How will the ratings of viewers for this movie be 5.4 ?! Only Alisan Porter, the youngest, should start at 6 automatically when you decide to vote. James Belushi is also a good person in this matter. His first serious role was good. I didn't like him anything but the story last night. He is quite good in the gang that is related to Tupac. With Kelly Lynch, you have to love her. I do. I just wonder what happened to Miss Porter. <br /> <br /> I gave 7 people together
