Hey, now I can't claim to watch all the movies of Jesse (Jesus) Franco and it seems to have a lot of them. But this is one of the better things (And the destroyer) saw. I would say that it is possible that he was in his best time during the sixties / seventies, and recently there was something strange for me. However, this is like a great nightmare that seems to be part of it. In many ways, this woman is an actor or something, performing in some theaters in Berlin with "fake" torture for viewers Appreciate (?!) And it seems that she has problems with dreams The thing that can't be caught in this movie is the tangible thing in this focus. But what is not a dream She seems to be in the state of deja vu. I will not say this, it makes all sense. But it is quite fierce and strange and fun The image of Berlin makes it seem like a place that is lonely and creepy, therefore increasing the atmosphere. The ending was very sudden, although this movie ended and the tape was black. I think there is no need to tell you that it is over. My copy comes from the Anchor Bay collection of the Euro-Trash. And I said to give more Euro-Trash. I can't get that shit. But it is a good shit
