Steven Spielberg (24 years old) directed two great episodes of the 1971 series called "The Psychiatrist", starring Roy Thinnes, one episode about a 12-year-old boy with emotional problems and another story about a man. A lively young man (Clu Gulager in his best performance) who is dying of cancer Both episodes look amazing, unlike anything else on TV and the complex emotions and adults. The creators of "The Psychiatrist" are Richard Levinson and William Link, creators of "Columbo" and still produce the first season. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk insisted on the first position, an experienced TV director for the first season of "Columbo", such as Bernard Kowalski and Jack Smight, but Falk agreed with Spielberg after watching the part of "The Psychiatrist" Clu Gulagher's scene. <br /> <br /> Spielberg speaks in DVD. Of "Duel" that he loves Steven Bochco's "Murder by Books" in Levinson's story / Link) and he tries to make the production look like a million dollar feature, even thinking that he has much less money to work with <br /> <br /> Now, "Columbo" is far away, has a modern look and takes advantage of the soundtrack and background music better than other scenes in "Columbo". Always use the leading director. Spielberg tries to protect Falk and Cassidy from being too great to destroy. But both actors are still very fun. Spielberg is well supported by Martin Milner, Rosemary Forsyth and Barbara Colby. All the performances are fresh and lively about them. The only "Columbo" episode that is close to directing is Episode "By Dawn's Early Light" with Patrick McGoohan (Directed by Harvey Hart) <br /> <br /> I think the two episodes of "The Psychiatrist" "and now" Columbo "suggest Spielberg not. Has developed the technique as much as the director He was excellent from the beginning in "The Fight!", A DVD description of the guest in 1962, starring Albert Salmi. Robert Altman said that it was quite as good as he had been. Received as director May be the same as Spielberg
