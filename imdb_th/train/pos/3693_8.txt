It's not easy to create a movie that has 18 different stories, although 18 foreign directors will challenge, but not everyone is good. But some people are boring But in his entity, "Paris, je t'aime" is amazing, showing that while "Love Actually" has already been placed, 'love is all around' especially in the city of love. This is a resume. (I'll try to make it as the most free spoiler) of 18 different stories. <br /> <br /> MONTMARTRE - It's a boring opening sequence. There's nothing really special about it. A man found a parking lot and saw many strange couples passing by wondering why he couldn't find a woman. And suddenly a woman fainted beside his car ... <br /> <br /> QUAIS DE SEINE - another boring sequence about three teenagers looking for 'Piece of donkey' when Muslims suddenly The young woman in front of them was helped by a really ordinary boy, but with a sweet heart. <br /> <br /> LES MARAIS - This is a big disappointment! Although the love story between two boys with an artistic background may be interesting by the great Van Sant, eventually everything that happens after speaking alone by Ulliel is all good before it's annoying. /> <br /> Cost - entertainment order by the Coen Buscemi brothers - without even saying a single word - it's attractive and the whole sequence is just hilarious. This makes me stick to the end, and this makes you stick to the movie truly. <br /> <br /> LOIN DU 16IEME - A beautiful story as well, even if the execution is bad, the heart is there. The story of a Spanish woman who left her child from the morning to take care of another beautiful child outside the city. <br /> <br /> PORTE DE CHOISY - This segment must be strange and strange from the whole movie. Some shoppers come to foreign countries in Paris. If I understood correctly, that story was about the inner beauty. But I think I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> BASTILLE - truly wonderful sequence A man met his wife at a restaurant to break up with her so he could escape with his woman. But the wife has very bad news Quite plain But sad and truly beautiful! Drop DES VICTOIRES - a tragic sequence as well. Juliette Binoche plays the sad mother. One night she woke up to hear her dead child. When she arrived at the location, the cowboy told her that she could give the last donkey to her child. One of the best groups! TOIF EIFFEL - Two mimes that fall in love may be wonderful. But even though it has good movie making techniques But the story is not interesting and not funny at all. <br /> <br /> PARC MONCEAU - truly the original and excellent sequence, which is one of the best movies! The girl and the old man talked about their future and her fears for some men ... Cuaron did a great job directing and the actors were amazing! QUARTIER DES ENFANTS ROUGES - American actress (Gyllenhaal) falls in love with her drug dealer. The beautiful part again with a very tragic ending. PLACE DES FETES - A woman comes to a homeless man. He begins to talk about romance with her ... because she is the love of his life. Beautiful, sad, shocking, roar. Romance, ... Place des Fêtes will make everyone cry. <br /> <br /> PIGALLE - a boring sequence between Ardant and Hoskins looking for new excitement in their relationship ... Pigalle A person that is not offensive and inhumane. <br /> <br / > QUARTIER DE LA MADELEINE - Bringing diversity to the QdlM movie is something that can help alleviate the young man (wood). Meet the vampire, kill the victim ... tourists and vampires ... fall in love! Dark, scary and strange romance, Madeleine is excellent. <br /> <br /> PERE-LACHAISE - another part released by Wes Craven and with stars as Mortimer and Sewell. Great, but Père-Lachaise It's normal, not the original. <br /> <br /> FAUBOURG SAINT-DENIS - The rumor is the true story of Twyker. The short film is beautiful, amazing and very well done. The blind man picked up the phone and heard a voice from his girlfriend (Portman - really amazing) that she broke up with him. He reflects their relationship. <br /> <br /> QUARTIER Latin - although this part has been directed by Depardieu and has stars such as Rowlands, Gazzara and Depardieu. Nothing happens. There is no lack of chemistry between actors. <br /> <br /> Arsenal 14th - The final sequence is hilarious and sad at the same time. Americans tell in her French class about traveling to Paris. Her French language is really bad, but at the end of the group she realizes that Paris is too big to look at her eyes. <br /> <br /> With Feist on the background "Paris, je t'aime" ends. With a beautiful voice that didn't disappoint me, although some segments would make me bored of hell, but this movie was great! A true movie experience for kids and adults. Paris, je t'aime vraiment!
