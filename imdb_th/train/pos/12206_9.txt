Among the noirs movies of the 1940s and 1950s, this was ranked as one of the most unusual and fun to watch. I said that because the four main actors: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders <br /> <br /> The first two names are familiar to everyone. But it was the last two that made this movie fun to me, especially his character Anders. "George Grisby" is one of the most bizarre people I've ever seen in a movie. His voice and some of the things he said must have people believe Slaone is not far behind in the "strange" category. Hayworth doesn't have the charm of a blonde short hair, but is also Hayworth, which has a lot of meaning for Google. You are men Wales is as fascinating as ever. One tip: If you have a DVD, open English subtitles. His character in this film is Irish and you need a description to understand everything he says. <br /> <br /> Wales also directs movies, which means you have a great camera angle and a close-up. Great face You have a unique ending by shooting in the glass house. Great things! As this strange movie, I still think that the carnival atmosphere is like a clown in the trial near the end and is taken away from the violence of the scene. In addition, no complaints. <br /> <br /> This is a great entertainment, which is the name of the game.
