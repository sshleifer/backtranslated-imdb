I can't say that this movie is disappointing because I read the reviews before watching and it didn't do what I thought it would have. The bar does not set a high value, so the fact that my expectations are not met much. <br /> <br /> Well: New York City If you live in a city like me, you will remember some places and understand that the city should be more than just a place. But is one of the main characters There are truly gentle moments, funny conversations and planning, left and right twists, which make everything interesting. <br /> <br /> Not good: The first thing I think after leaving the theater is I want. More, but not in the positive "Let them want more fashion." Of course, the good / bad scenes are more than bad. But there are a number of games that fall into the category "in between" which is in fact too many. In addition, the diversity of New York City, although hinted at, though many remote pans of the city and mentioned in the dialogue in this film, were never really recognized or analyzed until the point of doing justice in the city For example, many games are related to making middle-aged white skin. I mean, I know that this city is home to many demographic information. But it turns out that the plot of the character's diversity and character of Paris Genem makes New York City look like Lancaster, Pennsylvania. It is a disappointment to see this city changing this cultural heritage. <br /> <br /> But after talking about this Who knows, maybe you do not agree with my opinion. You will never know until you see yourself. This review is not intended to prevent anyone from watching this movie because everyone's opinions about art are different. I just give you vague things to expect.
