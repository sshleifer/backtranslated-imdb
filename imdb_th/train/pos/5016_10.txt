This movie is one of my favorites. It's hard to explain why. Perhaps it was Corin Nemec's innocence and his clumsiness paired up with Cheryl Pollak's courage. In addition, some characters also have lines or movements or little moments that are fun and own. Eventually, the story always draws my attention and the final scene is bitterly swallowed. Overall, I love this movie. It is perfect for a gooey night. Good mood girl.
