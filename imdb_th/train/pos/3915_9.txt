I have watched this movie at least 4 times since '84, and it's still great every time I see it. It is a very attractive version of the opera Carmen with amazing flamenco dancing, bare bones and of course great music. <br /> <br /> Carmen's storytelling. This story is a story in other stories until the end is doubly sad. Obviously, as the Spanish production budget is low, the film has the dance of the leading Flamenco dancers in Spain. The combination of opera music and the dancer's voice on the wooden stage makes the storytelling more effective. <br /> <br /> It's an independent film that makes it the best and may be my favorite forever.
