I rented this movie and watched it 20 times before I brought it back to the store. Bill Paxton hired someone with first-class talent to create a good thriller with an interesting twist. The story is original and well written. Powers Booth and Paxton both perform well. The story has been told in an interesting manner, with events dating back 20 years. Then see the current point, switch back and forth. This storytelling makes the thriller that is not boring. Bill Paxton, please create more horror movies you are capable of!
