As a man born to be a German mother and an English father (Who spent five years in a prisoner of war camp) I came from a unique position One person must deal with many Nazis on the other side of the family and win from WW2 on the other side. This drama cannot penetrate into every part of Hitler's ideas and must allow the audience to get to know the general situation at that time and to be as good as possible. In this set, it can do quite well. Carlyle is very good, like O'Toole. I would like more information about the relationship with others at the party because Hitler didn't do anything on his own. He has people around him who follow him to the letter often without questions and, of course, without doubt later in his murder career. What happened to Hesse's gables and blood? Seeing these relationships is more useful. But I hope it will make people research more It may make people understand why people like Saddam Hussein are not allowed to continue to have power.
