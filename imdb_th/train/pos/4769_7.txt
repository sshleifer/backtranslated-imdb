I'm sure this is a list that no one is familiar with and may not think well. After that, almost near Baywatch Hawaii with actors, locations, forms of governance and public relations? Shows that women walking around on the beach and everything It is not surprising that people misunderstand and decide not to see. <br /> <br /> It's wrong that they do that. After I decided to watch the program, there was much more to happen. Really juicy and controversial stories became really exciting to see and be beautiful. ?? Addictive <br /> <br /> Stories of hotel staff, managers, owners and their complex love lives. Also entering the hotel visitors who are difficult and powerful people trying to steal the hotel. Actually, it's more exciting than this. <br /> <br /> I will not deny that the show is sucking. But it's not bad that you look out The story is not consistent, but good enough. The soundtrack is suitable for situations and actions at all times. I took me a couple of times before I had something really patiently, so patience. <br /> <br /> Hint: I really enjoyed watching this thing. Zillion Times is better than expected. <Br / > <br /> Score: 7.5 / 10 (Grade: B) <br /> <br /> Please rate my review after reading it. Thank you.
