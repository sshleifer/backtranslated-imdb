First of all, I do not understand why some people find this film against Americans. Of course, there are times when the United States is directly accused, for example, in Youssef Chahine, Ken Loach and Mira Nair. To some degree, they do not accuse them innocently; They are based on true facts and have all the documents and documents that the CIA publishes about Chile. Confirm this too. <br /> <br /> But back to the movie itself, what I like most is The various emotions that we find there, we find that children are educated to respect every person who died in the event. We found a couple that was not happy to change with the tragedy that day. We find that people who have their feelings lower on the shadow of the events of September 11 and respond to this thing differently with dignity or frustration. We also found someone in the film about the collapse of the tower as a time of true happiness. <br /> <br /> These and all other visions - are as powerful as these or more - Make integration and help regularly Viewers will see how people are different throughout the world on the events of September 11th. Therefore, what we see is a panorama that is more complex than white and black, and this may make some people angry. But this is the world that we live in and there is no place for creative ideals, regardless of whether the president or the priest will say anything to us. <br /> <br /> Finally, I think it's a shame that none Even though it was the release date for this film in the United States It's a shame because most Americans ask why this disaster happened and this movie might give a clue to them. This film is very clear - unlike some people think in this forum - everything we do today will determine our future and past mistakes will affect how we use it. Our current life
