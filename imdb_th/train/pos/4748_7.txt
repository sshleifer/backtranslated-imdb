The story will never win a prize. But that's not related ... The script is just fun and suspicion enough to make space for an incredibly choreographed fighting scene. Who needs a story about that kind of fight? Actually it's worth watching for just one reason. If you are able to deal with a lot of blood ... no, it can be done enough to look hard.
