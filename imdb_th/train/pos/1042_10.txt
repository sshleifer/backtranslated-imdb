An American woman, a European husband and her children, returned to her mother's house in the movie "Watch on the Rhine" in 1943 from the performance of Lillian Hellman and starring Paul Lucas. (Which I believe Davis, Lucile Watson, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald and Donald Woods, who are anti-fascist workers in the underground movement, have been injured many times and want by Nazi Kurt Muller (Lucas) Long-term rest in the land of his wealthy adoptive mother But he found that there was no real escape because one of the housecuests (Coulouris) was suspicious of his true identity and was more than willing to sell him. <br /> <br /> Great performance. Many in this film write Very much to present the liberal views of Lillian Hellman. Of course, it was a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time it was released due to the wickedness of the war and what happened to people in other countries. America's safe The big controversy of the film today is that Paul Lukas has won Oscar more than Humphrey Bogart in "Casablanca". Humphrey Bogart is an excellent screen actor and a fantastic rick. But Lucas is great as Kurt. The only chapter he has about the desire to kill is courage, just talking about one scene. <br /> <br /> Although this is not something that anyone thinks is a Bette Davis movie, but she shows expertise. Here with Sara, Sara's faithful and loving wife, her performance draws at the heart and the love scene between Kurt and Sara is beautiful and gentle. <br /> <br /> The last half hour of this movie makes The purpose of the sincere tears of emotion. Lillian Hellman is not everyone's cup of tea. But different from "Little Fox", she wrote great characters and great characters, and was the story received by Warner Brothers. Highly recommended
