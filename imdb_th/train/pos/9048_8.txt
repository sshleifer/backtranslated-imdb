I refuse to watch this movie and I understand why it is not a hit in the movie theater. "October Sky" gives a feeling and looks familiar and it is. All artifacts and emotions have been explored before in the movie. Others - and maybe better But although familiar and resistant to all Hollywood formulas But this film wins and is a favorite every turn. <br /> <br /> Sputnik is an inspiration for the journey of the heart, mind and spirit. Like the characters from Steven Sondheim's musical drama MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG, standing on the roof of their apartment, hoping that it will launch their new generation. ("What do you call this?" Rocket boy of this true story While the townspeople in the coal fields in the 1950s were not interested in this event, Homer Hickham saw Sputnik as his ticket out of mine life. <br /> <br /> A wise direction. And the casting made the journey of fresh and new rocket boys, especially those that affect the subplots that are related to Homer's school teacher. Breathtaking restraint is shown in their delicate relationship drawings. Another amazing thing is that the father / son has more power than the film holder. Play perfectly anywhere. Even Homer's mother was able to get a time when there was no boredom or invasion. Her absence and her husband have both elegance and heat. "Myrtle Beach" says everything. <br /> <br /> The main video chain that I despise has a symbol next to this movie, stating that you will love this movie or they will refund you. One time I agreed with them. You won't look at the sky in October as before. <br /> <br />
