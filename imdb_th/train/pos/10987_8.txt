Searching through the Sci Fi Weekly section of the video rental shop in the area, I'm losing hope in finding good movies that I haven't seen. Renting Cypher is like a punt horse on a very weak horse. My son is bored with science fiction "B". Nowadays he hasn't seen this. <br /> <br /> It must be noted that I didn't see anything about Cypher when it was released in Australia. It's probably very quiet or I just missed it. <br /> <br /> This is a surprise that is really delightful! This is not a B movie. It's not a "blockbuster" of great variety and doesn't try to be - a silent movie that must be seen many times to get a plot to fully taste. > <br /> Special effects are powerful Presented when in use - My only complaint is that super helo is a leetle. It is obvious that CGI in the first view, but they are correct in the second way and that everything else is the top mark No matter in any case, the impact will be secondary. <br /> <br /> I will not give anything about the plot. The plot structure has a slight aspect of the Russian doll, reminiscent of basic instincts. (Although there is a lot of different content) <br /> <br /> Just I'll say that choosing Jeremy Northham for that leader is the main rhythm. The actor was born in Cambridge, England, and his accent for this film was popular as a New England dialect, which was a tremendous driving force. See the final twist of the plot and you'll see why it's a great choice! And Lucy Liu is just with you. "She will kiss me - you will shoot me." Edge <br /> <br /> I rarely watch movies many times in a few days - this is one of them.
