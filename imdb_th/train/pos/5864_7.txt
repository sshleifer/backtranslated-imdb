I don't like the apocalypse and overrated myths. Right now, it's my favorite Vietnam war movie, The Deer Hunter. The deer hunter focused on part of the war and focused on life before the war The film's main content is Deer Hunter 2. The script is too loose compared to Deer Hunter. The story has never been developed to the point where the audience can understand and feel the characters like Deerhunter. Participate just like in Deerhunter. This is the reason I can give this movie just 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> But I think the performance is excellent. DeNiro and Harris As a performer who truly remarkable. They fully immerse themselves in their characters and show their anguish in the past two friends who lost their best friend Bobby in the fight. Harris's character is a half-alcoholic person who hides the guilt he has in Bobby, loses his life, trying to save his life. <br /> <br /> I like actors who support. Everyone in the city is part of the movie. Obviously, this city is not able to take good care of the Vietnamese vet. Like many small towns, it is a matter of tranquility, humility and consideration of that person's business. However, Harris's character cannot do these things. It is interesting how the war affects people. Some people recover quickly while others don't recover.
