While I didn't think of myself as a big fan of the fairy tale movie, Stardust surprised me when I saw Michelle Pfeiffer in the trailer as a villain. Boy, she is a wicked person who is convinced here as a witch, especially the makeup that looks ugly at the beginning and end! Robert De Niro is great as a pirate captain who is forced to hide "In the closet" to protect his "reputation"! All actors such as Claire Danes, Rupert Everett, Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole and others work well here, while Danes and Pfeiffer are classically beautiful. But there was a beautiful face of Sienna Miller, Olivia Grant (as Girl Bernard) and Kate Magowan, especially when we first met her. Newcomer Charlie Cox was fine as a lead actor and he looks like Dunstan's father. As a young man, I think he was the first scene with Magowan (actually Ben Barnes). Many comments have compared this to the princess bride and while I can see some similarities, the main difference is When using a PB, you always knew it was only a fantasy tale, the old man told his grandson. Stardust makes you believe that most of the things you see and hear may actually occur, despite the buzz that occurs throughout. So in that note I would recommend Stardust.
