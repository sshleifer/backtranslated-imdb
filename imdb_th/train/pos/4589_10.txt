I will assume that Police Story is one of Jackie's best movies. The story, fight scenes, and stun scenes are excellent. In this movie, Jackie himself acts as a police officer named Chanakui. (Kevin Chan in some models) who succeeded in arresting the crime master After the crime lord was released due to lack of evidence, he surrounded the chan for killing police officers. For this reason, he became a police officer. Later, Brigitte Lin, the secretary of the crime officer, went to the department store and began to steal evidence of the crime of the crime lord from his computer However, the perpetrator knew that Salina had downloaded his alleged information and hired his followers to catch her. Later, Chan appeared in the scene and began to fight with all the people, beat them one by one. In the final scene, Chan sees a crime boss fight. Finally, this is the best and funny action movie. Everyone should watch it. Highly recommended
