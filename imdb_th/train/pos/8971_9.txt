In general, I'm not a big fan of stop-motion movies, and at first RUKA didn't get the attention. However, knowing that the film was created in the era of the repression of Czechoslovakia in the Soviet era, which made me more watching movies This narrative makes the film really come alive and gives real power while both art and political statements. <br /> <br /> Tragic little movie made without talking. Happening The cute little wooden man is making a clay pot and having a lovely time when suddenly moving hands appear and break the pot - causing it to become a statue of the hand instead. The man tried again to catch his hand and do his own thing. However, as time passed, the hand became more persistent and eventually imprisoned people. And at the end the man died with a messy hand and a hand which is a symbol of true hypocrisy, making this man a funeral for the heroes! <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie is a clear attempt by the brave Jir√≠ Trnka to criticize his dominant government. It is not surprising, even though the Czechs like this movie and give the state's critical praise (such as hands) forbidding this parable. Sadly, Trnka didn't live to see his country more liberated. Two decades later, during the period called "Velvet Revolution"
