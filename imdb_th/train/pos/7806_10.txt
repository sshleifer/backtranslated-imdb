"Cry Freedom" is not just a movie It is a historical story, a brave story and a deep understanding of the cultural background of important events in history. Not only does Denzel Washington do an excellent job of disguising as a hero who is inspired by Steve Biko But he sent a public message about the horrors of South Africa. The story of Biko, an influential leader and Donald Wood, is the main influence and heartbreaking person. But the greatest success of his life can do more than the cruelty that occurs in South Africa. "Freedom Cry" can communicate with the audience in a positive light of annoying plans. It is because of such great movies that the public can be educated about the terrible events in history, the great leaders who try to end them and the way we won't allow them to happen in the future. With this importance, "Cry Freedom" is an amazing movie that everyone should watch.
