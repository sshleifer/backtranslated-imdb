I saw this movie for the first time 3 years ago and was then introduced by the head of Disney, Eisner and Jim Morris. <br /> <br /> About a month ago it came back on TV and once This i taped Since then, I have to watch it at least three times. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie that inspires and feels good, cleverly written and performed by everyone involved. It resists the emotional deception of everything in the book, including other clich√©s. <br /> <br /> It's refreshing to watch movies that kids don't jerk and have all behavioral problems. And the sport doesn't show that it is a big head muscle that uses testosterone. <br /> <br /> These are just ordinary people who have dreams like you and me. <br /> <br /> In my opinion "The ultimate realism" makes movies that everyone curse and have problems with aggression. <br /> <br /> This film is about men who have dreams and are supported by friends and family. Following that dream, people in Big Lake TX looked so good that I wanted to move there. <br /> <br /> As I said b4, this film didn't try to end with confidence. Dennis Quaid As usual, never disappointed I've watched him since the late 70s and he doesn't look good. <br /> <br /> But this movie has a great performance from everyone involved and the glory of the writer. <br /> <br / > The gem in this movie is almost over when Jim practiced before the big game and his wife called him from the stands. He hurried to find his family. The appearance of the other three pitchers who were sitting on the bench in the booming boat was priceless. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a rhythm that changes.
