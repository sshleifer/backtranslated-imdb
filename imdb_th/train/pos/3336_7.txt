I have to admit that I joined Fever Pitch with low expectations. There was no great revelation for me to say that the last film of Jimmy Fallon (Taxi) was terrible in Catwoman's story and the trailer for Fever Pitch was all right. But didn't make me fascinated I have prepared baseball to play my reviews. <br /> <br /> "I like Jimmy Fallon. But the taxi hit one of his actors. Now we have steeeeee-riiiiiike twoooooooo! One more protest and it goes back to SNL! "Or" Buy yourself with a peanut jack and cracker. But don't buy tickets to watch Fever Pitch. You will walk out of the cinema and don't have to go back! "Then this movie must have more entertainment than I expected. But wait, I can't let my play be wasted, right? Another reason I think I don't care about this film is that I hate the Boston Red Sox. All my family hates. The mention of Pedro Martinez's name sent me to run into the bathroom. Oh man, wait ... <br /> <br /> ... Okay, I'm back. However, my mother, a St. Louis fan, still believes that the World Series will be crushed last year. She refused to believe that the team would win it legally. But I am a man enough to admit that Fever Pitch has made me sympathetic, even though there is little to the fate of Red Sox fans. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has a passion for sports can relate to this story Movie to a certain extent If you don't have a favorite sports team, you won't be able to understand the top and lowest points that fans like Fallon Ben can do. Nothing is so fresh because of the smell of the new season and nothing is quite as smooth as a clean slate. Uh say formally It is a pleasure to be a sports fan. "Hey, next year" turns into a mantra. Your motto, your prayers - and Pitch fever have gathered that essence effectively. <br /> <br /> I love the fact that this film uses fictional stories. The real-life backdrop of the Red Sox's improbable World Series last year I don't love it so much that I want to get married. But you know what I mean I expect that this will be handled in a rather wonderful manner, and while some humor is stupid, but it's a realistic reality. <br /> <br /> You see Ben Pha Uncle's He went to his first Red Sox game. He was 7 years old and when he died he left Ben two tickets. Ben never missed a game in 23 years. At the beginning of each season, he had a draft day in which he and his friends gathered to find out who would play the game with him. He made everyone dance the game of Yankees and when people complained that they threatened them with tickets for games with Royals (Sorry, Mr. Shade) and Devil Rays. It was a very good scene and worked well because I knew someone who Doing "day ticket, I have to admit that I can relate when Ben goes to dinner with Lindsey and her parents. The Red Sox are playing the road game. But instead of watching live on TV, Ben decided to tape One of the most dangerous things in life is to tape the game and to the public and try to avoid hearing the results. Have been there It was a very tense and frightening situation. Weeeeeell Ben entered the danger zone when a man appeared at a restaurant and mentioned watching the game. Ben immediately closed his ear and began to scream like a shaman in order not to hear the results. Lindsay Shy and her parents don't know what to think. Yes, sports fans may be strange. I don't deny it. But it's true. <br /> <br /> Now, if you expect a rude and frustrating story that the Farrell brothers know well, you may be disappointed. They have their time, even when Ben says that he likes the way Lindsey speaks from her mouth sometimes. "Like a cute stroke victim" But overall, this is a gentle and romantic side. <br /> <br /> Don't say that this movie has too much meaning. Fortunately, when the sap began to flow slightly, Farrellys knew when to pull away. The romantic moment with Lindsey leaps onto the field and runs to Ben to announce the immortal love he has for him. Ben responds sincerely that "You have to tell me about the field. Jimmy Fallon proves that with the right material, he can manage himself well on the big screen and Drew Barrymore is still a source of glamorous, romantic comedy. Fever Pitch is just great entertainment. And hard, which will look relatively new in romantic comedy types It is a movie that both men and women are all related to. Especially men who practice frantic sports in one year and women who have to deal with 'em <br /> <br /> now if the Red Sox fans can please close "Bambino's Curse" I will thank MEM My Fischer didn't win the NCAA basketball championship, so I officially announced your fate more than you. <br /> <br /> Jimmy F fans Alonon, Drew, mania generally should consider to feed North Pitch View I will not go out of my way to hustle and watch it at the time of the first service. But it will make a great matin√©e. <br /> <br /> Score: 3.25 (from 5)
