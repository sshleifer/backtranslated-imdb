I have watched the Cold Case a few times over the past several years, beginning with Season 1 episode back in 2003-2004 and while most are good now, not only the best of the best. But there are few competitors in the category of Emmy, although some may disagree with the content of the story. (Such as a romantic relationship between a man and a man) but I wonder if anyone can see this thing without having to move deep into their souls. <br /> <br /> In the case of reopening With testimony from a dying drug dealer Two middle actors were two police officers in 1960, named Sean Kop (aka the victim of a cold case with a random surname) and Jimmy Bruno, his partner. <br /> <br /> In this regard, Coop is one of the veterans of Vietnam who have problems in the past. However, Jimmy is married and has little children. Both are allied with police forces and not just But build friendships But is a romantic relationship that both have to hide from the culture that is deep and noticeable at that time. <br /> <br /> The scenes of life Most of them are black and white. The color is then sprinkled throughout. Examples include their red car, yellow curtain, lightly blowing at the window in the bedroom of Jimmy, Jimmy's wife. See Coop and Jimmy drink. While in an alcoholic state I find it interesting that there are only some items that have been painted in the background, with everything in black and white. I have not understood the style, color and reason. <br /> <br /> The apparent tensions between the patrol officers, friends, and two central actors increase the intensity of the event. One of the most important scenes was when Coop confronted his father after Jimmy's baptism. In this scene, the father of Coop, Sarge, the respected officer of the enforcer, confronted Coop about rumors around Coop's relationship with Jimmy. Who would feel sorry for Coop at this point when shame? And the shame of the father of the random, imprisoned on random - "You will not discredit our family ... and you are not my son too" - clearly showing the corner <br /> <br /> The increased tension can be seen in the police locker room at Coop and the other staff go to it after Coop and Jimmy are identified. "Batman and Robin Homosexuality" <br /> <br /> For the relationship between Coop and Jimmy, it's clear that Coop wants Jimmy more in his life. When able to see the tension in Jimmy's face while he had to choose between his commitment to his wife and children, his church and also dedicated to Coop, of course forever. <br /> <br /> Finally, Jimmy walks out of Coop, realizing that he can't have both Coop and his family at the same time. Unfortunately, Coop was killed, probably because of his relationship with Jimmy, but Coop might have been killed because of the increasing knowledge of money, drugs and police corruption. <br /> <br /> Scene The most moving In the whole episode, when Coop, as he sat dead from gunshot wounds in his car, spoke his last words quietly through his police radio to his partner: "Jimmy ... We are lucky people. Don't forget. That thing "<br /> <br /> The song selection is outstanding throughout the episode. I enjoyed the final scene with actor Chad Everett, playing the role of Jimmy, who is still very young, and now still lacks Coop. His former partner, <br /> <br /> I recommend the episode. This and the best consideration, no doubt that it is the best written episode, well done and well done in all cases of the Cold Case that I have seen
