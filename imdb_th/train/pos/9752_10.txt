I remember seeing this when I was 3 years old. Then my parents accidentally put it on. But a few seconds with other cartoons Then I was about 8 or 9 years old when I discovered it again and when I could understand things better I thought it was a good movie. Fast forward a few weeks before (June 2006) when I discovered it again, thanks to the internet / video clip article and it's not the same movie. I'm sure it's still good for the kids, but for us 20-30 days, it has all the "religious status" written. It is a shame that traditional production goes through a painful process. If the fox gave enough time, it would be known in the eyes of the public more than now. Maybe if they were to create a new one with a completely different story and a celebrity voice, it might be possible. But that was for Fox to decide. I went here. I know. I still think it's a great movie. But it may be better than good
