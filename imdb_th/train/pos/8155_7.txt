I'm too old to know (or interest) what is the difference between rap and hip hop. And being a Canadian is likely that I have never really seen MTV but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> But I think this movie is very funny when I see it. Hip-hop culture is very prevalent today, which is difficult to not listen to this story over and over again (if only we can say the same about pi clarinet music). (At least I think I do) Of course, it comes from the Spinal Tap, but there are many goals that can be used with Tap therapy, not just carpenters. They are sacred.
