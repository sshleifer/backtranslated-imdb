Just passed this "Samhain" look and although I still like it, there is nothing like the "rough" version that I have. If you check the message board, you will see an apology from the director for this cut version 79 minutes and He said that he was not involved in the R rating, which was truncated with a new score. Christians do not need to separate themselves a lot because the basic blood elements are still outstanding, even though they are highly cut. This is a shame because this has the potential to be one of the best and most boring movies in many years. It still has porn stars and descent, and some parts of the blood can be seen at least partially. I'm just glad that I have "rough" because for me it is a gem for any library gorehounds. Christian Viel has the exact skills and vision of shipping and hope that his next project will have a better production. The idiot is classic, close to the hand and makes everyone drunk "Samhain" may be one of the most controversial and never-ending horror movies and wounds that are too bad to see what the director wants. <br /> <br /> *********** ******************************* * Just to let you know what you missed, this is my opinion based on SAMHAIN's "print job". <br /> <br /> The film takes more than 90 minutes and doesn't stop. There is no music soundtrack for sure, and some scenes do not have sound in the dialog box because I think it will be repeated later. However, most movies have sound effects that sound and when the effect or scene disappears, the message appears as a queue for insertion when the movie is complete. It's exactly the same as saying "Rough Cut" but it's "Samhain", the only version you've never seen before. The reason is because it is more graphic than NC-17 will allow. Yes, there are a few porn stars. But they were there to kill and add a little sugar and spices The story is pretty standard, American tourists on holiday in Ireland and ultimately live in the middle of the forest. The area that is heavy about folklore involves the ancient druids and Samhain celebrations, or as we call Halloween (scary). <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a lot of blood. Because the camping couple was attacked by one of the local mutant species This is a great gore scene as the man finds his girl hanging from the cliff with her help. What he saw was the head, arms and shoulders hanging in front of him, and when he pulled her up, she was completely cut into two parts. This is what I will call EXTREME GORE with internal organs, blood and limbs that are cut off all over the place. We are in the Herschell Gordon Lewis land here, except for people who look more realistic. I will skip this story because it is common and kills the plot. <br /> <br /> Next scene is the story that must be watched by the young fans from the first killings being taken to the cave like the location. (TCM-2 things) and tied to the table This geek cut off all his limbs. (Turn off the camera with the queue to insert the scene.) Then we saw his body on the barbecue hole slowly turned over the fire and the body was difficult (if you could believe it). Yes, the taste is terrible. Must and it may be fit as well. <br /> <br /> After that, Jenna Jameson, her beautiful body and all were cut from the neck to the target and All of her internal organs were pulled out in a cheerful form and her blood flowed down to the pot. Really delicious, right? <br /> <br /> But the best gore scene happened in the house and I had to admit That this is one of the best gore scenes I have ever seen, this man (not important to anyone) is caught from the side after the geek and cut open the asshole Then the man stretched out his hand and pulled out all the organs, internal organs, and things that the hell had to live from his asshole. This thing continued forever because the man screamed and the body organs were pulled out across the bathroom floor. This is the most extreme. I find myself laughing all over hell. Obviously, you will never see this scene in the DVD, the right IMO, along with the most violent scenes, other scenes. <br /> <br /> So what is all this thought? First of all, although I suspect that this movie will be released in an uncut presentation. In any way, it makes this "Rough Cut" a rare gem for gorehounds. Yes, it is difficult at first when there are a few scenes of music that will be inserted and the name credits disappear everywhere. But that's what makes this unique and I won't exchange anything at this time. Very thrilling. Yes, yes. Extreme. This makes "Haute Tension" look like a Disney movie.
