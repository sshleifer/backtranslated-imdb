War Inc. is a funny but strange movie. A favorite actor, this movie is also a favorite. But I don't know how to describe the plot I will go down the spot later This is a movie with a selection of strange actors, besides John Cusack as a killer, which we saw many years ago in my favorite Grosse Point. <br /> <br /> Here we have Hilary Duff. Playing as a Russian pop singer, Yonikabaya, or something like that Her character is strange. There was one scene where she stuck the scorpion pants and the hit song on Hauser (Cusack). There was a twist at the end that involved both characters. It's reasonable. <br /> <br /> That is the only option in casting. Makes it look strange But sometimes it's incredibly funny and I never get bored. Here we have some of the best performers, not including Miss Duff. She's not good, but here we have John Cusack, Marisa Tomeii, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley. See what I mean. <br /> <br /> This is The story of a hit-man named Hauser (Cusack). He was sent to some Middle Eastern cities in order to kill an oil man named Omar Sheriff. (Not an actor) while trying to deal with his own personal problems, he must help the pop star's wedding (Played by Hilary Duff) and he fell in love with a news reporter (Played by Marisa Tomei) There is something about Popstar that Hauser disgusted. She had one scene that she sang for him and after that he threw up <br /> <br /> The distortion of the episode The end of this movie reveals why The thing about twisting is that I have seen it. But that doesn't matter This is a funny, funny and fun story. I love most actors. So how do I suggest? <br /> <br /> War, Inc: 3.5 / 5
