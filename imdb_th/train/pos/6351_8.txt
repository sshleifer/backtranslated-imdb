When Grinch came out, I was excited even though I thought it would be a lucky movie that was happy and it was like that Although it has a little nightmare before Christmas will touch it. You know it's dark and scary. I love this movie because it helps fill people with the Christmas spirit. So most Grinch helped Christmas. And what happened well in Whoville, they said that the small heart of the Grinch grew three sizes that day. Merry Christmas!
