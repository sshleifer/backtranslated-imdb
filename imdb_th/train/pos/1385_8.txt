I saw it at Cinema MK2 Hautefeuille only one night after the first show in Paris. A very cute movie about three 15-year-old teens. They are all in the same psychological period. Many scenes allow us to return to young age and our first feelings about sex. It is possible to imagine that the director wanted to reduce the first glamor of the girls into lesbians. But in this case, she didn't destroy the probability of the story. Sometimes you can find this movie a little slow. But it is something that creates this intimate atmosphere I gave the scholarship to a talented young actor, mentioned with Floriane and Marie very reliably. There are many small details, but this movie made me discover swimming synchronized: impressive!
