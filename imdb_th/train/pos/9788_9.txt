I am at a script writer meeting and watching a movie. I think the author - Smith - summarizes clearly what this movie is about. However, this film does not require explanation. I think various themes are clear and inspiring. Movies related to the ability to face fear, especially the fear inherited from people, parents - and overcome it, and when accepting the possibilities in our lives I enjoy it more I still think that Mandy62 is a ruthless person to Hugo Weaving. As a person about his wine, I should look very good! I agree that many Australian movies lack lately, but 'Peach' delivered the product. I'm glad I saw it.
