This is a good movie. I'm not sure if this is a spoiler review or not. But I don't want to have a chance However, near the end of the movie, the prosecutor read the scripture and claimed another one from his memory. I can't remember the first episode he read. But the second part is Genesis 9: 6. He says that it is Genesis 9:12. But actually, he refers to verse 6. It's too bad that the prosecutors didn't dare to say the Bible today. Does anyone ever hear John Jay, the first Supreme Court judge in the history of this country? He said that the Bible is the best in every book. Unfortunately we lost that view in America.
