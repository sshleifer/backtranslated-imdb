Essentially, this movie may be one of the most appealing titles from Scotts (Ridley and Tony) to make it straight. This film deserves to be advertised as one of the most exciting actors / actors. <br /> <br /> When it comes to the tragedy heroes that are not satisfied with Denzel Washington and Tony Scotts. Both this movie and Deja Vu are better than you expected. Washington felt very comfortable with the camera shaking and every scene in the movie. One can easily relate to the emotions of his character, so enjoy killing all on the road. It is a success that they created the darkest Mexican city with so many things happening. Who can be easily assured by the extent of corruption that appears in Man On Fire? I don't know what Mexicans will think of when they watch this thing ...... <br /> <br /> Okay. We meet again Is one of the best types of Death Wish, but still suffers from a wide range of violence It's a bit annoying that they show the actions of the vigilante by making the movie very realistic and let Denzel Washington play the type of hero. "The Lost Sheep" In the end, they also have kidnappers shot in his own pool like a documentary. I am checking IMDb if the movie is made from a real event for that ...... So, to consider you if you find that the movie theme is a little fake, <br /> <br /> At the end, I hope. That no one will actually bring this movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10 For art / editing / movies / denzel Washington guidelines
