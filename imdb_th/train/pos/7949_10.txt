SPOILERS ALERT Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey is an important movie in my life because it was the first movie I remember ever seen in a movie theater in my home town at the age of 4. This story is based on the novel Sheila Burnford and is the reason why it is impossible to write this story into a silly Lassie clone. <br /> <br /> Basic story: Two dogs and cats live. Happily waiting The Seaver Kitchen, when a new husband gave to the mother of the three children, got a job in the city and they had to temporarily move into San Francisco while the animals were sent to the ranch for a few months. The bond between animals and children that they are aware of is particularly strong, and the Shadow the Golden Retever and Sassy Himalayan cats are heartbroken like children. Although young and happy American Bulldogs are known as Chance, less concerned. Over and insulting (Partly because of his voice, explaining that he was abandoned as a puppy, picked up for animal shelter and was bought by the family), although his growth as a character in the story Important storytelling <br /> <br /> The three pets escaped from the farm and headed to a wide and dangerous wilderness. (Setting the wilderness astonishingly along the way) Driven by shadow instincts They encountered many threats on the way, hoping to return home while families and farm owners were worried about the disappearance of animals. There are funny moments along the way, the wonderful dialogue between the three animals and the hilarious lines (see - memorable words) and touchable companions that grow between the main characters during storytelling, separated by sad moments. (For example, when Sassy's pride, which tried to cross the river without wetting, caused her to fall into the river and was washed out of the time of the loss that the audience Feel deeply) <br /> <br /> Somehow, though. I failed to see what the sum of the girl records disappeared in the wilderness, adding their stories and travels. However, it seems that it is not necessary for the story. <br /> <br /> The ending cranks the higher stakes. When the shadow fell into the hole in the train yard and hurt his leg, it was difficult to leave and give. Exhausted, followed by the opportunity to climb up with him to persuade him to climb out, tell him how important he was to him, and he pushed them so far so he should not leave it easily <br /> <br /> How this scene (Doing wisely) has not yet concluded, causing ambiguity that occurred in the last scene when Chance and Sassy returned home, but the shadow was not seen. Then everything seemed to disappear. He would appear slowly and reunite with the family. The conclusion of the opportunity at the end speaks of the friendship developed between him and his friends on the journey and the realization of what the house was born from his long journey to go there, leaving a good epilogue to show that How much does his character grow? But there are two other ways as well Wait a minute. I think I will cry ... <br /> <br /> Next, I haven't read Sheila Burnford's book, so I don't pretend that the difference between books and movies is a lie. Everyone in the family can watch, and while dull will love animals, talking older audiences will understand the plot better. (As I found out when I watched the movie again after many years This movie is a masterpiece in the cinema and I highly recommend that if you don't see you go out and get it! <br /> <br /> and please avoid the sequel (See my review for Homeward Bound II!)
