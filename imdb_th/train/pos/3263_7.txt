I normally like to watch movies like "Chance Are" but I'm not happy with this. The first half was quite good, with Alex Finch dying and being rebuilt in a new body (played by Robert Downey Jr.). He met his wife (Cybill Shepherd) and Ryan O'Neal and her daughter. He is now growing up. The scene with them met again, and Downey discovered again that he had done well and had enough emotion and happiness that the shepherds eventually believed that her husband was reincarnated. There are many sex-related scenes that make me close, especially Downey and Shepherd, who want to reunite even though they are different. However, after that, this film can end up satisfying the most by considering the situation of the plot. I'm disappointed because I didn't expect the film to be immoral at the end. There is a great potential for this, and the scenes in heaven do very well. There are good songs sung by Peter Cetera and Cher, but in the end this movie is not great. For better and similar movies, try "Heaven Can Wait". Well, but I hope I won't see it because the scene in the second half. <br /> <br /> *** From ****
