You don't need to read this review. <br /> <br /> Previous reviews by pninson of Seattle have identified all the major flaws in this production. I can only extend the basic argument. <br /> <br /> Bleak House is a novel of Dickens that is somewhat slower and darker than his previous work. Director Ross Devenish, who directed this story, falls into Darkness and fog too When Adrian and Esther appeared only half an hour at the opening of the event, it was a relief to be in the daytime for the first time in the murkier scene. It's hard to see what is on the TV screen. My I watched everything in one day, starting in the afternoon. When the day faded, this became less problematic. But I have a very good TV and I have never encountered this problem at any time. <br /> <br /> Spacing is a very thoughtful thing (such as slow). I'm sure this is three-dimensional. But it's too much There are images of many people that have been overrun, although the mud and grief of Victoria London is held longer than necessary to create mood and atmosphere. A good editing tool may take several minutes for each fifty minute episode without having to waste a conversation, just cutting each scene slightly. <br /> <br /> I don't want to exaggerate these two problems soon. You will adapt to the characteristics and rhythm of this production. The more important issue is that it doesn't always tell the story effectively. Previous versions of the Dickens novel have the same length as Bleak House, but they do not have complex plans. For example, recently I read Nicholas Nickleby again because I was interested in seeing how Douglas McGrath crammed the 800-page book in his two-hour movie. The answer is simple: This book is filled with spaces within McGrath, a wonderful cut of fiction while still retaining all important story elements. This will not be possible with Bleak House. <br /> <br /> This production takes seven hours. It may take longer because many elements of a complex storyline are not clear enough or have good management as necessary. A few random examples will show the problem. <br /> <br /> The maid, Rosa, appears from no background, so her attachment to Lady Dedlock is not taken care of. <Br / > <br /> George Sergeant's acceptance In the Tulkinhorn's need for Horton's handwriting samples is quite absurd. <br /> <br /> It's not clear enough that Esther falls in love with Wood Court when she agrees to marry John. It is not clear whether they agreed not to declare engagement or why. <br /> <br /> Ada and Rick are not openly married. In one episode, they were just lovers. Later, people talked about them as husbands and wives. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Rouncewell was introduced at the end of the story and the feud of Sargeant George from His family Being left unexplained - as she discovers <br /> <br /> The involvement of brick builders with Tom and (later) Lady Dedlock is quite opaque. <br /> <br /> It's not clear that Guppy renewed his offer. To Esther because of her The scars from smallpox are all but missing. <br /> <br /> This is just an option: There are others. They are not a major problem and the main driving force of that matter is clear enough. However, they are a little irritating that deviates from their power: You shouldn't have to solve small plot points. However, there are more important structural problems that make the story weak in the later stages. <Br /> <br /> The entire business of Tulkinhorn's murder is quite dropped. Bucket identifies Hortense as a suspect, which destroys the situation of Sergeant George and destroys the importance of The search for Mrs. Rouncewell also reduces the impact of the subplot that suspects Lady Dedlock and causes the scene in which Hortense is exposed. In front of Sir Lester, it is weaker. <br /> <br /> The more serious problem is murder. Investigation and searching for the Lady Dedlock that followed possession of the story for over an hour during the time we lost interest in other matters: lawsuits and consequences for Rick His failing finances were slashed by Vholes and Skimpole. Ada's despair, his reduced health and others were all suspended. This may be the way Dickens wrote this book. (I haven't read it for many years), but a good screenplay should make the plot go forward. <br /> <br /> Finally, the role of Smallweed in the story is diminishing. He was almost superfluous. His discovery of the new testament that caused the end of the story was thrown away. It happened outside the screen. <br /> <br /> Despite all this But still produce very well Many performances are outstanding. Each scene is beautifully accepted. The feeling of tragedy that has accumulated is very powerful. I will still suggest that it is a great adaptation of a great book, if not for production in 2005. In fact, I may not fully realize its shortcomings if I didn't see that Andrew Davies did it. How is it better? I am extremely important to Davies 'adaptation of Jane Austen, but I have to admit that he really knows how to teach Dickens' sprawling books. <br /> <br /> This is an impressive and fascinating drama and Worth everyone's time However, its fate is to be overlooked as a reference to the 2005 version that is nearing completion.
