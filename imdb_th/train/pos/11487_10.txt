As always, such controversial films have a variety of reviews. You may love or hate it and not everyone will like this movie. This shows the killer's perspective, which is what I feel is important to consider. You may hate them. You may claim to understand and feel as though you can participate. But regardless of whether this movie will make you think about shooting at school in a different perspective, <br /> <br /> The movie was taken using Some mobile cameras that I think use quite well because they make it more realistic. It was completely told from the killer's point of view from their "mission" to travel outside the house which led to the day "Zero Day" that they planned to massacre at their school. Zero Day did not offer an answer. But only offered a glimpse into the lives of two troubled boys and let the audience decide for themselves. Our feelings for boys are a combination of compassion and hatred. But we are still confused as to why two ordinary young people do so They show that it is normal to surprise young teenagers in general with ordinary lives and if we don't know what they plan, we don't expect anything. (They made it clear in the whole film that no one knew about their plans.) <br /> <br /> The performance was very good because the two actors were completely unknown. We hope to see more work from both of them in the future. However, this is a fictional movie. But can't help But notice the similarities clearly with Columbine Calvin and Andre have similarities to Eric Harris and Dylan Clyde Boulder (not much, but look like). See similarities. <br /> <br /> The actual massacre was shown on CCTV at the school and one of the most horrible things I've ever seen. I was absolutely shocked after seeing it and it was a feeling that was around for a while. It was real and very well done, and it seemed very difficult. <br /> <br /> All in Zero Day is a great movie. Great and I think at least everyone should try. In the past, we often had killer "psychopaths" and assumed that they were biological lines for disaster or influence on the media, but when Zero showed a deeper motivation and we never understood why the tragedy. When a school shot takes place until we see it from the killer's perspective
