After receiving excellent ratings at many levels, I was very satisfied with this movie. This movie is dark, movement, anger, pain, guilt and devil. Very convincing. <br /> <br /> At first I expected to see many special effects and like the love of couples. With its subtlety and accuracy Brian, I blown away with your art again with storytelling and special care techniques. You will go far my friend I'll definitely be the president of the fans. <br /> <br /> Eric Etebari, the best actor award, is the number one choice. You make Jr. Lopez look like a kid compared to Kasadya :) <br /> <br /> Overall, performances, stories, high-quality filming and great effects are great. I just hope it will last longer. I am looking forward to a dream that has very high expectations.
