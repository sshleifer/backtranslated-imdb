This movie is amazing - it's like a nightmare. The strange story, the darkness of the insect decoration, everywhere. The idea jumped and surreal dreams ... really wonderful! Those who like cult movies or thrillers will find this miracle. Looks like David Lynch's movie: Strange, strange dreams, red curtains, Nuit Noire, without any plot. It's quite a continuation of the surreal events, nightmares and meetings That is a drawback If this film has a really interesting plot full of tension with a storyline, a fascinating fascination, I'll give 10 out of 10, but that is gone and that's why I gave this movie. 8. Nuit Noire. Find a DVD and you will be rewarded!
