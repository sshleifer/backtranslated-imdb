My Take: Use a plot that is familiar with good performances and truly exciting moments. <br /> <br /> Be familiar. The innocent man is framed to assassinate the President of the United States, the first traitor in the US intelligence service. As his secret service agent pursued him, he tried to prove his innocence. Of course, we know his innocents and the real culprit is near. But I still get entertainment from THE SENTINEL at a time when the thrill has been downgraded to become too laughable and too much in the action scenes. Good for everyone who is shocking old-fashioned crime. The familiar plot is enhanced with exciting sequences and great performances. Michael Douglas, the perfect man for that job, is Pete Garrison, a long-running secret service. To assassinate the president Former colleagues in the secret service (Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria) chased Harrison as he tried to find out who was behind the assassination and the traitor in secret. This leads to many chasing scenes that are surprising (and thankful) that is unbelievable. The screenplay also has a sub-plan related to the battalion that is associated with the First Lady (played by Kim Basinger). This is not necessary to know because most subplots are of this type. > The film director is Clark Johnson (SWAT) who is a filmmaker. Although many people criticize it as "Should be a TV movie" I must not agree. Agreed that this is not the perfect movie and most are inspired by action movies, thriller and political interests like IN THE LINE OF FIRE or episodes from the 24 TV series (which this movie has Similar to the style), but even so, this movie will lead to height and not leave even less details The performance was excellent. (With the top performers, even though it is a chapter with numbers, <br /> <br /> everything I won *** 1/2 is not perfect But not far from here <br /> <br /> Score: *** 1/2 out of 5
