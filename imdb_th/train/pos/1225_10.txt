No one knows where or how I can find this movie !! I searched for too long and someone helped! Back in 1997, my girlfriend and I felt special with this movie from Long Island and we never saw it at all: (<br /> <br /> I hope I can find a copy so in I can finally check and share with girls! Who knows where to get this copy? I can stop driving by myself like crazy. (Also, it doesn't matter if it's in the VHS format. I'm still in the ice age by myself.) If you or anyone you know I am willing to pay for a good copy!
