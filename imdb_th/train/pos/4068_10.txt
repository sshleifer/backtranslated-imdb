No doubt that this is the best anime cartoon ever. I saw the castle for the first time in the sky in the late 80s when I was a child and it made an unforgettable impression. Many years have passed and I forgot the name of the movie and by searching on the internet by chance, I found this masterpiece again. After reading the opinions and analysis of others, I was not surprised that it had a lot of cheers and touches because it made an impression The true fantasy adventure must look for all children and adults. It is best not to let the story go out, so I will say that watching this movie will be clear and open. If you have children treat them, I promise you that they will love it. There is not much to say about this art. But if you don't see it, it will look and be fun
