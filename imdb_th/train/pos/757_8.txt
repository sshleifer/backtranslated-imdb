I want honesty I watched and enjoyed this show because it was impolite, offensive, hilarious and obscene. Yes, there are lots of humor for every taste. If you are a person who has a sense of humor related to making fun for people falling from the skateboard, you will have a good time. <br /> <br /> Or if you enjoy acrobatics Not good, you will have a good time And if you enjoy scatological humor and extreme situations, you will enjoy the show. <br /> <br /> I enjoy all three kinds of humor that "Dirty SÃ nchez" offers. The performance of "Jackass" is like walking in the park compared to here. So if you're tired of Jackass's American stupidity, try using English in this show. With great respect <br /> <br /> This is a tasteful list or a little class. Not recommended for those who are angry or easy to make money. <br /> <br /> Now these people have to meet with a psychologist, a special Paco character.
