TRICK or TREAT is a good example of Hollywood jumping on. "A retrospective of the metal music" bandwagon at Tipper Gore and her Washington Wives kicked off in the mid-80s (other less successful programs in this mini category, including the great BLACK ROSES and Silly THE GATE ) I am a second year student in high school when TRICK or TREAT comes out and can't wait to see it. Seems to be missing from the video store at the end of the 80s, but eventually I picked up a cheap DVD, and it brought many pleasant metal memories back on the same day. Any teenager associated with Eddie Weinbauer's experiment "The Fool" Weinbauer (Mark Price "Family Relationships") in this film as he was persecuted by the preppie "beautiful" people in his high school for heavy metals and musical tastes. Eddie's favorite rock star is Sammi. Curr (which looks like Tommy Lee of Motley Crue) who was killed in a hotel fire early in the movie Eddie didn't give up until he received the final test of Sammi's unreleased album from DJ Radio (Gene Simmons of Kiss for a short time). Eddie soon found out that this record when playing back made He can communicate with Sammi Curr's own soul! Soon, Sammi gave advice to Eddie about what to do with his torturers' preppie. But when the message grew tragic ("Waste'em ALL ... no fake metal!") Eddie tried. To destroy the album To live with Eddie's stereo speakers, Sammy rampages into a big dance at Eddie's high school and goes on stage to shake the crowd and collapse. "Bad Metal Mercury", where a few unfortunate people, before Eddie, arrived to save the whole day and the woman of his dreams (SIGH). No, it's not terrible. In 2006, it wasn't scary. Even in 1986, but TRICK or TREAT is a movie that will bring smiles to the faces of famous people in the 80s and have a good soundtrack. Fastway bands are worth looking at whether you've been bumped or not. Has a taste for horror movies Grade B (or both like me).
