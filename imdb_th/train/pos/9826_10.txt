Thriller, erotic story, cheap price that gives a good rating But has more disadvantages The plot revolves around a female lawyer trying to clear her lover who allegedly killed his wife. Is a movie that is soft, which makes her lost the strip club and having sex with suspects that may occur When converting to this type of category is not bad. The script is okay, and the story has enough reason for some people at 2:00 am. See this, so as not to notice too many vulnerabilities. But everything in the movie seems to be right The lead actor is not bad. But all the supporting actors are incredibly bad. (A woman looks like she is drunk and / or tall) The movie has bad light along with everything that looks grainy and ugly. The sound is so bad that you almost can't hear what people are saying. The worst thing in this movie is the reason you watch it - sex. The reason people watch these things is for the hot sex scene that has the hottest girls in the situation. Red Shoe Diary Sex scenes are not that hot. It was too lazy to shoot in the form of porn that everything was just a prototype image of two people. Women seem to be taking refuge from pornography. I'm not trying to be rude or meaningful here. But all of them have breast implants and look tired / eroded. Even the name "Deviant Obsession" sounds like a simple flick, not that I don't have anything with pornography - I actually love it. But I need a separate softcore and hard core What happened to actors like Shannon Tweed, Jacqueline Lovell, Shannon Whirry and Kim Dawson? Women who can show and who will stimulate you completely? And what happened to the sex thriller B, such as Body Chemistry, Nighteyes and even Stripped to Kill. Of course, none of these things were masterpieces. But at least they feel like a movie Moreover, they pushed the envelope apart from Hollywood's vulgar posture about sex, sexual passion and perversity. Now they have just created a hard movie without having hard-core sex.
