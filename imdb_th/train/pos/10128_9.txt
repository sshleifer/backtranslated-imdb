This is .. The first episode of Friends that we were introduced to Control Freak Monica Gellar (Courtney Cox), divorced new Ross Gellar (David Schimmer), Hippy Pheobe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), unknown actors and ladies. Man (Matt Le Blanc and Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry) is very sarcastic. This is the way the scene begins until we get introduced to the 6th child and the last friend. Spoiled Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston) <br /> <br / > Now better than most people, give credit as well as new sitcoms. The show is not good at this time because the actors are unable to identify and believe in their new characters (apart from Kudrow and Perry - shining). <br /> <br /> Matt Le Blong-Man, his performance is terrible because until later he has more confidence. But I think he tried to be funny but failed. <br /> <br /> David Schimmer - Why did he pronounce every word he couldn't speak normally? But he became one of the most fun people Character in the next season But he wasn't confident And I do not sympathize with him. Jennifer Aniston - looks hot and works well like Rachel Green But we will see the true Rachel in season 1. Later, Courtney Cox - looks quite tired of food at this time. Now different (Better health) She acted as a short body, but everyone was in the pilot for 20 minutes! Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry - I do these two things together, because their time and quality of acting is great, and for Lisa, this is one of her first roles and she is very natural, like Pheobe (Pheebs) and Matthew. Perry is just Matthew Perry playing himself in general! The quality of the episode will improve later, like the series. They look dark and creepy now and make them look unfriendly. The show is ok. The characters get confidence in each new scene and I'm proud. This is the pilot! I hope we can see friends gather together again! Because they will always be there for us!
