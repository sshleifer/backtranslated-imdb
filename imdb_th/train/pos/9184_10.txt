Yes, this production is long. (Good news for Bronte fans!) And it feels quite old. But both casting and acting are so great that you don't want to see other versions. <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton IS Edward Rochester ... It's very easy. I don't care that other critics claim that he's handsome. too Dalton is definitely charming. But without cute children In fact, he has a dark charm and has a corner which in my opinion is quite a treat to the mystery of Mr. R. and he uses the feelings of torture and torture of Rochester severely. He shows the ferocity when the scene demands But also demonstrates Rochester's gentle, emotional passion (IMO, a new generation of A&E manufacturers suffering from Ciaran Hinds - which I normally like - seems to be polite and bullying him all the time I read many times and I never felt that Rochester was seen as a beast.) <br /> <br /> When I read the novel, I read Zelah Clarke as Jane always. For me, Clarke looked like Jane while She explained the A(And described by others), small, innocent, angels ... although it is true But the actress did not see 18, but she showed the character of Jane well. While other reviews claim that her performance is woody or not frantic But we must remember that the character spent 8 years in Lowood's training to keep her emotions and "Passionate nature" in the examination of her main inspiration is Helen, her childhood friend who is a picture of humility. Although her true nature is not the same But Jane learns to control her emotions and insult him according to the school's goals. For charitable students who want to 'service', Jane becomes the authority of Rochester's household. Of course, she will not talk to him equally. Even later, when she gave and received, she had to always remember that her station was below her employer. However, if you read this book - which this production is astonishingly close - you can see the small battles of Zelah-as-Jane. That stands up as she controls her emotions to keep the mind calm and emotional. <br /> <br I think the chemistry between Dalton and Clarke is correct. No, it doesn't look like the least of Hollywood. (thanks to God! It's not a Hollywood type of book) but their love is love, truth, dedication and loyalty. And for women like Jane who never thought of having * love * towards her, it was a little miracle. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is great and I like the truth that almost everything. The characters from the book are here. Therefore, it is a rich and varied manuscript dialogue. This version is the only version that I know, including the cute and embarrassing gypsy scene. In general, there is more humor than any other version I've seen. Especially the teasing of each other between the characters brought from the book and is very happy. <br /> <br /> Jane Eyre is in many ways, one of the most popular female novels. Finally, she accepts her own love and freedom, and eventually is the equally true truth of Rochester!
