This film has one of the greatest performances of Richard Dreyfuss as an actor who played dictatorship and made it convincing that his mother didn't detect deceit In addition, this movie is funny. But there are serious aspects as well What is particularly interesting about this movie is the character Madonna, who is the dictator of the dictator. But eventually became the leader of the country The evolution of Madonna from the beloved to the political leader has greatly enhanced the quality of the story and the entertainment value of the movie. And the main character at the beginning of the movie is a struggling actor and a comedian evolved, and the end of the movie is respected I like this movie
