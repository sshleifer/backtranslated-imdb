Life Stinks (1991) is a step lower than other Mel Brooks productions. He is a millionaire who wakes up mad people with his "friends". Brooks claims he can live like a homeless man for a month His shocked and amusing friend accepted this unusual bet while "in" in Bowery. He met a group of strange homeless people, one of whom caught his fancy (Lesley-Ann Warren). Which she taught him about the techniques she learned while on the road Mr. Brooks can survive on his own without being extravagant, rich or not? Will he win this unorthodox bet? Who is his true friend? Search when you watch LIFE STINKS to find answers. <br /> <br /> This film has been unfair. Of course, it's not classic like his previous movies, but still fun. I like the way Mel Brooks shows respect for Charles Chaplin in this movie. If you've watched Chaplin's silent movie before, you'll get humor as well. <br /> <br /> Recommended for Mel Brooks fans.
