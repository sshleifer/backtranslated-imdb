The erotic cinema of the 1970s was tame compared to the three times that of Romps today, which is considered good. Because there are good stories around naked rituals and sex scenes Of course, I hope that they will have the vampire effects that they have at that time and that sex has come in a little bit. Plus some accents are difficult to understand at times. But it is worthwhile to see an unedited version, then a modified version But if you don't care that many naked women dance and have sex, this isn't the movie for you. Anyway, I enjoy it and I give ... 7 STARS
