I was and was very entertained by movies. It was my favorite movie of the year 1976. Raising in the 70s I loved Kris Kristoffersons The look and behavior of course I'm not a movie critic. But for that era I like the combo of Streisand and Kristofferson. I think they work very well together. I have watched movies many times and still love both as Esther and John Norman. I'm a big fan of Chris and have seen him in concert when I can. A talented music writer, a singer, doesn't have to talk about actors. I've seen him in many movies. But still think that A Star was born
