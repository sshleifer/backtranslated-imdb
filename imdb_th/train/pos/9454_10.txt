In what is the best outdoor adventure movie of all time, the four cities face the wrath of nature in the story of survival. This scene is a rainforest in Georgia with forests, mountains and wild rivers. <br /> <br /> The director John Borman chose to use local people, not actors, to show the second character. These villagers absorb movies that have a depth of character in film history. There are no "actors" actors who can approach these faces, sounds or the amazing actions of these people. I don't think of movies that are secondary characters that are realistic and colorful. It is a formidable realism that makes this movie so amazing. <br /> <br /> Another strength is the movie theme. Nature in the forest may be violent. The proper way that the setting should be American South. There are only a few places in the United States that are as violent as the narrow-minded countries. In the story of Darwin's survival that is most appropriate, the film conveyed the idea that humans are part of nature, not separate. <br /> <br /> "Liberation" is the work of time that is broken Unlike today The Americans expressed concern about the lost wilderness. The beautiful scenery of the movie, the sound of the crickets and the roar of the turbulent river combined with the lack of civilization all convey the environmental message. And that is the strength of the movie. <br /> <br /> At the level of entertainment, the tension gradually multiplies. Even half the movie, the tension gets tougher and then doesn't give up until final chapter There are only a few movies that can maintain that intensity in this lengthy plot. <br /> <br /> Finally, the technical quality of this film is number one. The direction and correction are flawless. Great movie Interesting conversation And the performance is excellent. Burt Reynolds has never been better than before. Ned Betty is perfectly selected and works well. And Jon Voight should be nominated for an Academy Award If there is a weak link in the movie, it is a song that hit me as a shy person. <br /> <br /> Overall, "liberation" almost certainly attracts viewers who like outdoor adventure. Even for people who do not have a formidable identity, the performances and tensions in that scene are reason enough to watch this movie, which is one of the best movies in film history.
