When the United States entered the First World War, the government forced Hollywood to create a LITTLE American propaganda movie. Probably the best place among all because it was Mary Pickford's star. <br /> <br /> Pickford played the girl at Lacking between two men: Jack Holt (Germany) and Raymond Hatton (France), but her decision is Delayed due to war while both men meet. <br /> <br /> When the Pickford ship is sailing on a sank by a German (Think of Lucitania) because it holds a weapon. Picford has a wonderful scene as she stands on Lifeboat and shouting at the German commander Later, of course, she ran toward both Holt and Hutton when she was captured as a prisoner of war at the castle, director Cecil B. Demil shows one of the best scenes in this film, like Pickford and Holt was walking through the village that was bombed. They passed the destroyed church, which had only one wall still standing. Compared to the wall is a very large cross As they stood and watched the wall collapsed. But the body of Jesus remained in the air It was a very surreal moment in the movies that were straightforward and artistic. <br /> <br /> Picford is a pleasure to watch all the time. She is often a natural actor who avoids other actors in those days. She is also very beautiful. Holt is very good here. In the role of leader Hatton is ok. Among the list of performers in the "Special" section include Wallace Beery, Ramon Novarro, Colleen Moore, Ben Alexander, Hobart Bosworth, Norman Kerry, Walter Long, James Neill and Edythe Chapman <br /> <br /> Not a great movie But interesting to see the propaganda of the United States at work
