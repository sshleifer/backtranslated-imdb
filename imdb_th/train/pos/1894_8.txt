I remember trying to spend a few minutes in this movie. I was very surprised that I didn't watch all of the director Steve Gordon. His only film directed before death, heart failure was generally Arthur Bach (who Received a Golden Globe Award and Oscar nominated Dudley Moore) as a drunken millionaire with everything he needed. Hobson butler mansion (Oscar winner and Golden Globe and BAFTA Sen The name Sir John Gielgud). He will inherit a value of $ 750 million if he married the daughter of a billionaire Robert Johnson. (Stephen Elliott) They are the women he and his family chose Susan. (Jill Aiken Berry) But Arthur finds herself falling in love with Queens, the waitress, Linda Rollers. (The Golden Globe named Lisa Minnie) which of course was threatening the inheritance and 3/4 of his family's possessions from Stanford's father. After the death of Hobson, Arthur in the day Marriage, not obeying the wishes of the family But Aunt Martha still gives Arthur a legacy that will live happily forever after having true love. Linda Starring Ted Ross as Bitterman Barney, Martin Ralf, Marolla Anderson, Salvo as Gloria-Glass, Maurice Copeland as Uncle Peter Bash, Justin John Houston Aunt Buck, Florence Tarlow, as Nesbitt John Bentley plays Perry and Peter Evans as Preston Langley - Party Guest. Moore is an amazingly funny person and a little cringe as a drunken millionaire. At times, Minnie is a favorite as a woman he loves and of course. Gielgud less impressed with Oscar. It won the Academy Award for Best Song for "Arthur's Theme (The Best You Can Do)" (also won the Golden Globe) (number 79 in 100 years, 100 songs) and received Nominated for writing popular screenplay directly For that screen, BAFTA Anthony Asquith was nominated for Burt Bacharach's film and received the Golden Globe Award for Best Picture - Comedy / Musical Sir John Gielgud is number 35 in the 50 Great British Actors.
