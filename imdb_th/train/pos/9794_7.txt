I think this movie might be a little more complicated in terms of psychology, maybe But performing action and sound is the most important thing The animation is a heavy CG in many scenes, but it's very good. This is one of the Batman Returns / Forever movies, which includes Wayne's love and conflict and the motivation for dating fans 007. People will love this and women's songs that are the theme! Wayne plays well in this film and Penquin returns to his true form. This time, there is no mutant gene in him! I like the fact that Robin doesn't use too much. Tim Drake is just a good computer. But an Indigo or future child. <br /> <br /> Actor who was created from some TV series. The star, the right talent and the characters are attracted to the voice actors. Kelly Ripa is a hilarious person in this movie. <br /> <br /> I score below Phantasm, Return of the Joker and Batman vs. Dracula But like scripts that are smarter than I like Subzero 7/10
