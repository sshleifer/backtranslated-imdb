They may have crossed the starting point - I'm not sure why this happened in the Turkish region of Asia. If because of the beginning in the Mediterranean, they might start to come closer to Lebanon in modern times. <br /> <br /> One camera and a team travel to the Bakhtyari tribe. It is the start of an amazing 48-day journey. 50,000 people with goats, camels, cows and horses, about 250,000 people travel through this amazing path in what appears to be a fast moving Karun river. They use a raft floating in the water by inflating the skin of the goat - you can see where the head and legs are removed. "Other banks" of the river are very steep - I guess that will increase by 60 degrees. br /> <br /> Just look incredible. But there is much more to come To go to the pasture, they had to cross the big mountain with snow about 4 feet. If not many, the ability to climb this mountain is very amazing in itself, but they (and all animals) climb. This mountain with bare feet! Yes, barefoot. <br /> <br /> One drawback to this documentary is that some of the titles that have bad humor. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a documentary from the silent era Or the incredible challenge that this tribe not only But found only But still overcome This is just an incredible document of a group of little-known people facing all kinds of challenges.
