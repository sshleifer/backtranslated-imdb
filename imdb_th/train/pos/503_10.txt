After 7 years of watching the terrifying nonsense called Star Trek Voyager, I felt the next genius numbness and DS9 was a good blood and Voyager destroyed TV Trek. The crew is very good as well as choosing actors for parts. Scott Bakula played as a team captain for the first time, generally in space and the way to do things that were not polished to him was a refreshing change for bosses who knew everything from before. Other crews are very fond of their roles and I think they will go out for the first season. When the show was canceled prematurely, I was really disappointed in A Mirror Darkly showing us what the actor was capable of. Pity of movies or TV movies was never considered. Many retrospective stories and the founding of the remaining federation to tell, including the attacks of the Klingons ..........
