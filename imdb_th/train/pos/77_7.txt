The movie begins with Vincent Price being about to start his performance as a magician. However, on the way through successful performances, the police came and shut him down. It seems that his old boss will fool him from the price created - even the person he did himself at home. The price makes the price kill the wicked reasonably. The problem is that while the audience understands why the price is killed and most probably think this is a good thing because the price is quite crazy, he can't stop at first. <br /> <br /> This film is full of creative and exciting magic tricks. (Including a large circular saw and crematorium for the show) excellent plot and exciting action One thing you can't say about this movie is it's boring. While it is far from sensitive But it's always fun, even if it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> If I never saw the House of WAX version Vincent Price, I might like THE MAD MAGICIAN more and give it a score of 8 or 9. That's because While THE MAD MAGICIAN is a great movie, it is reminiscent of the house of WAX. The bottom line is that since the House of WAX is very successful, the formula is again hashed in the follow-up movie Both were created in 3-D. Both have a plot that Price has every reason to kill. But he can't stop when he does the first thing and both of them enjoy watching The biggest difference and only a few are House of WAX in color and more horror movies. THE MAD MAGICIAN is more of a mystery. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch this movie. AND HOUSE OF WAX (Price model only) They are both great horror movies of the 1950s.
