I didn't know Texan (director Douglas McGrath) and American actress Gwyneth Paltrow had pulled this out. But seeing this again will remind you of what Paltrow worried at first! I lost a long time since that woman and still felt that she was quite boring in the Oscar-winning "Shakespeare In Love" performance. But she received all the dancing here - she was almost perfect like Emma Woodhouse. She may have won the Shakespeare Academy Award. But you should remember this. <br /> <br /> Of course, she is surrounded by great actors, including Tony Collet, Greta Kochchi. Much about love, interest, even though the screenplay makes his love for Paltrow (in the process of helping all tensions escape from their relationship); Many years later, Ewan's hair is easier than it used to be in '96, and personally I found Alan Cumming that looks disgusting today. But the distinction is Sophie Thompson (the sister of Emma Thompson, Phyllawall's daughter) as Miss Bates, without a doubt. What this model wants is the scene in which Emma fights with Miss Bates because she is the character that we draw destiny. This movie should be worth watching (again) for her performance alone. <br /> <br /> All of this makes the amazing age amazing, with the charm that is empty and subtle enough Distinguish the English class system Worth the rental (Because it is unlikely that Paltrow will be good again But we will always have Emma)
