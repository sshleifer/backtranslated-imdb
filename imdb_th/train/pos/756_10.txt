I must say that even though I insult this kind of performance, the horror I am a woman. But I feel that I have to comment. I've seen Dirty Sanchez before seeing Jackass and thinking that it's more than Jackass in terms of creating a list. The story and interviews are woven to create more interesting performances. I saw the movie Jackass for a few minutes the night before and didn't want to believe how bad it was. Everything was a joke after nothing was involved. It must be the easiest, quickest to start shocking amateurs. While drinking puke isn't my own, as many entertainment programs continue, Dirty Sanchez is separated from Jackass's league.
