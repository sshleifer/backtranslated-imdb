From Robert Bloch's heart of fame "Psycho" comes four stories of distorted fear in this Amicus poetry movie, which, while not much fun or as scary as I would like, still provide good entertainment. < br /> <br /> It's linked to the story of the detective Scott York (John Bennett), who is investigating the disappearance of a famous actor He suggested that this case was linked to others by the house in which they all happened and our movies were closed and worked. <br /> <br /> "How to kill" There are authors Charles Hillyer (Denholm Always delighted. Elliott) haunts his latest creation, which seems to come to life. This sequence has surprising and quite good moments and is covered by revelations and humorous storylines. <br /> <br /> "Waxworks" Horror star icon Peter Cushing Peter Cushing Is a broker of Philip Securities Joss Ackland is obsessed with the image of a beautiful woman found in a terrifying wax museum. The most effective at this time is the dream sequence, although it is always great to watch the mattress. The last picture presented to us in this story is quite shocking. <br /> <br /> "Sweets to the Sweet" presented Christopher Lee, a horror movie that is loved by others like John Reid, who does not love. Cute moppet boy Jane (Chloe Franks) is too generous and it is up to a friend / new tutor Ann Norton (Nyree Dawn Porter) to find out why. The mystery of this episode has been superbly managed. The filmmakers wisely did not reach their hands, so it was truly shocking when we received the full truth from this unhappy family. The "dying" moments were scary. The more <br /> <br /> "The Cloak" has the most comedy in the fourth, Jon Pertwee, one of the many actors who played the role of Dr. Who over the years has had a lot of fun as a crafty horror movie star. (In fact, he was the highlight of this story) who was furious about the quality of his latest low budget movie and bought his own cloak. The cloak says that there is a strange power that I didn't dare to reveal. Here, Sexy Ingrid Pitt presents a welcome as a colleague of the Pertwees. One amazing example of humor here is the jab that nobody else except Christopher Lee! <br /> <br /> The story is summarized and summarized in a predictable way. But still effective as a detective. Inspector Holloway Take all the warnings for him more seriously. <br /> <br /> Emphasize with the unusual and striking scores of Michael Dress. "The House That Dripped Blood" is a fun mix of stories. While I do not enjoy it as far as speaking "Tales from the cellar" It was fun. Directed by Peter Duffell. But of course, going to each horrific conclusion and being a good movie of the kind. <br /> <br /> 7/10
