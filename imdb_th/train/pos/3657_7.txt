This movie is like the version of Ettore Scola of Brutti sporchi e cattivi in ​​1950. Less sex and less realism. But is a story that has humanity and good warmth I will not call this a true image. It's a very sensitive and fairy-tale story, and should be classified as a comedy, although it's related to seriousness. In general, Italians are difficult to temper and resist, except for those who have a cold. Thoughts are reduced even though this image does not mean being a true drama. It's not a masterpiece like Umberto D or The Thief Bicycle, but it's a funny and funny comedy with beautiful music. <br /> <br /> 7/10
