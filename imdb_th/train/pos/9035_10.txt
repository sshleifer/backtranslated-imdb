The performance in this film is excellent. As an amateur rocket player, I found a slight error. As a human being, it touches my heart and soul. In watching the actors, you will think that they are real characters. Laura Dern, my favorite actress, has nothing left for her performance. A young actor who plays Rocket Boys shows his talent beyond his time, especially the younger Homer. Homer's father inspires that eternal love / hate the relationship between father and son makes it feel real. If you don't get a lump in your neck or shed tears when the first successful rocket goes up, or when the father and son arrive at the agreement, then check your pulse.
