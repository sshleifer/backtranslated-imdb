One of my favorite movies forever I saw it at least a hundred times and I couldn't pass it without crying. I challenged anyone to see Celie and Nettie or Shug and his father, and did not feel that your eyes were dull. Whoopie Goldberg should have won one for an amazing painting And for people who say you can't love movies if you love this book wrong! I am a proof of that.
