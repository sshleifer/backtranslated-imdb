After reading many good reviews about this movie, I decided to do this. (I bought it on a DVD, so pun "Blender" ... I'm a fool.) The starting point is everything I hope. (With some words I've heard in Wu-Tang's various albums) about what should be a good movie But the plot I heard was great. It was predictable. Every time I see a character (except Lizard), I guess he is poisonous. In addition, the coolest characters are killed in the middle of the movie. Ok, the plot is not very good. But at least there are good kung fu, right? Wrong. The fight is very short and not very far apart. Receiving different styles is great. But I hope the fight will last longer. I hope to see the Lizard running and making a crazy cough on the wall. But it never happened I hope to see Centipede doing something fast. But never happened I hope to see Scorpion in the movie for more than 7 minutes, but it never happened. In the short term, not much happens. The fight is a lovely routine. Don't be fooled, because this movie has a story that doesn't mean it's a good story.
