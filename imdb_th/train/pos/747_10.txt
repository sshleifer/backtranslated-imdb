When I saw it, I became a fanatic, laughing, laughing and crying and feeling along with the characters because Me and my friends are <br /> <br /> My clothes and their speaking are out of date. But the mood and despair of each situation is familiar I remember how real it was and I hope that they will make a movie like this. <br /> <br /> Actually, I saw this movie one night after I was at a party at crazy In the house of Jay), which was affected by what we considered the loser. Derelicts hanging on the edge of our world-class BS'er crowd and the "responsible" mummy type that I immediately identified with Jeanie (me Is also a person with a car), even though I have the insecurity of Madge floating there My best friend is Deidre and her good friend Annie is our childhood. <br /> <br /> Watch the scene when Jeanie is in school or she and her boyfriend quit.

Think this is Must see for girls aged 13 years and over
