I think this movie has a great plan. It makes me confused and my cousin watching it with me to tell the truth. I think Kevin Dillon is a little hot. Hahaha ... but I Thought that the woman was too stupid The police and that were wrong in what he said to her before he died. "I am in you." I think that's what she got from doing what she did to him and how he would tell her that she was too young. How old is another woman? I don't think I can trust that police. But telling the truth, it is quite clear that he is a man, even if he wants to be a police officer, I still wonder From him both ways, and that was funny when she sprayed him in the eyes. At Haha Haha, she was stupid to enter the warehouse again by herself and the police died with HELLO !! It is called back-up. Sometimes these movies make me crazy when people are stupid and do stupid things. But that's what I think about movies.
