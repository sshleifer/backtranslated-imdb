This is a very unusual movie that the star with the highest charge does not appear literally until half way up. However, I have received a request from Phantom Lady Curtis, despite the ability as an accused. Ott Henderson, who falsely seems to be sympathetic (Maybe he should shave) and his behavior when he got home for the first time. While other critics had problems with Franchot Tone while Jack Marlowe, I found that his character was impressive and complex. He doesn't have a bad identity. Best Actress Elisha Cook Jr. is back in the top position again as 'The small man with great ambitions' His drumming in the amount of music adds a delightful touch of sexual feelings. However, this film was performed by Ella Rain, who is capable and adorable as a devoted lover of Henderson's Carol Richmond. She is certainly capable and her on-screen appearance is a tradition of Lorraine. This is my first job that I have seen and I will definitely see her other roles. The remaining actors are more capable. All in the film Noir, a very satisfying mystery that, when viewed today, indicates a dark and complex city in the world.
