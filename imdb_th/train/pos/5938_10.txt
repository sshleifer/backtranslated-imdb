Another great taste of superhero movies that should be after Batman: Dead End that stimulates our taste and makes us want more! This is what the real superhero movie should look like and feel like! Even this difficult matter is a true fan. The attention to detail, characters and actions is undeniably true. Although this is a production of limited resources, it has caused a lot of shame about the budget of the superhero, the actor and the hyped "other" related movie productions. Here, the main characters and the actors act and look like they are people in real life. Finally, the superman that looks like "super" and looks real! Batman, in a way that should be without tearing the rubber armor to hide the ridiculous body for the paid actor more than not delivering. I just hope that some people who have the reason of Warner Bros. agreed to a full length adjustment of this gem. I don't care whether going to the cinema or directly with the DVD. I won't be bored to watch it. The plot itself has value for the powder that has been hard for this. Hopefully "bigwigs" at Marvel and D Productions will watch and see if the real superhero movie produced is good. What does it look like? There is no failure "Batman & Robin" or Hulk, Daredevil and others. Learn from these little directors and learn that there is no reason to "create" a hero for the movie theater Mr. Collora ... We Want more directors like you !!
