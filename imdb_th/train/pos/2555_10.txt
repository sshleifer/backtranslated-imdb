This movie isn't all that great. Better book But the movie wasn't too bad either. It's interesting to say the least. This plot has enough suspicion for me to see, even if I don't say that I'm really interested in the movie Janine Turner and Antonio Sabato Jr. Both of them are beautiful enough to let you see :) They have amazing scenes. A few love places that are attractive for couples. Overall, I want this movie to have 7 or 8. It's not bad.
