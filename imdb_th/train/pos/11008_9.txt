You will notice from the stars that I received this great movie, '... before you see it for the first time.' I have never heard of this before and happened to it because this week (and finally) Very slow rental experience (Not much to come in) I'm not sure how this movie slipped through me - I love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northam is great too. Even so, <br /> <br /> This film is a great example of what to do if you don't have a large budget. It has the right plot and dialogue to make it very interesting and make the audience in the dark enough. This movie is you (the audience) trying to figure out a lot of twists and turns. I'll give this movie 10/10, but some pictures look tricky. I didn't stick to this movie too much. But I don't think it deserves the perfect score. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is beautiful and mysterious (as always). I think she is a talented person. Never mind your beauty (Which is difficult) She is serious about her role seriously and does not stand still to drive her through complex emotions. And she looks cool and lifeless, if desired as well. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam did very well at first as an organization with a fierce stance. However, as he changed throughout the movie, it was like day and night. I knew that some fans of Clive Owen Jude Law or other hopes of becoming the next James Bond would hate me in this story He is gentle and has a culture. He has Bond's great voice and gesture. I think he might be cold if the situation demands and would rather go down to the ground as well. <br /> <br /> Great movie and of course this movie is recommended to watch at least once if You like corporate espionage movies
