I can't see the point in embedding a movie like this in sulfur satire when it does not intend to be anything more than a vehicle to entertain children and prepare them for the next line product to ask like crazy. /> This is a fun movie. My children sit quietly throughout everything and love it every minute. True, the villain is on the top with a silly costume and his madman. But this is a much easier way to get the dark, gloomy and terrifying Pokémon. <br /> <br /> Watch the Pokémon from the beginning and they're going into the era when they will "Take off what is a kid" and move on to others. I'm glad we had fun together.
