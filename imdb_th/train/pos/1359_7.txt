I work in the library and expect to like this movie when it came out 5 years ago. I like Parker Posey a lot. (She is a great actor) and Omar Townsend is really cute as her boyfriend. (He can't show It's not funny or cute or anything more. Posey kept this movie with her power. But she learned the Dewey decimal system overnight and put a lot of books to the music rhythm ?? !!!! ??? Come! In addition, I have a problem with the way she looks when she becomes a full-fledged librarian. At the end - I'm in boxing glasses without humor - can we let that image be possible? Worth seeing Posey and Townsend But that's about it The TV series is much better.
