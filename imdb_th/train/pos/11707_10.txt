I remember having watched this movie for a long time, even though it had no special effects. But the performance is very good And it still has the same message for today, although the technology will change, maybe they should create this movie again, it's interesting to see the remake I also enjoy music from movies as well. Larry Norman is a really good songwriter at that time, although most Christian songs are now worshiping and praising music. I always want to know what will happen to Patty after the series ends? Do you make more movies? Do you marry and raise a family? I want to update
