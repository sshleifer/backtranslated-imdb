One of the ten best comedians ever. <br /> <br /> It looks funny and cheerful. Keaton's comedy is thoughtfully _innerly harmonious. Ordered wisely. <br /> <br /> Amusing, delightful and deliberately creative. Three ages should be the body of the top ten comedians. Three times the love story will make the audience passionate. I want to bring this method or not. Keaton's comedy is like DESTINY. Up or down, BO REBOURS again, a few traverses the waters of time and age in the Stone Age in Rome and at Keaton in Mohammed. In the country of Renaissance Italy and in China The same device works with both movies, as well as other eerie melodrama - as a light comedian at Keaton. It's the same couple. And may be the same as Lang Babies who want by Buster and Beer are good people. I find that there are three eras that are well written and intelligent without having to be complex and elegant. The plot is basically POPEYE, much like a baby. It's a piece of furniture. The only protagonist is two male competitors. Keaton and Beery Keaton's movies are very satisfying. Who will be tempted to confirm this, seems to be ambitious fun, isn't it? But it is great fun, great fun, enough fun and Wallace Beery is a nemesis.
