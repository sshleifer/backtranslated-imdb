This film has never received as much attention as it should be, although this is one of the best performances and is one of the most realistic stories I've ever seen on screen. Filmed clearly with a small budget in the actual V.A hospital. The center of the story is Joel, which plays very well by Eric Stolt Joel is paralyzed by a motorcycle accident and comes to the hospital to meet another man with a spinal injury. Joel falls in love with his married lover Anna, played by Helen Hunt, which shows the early signs of her Academy Award-winning work. > <br /> Although Joel Ann's relationship Many other well-developed characters in the ward Wesley Snipe works tremendously as Raymond is angry. What's more impressive is William Forsythe as a bitter and racist bloss. I think two of Forsyth's best scenes were when he was frustrated and angry at Dancers Square and later when he was sympathetic to a Korean man shot in a liquor store. My favorite scene with Snipes is talking at the round of sex choices after the injury. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Stoltz and Hunt is very strong and they are very intimate. The orgasm in the ward is both sexy and amusing. There is also another memorable scene in which Joel and Blus and the Korean boy bring a van with special equipment to the strip. It was a joke that caused a real mistake as they tried hard to get the van to look. "Naked women" <br /> <br /> This causes more pain from the fact that director Neal Jimenez is paralyzed in real life. This is his story. This movie is real, not shadows or flashy. Having talent in this movie with a small budget is amazing. I recommend this movie to everyone I see because it is one of those movies that is improved in the second look. It's a shame that such a large piece of work is overlooked. But through the video may receive attention until deserving of wealth
