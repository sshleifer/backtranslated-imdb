This is not the best big foot ever made. But from the latest standards of movies that are not very popular, most are shown in sci-fi channels. This is a quality thing. It has some humorous action. F / X and the right Bigfoot use CG, but there are actually F / X that I like. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is worth watching. If you are a fan of horror / sci-fi and need correction It's better than Sasquatch movies and it's not a sequel, so don't be fooled. <br /> <br /> The performance is better than you'd expect to see in a movie like this, and the director is enough. A little while the character "develops" but knows that things will improve. If you are watching a DVD, you may want to skip one or two chapters.
