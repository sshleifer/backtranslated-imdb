I watched recently, but when it started I didn't know what the concept was about. The topic was ..... in the short term - I don't know what it is. Is it a documentary or a comedy routine ..... Hmm, it's both. <br /> <br /> It's a bit slow. But I think that's because I don't know what kind of program I'm watching, but it makes me absorb quickly. When I watched Robert Wuhl talked about facts and historical fiction. Most of us (American) learned. The history is not true - and the way we learn what we do. He did this for the audience to enjoy and was completely interested. In fact, I learned a little and that was a true indicator of how powerful this program is. <br /> <br /> I like it. To see this, picking up a set for HBO. I believe it may be fun and effective with a variety of topics - especially if they "teach" in the same way as now.
