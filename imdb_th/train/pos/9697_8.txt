This is a really warm family movie. It has absolutely excellent animal training and "performances" (if you can call it that way) as well (just think about dogs in Paulie's story. Very well done, repeat well and generally The drama is also complicated. No need to say much unless this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: Story 8.5 / 10, Performances 7.5 / 10, Animals + fx 8.5 / 10, Movies 8/10 <br / > My overall rating: 8/10 - big family movies and looks very good!
