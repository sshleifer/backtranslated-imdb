Unfortunately, director Amos Guttman died from a disease associated with AIDS in the year after making this movie, so we do not know if there are many gay-related movies that we may have from him.

The Hessed Mufla (Amazing Grace) service has a nude male forehead, at least in a magazine that turns into a dream sequence of desires and use This is the story of two families that have to go through or try to do.
