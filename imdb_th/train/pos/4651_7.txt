I did not set very high expectations for this movie, which surprised me. Sometimes the story is strange. But overall I think it's reliable. The action scenes are quite good and the accompanying songs are used to stimulate the patriotic feelings that are identical to the movies of the United States. This may not be the best movie ever. But it is strange for Sweden and I hope to see more similar things in the future.
