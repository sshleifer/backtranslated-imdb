When I found this movie in my local videostore, I expect it to be another magical American vampire movie in the same vein of "The Lost Boys" (1987). My surprise "To Die for" is a movie that Really good But there are also a set of modern and surprising parts that will satisfy vampire lovers. This is the perfect combination of romance and horror, and it is surprisingly full of blood. Highly recommended
