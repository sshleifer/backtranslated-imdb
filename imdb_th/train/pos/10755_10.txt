A wonderful documentary about the lives of New York firefighters during the worst terrorist attacks of all time .. The only reason is the reason why this thing has to see the collector's list .. What shocked me Is not just an attack The physical characteristics of these firefighters I think many doctors will agree with me that in the way they are in there, some of these firefighters will not make it up to the 79th floor that carries 60 pounds or more. There is more respect for firefighters and I know that being a firefighter is a life-changing job. The French have a history of creating great documentary films and that is what is a great documentary .....
