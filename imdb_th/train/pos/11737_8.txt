OK, this film is stupid. I mean, it's a good way. But it's stupid with a purpose and one of the "stupid" movies that is better than I've seen The jokes and gags are not good. But delivered in a way that makes all the correct notes to me Supporting characters are relatively shallow and moderate. Has a rather weak plot But it works well. <br /> <br /> Elvira's character is the point of interest. Here, she's cute and cute. On top of that acting ability, she has a straightforward, beautiful physical property. There are only a few people who disagree. The part that shows her shape is a fun scene in the movie. <br /> <br /> I have ears that smile from the first scene to the final scene. <br /> <br /> Very high. Lots of funny and beautiful women fans I hope they will create another dozen Elvia movies.
