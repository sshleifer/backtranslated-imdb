I have to say that I love Vanishing Point. I've seen the original and this is a good rework. Although it doesn't follow the original story (That is why I gave 8 out of 10) It's still quite good and this may be a better story. <br /> <br /> For the car, DJ comments at the end about Challenger being 185 mph in bulldozers. That is unlikely to be possible (And if you look at, the shaky speedometer needle at 145-150) but even though I don't see one in the engine The initial scene in which they performed the engine, the original story, with the hemi being too crowded, so it was possible. For those who say that aerodynamics won't allow Chrysler 300C today to be able to accelerate at 168 miles per hour and if you look at it on the highway by pushing the brick wall through the wind at 70 miles Hour In addition, in the wind tunnel test, if you place the air dam on the Challenger, it may be more aerodynamic.
