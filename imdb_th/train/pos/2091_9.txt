What Irving Tulberg made in creating this film today will never be tried again. Create stories of Chinese and Western players, although they have the talents of Paul Muni, Luise Rainer, Charley Grapewin and Walter Connolly among others. <br /> <br /> Maybe partly because of the stories written by the people. Western Pearl Buck, who received the Pulitzer Prize for her novel in 1932. Ms. Buck, the daughter of a Chinese missionary, may lead China closer to America's consciousness than anyone else. Not a political struggle in China But the life and hardships of the people we meet in the good world every day Unfortunately, later, Pearl Buck became the defender of Chiang Kai-Shek's Kuomintang China for morals and exaggeration. The rest of her literary works do not match The Good Earth. <br /> <br /> In The Sundowners, there are good explanations about comparing China and Australia by Peter Ustinov. When asked about differences, Ustinov said that China Big and very full and very big and empty Australia That's what you see in The Good Earth, China. Bigger and full of people than you can sometimes handle. <br /> <br /> The Good Earth tells the story of Wang Lung (Paul Muni) in As a young man who bought a wife from a large house where she was a slave girl O-Lan (Luise Rainer) carrying him for two sons and seeing him all the time, good and bad, that they had drought, famine, revolution and Plague of Locusts The second of two consecutive Oscars for O-Lan drawing. She may set some recordings in order to be the leading interactive Oscar player. Everything she did was actually done with facial expressions. Her performance should be a silent movie with very little description. I think only John Mills in Ryan's daughter has fewer words and he plays a mentally retarded person. <br /> <br /> Muni doesn't always appreciate that she supports her in male culture. Big Rainer helped the bear field and raise children to do housework. When Muni was a wealthy man, he won the second wife of China, which made him very sad. Also, Muni is not a bad person and is praising his movies and performances and the writing of bugs that you don't hate him and the cultural gap is interconnected. <br /> <br /> We have a group of Eastern players that Doing more than kung fu movies, I'm surprised. The Good Earth of all movies has not been rearranged now. I can bet that the Chinese government will let some American companies do it in real places. <br /> <br /> Previously, we had this great class to admire and enjoy.
