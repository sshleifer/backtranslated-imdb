Have you heard stories about unwilling heroes hired by the king to kill dragons? Oh, do you have it set in a world full of small islands floating above the clouds and heroes need to make dangerous jumps from one island to another in their journey? Does the water flow up and be left in the big cities floating on the horizon? I don't think so. <br /> <br /> I stumbled upon this movie accidentally and I'm so glad I did! Is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen Like the Pixar movie, it is a computer art that can be possible in today's world. The animators used the idea in almost everything that appeared on the screen and this attention to detail caused confusion. (The scene in which the mushrooms in the foreground sprayed green smoke while the characters walked back is one of the favorites.) These monsters are also fully aware and wonderful to watch. <br /> <br /> Although The story may not be entirely unique. But the movie is charming enough to make sure you continue to watch. Our protagonists are interesting and interesting, ensuring that the audience is behind the mission that is almost impossible to reach the end of the world and destroy the dragon which may destroy everything in its path. Of course, Hector is a character that most people fall in love with. A small blue creature with a crazy smile and a tendency to talk about nonsense and English. Hector is funny as Jar Jar Binks can only dream. <br /> <br /> In summary, I would suggest watching The Dragon Hunters if you have a chance. Watch breathtaking animations, breathtaking battle scenes and see a world unlike anything you've seen on a movie or television screen. At the very least, it's a fun way to spend one and a half hours, whether you're nine or twenty-nine. (Which in fact I am a person)!
