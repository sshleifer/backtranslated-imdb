Are we doing 'video nasties' again? In the guise of creating a large budget digital wide screen 8 mm, it is quite riding. Unfortunately there are too many stories, and sometimes it becomes like a travel book because our heroine searches for the horrific spots of Paris, Hamburg and Amsterdam. However, I am quite vile in the scene. 'Unkindness' includes everything from hot waxing, whipping and rough sex to drowning, cutting heads and parts. These scenes are flawless and unfortunately Bruno and his budget cannot be stretched out to make many of the characters that are presented to be more than caricatures
