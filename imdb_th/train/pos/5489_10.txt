A very good point there: "There are only a few people that are excellent (upstairs). Both are able to access the internet and can communicate with websites that speak English in particular, such as IMDb." Some people may think that the internet is not true. But this view Social media and democracy are at risk: You may be right .. Although there are internet stores in Venezuela, most Chavez supporters won't even rent a computer for half an hour to comment on IMDb. <br /> <br /> Screw you rich elite faschist, right wing, liberal capitalist, intellectual surpressors .. May be your first time using the internet;)
