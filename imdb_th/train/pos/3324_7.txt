Some people specialize in difficult tasks in merging sports with love. In fact, sports and romance go together like oil and water. So in order to successfully combine the two together on the screen ... Well, that's roughly equivalent to the separation of atoms. I never thought it would be possible. I will be the first to say that, in general, I don't like romantic actors ... but I like sports and movies, mostly about sports. This movie is a good combination of these two stories. As a baseball fan, I am grateful for the funny test with Ben Wrightman (Jimmy Falon) who is a crazy Boston Redsox fan. Anyone who knows anything about baseball knows about the curse of Brahma that disturbed Redsox for 86 Years and they know that nuts about baseball are a lot of Redsox fans. The Farrely brothers do a great job of filming that and make it a good joke. This is a very good movie that is attractive for many people.
