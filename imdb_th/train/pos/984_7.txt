I happened to cross the cable "victim" one night while it started and thought "Eh, why not?" I'm glad I gave you the opportunity. <br /> <br /> "The victim" is not perfect. It suffers from unnecessary sudden directions and occasional stupidity. But overall this movie works All elements are in the right direction and they pull out what may be an ugly movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the time I think it's because Jamie Foxx. I don't know who tagged Red. Fox to bring But anyone who makes this movie is a favorite. Believable and amazingly pleasing. Foxx screened through movies as smooth as butter and more fun than hell. You can tell that he is following his instincts and instincts to not let him down. <br /> <br /> Plot while not really important, then tie together very well. Again, they may Slipping without this But it makes things a lot better. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to score low for this. Maybe I'll just catch this movement on the right night or vice versa, but I'll give 7/10. Bravo Mssr Foxx
