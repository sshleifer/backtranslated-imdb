This is a good movie for 99% of the time. I feel that the ending has blocked this film from higher acclaim. <br /> <br /> It was filmed in a rather innocent manner. This is a clear action to create a more cool feeling for the movie - the loneliness will appear shortly because of this filming technique. <br /> <br /> The scary character acts well. That Joe, however, a good character (usually) is too pathetic for my liking - they should find it pathetic, but this is a little OTT The innocent camera, dab the movie 'B' to begin with) and usually you will feel the brutality that is about to happen. This is one of the most 'twisted' movies about violent violence. <br /> <br /> After an incredible and lazy ending, I was disappointed. I will give this film as 9 if the ending corresponds to the rest of the film. But since it received only 7 stories, the strength of 'Enthusiasm' and the recent biting scene in the movie /> <br /> Let it look and excuse the ending!
