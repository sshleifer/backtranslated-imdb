If you're a fan, you may enjoy this. If you don't know Misty Mundae, Darian Caine, Ruby LaRocca or Seduction Cinema, this is not a movie to start with. It's very cute, silly. Girls are hot and enjoy watching. There is no sexuality until the ending of the movie 45 minutes, but the score is wonderful and the storyline is not boring. The makeup of Misty Mundae is not good in this movie, and her hair is in a clumsy braid so she is not as hot as this when with others. But her underwear in this is very cute (You just have to watch the movie so it doesn't sound strange.) If you do this, you may enjoy "That 70's Girl", "Vampire Vixens" or "Erotic Survivor" (which is a slightly more sexual graphic. ) If you like watching Misty or Esmerelda in a movie that has less sex than before. (But with a small budget), see the Factory 2000 website
