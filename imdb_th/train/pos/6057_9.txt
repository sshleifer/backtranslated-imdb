Of course, because it's a great picture and great sound, it's a great home theater. "Show off" the disk, but this is an impressive drama, as well as informative documentaries. A parallel story that combines this film will make every audience interested. Young children, boys and girls will find deep down. We are all big fans of motor vehicles, especially high-performance machines that result from sweaty blood, tears, intelligence and perseverance. Mark Knopfler and Ry Cooder's audio tracks are perfectly compatible with images and content. I don't want death to end. But the final driving sequence of Quincy Jones, just "These Like Days" may make you tears. Enjoy it!
