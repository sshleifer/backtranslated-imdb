A very unique and straightforward Sci-Fi animation movie. I love being unique, either in any way. It tends to be better or worse. This French film is quite interesting, while the technique is creative like "Waking Life" that I watched recently. <br /> <br /> It took a long time for me to be familiar with the black and white style, but in I love it. The figure is really fancy! The future world that is shrinking is the symbol of the final destination of the human race, which I really like. <br /> <br /> The whole story can be used for sci-fi. Not interesting. A giant conspiracy about human eternity, ancient ideas and unbelievable distorted ends. Some developments are too simple and insipid, and the whole movie is too long. <br /> <br /> So I Think of me 'I love the style that is shown in this movie. Others are not good. <br /> <br /> About eternal life, I think most people come to unanimously that we don't want eternity. Sorry to break it The meaning of life, we value our lives because they are limited and meaningful, if everyone can live forever, therefore the world of the world will become disastrous and chaos. Letting your loved one be difficult and sad But that is a way to show that our lives are genuine and all emotions will fulfill one's life and make the world colorful and lively.
