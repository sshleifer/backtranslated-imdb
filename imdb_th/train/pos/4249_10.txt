Whether they were three men in whitey who had their corset rapped with a friend tied with a rope or a woman said "What happened to the dog?" To a large roadkill The first time I saw I almost laughed myself uncomfortable. And every night after I go home and see again, forget Coyote Ugly ... This is a movie that makes me fascinated Piper Perabo. Watch it ... before it's too late!
