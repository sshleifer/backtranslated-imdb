I found this movie quite suspicious from traveling when Miss Stanwyck began her lecture in a few minutes until you knew that the problem was coming. The deserted area, locked doors, abandoned gas stations, everything is set for you to wait ... Here comes first. You think it's about a little boy, but all this is too early for you to start holding your breath when you see the tide coming in. Found that this movie was really stressful even though I had watched it before Now that movie can make you wonder even when you've seen it before deserving a special ranking, perhaps a white knuckle prize?
