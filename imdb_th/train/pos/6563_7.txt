Jake Speed ​​is a movie that lacks one thing. Charming leader It's a shame that it is all that makes the movie go away and is embarrassing because it is a fun action movie that has enough and interesting scripts. Although the origin may return to the success of the Indiana Jones trilogy? This movie plays like a little 'Romancing the Stone'. It is not a writer of romantic adventure novels that bring adventure by characters as much as one of her creations. It is a character in an adventure novel. (Happened in the history of his own adventures) Bring an ordinary woman to his adventure. <br /> <br /> When a young woman disappears in Paris, her sister Margaret. (Played by the attractive Karin Copins) has been voiced by Jake Speed ​​(Wayne Crawford) and the best friend of Dennis. Is a true and very flawed person in an adventure that led them into the heart of a torn civil war in the African state and eventually into the hands of two brothers, Sid. (John Hert) The evil evil Is that the story? It's not a maze and not complicated. But the story doesn't have to be very deep. <br /> <br /> The action sequence is interesting to start with, and of course it is true that the trio of the three heroes walked through (regardless of Will be stuck in a fight between the government and the rebel forces, or being dropped into a lion-filled pit) and of course there are some funny lines However, the movie seems to be struggling to find an end, and unfortunately, the action scenes are quite interesting to start with, to hang around and eventually become polite and boring. However, this may not be a problem if it is possible to like Jake Speed, but because of Wayne Crawford's performance, it's hard to pay attention to what happens. Now I don't know if he stretched himself out a bit, because he is a producer and writer of the movie, or is he not just a good actor? (Because I've never seen him before), but he's never really comforted. It's a formidable mix of Doc Savage, Indiana Jones and Jack Colton. <br /> <br /> This is a shame because of the other characters. The big role is good. Karen Kopins is funny and trustworthy and her character speaks joke with Jake (unfortunately it never lulls). Dennis Christopher is perfect, like a close friend and screen. John Hert played the role with Pae Camp. Enjoy statistics? As if he were in the age of sixty of Batman He stepped forward about a few scenes in which he was voiced with a ridiculous chicken accent, making the performance almost the same. Sid is not Mori Arty. (He was presented as Jake's nemesis as an adventure / his previous book) but he always enjoyed watching. <br /> <br /> Jake Speed ​​tried to create Night of the Comet 'fun (movie produced by Crawford a few years ago) and almost succeeded but missed? Which is embarrassing because Jake should watch for a few more adventures and may receive better service from the TV series. <br /> <br /> I would like to introduce this thing with desire. Want to know Taste because most of the elements are there to do truly good things.
