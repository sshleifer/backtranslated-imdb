First of all, don't call it a remake of the movie '63, although this version is more realistic than playing on stage. But it is very long The casting has some exceptions. Chyna Phillips is not a good selection of actresses. She is almost 30 when she made this movie and it's hard to believe that she is a teenager. Jason Alexander is a good choice. But not long after that he had a headache with me. Tyne Daly performed her duties as a mother. Peterson George Wendt was a funny person like Harry McAffee and showed that he was able to customize. Like the movie '63, they do not know how to play Conrad Birdie. Marc Kudisch enjoys his role as a birdie and it shows I have a soundtrack and I like to listen to his singing. So what makes this television rating fail? One long They put on new songs and scenes, although some new songs are good (like "Let's Settle"), but is it really necessary? Now don't understand me wrong, I like it. But I like to watch the movie '63 (see my opinion). This is just the case of some actors who have too many roles being changed and again LENGTH. Another thing I forgot to mention is Vanessa Williams. She works well with The role and music of any of her lyrics and she can sing them So here are my suggestions from people who made the production of Bye Bye Birdie: If you want to watch entertainment from the drama. If you want to see the version that is easier to play, see version '95. Just use it in moderation. Don't be a hero and try to see it all in one place.
