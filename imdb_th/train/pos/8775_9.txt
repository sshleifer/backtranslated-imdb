The great effort of Warner Bros starring Errol Flynn in one of his best screen performances. It is often claimed to be his best, and I can't fully judge until I see his "Dawn Patrol". "They died with boots." It took time. I am a big fan of Flynn. (He is my favorite actor after James Mason - it helps him to be an Aussie too) and I think he's a wonderful, wonderful screen performance and an excellent actor. He is the core of "Gentleman Jim" as a legendary fighter with fancy footage But he is also supported by a script that knows well and funny and the direction of Raul Walsh The movie Walsh, all the stories I've seen, never lost the rhythm of it. He is a true filmmaker. Walsh directed the ring ring beautifully as he did with the lightest moments and the ultimate final scene between Ward Bard and Flynn. Add excellent production value ("Ninety Gay" never looks better than this!) And the supporting actors are lovely and it is a very perfect entertainment. Alan Hale often plays Flynn's best friend. But this is his father, and it still works. Alexis Smith is Flynn's love interest. Both of them fall in love with each other.
