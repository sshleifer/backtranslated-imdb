I love this movie when I was young. Today, 17 years is one of my favorite animated movies of all time. Beautiful animations and attractive characters are just two things that I like about this movie. Although many people may not enjoy some songs But most do well and match the story It focuses on Charlie, Shepard, an insulting and handsome German man who may look like no other at first ... but will eventually win you more. <br /> <br /> Not a small movie but often. Very dark and sometimes scary for Don Bluth fans and animation lovers But will make the tissues useful. ADGTH never fails to make me cry and will do the same for those who are sensitive to movies. Is one of the greatest non-Disney animated movies of all time, along with Watership Down and My Neighbor Totoro. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Heaven's masterpiece
