This movie shocked you. The debut film from Tom Barman (better known by Belgian rock band dEUS) introduces you to 8 interesting people. They survive one day and one night in Antwerp's Metropole. Barten draws his character with vitality and blends each person's story together. A power tour that reminds Robert Altman's best work and Paul Thomas Anderson. The patchwork of surprising anecdotes. Fun move; The conversation is very natural. Great performances from Matthias Schoenaerts, Natali Broods and the most comical duo from Ghent, Jonas Boel and Titus De Voogdt. Sam Louwyck is a memorable "Windman" who is a strange guy dancing throughout the movie Sam is also responsible for the amazing choreography, and of course, Tom Barman himself takes special care of the soundtrack. We were extremely impressed: whether the Wind Blows is a movie that makes you feel sick.
