This movie has everything. It is a classic picture of the events surrounding the evacuation of thousands of Cuban refugees. Antonio Montana (Played by Al Pacino) is just one of the thousands who have been given the opportunity to choose his destiny in America. The most accurate film description of Miamis' Drug Empire is amazing. Brian DePalma works astonishingly, directing this image so much that the audience is involved in both the story and every character in the show. With pressure from Tony's character, making it believable and very strong, Brian Depp talks about the talent revealed by Steven Bauer. (Tony's best friend, Manny) Mary Elizabeth Masatononi Firmer (Elvira, Frank's wife) I enjoy watching this movie every minute and still look as Weekly This year, the 20th anniversary of the classic crime movie, I am one of the true believers who, over the next 20 years, will still refer to this amazing number of movies. With other amazing crime movies, I found this movie to be a shocking thing to the system.
