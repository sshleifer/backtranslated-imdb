Bromwell High is a funny cartoon. It ran along with other programs about school life, such as "Master". 35 years in my teaching career, I believe that the words of Bromwell High are closer to reality than "teachers". Finance students with a flair that can be seen through the pomp of their pathetic teachers. When I saw when the students tried to burn the school many times, I immediately remembered that ......... at the time .......... was high. Classic: Inspector: I was at This is to expel one of your teachers. Students: Welcome to Bromwell High. I expect many adults in my age to think that Bromwell High is beyond reach. It's really a shame!
