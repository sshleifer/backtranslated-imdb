We threw the word "superstar" too lightly today. But this is a man who really deserves it. <br /> <br /> I'm stuck with all these scenes. The selection of the song is perfect - there are only songs that I want to listen to and edited with documentary images during the weaker new songs. I love that the band is only five people on stage in a very simple environment. (With this strong song, you don't need to have a circus for entertainment) <br /> <br /> The image of the crowd is amazing as well. How many actors can affect the Beatles fans (now in the age of 50 years)? Take the young children jump up to the openings <br /> while watching me. Realized that after the dreadful death of John Lennon, Paul McCartney became the person who later thought Paul not only But lost John and George (Regardless of their last relationship, it will be difficult to lose the person you changed the world) but he lost his wife Linda. I agree that Lennon's murder is scary. But now I know that Paul has been forgotten in the past. I am very happy that he found love again in Heather. <br /> <br /> For those who complain about the audio / video quality I don't have. Any complaints both clear in my dress I think these people will complain about the quality of the DVD when the next format comes out. <br /> <br /> The only thing I regret is not buying tickets for this show when I have a chance. Thank you for this video that I can enjoy. <br /> <br /> When people remember John Lennon, they will remember his murder first and then sing his song. Now I have a new gratitude for Paul McCartney because if there is nothing he will be remembered for his music first. And hope that other crazy people will not change this because the McCartney catalog is quite good.
