Sometimes I watch movies and really appreciate it ?? And it's not easy to explain why I like it so much Is this true for non-ordinary movies? One person can hardly compare with the rest out there. Goodnight Mister Tom is one of these special movies. There are many emotions in this film ?? And the performance was very good while watching movies. I cried and laughed as the story continued. Nick Robinson, young Was a young boy (William) emigrated from London due to an air attack during World War II Mr Tom, played by John Taw, is an old man who left the village where the children were evacuated. <br /> <br /> At first, Tom refused to take any responsibility - such as caring for young children. Got a problem here? But accepted because he was left without choice During the stay, Mr. Tom discovers how bad William's life is. Beside his bag, his mother sent a belt and written instructions to the host of her son? Do not hesitate to use it Is this belt in the field? Never been used in a cruel manner Mr. Tom provides the true home for William and the boys, enjoying his new life. He goes to school, finds new friends and discovers hidden talents. Suddenly, all of William's letters were called home in London, with a letter saying that she felt sick and it started again. Only this time it is much worse? There are many feelings you can experience in this movie ?? Love, fear, sadness, happiness, pain, hope ?? And many more. Goodnight, Mr Tom, is another masterpiece of British cinema that is comparable to others like Dear Frankie and Billy Elliot. I really enjoyed watching and highly recommended. Before completing this review I would like to talk about the great performance of Thomas Orange in the role of Zac ?? Remind me of my friends since my childhood (:
