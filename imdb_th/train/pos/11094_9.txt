This movie that is slippery and has sand delivered continuously. It is one of the best and most inferior movies of Frankenheimer And is the easiest thing that Elmore Leonard will adapt to the era (And if you are thinking of your head "But I love GET SHORTY" You have to press the face) In my opinion, no one captures "feelings" for Leonard's character. In PICK-UP 52, the relocation of the story from Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) elevates the factors that make this story amazingly high. As a man with a little beer and watching this movie For reference purposes, my favorite Leonard books are: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval and Pick-Up 52, Frankenheimer Films. My favorite places include SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I also have a special place in the cold heart of DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday.
