HUSBANDS BEWARE is a remake of the classic BREMELESS GROOM of Shemp. The new cooking scene of the film at the beginning of this film is very good. Stooges are often funny when cooking. However, after the first few minutes of the cooking video, we cut the original image of BRIDELESS GROOM. One thing I noticed about the rebuilding in 1953 to 1956 was that they were suitable for new stories. They insert the picture if the old story line doesn't match. <br /> <br /> HUSBANDS BEWARE has a new end, but I won't give it to someone who wants to surprise.> <br /> **** from 4 stars
