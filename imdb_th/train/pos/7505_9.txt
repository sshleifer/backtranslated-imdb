If there is one type that I've never been a fan of, it's a biography. Misleading, filled with false information, over-scene and trickery. Every round, biopics are almost inaccurate. Even in the hands of truly talented directors such as Martin Scorsese (The Aviator) and Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind), they often damage the people they are trying to capture on the screen. Skeptiscism arises because most hype of biopics that make them go to the big screen and the notorious Betty web page is no different. Some critics and moviegoers oppose Gretchen Mol as Bettie Page, saying that she is no longer a celebrity and does not participate in the hack. I never doubt that Mol will be able to handle this part. But I never expected that she would be blown away by her performance, just as I had watched the movie several hours before. Mol presented Oscar's amazing work as a famous young woman in the 1950s. Childhood (Describing the subtlety and tastefulness a few directors may do) unintentionally. The picture covers a lot of ground in 90 minutes of use, although there are no less than three subplots. There may be some missing parts from the story. Author / co-writer Marry Harron and Guinevere Turner of the wonderful script are just too sudden and unclear as they should end. Still have to give credit to two women for creating an almost impeccable biography that will pay tribute to both the story and the decades that it imitates Came the time Oscar, Mol, Turner and Harron should be nominated It will certainly happen even though there are no three women who deserve more. 9/10
