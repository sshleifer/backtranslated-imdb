Not the most successful television program of John Cleese, who used to do "Strange Case". Feeling the first draft that was rushed into production before any changes were made And even some wise things But the whole story is a pity that didn't add much. <br /> <br /> Arthur Lowe is a hooter. Bits and all "The Good Lady"
