I have never watched 'Next Action Hero' and until I read other comments here, I do not know that this movie is a 'prize' from that competition. I just flipped the box and found this and found myself brave and brave. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is finished. (The most dangerous game, etc.) But I hope and almost get it 'gotcha' - How can the protagonist defeat the hunter in the end? I think the technology is too advanced (GPS) and makes me cold when the rider returns. But it's not too much. <br /> <br /> The basic problem I have with this movie is the level of SOD (suspension of disbelief) that the audience wants. Do we really think that there are people flying with helicopters capable of bombing countless insurgents at the public bridge? Limousine can make countless donuts in the Las Vegas intersection and no options appear? Pleeease, too many methods of that kind - enjoy watching, but give at least reason. Thank you. <br /> <br /> The final solution is good. But the ending was disappointing when Star Trek was bad <br /> <br /> surprised me
