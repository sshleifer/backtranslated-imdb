The proud father is surprising: it is a witty joke and has a great voice acting. This list is about the Lion family that serves as a tourist attraction of Siegfried & Roy. Of course, they are all a plan. But that is what makes them funny. FOTP is not a small cartoon. It has rude adult humor. But very gentle It is full of cultural references and famous celebrities and most of them will perform well. I will say that I will give the show 7 in ten because it is quite good to perform. But not very original, I've seen most of those patterns many times before, even in a specific order!
