I think this is a wonderful movie, sweet theme song! :) However, the only thing that makes me quite annoyed is the first when everything should be normal. It's very strange and unrealistic. Most large cable companies are what I'm talking about. In addition, the movie is also very creative. I think all the performances are good. The actors show the character of the character perfectly. Everything fits together. It's a shame that they are not a soundtrack. That would be great! Because this is a Canadian movie and because it is one of my favorites, I gave this movie 10 out of 10!
