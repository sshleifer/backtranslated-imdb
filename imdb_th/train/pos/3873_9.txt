This movie is light, funny and beautifully filmed. The lightning is great and the color reminds Vermeer's drawings. <br /> <br /> This is the best comedy in the North, USA and France standards, and the content is better than English. <Br /> <br /> All the characters touch and interpret as close to perfection as Isabelle Blais. Excellent Sylvie Moreau is better in the Catherine Stéphane Gagnon series. Charming Emmanuel Bilodeau is fantastic in his strange role and Genev. iève Laroche is the perfect best friend. <br /> <br /> Going for hours before finding any negative comments on this movie, so give a chance and add your own opinion.
