This documentary aired both RTE and BBC over the past several months. When seeing it twice, I would like to recommend to everyone who is interested in the media and the creation of a documentary. At first, this documentary is intended to provide details about the political life of President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela The Irish crew began to travel with those intentions. What will happen when they reach Venezuela are shocking as they see the first attempt to overthrow the rebels? (Especially oil in Venezuela) of Chavez and his government What we witness to the audience is just a way in which the media manipulates the situation and results in the overthrow of Chavez by distorting the events that occurred when the coup is rising. And is an amazing piece of Worked by a few filmmakers. <br /> <br />
