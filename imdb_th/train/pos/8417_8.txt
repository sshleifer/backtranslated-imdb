While the style of the film is not as simple and realistic as the sound version is likely to be But this is a very good movie In fact, it was seen as a great movie that day because it was nominated for the first Best Film (WINGS). I still think WINGS will be a great movie. But this movie is excellent, even though Emil Jannings is a leader. <br /> <br /> Jannings is a general from the Russian Czarist who is still alive. Made a few dollars in the 1920s by increasing revenues from Hollywood His luck changed when he was given a decisive role to play against the communist struggle of the Russian Empire in general during the revolution. But it makes the old man miss the old days and revolutions. <br /> <br /> Of course, what will happen next, I'll leave, but it's a good movie, especially at the end. By looking for William Powell as Russian director Even though it was created in 1928 with makeup, he didn't look as young as ever in many of his later films.
