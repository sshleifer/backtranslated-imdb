Don't waste time reading my review. Go out and watch amazingly good episodes that may be the best Columbo ever written! Mrs. Ruth Gordon is a charming puzzle writer. But with the charm that murdered her son-in-law to avenge her daughter's murder Has been written by the creator of Levinson or the link But may be the most dense and original plot Most satisfied with almost every department and full of dialogue and brilliant ideas Unexpected climax and true invention above all. 10/10 ... Find this on Netflix!
