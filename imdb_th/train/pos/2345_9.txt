I'm happy with the first episode and I hope to get more. Slightly soft in front of the crime (It was almost later and not anxious or drained out) but thought that the romantic angle was wonderfully charming. Will definitely watch again! <br /> <br /> I hope that they will have a bigger role for the aunt who is a great actress and was used this time quite a bit. Actors who play as assistants / waiters (such as from Bewitched, I think) are very cute and cheerful and come out beautifully and cute instead of being stupid and annoying, which is great try
