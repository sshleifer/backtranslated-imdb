Like a group of people at school, we have to give a thumbs up. Even Grim Ripper makes us smile. These two strange things make me laugh. Bill and Ted is the most stupid person. But it's the most funny in all movies This is much better than the first one. And for some reason I felt that it was missing something Some great things, important things, building a house and a better girlfriend. No, I can say better than the villain. Use clones instead of robots When he fell from the sky, I separated Splat filling. I'm not sure about those aliens. Where are they scientist? No way.
