I want to increase compliments for the production of this film, especially the luminous movie shooting. Firelight emits shine from smooth skin and muscle, creating a stunningly beautiful image. The film was nominated for an Academy Award (and won). The first film to be edited, Mala's performance was exciting, exciting and powerful.
