I was very surprised that I liked this movie a lot. Witty writing (funny "inside" that I get some things I can't do - probably because the actors say) Great performances (Especially John Cassini) the great pendant I rented it to see Jeffrey Meek (very disappointed. He's in there for a short time, blinking and you'll miss him!) But found this movie to be remarkably fun. I will watch again before sending back to Netflix. I think the actors and would like to be actors will enjoy this movie thoroughly. The ending is quite expected. But hope that they will do different things (And more positive) Unfortunately, the film did not receive a good response, except in the "festival" market. I advise everyone who loves the show business.
