Do you know that Star Trek fans flock to watch all Star Trek movies, even if they are really bad people? why? If you want to see their heroes in action again That's the way I feel about Doc Savage. I am a big fan for the character and the opportunity to see the doctor and his crew on the adventure is overwhelming and during the first 20 minutes of the film, the feeling of anticipation. Hope higher Then they decided to strip off the doctor's adventures and throw it into the film, causing the film to be disjointed. There are many promises here, diluted with unfortunate options. (Music, composition, "camp", etc.) But the spirit of the doctor was there and that's what we were familiar with. The doctor and his crew responded. So in my protracted way, what I tried to say was that This is not a bad movie: it's not as good as it should be. And everyone who is a big fan of Superman, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Buckaroo Banzai and many other characters should check out this movie to familiarize themselves with the heroes that inspired them.
