The most obvious freedom with the facts I thought was when they started playing at Bruno Koschmidder's Kaiserkeller. When they actually played at Indra and later moved to Kaiserkeller, <br /> <br /> I agree with Semprinni20 that this movie Leaning on the Pete Best version, but if he was a consultant, I guess he would call I also agree with Semprinni that the recording of Pete Best plays when speaking the last word about why he was fired. <br /> <br /> Although this film is not produced as lavishly as in the next movie, " Backbeat "I like this movie more because it is more accurate and because it has better chapters and deeper characteristics. <br /> <br /> There are many movies that are quite substantial - such as Brian Epstein trying to hide the truth. That he had been "freaking bash" only to find that the band knew he was gay forever A little touch, just like the band that entered the cafe and ordered "Corn-Flakes mit Milch". My favorite scene with some bass in truth is that Stuart Sutcliffe audition recently bought his bass guitar. But can't play, so he stood behind the song and tried to pretend but was caught. That is rock and roll. <br /> <br /> Worth watching
