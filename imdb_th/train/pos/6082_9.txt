I had fun with Shakespeare, the classic version of Kenneth Branagh while he worked very well. But in this film, the person who raised both of this film is none other than Laurence Fishburne. Of course, he has a bad choice in the movie, even though he is a great actor But this time, we get the real Otello: Passion, the intensity of jealousy. We finally received the black Othello! <br /> <br /> I don't think they will choose Othello better. There are others who will make him sympathetic / hate, love / hate and not forget hot eyes. These strength ...? Branagh, as always, but not at his peak. Ir√©ne Jacob's Desdemona is quite good. But quite bleak, while Laurence Fishburne literally raised it and made it a very interesting and entertaining movie. Watch it.
