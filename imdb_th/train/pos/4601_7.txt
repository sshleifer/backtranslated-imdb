Police Story is an amazing set of pieces for Jackie Chan to show his unique talent and courage. Performing Jackie's best and most dangerous stunt scenes in the shopping mall scene is probably Jackie's greatest single fight scene, less cruel and funny, then says Project A. Or Drunken Master Impact <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the rest of the film doesn't depend on this quality because it's a rather copic thriller, a formula with funny elements. Some things I tend to like JC in movies such as Project A, where his cartoon abilities shine. In the serious extent of some elements of the Police Story, it doesn't work for me. Having said that, even though he was still there with Jackies' best movies due to amazing performances and performances, <br /> <br /> As usual with Hong Kong movies, avoid DVD versions dubbed in English. br /> <br /> Great movie stunts. OK is a good starting point if you have never seen JC movies before and worth watching for movie fans. 7/10
