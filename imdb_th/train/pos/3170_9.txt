Adam Jones, writer / director / co-head for good things That was the idea I had after watching his feature film "Cross Eyed". Independent movies didn't make me feel good like him. Cleverly written and mastered "Cross Eyed" allows you to participate from beginning to end. Adam Jones may not be a well-known name, but he will be if this film has "An actor with a name" One or two people, it would be a box office feeling. I think it also has the opportunity to see mainstream audiences if only one movie distributor needs time to work on the movie. No matter where you are, if you have the opportunity to see, you will not be disappointed.
