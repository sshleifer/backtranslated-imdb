There is a very clever sense of humor in this film, which is both a parody and a praise for the actors. However, after a while, there seems to be a stylish exercise. (Although there are great gags, such as Balasko that is still part of Dussolier and very good performances by all involved), all were revealed at the end when Blier directed Claude Brasseur to receive a call from his father (Bernard Blier) - From heaven and given the opportunity to say how much he misses him. An effective and compassionate emotional capper. But there is not enough tension or emotional involvement to make the rest of this film interesting all the time However, really good scenes and sequences and anyone who likes 'mosntres sacr√©s' of French movies should be entertained by this movie.
