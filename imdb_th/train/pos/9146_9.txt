This exciting musical drama is more than an emissary, a genius, a musician, a prince. This film takes about 90 minutes to rest, but actually it's easy to see why it's a classic cult. <br /> <br /> Like other movies that focus on young musicians. Trying to make a big deal There is a hint of the drama in it to add dimension to the musical numbers. While this movie is not as good as 8 miles, as in the recent example, but it does not reduce entertainment and the soundtrack is much better. In an amazing aspect of stories, stories around children (princes), young artists and normal points at the club. The club owner was disappointed with Kid's arrogance and Kid knew he might be fired and replaced by his opponent soon. One side that the parents of the children are having problems with their father, use her severely. During this film, Kid learned a few lessons in life and learned to appreciate his friends more. Of course, it is everything we see in the drama of age. But it was combined in a musical drama that is a unique style. <br /> <br /> The actor is really good. The prince is quite good in the drama when he doesn't make it stand out. He looks like a human and is related. Clarence Williams is very good, like a bad father. Appollonia Kotero was first launched as a sexy prince. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this film is the top soundtrack. visit Music numbers are well organized and use electric power. The prince has no doubt become a talented musician. When he was inspired, he was excellent. But on the other hand, he often makes songs that are But only his own taste, and sometimes his experiment could cause a fire But that's the same for many musical geniuses. The soundtrack of this movie is excellent, but only the weakest Sexshooter Purple Rain's stopping performance is excellent. It's one of my favorite songs forever. *** <br /> <br />
