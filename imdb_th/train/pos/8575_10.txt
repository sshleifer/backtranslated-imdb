This is a movie that I can watch over and over again and never get bored. There are many stories that laugh, gun, crime action, one great torpedo and a good plot. Top Donald Sutherland in a rather funny role as Assasain. Tia Carerra looks as hot as he did and can do his job as well. Thomas Ian Griffin is great in this role as the lead character of "Max". DEA representative Diane is the FBI agent. TV plays the bad guy "Livingston" The plot centered around trying to catch Max and Diane Livingston as they fight and argue over who gets the money from the agency that threw Assassain Sutherland is a good mix of torpedoes. The perfect crime has a normal love story. But playing differently than you think by Carerra and Griffith. You also have Russian mafia, Italian mafia and Chinese mafia. Here are thrown into the mix, this film was filmed in Boston, where you have a great shot, And local people, excellent photography and music in this movie Is just a good example of crime crime But it has everything we need Examined Sutherland's bathroom in some scenes which were very unusual. This movie is a riot and will make you laugh hard 10 plus with me.
