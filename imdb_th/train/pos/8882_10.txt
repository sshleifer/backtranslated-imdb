The best movie of John Singleton before the blockbuster movie, like the movie remake of Shaft. This movie is a thought-provoking film with excellent performances and an excellent balance between the three main characters. The problem with the youngster <br /> <br /> Like most, it also covers the problem of selfishness among young black people. Users are ignored by the media and other films that focus on social issues and racism by whites. This film shows that black people are able to know each other and be racist. <br /> <br /> The thing that specializes in this film is that it involves a lot of topics without being shallow. It is not just a matter of racism. But it is difficult to apply to the new world (college), rape, dating, sexual discovery and loneliness. Omar Epps, Michael Rapaport and Kristy Swanson each have great performances, and supporting actors are interesting enough. Together with Jennifer Connelly as lez (yay) and Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes as bums. The college causes riots. <br /> <br /> The only downside is the parody of the professor by Laurence Fishburne ("Peppermint?" ) Of course, many teachers are crazy. But they are not flat Skinheads are like caricatures. But I think it's the same in real life. <br /> <br /> Combining a masterpiece that gets a good rating. If you like American History X, you have to like this person. <br /> <br /> 8,5 out of 10
