"Tarzan and his partner", MGM's second Tarzan image, received one year after the event. "Tarzan's ape man" Tarzan and Jane live happily in the forest and Harry Holt. (One of the explorers in the first movie) came back, this time with Martin Arlington, who had less honor in seeking ivory from the elephant tomb. By nature, various and exciting adventures have taken place. <br /> <br /> The first movie, romantic, everything, whether it be wild, adventure, romance, wildlife and even death. The second movie still has many romantic and action scenes. The characters dare to ask questions such as: What happens if Tarzan happens? What would Jane do if she was stuck in the middle of the forest and had to take care of herself? Although these may be questions that people will ask in this situation But creating a lot of unregulated chaos that has ever been in the same attitude of throwing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the most fun aspects of the movie. This is the growth we see in the relationship of Tarzan and Jane. Tarzan still doesn't speak English well. But he clearly learned new words from his friends In addition, the love for each other has increased dramatically and we feel that they spend time together in the forest for one year. <br /> <br /> Most people think that "Tarzan and his partner" are superior to the original "Tarzan Ape Man". Personally, I like the first movie a little better. The main reason is that the relationship between Harry Holt and Martin Arlington is not as good as Holt's relationship with James Parker (Jane's father). In the original, the character Mr. Arlington may act as a villain in the movie. But he plays the role of a hero in this film too The movie can't decide if we should like him or hate him. (Also, I don't want anything. But in one of the scenes that we should hate him clearly, Jane never knew about those events, so the ending was not as satisfying as it should be). <br /> <br /> Like the first movie, "Tarzan and His Mate" has amazing action scenes, wonderful wildlife pictures and one of the screens of The greatest love of all time If you like the first movie in this series, it is a sequel to see.
