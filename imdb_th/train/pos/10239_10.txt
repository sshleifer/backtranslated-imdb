I disagree with anyone who doesn't like this movie. <br /> <br /> I used to love this movie when I was young and I still do it. It's sweet, funny and warm your heart. And it proves that love and friendship are never destroyed. <br /> <br /> And even though it doesn't have a lot of stories But it was still great that I gave 10 and two thumbs up. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, it proves that your deepest wishes and dreams are true (tearing your tears). <Br / > <br /> I love this movie. Personally, if anyone says it sucks than I say, "Shame on you" because it's a small movie that's delightful and I'm glad that at least some people like it.
