I finally sat down and saw this movie all the way and I had to say that I was very impressed. Michelle Rodriguez seems to be one of the new female actors that I like, not just the fact that she can do *, but she chooses the most suitable role for her that is meaningful and important than what seems to be first time I have read some comments that show their relief that this is not a frightening feminist claim that they thought before. But I definitely disagree Diana is a feminist She follows her dreams and believes in herself that what everyone around you thinks. (Except for a little brother who cares about her and her coach and manager Hector, who proves to be a father more than a true parent). The word "feminism" is about It is good to watch movies like this, showing the true side of feminism - they are not losers - but they have dreams and can do anything. Diana is true to herself while still being a victim of love, and she and Adrian have a more realistic and complex relationship than the amazing things Girlfight is the true taste of reality and it makes faith. Something returned to my perception of people. Thank you Michelle. <br /> <br /> 8/10 - A very important movie that isn't about a girl. But everyone wants to go far in life
