Is this the future that awaits us? The wilderness area that exceeds the unexpected with an evil existence and does not want? This movie reminds us of a problem that is still a problem with us. Therefore, since the film was released in 1973, we hope that the world will not end like this ... <br /> <br /> Soylent is green. Wide, which I like very much. It has popular characters, semi-apocalyptic settings, engaging and thought-provoking stories, and men, men, men who like men there: Charleton Heston Richard Fleischer makes this film. None feel unwanted and very dirty. You are almost choked by the stench from the city and the dirty people. <br /> <br /> The great character Charleton Heston, who became one of my favorite actors, IS Thorn. This man created the role of Badass. But is a cute person I can definitely put myself in Thorn's shoes. He saw that something was wrong. But everyone around him doesn't listen (Like paying, not having to listen to) or wanting him to die. Edward G. Robinson (in his last film, Capt.) Plays the lovely old Sol who has enough of this nasty place. Everyone is excellent, especially Leigh Taylor-Young as Shirl. The piece of "furniture" that comes with the apartment she lives in. <br /> <br /> Great special techniques, even in the year 1973 The apartment factory of the future and especially the "scoops" (bulldozer that eliminates people) is excellent. The polluted air outside is very disgusting and disgusting. The empty city streets filled with insolent people. <br /> <br /> One last message is the ending, which is still still shocking. It's scary, but if you think about it. It's a good idea. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: <br /> <br /> Great 70s science fiction flick that makes you think and leave you. Feeling very uneasy
