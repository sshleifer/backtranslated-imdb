From the perspective of NAS Carmania, like this movie, it's interesting. You can see a lot of racing cars from 1983, even though the race scenes are very realistic. But I have to admit that I have never seen any competition before 1995, because before that they did not show the NASCAR race in Germany. <br /> <br /> From the perspective of the fans of Burt Reynolds I am a movie that we have seen from Reynolds in the 80s: Burt is behind the wheel of a car like his bandit movie. <br /> <br /> If you love NASCAR and Burt Reynolds, this movie will have to see. If you love one of these two things, I suggest watching it too. If you don't like NASCAR and Burt Reynolds, you should give a chance. But remember that this movie is far from winning the Oscar Award. <br /> <br /> It's a general joke. If you like movies like Cannonball Movies and Police Academy, you'll like it.
