Zane and Beringer will take care of you all the time. Usually I will not go to see military movies / war, but it's worth my time. <br /> <br /> It's serious, but it's funny. Beringer's character proved to be a hero and honest. No matter what, you know that he has been back. <br /> <br /> Zane's characters developed throughout the story. He is not just a suit, he can certainly prove that he can be a hero and deal with guns. <br /> <br /> My little ending. It doesn't go with action throughout the story. But I'm glad I saw it. However, <br /> <br /> It's worth checking out.
