This is a beautiful, rich and well-published film with a story full of meaning. Basically, it will tell how the old storyteller wanted to find the heir (male) to continue his craft. But finally did not receive what he expected in a world dominated by men The characters must deal with their situation and the old boss must fight the conflict between his wishes with friends and heirs and the original ideas of society. <br /> <br /> The story is fun, emotion and complexity. Exploring the characters, their lives and emotions are rich and interesting in character development, while the characters are complex and not one-dimensional. The film conveyed the feelings of the old man and his desire to search for heirs and demonstrated clearly how he and the children dealt with the situation. There are also sometimes quite subtle humor in the right spot. The film also examines the goodness and badness of traditional Chinese culture, creating interest and depth towards the film. <br /> <br /> The director and the scenery are all outstanding. In addition to other strengths, this also creates a complete and reliable image, including real and attractive characters. For this reason, the film encourages sympathy and feelings for the characters. <br /> <br /> Some people claim that the ending makes the film weak. But i disagree Perhaps stronger with different endings But any improvement in the overall movie seems to be quite small.
