I watched this movie many times through my child mask, which even today I can see the whole conversation again. And when I watch now, it makes me happy and still laughing astoundingly. I think it's amazing that they can train animals, especially cats, as much as they can play the main role of a documentary film. However, watching it now, I can observe that it's not a masterpiece I've ever thought of. But I like to remember my feelings when I was young. Watch the VHS on my fist TV to make the image yellow. And remember that it is a children's movie that is why I still give it. 10/10
