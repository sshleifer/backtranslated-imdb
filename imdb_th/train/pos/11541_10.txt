Matthau and Lemmon are the best for them in this movie - others in the movie are also great. The conversation was great and very witty - and the scene where the character Lemmon tried to get rid of his sinus in the restaurant, let me roll down on the floor with a laugh every time I saw it. Everyone who happens to see a great sequel should not turn away from the original. I recommend this great movie to everyone - I love it so much, and the fact that Jack Lemmon shows his role honestly with grief added to my thoughts only. These two great people create movies together. But this is the best - no doubt
