I'm really shocked with movies that are over 60 years old that impressed me. It's almost two hours long. There are no stars. There are subtitles. But interesting and exciting What impressed me most was the realism of the movie. You almost feel the cold of ice because you see that the storm is real. This is relief in the CGI-world like our day. I wonder how much this work requires Van Dyke. I read somewhere that it took 17 months to shoot. Who wants to talk about 'Titanic' anymore? It's a great movie with a great message and I would like to suggest that future directors see how great and realistic movies can happen if they are right Directed by realism instead of visual effects
