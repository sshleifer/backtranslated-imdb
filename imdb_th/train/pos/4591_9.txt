It's depressing to see that Jackie Chan has ended. He used to be a hurricane of punches, fists, kicks and unbelievable tactics. To be fair, he is now in the fifties and is expected to slow down somewhat, but with 'Rush Hour 3' where he takes the back seat to Chris Tucker (from everyone!) And then has 'Kung Fu Panda'. That not only will he play a role in singing But his character has almost no dialogue .. to say that Jackie Chan saw a better day is an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> It's time when the only way is to hit the tape. Old dusty VHS and see Jackie kick his ass in his younger, fit, free day. Chris Tucker. <br /> <br /> Enter 'Police Story'. Jackie Chan plays Kar-kui. Police who have the duty to protect witnesses before a major trial He faced resistance from both uncooperative witnesses and a large number of people sent by the crowd to silence them both. <br /> <br /> But in return, who will be interested? We didn't watch Jackie's movie for the story. We watch them to see Jackie Chan showing stunts that are striking and generally punching and kicking a lot of people that are less than excellent. <br /> <br /> And at that level, 'Police Story' wasn't disappointed. A great showdown in the mall at the end, which makes the ultimate in Jackie. Slide the large chandelier with high voltage. Seriously, if these things happen often, no man must persuade them to buy clothes. <br /> <br /> There is also a comedy which is mostly related to Kar-kui, inadvertently losing a month. May (Maggie Cheung), his eternal suffering and apparently had forgiven his girlfriend. The humor in the overall picture is quite smooth. But it works so well, so I don't complain. <br /> <br /> The performance isn't too flimsy as well. In fact, I'm not sure if there's anything profound about 'Police Story' at all. Kook Chan (Yes, he did so) There was a deep understanding of why we watched his movies and knew that while we waited for the next fight to start, the last thing we needed was to look for differences and The depth and meaning within <br /> <br /> So 'Police Story' is an explosion. Just like most of his movies, the fact that Jackie actually does what you see on the screen, makes his head and shoulders above the competition. I mean, when Jackie really hangs from the umbrella with a bus, "Wow!" All new. The factor is added to the action.
