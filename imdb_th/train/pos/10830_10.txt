I enjoy Still Crazy more than any movie I've seen in years. The successful band from the 70s decided to try again. They started by playing gigs in some places in Europe with hilarious results. Music is a great story, great screenplay and performances. The characters are unique, especially the lead singer with heavy metal problems, makeup and personality problems. The concert at the end is not true. Go see it, especially in the cinema with a good sound system :)
