The film was well built in the early 1960s. Communist Yugoslavia The five young actors who are teenagers at the center of the story give strong, sincere and profound emotional performances. A clear picture of how natural confidence and innocence that exists in adolescents can be easily managed and how they affect the rest of their lives. Highly recommended
