Although this film will bring Davis to make a map due to her fierce acting as an unskilled waitress / Mildred Rogers, an illiterate But this movie was not surprisingly satisfying for me as a whole. Performances are good in every area. What I cannot understand for my life is how or why Phillip, a sensitive and sensitive young man, must use the following inappropriate behavior: I found his innocent patience. Yes, I know that he is sensitive to the club. But Davis is an evil witch that no one can raise her attitude or action and make it believable. Davis was an amazing person in her role: Yes, she might go to the boat in her history now and later. But it is an image that is creative and vivid, no matter how you look Unfortunately she didn't play with gangsters. Her character is completely convinced that he is a homeless person among the low people!
