There are many reasons why I rate the soprano highly, one of the biggest victories of being an actor and creating a character. Each character spreads more and more in each series. In addition, each series also has 'Little time character' is different, just like the main character. Good example of character (Which is only three episodes) that you can feel is David Gambler, who plays superbly by Robert Patrick. Every little detail will create the perfect TV series. The show revolves around the leader of the mob group Tony Soprano. (James Gandalfi) who tries to balance the crime of life with his role as the father of two people The act is not afraid to be brave and powerful with dialogue and images and this is what makes it believable. While Tony did things with Capol Polly (Tony Sirico) and Silvio (Steve Van Sant), his nephew, Christopher (Michael imperioli), see promotion Every episode also has Tony's other family as well, including his children and his wife Carmelella Soprano (Edalfo). On top of these problems is his uncle's soprano junior. (Dominic Chiansei) tries to find out what he can do from Tony's business, even under house arrest. All performances are powerful and complex characters. But the two most prominent ones are; James Gandolfini, who is' Tony Soprano Michael Imperio, who plays Christopher, who is a representative of the younger generation of crime (20-30). If David Chase does not create a TV series, this modern masterpiece may not exist, such as The Wire and Dexter, so the soprano is Godfather, Goodfellas and Pulp. The TV novel.
