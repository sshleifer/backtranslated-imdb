This documentary about schlockmeister William Castle took a few cheap photographs in the '50s-60s' innocuous environment in which he made his most outstanding work - see stupid people with ghost glasses - with vivid explanations. Special from John Waters, who is certainly a target group for things at that time, and from Castle's daughter who loves her father and still quite understanding how he painted his craft. (We never knew what had happened to other descendants of Castle) The movie wasn't so good. It's clear. But their marketing is great and he seems to be a cute and diligent family member. People have fun, like Diane Baker's "Jack's jacket" that looks good and Anne Helm, which she transforms from the awakening of Joan Crawford to Darryl Hickman. All but the bomb is a giggle that the memory has. The joy of working with the castle in "The Tingler" and having enough pictures to let us think of the castle's skill level - not very high, but very powerful.
