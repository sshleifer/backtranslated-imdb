This is an important movie. It challenges the audience and encourages you to pay attention. There is so much to do here. It seems that the director is interested in separating the tiring movie conference. Unlike most recent American movies, this film focuses on the meaning of making movies from the beginning. The DVD has a lot of bonus features and there are two comments that describe the movie for viewers who are still confused after the first viewing. When the movie was shown at Sundance, it made the audience members a bit uncomfortable and angry. This is Sunday morning coffee movie, not a Friday night party movie. For a particular audience, it's a treasure.
