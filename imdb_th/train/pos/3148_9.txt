I love this show. The period I didn't look very long, probably only about six months or more. But now it's my favorite item and maybe for a while I love all the characters except I don't care. I'm not sure why I just couldn't find her. Funny. And I don't think Laura Prepon is a very good actor. In addition to her, I found that the rest of the actors were quite good. Kurtwood Smith and Debra Joe Rupp, the parents who sold the products, were very funny. Topher Grace is also a great actor. Unlike many fans, I do not hate the season 8 entirely. I'm still watching and it makes me laugh. But if you compare it to the previous season, it's not good at all. Randy is terrible. The ending is good. There is nothing amazing but good. =] I think it would be better to cancel the show after Ashton and Topher decide to Out, but oh well, I have the fourth season on the DVD and someday I hope to have all eight seasons. Some of the most hilarious episodes in my opinion are 'Dine & Dash', 'Grandmas Dead', 'Red & Stacey' and 'Streaking', but I love every episode I see. =] 9/10 stars I want Will definitely recommend =]
