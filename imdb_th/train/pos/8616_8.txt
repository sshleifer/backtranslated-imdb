What will happen if the soldiers of G.I. from the Japanese army have been sent back in 400 years in the middle of the feudal war that led to the formation of the Tokugawa Shogun? Yes, the movie does exactly what it says in the can. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the author didn't want to explain that in general it was ridiculous in the sci-fi movie Jumbo Science of Transport. Time No way or why They just do However, the order of transportation is quite fast as hell and quite beautiful if not outdated. Not as stupid as anyone would imagine. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie follows the back of T, but while it loses a little steam, along with various subplots that follow the GIs, comes to the Middle Ages of Japan. Picked up with intense fighting sequences. Undoubtedly, it is the main command of the day. The whole concept and by expanding the movie may occur from this simple field: If G.I, along with the latest war in today's era, is fighting with the samurai? And the boys deliver <br /> <br /> The main battle sequences that cover more than half an hour may be one of the best in action / war movies of the 70s. Fatigue in pace and length But is also an excellent form and technique that has unique locations such as G.I. Samurai can deliver I mean, will you have the opportunity to qualify for another complete ninja tank equipped with shuriken, helicopters and samurai in the same match? The GI division led by Lieutenant Iba tears through the hundreds, hundreds of them entering them with mortars. Bombs and tanks <br /> <br /> This erroneous form has one foot firmly embedded in the jidai-Kagemusha epic of Krosusha or Samurai Banners's Hiroshi Inagaki, while the other is in action movies. And movies Lahore war With rhetorical touch (Such as the wonderful slow motion and bloodthirsty violence) that caused Sam Peckinpah or Enzogastarella about Keoma in his mind. Japanese movies were influenced by the West and Hollywood works. Other Hollywood and vice versa, and the GI Samurai transform the melting pot from the east to the west to become an exciting movie. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers must appreciate everything seriously and This film has been very useful. Not that the idea is not speaking But lacking the effort to look at the audience that is not good The budget should be heavy because it is evident in the hundreds of exquisite costumes. (Suitable for non-jidai-geki traditional production) and special techniques Camera work and editing are great, almost better than movies that do not have the artistic ambitions that deserve. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's not without flaws. Of course, there are many "music" scenes that have Japanese rock music, disco and country music in the 70s played (with bondage scenes, love-interest scenes, "war is hell" etc.) The song itself is quite weak and repetitive and deviates from the whole story. Although it was about 140 minutes of whooping cough, it flew like most bullets. There are still some scenes, events and sub-periods in the first half of the year that may be more tightly effected. <br /> <br /> The actors deserve to be mentioned), Tsunehiko Watase (The Yakuza Papers) And Hiroyuki Sanada. They all hit the correct note.
