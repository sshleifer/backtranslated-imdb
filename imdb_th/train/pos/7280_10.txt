Of watching this as a child Although I may find it very scary now. But it was a scary thing because I was only seven years old I still remember working on a puzzle next Saturday while watching, so I didn't care much. However, the scene with rolling stones has been burned in my heart ever since. I asked many people whether they saw this flick or not. 12 years ago, one person said that it was possible that he had seen. But he thought it was just a dream Dreamlike wind It's not my friend's dream. No dream now Again, I haven't seen it since then. But I can't wait to find a copy and that thing into my VCR. Anything that can be embedded in my mind for 23 years deserves '10'.
