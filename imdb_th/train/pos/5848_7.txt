And I'm high 7 ..... <br /> <br /> Why? Because the blood shakes well At a time when there are many OTHER shows linked to toys / games, this item is unique in that it has overlapping stories. As others say here, it is ahead of time. <br /> <br /> Sad. This is the reason why the show is doomed. They have released 4 DVDs, which are all 16 episodes. I hope to come out more. <br /> <br /> How can this compare to watching it now 20 years after it first came out? I do not know if I still like it, even with some hilarious animations. The writing is almost the top marks and the way ahead of the competition ........ <br /> <br /> I hope to get more DVDs or even all the episodes in the correct order .. .DVD is good. But I don't think the story will be in their proper order.
