corny! I love it! Corny - just like the TV program about 40 years ago! Adam and Bert all the chemistry on the same screen that has never been! They came back to live the old memories again, including the actors who played in the 1960s, showing the things behind it that were quite interesting. 1960s TV was an extremely difficult escape era for many of us People and this DVD are no exception if you are familiar with traditional TV shows, fighting scenes with Boofs and Bams written or whatever is great !! The cinematic scene shows clips of the villains who have passed away. At the end, Frank Gorsin appeared. He passed away shortly after making this DVD. I believe that it was his great credit that he came back to play the villains at Adam and Bert again, just as he did with Batman and Robert. Flew many years ago He didn't touch! Thank you Julie Newmar, who has returned to the villain role again. In conclusion, I think this DVD is for good memories and I would like to thank both Adam and Bert for creating these memories for those of us who remember the original - !!! thank you friend!!!
