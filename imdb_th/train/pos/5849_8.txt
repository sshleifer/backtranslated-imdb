Damn straight ..... This item was kicked back in the day and still cartoons outshine today. I can't wait to find a DVD to share with my little guy and see the sparkle in his eyes. I introduced him to the Voltron (5 lions, not 15 vehicles) and I laughed when he said to me one day, "Dad .. Are you sure you watched a great cartoon when you were Baby !! "How cool is it? <br /> <br /> Come to Hollywood to dust this. Not likely to be worse than Spiderman 3, that is ... Man oh man ... 2007 has been heavily damaged for the summer movie. <br /> <br /> Ok, now I'll talk. <Br /> Bravo
