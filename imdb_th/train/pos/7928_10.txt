Let's understand first: Zombies don't exist, so filmmakers can have WALK, RUN or Hell even fly if they want. That's what makes this original Zombie movie so good. Everything they do is original. I hate when the creators do everything like Romero or when fans expect everything like Romero. Some idiots think that zombies should roar like a typical Romero movie because zombies don't exist, so filmmakers can make the zombies blow the whistle if he wants Zombies in this movie look very good. Unfortunately, they didn't break down the carcasses because they just died! They are quite confused and full of faces and blood. One of the coolest scenes is half the cat that eats. It looks real. My daughter cried when she saw it. This movie received really good reviews in Fangoria and Rue Morgue, making me want to watch it. I'm glad to hear They are always correct when talking about the true taste of horror fans. 10 out of 10! Go rent it!
