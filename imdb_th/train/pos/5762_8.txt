I have to admit to enjoying bad movies. I love them. I watch them all. Especially horror My friends and I all gathered together after a week at school and at work, renting tapes, ordering crazy pizza and bombs. This box has a great box, so I expect less than usual. <br /> <br /> The story of a housing project built over a nuclear power plant with a basement above the ground and others. easily The residents of this neighbor found a comprehensive facility when some children fell into the hole inside the cave. This causes some zombies to disappear. <br /> <br /> From this point, it's a big city. Blood effects and action never stops until you run out of credits. <br /> <br /> OK, it's not a great work of art. But this one has a dialogue in the comedy in the evening. In fact, it's one of the best "party tapes" I've ever enjoyed watching. And you can tell that it's done without money with crazy people. There are hundreds of zombies and the director looks like Brendan Frazer (he has a pendant) and it's a wild trip.
