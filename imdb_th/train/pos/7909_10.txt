When I first came out, my father brought it home - we were surprised by it - it's different from what we've seen before. Last night I was looking for a specific movie and I found that "the eye of the eye" again. The box came out and I was surprised that the tape was still working! Although not a 'Finding Nemo' quality graphic, it is still very good. They should sell this thing again because it is a landmark for animation on computers. Highly recommended! <br /> <br /> This is what it is: <br /> <br /> "Eyes of the mind" is an exciting Odyssey all the time. Your journey begins since the dawn of creation and progresses through the rise of humans and technology. Travel to the world of abstraction and future with amazing computer animation. <br /> <br /> "The Mind's Eye" joins over 300 of the world's most talented computer animation artists. Original soundtrack. This unique collaboration brings you to an incredible journey in "The Mind's Eye".
