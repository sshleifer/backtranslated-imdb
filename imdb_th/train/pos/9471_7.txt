Steve Karel plays the role of Dan Burns, a newspaper that suffers and devotes only one father to three girls. In returning to the home of a large family, Dan met his perfect woman, only to find that she had a relationship with his brother. <br /> <br /> What should a man do? <br /> <br /> I like "Dan In Real Life", but I can imagine the success or anything that this flick will go down that you are willing to accept Steve Carell to play a role that is quite straight and restrained rather than through comedy Wide with Making him successful If you can't accept it, don't be afraid. "Get Smart" will be available later this year. But for the record that I think he is very good, <br /> <br /> "Dan In Real Life" starts like you. In general, an amusing family drama But it was fun and fun when it went along and Carell's frustration with his situation increased. It is not massively traditional. (But if you watch movies with original ideas, choosing movies will be very rare, right?) But "Dan In Real Life" is fun and a good actor. In love at first sight with Juliette Binoche who shines?) Take advantage of the profound chant that many people ponder about meaning and love. <br /> <br /> I hope Steve Carell pushes himself. Own and do Interesting things again
