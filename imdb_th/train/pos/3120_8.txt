Paul Greengrass definitely saved the best Bourne! I heard many people complain about the way he shot this movie and some even compared the camera style to the Blair Witch Project. All I have to say is ... are you kidding me? It's not bad at all. I think it helps to make the action scene feel more realistic, which I like to design a very stylish choreography. The rest of this movie I didn't notice. <br /> <br /> You can tell. That Damon felt comfortable with the role of Jason Bourne, sometimes it was a bad thing But in this case, it's really good. He really became Jason Bourne in this sector. Damon also has actors who play a key role in Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer and Julia Stiles. David Strathairn is an excellent addition as he adds depth to the CIA secret organization. Will be filled with car chases and non-stop actions Of character development in what happened The film is set above two Bourne movies and is one of the best movies of the summer of 2007!
