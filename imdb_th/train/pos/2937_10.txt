I know it's rude and I know it's not on the PC, but it's very funny if you can apply it in the view that it's from the early 80s and performs all the stereotypes of time - and movies still make you Almost laughed out - it's a really good joke. With the tradition of what comedies have been for thousands of years, the story of this film is enthusiastic. If you can suppress your political correctness for an hour and a half, you will be able to laugh more fully. Please see this. <br /> <br /> PS There are people helping to put this stuff on DVD. It's difficult. To find VHS anymore
