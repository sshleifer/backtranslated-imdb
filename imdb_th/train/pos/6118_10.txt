Jack Frost is a really great movie. I mean .... It's funny. It's very violent and fun. Most people say it's rated B, but that can't be far from the truth. It has excellent special effects and good performances. The only strange thing is, of course, the Killer Snowman. I think this movie is actually one of the best movies of the late nineties. Most of the movies today still lack the masterpiece of Clive Barker, which is original and gives the audience the expectation. Jack Frost is awesome. 10 out of 10 grades: A + Ed also introduces the movie Uncle Sam to Jack Frost's fans Post
