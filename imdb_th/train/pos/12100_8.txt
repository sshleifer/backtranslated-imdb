DVDs for "Danaza Macabra" (Castle of Blood) are very strange, because some parts of the movie are in French with subtitles and the rest are dubbed in English from French. Sometimes the characters switch between the two in the middle of the scene! When I try to make a movie as a subtitle or dub, it doesn't make anything different! Strange but still can see. <br /> <br /> The story claims to be the story of Poe. In fact, the character of Poe appears at the beginning and end of the movie - although it doesn't look like him. <br /> <br /> The rich man makes a bet with the lucky guy. He couldn't stay all night in the house. Seems to be easy to win - even if the house is very creepy However, it's not that easy, while the rich say that everyone who has bet has died - but this fool wants to bet! While in the house, he met the lovely Barbara Steele and fell in love with her madly. However, later he realized that she had died more than a decade earlier! How will it be ?! I can tell you more about PTSD. But do not want to cause doubt See for yourself to find the remaining stories. <br /> <br /> This film has a very high score to create an eerie atmosphere. Movie houses and black and white and music work together to create awesome movies. For the story, it's interesting - especially because there are many turns - many that you wonder who is who and who is not in the dead at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The downside The only thing is that I feel sorry for the poor snake that was killed unnecessarily. Crazy because it might sound like I'm sorry about it and it seems almost impossible. <br /> <br /> In addition, parents may want to know that at the end there is a little nudity. The most eye-catching beautiful women appear on the top. But do not need a plot
