This is not an art film. It is the main entertainment. <br /> <br /> Many people, beautiful & t and a action I find it very entertaining. It shouldn't be stimulating intellect. It's a fun movie to watch! Jesse and Chace are also funny, which is just gravy. Definitely worth the rental. <br /> <br /> In summary, I recommend checking for entertainment on Friday night with boys or even girls. <br /> <br /> The bad guys are also good. Vinnie, Corey Large, hateful men from heroes, very nasty villains
