This movie started me with a kick. Nick Cage. It's a story full of twists and turns - movies about motivation and movement. Of course, Dennis Hopper is a ham, but JT Walsh and Laura Flint Boyle are the perfect match to catch an unsuspecting man who falls on their website Everything about this movie is good - movies, stories and most of all. Cage is good at what he does best - not an action hero. But must be a normal person caught in a life snare
