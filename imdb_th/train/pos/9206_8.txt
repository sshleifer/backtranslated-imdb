We couldn't find a movie about the brother's relationship in Indian cinema or any other language or media. This relationship has many aspects that are not used in movies or novels. Usually the sisters are drawn as piles that can be used to call for ransom in Climax. This film focuses on the story in a totally different way. <br /> <br /> It was inspired by George Eliot's "The Mill on the Floss" novel. The brother is a very cute person, everyone is a blue-eyed child who is a good son and a mother's favorite. The sister is a wild romantic and challenges the unwritten rules of society. The brother's love is the winner. <br /> <br /> This film is about the love of two separate brothers and sisters in childhood and the same feeling of revival when they met many years later. In addition, it is the mission of the younger brother to gather with his sister who chooses to be a forest to challenge the world. <br /> <br /> Although the movies and novels are located three centuries apart in two Country But that feeling is the same and remains true
