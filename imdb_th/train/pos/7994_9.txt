I like this movie a lot. It's dark, it's not a bullet. Dodge, chasing cars, stunned action movies in your brain. The background of the characters and the many motives are quite vague, causing the audience to draw their own conclusions. It's good to see movies that the director allowed the audience to create their own thoughts. <br /> <br /> In the end, being inspired by love or vengeance or the desire to repent "'God will forgive us of what we do?' - It's not a question that humans can answer, so he does what he feels has to do what he does well. Do <br / > <br /> denzel Washington is a good actor Could not think of a bad movie that he had done and he was a great actor I would like to recommend this movie to everyone thoroughly.
