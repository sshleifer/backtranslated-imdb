There is nothing wonderful, exotic or innovative, but 'Dog Days' has a reason for studying the characters that are particularly interesting. It's like CRASH stumbles on a small amount of heroin. But not really like that It is an Austrian movie based on the lives of depressed and depressed people, and the relationship that is not suitable for them is disturbing, but it works very well and it is interesting to see the small things these characters do. Of course, not for those who are vulnerable, this pessimistic film doesn't have any conclusions or revelations. At the end, we just saw the lives of these evil people for two days. Grade: B
