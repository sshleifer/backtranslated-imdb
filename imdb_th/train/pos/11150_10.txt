I sat down to see "Midnight Cowboy", thinking that it would be a 70s movie. Another exaggerated story. Some of my favorite movies are from the 70s in the same vein as "Midnight Cowboy" ("Taxi Driver," "Mean Streets," "Panic in Needle Park, etc.) but there are many exaggerated stories. Well, that has earned a strong reputation among critics for its groundbreaking - but unfortunately most of them are not as well today. I feel like this about "Easy Rider" (although it's one of my favorites). <br /> <br /> So I didn't expect much from "Midnight Cowboy", but got back a lot. It's an impressive story, well done, and being told along with the best performances of all time. Dustin Hoffman as Enrico "Ratso" Rizzo gives him the best thing - it's quite funny all the time. (He sounded like a cartoon character when he spoke - probably because of Lenny's connection / "Simpson"), but Hoffman believes. Half of the film's budget is geared towards paying his salary because of He has just become an important star in Hollywood. Opposite him is Jon Voight, who is charged for the second time while Joe Buck "Cowboy" travels north to the Big Apple in hopes of becoming a male prostitute. Soon he was innocent, causing him to be in trouble and he paired up with an impostor named "Ratso" - who offered to be Joe's "manager" for absolute profit. <br /> <br /> The movie is quite long in two hours, but it doesn't seem to be long. Some movies tend to be dragged, especially in some movies that were created in the 70s because (as mentioned in "Easy Riders, Raging Bulls"), the director is a movie star in the 1970s and sometimes they Received A bit too obsessed with the content, check the characters / scenes / etc for too long. That doesn't matter. Just one scene that I feel is too long and unnecessary. It's a medicine party - it makes the movie look very outdated. (Similar to the drug in "Easy Rider") and dangerous to its flow because it is not necessary /> <br /> In addition, "Midnight Cowboy" is an almost impeccable animation I was surprised It has its shortcomings. (The backward is a bit tacky and never used like they would have been like) and some of the scenes were a bit uneasy. But like if you can manage the content of it, "Midnight Cowboy" is a truly great movie. Testing street life in the late 70s and early 70s. It's a depressing movie. Yes and follow. Today's standards may seem obsolete and heavy in the liberal view of "Life is horrible, etc." ... but I still love it and especially the impressive ending. For a long time, <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. One of the best films of the 70s (technical debut in late 1969, but I still categorized 70s movies and still won the Academy Award for Best Film as the first and only film that Rated as XR when appealing) <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 5
