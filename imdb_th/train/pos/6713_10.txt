I like this TV program because it is my own. The woman on her sixteenth birthday found that she is a witch and she lives with her aunt in the house and they are witches as well In this way, she spent about a few weeks getting acquainted. When she used her power for the first time, it was funny because she turned her enemies into pineapples. She must go back in time and repeat the day. This series is really cool and is a typical teen series. But it looked skinny when she moved out of her house and went to the apartment with her college friends. It was boring and I stopped watching. I loved their aunt. Very funny. And another one is really crazy I love Valerie and I hate Libri's Sabrina. The enemy is ugly.
