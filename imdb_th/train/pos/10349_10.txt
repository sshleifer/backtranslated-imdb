This is one of the movies that makes me feel strongly about the need to make movies. In general, I am a fan of movies that are made from worthy stories. And this one is great! In addition to Meryl's performance, which has been recognized and appreciated by many, the greatest movie of this story is a story based on The gripping story of couples suffering from social and legal after receiving enormous emotional pain that the unexpected and brutal death of their babies is an eye-opening story Good and legal society It is interesting to see that people who consider themselves to be smart and intelligent (Such as the jury, emotion in the film), in fact, nothing more than selfishness that insults other people And contemplation, even in facts clearly pointed to their opinions Another face of a society called "civilized" in which the film opens is the indifference to the pain of human friends. (There is no need to say that this is very common, although this is only happening in Australia.) As a true cruelty Must see that you are willing to do something seriously and may be an idea
