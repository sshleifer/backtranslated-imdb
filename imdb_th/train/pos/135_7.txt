It is a great work for a puppet series because the film shows all series from one to seven. And this is a story about a woman trying to stop a new puppet because I never guess that the puppet will be painful. Plus it shows some of the puppets that I didn't see and how I can look like the second episode. It shows the characteristics of the torch, which can change things and cool humans and show the return of the puppet master from one part. It also shows little aliens from episode 4, which is cool. It shows others that it may be good for them and that it can be done.
