If you are researching UFO facts, this video is very important. The 'texture' of the video is a comment made by Buzz Aldrin. He is no doubt the best of America. Trained to be honest and objective in his report Many astronauts from America in all ages have reported some contact or UFO observations and have videos from those missions. At the very least, there is something happening that requires continuous monitoring according to the purpose. I think Buzz Aldrin's testimony shows that it is possible that other worlds may be interested in our progress. As with all documentary videos that should be, this video may have a slant. But there are additional information and opinions from successful American heroes. Those things don't happen every day. Therefore, the fact that some people ignore the details should not be avoided by watching this video. If nothing is interesting and I suggest you look with an open mind.
