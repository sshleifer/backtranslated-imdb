I saw this for the first time at a foreign film festival. It's a beautiful and boring nail polish about the story to relieve Estonian bills that are worth billions of dollars or gold. All of this was filmed in a grainy style that Hollywood rarely used - but it captured the atmosphere of the newly launched Baltic state. (Note: Tallin was less grim in 2003 when I was there. <br /> <br /> There are lots of humor and love. I do not want to spoil the shocking surprise. But there is a reason, so I would say that the robbery movie begins with the best screenplay and the directing and acting are the best. The darkness in TALLIN is just the quickest and most exciting example of the genre of movies --- I will put it with RAFIFI, TOPKAPI and it is far from the new OCEAN'S 11 even though it is not glossy.
