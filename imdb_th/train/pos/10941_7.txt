Sarah Silverman's thoughts with her acting made me anxious at first. The movie that she appeared in was not funny and her humor was quite out. However, I was very surprised to see her true colors shine in this funny central jewel. I may have compared her to those who like Amy Sedaris in Strangers with Candy - Sarah's character is a true sociologist comparable to Sedaris' Jerri Blank. <br /> <br /> The fall of the show. This is a handsome supporting character of her sister. Sometimes funny But ultimately means that Sarah will not steal the item. However, the rest of the actors are very similar. <br /> <br /> I'm happy that Comedy Central makes Sarah the opportunity to express herself and the crazy humor.
