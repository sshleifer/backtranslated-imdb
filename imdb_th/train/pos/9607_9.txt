This film is a movie that anyone interested should be affected or suffering from eating disorders. It is a miraculous and accurate image of bulimia in teenage girls. Its causes and symptoms This girl, played by one of the best actresses working in the theater today, Alison Lohman, who was later excited in the 'Where the Truth Lies', would like to suggest that this movie will appear. In every school because you will never see this story better Alison Loh, it is very remarkable and one of her abilities to convey the pain of a girl who suffers from this disease. If the air pressure gauge tells us the air pressure, Alison Lohman tells us the emotional pressure with the same accuracy. Her emotional range is very precise, each scene can be measured with microscopes for gradations of injury, hysteria and despair. Mare Winningham is the perfect choice to play her mother and do so with compassion. The greatness and range of emotions, as well as elaborately tuned like Lohman's together, they make a pair of vibrating sensitive oscillators. Shaken by each other's resonance This movie is a really amazing achievement and director Katt Shea should be proud of it. The only reason not seeing it is if you don't care about others. But even if you like the most natural movies, this is the behavior of all animals at the sharp edges. Bulimia is a violent version that the tortured spirit can destroy her body like crazy. And if we do not sympathize with those who suffer from despair, we die
