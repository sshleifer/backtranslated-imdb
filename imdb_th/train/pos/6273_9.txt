I really love this movie. Yes, I know it's quite far enough. There is no way that Shelby's cars can be on the road as well as the 540i with traction control. Movies put together The Cage is normally excellent, and the rest of the actors are quite good, except for the Brit Bad Guy. He is "little". Don't you think so? However, excellent movies, excellent cars and excellent performances. I made sure my car was locked and alarmed in a remote controlled garage that night :)
