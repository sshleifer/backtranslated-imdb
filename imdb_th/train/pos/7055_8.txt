Although Cinderella is not an obvious choice for the sequel I love Jaq and Gus, so I do not hesitate. The style of the mice who wrote the book for Cinderella was inspired. I enjoy writing stories by myself and hope that children will be supported by this. The three stories are cute and amusing, although the song is forgotten. Jaq and Gus are the characters I like. But I was happy to see Lucifer Bruno, my singer and all the rest. Pom Pom proved to be the perfect partner for Lucifer and I like Governess. 8/10
