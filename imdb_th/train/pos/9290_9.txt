This is not a movie that John Wayne is known for. He plays a male diplomat who does things with words and persuasion rather than physical actions. This movie moves in a realistic way with tranquility through an incredibly amazing story. <br /> <br /> For those who are open-minded, patient and prudent, this movie is a picture that shows the interesting parts of History <br /> <br /> There are two related stories. The big story is about people within the Japanese isolationism and outsiders that grew when America collided when their interests conflicted. The story of a small human being belonging to the pagan outside (Wayne) and the first hatred of a geisha with civilization. The story of a human being is a reflection of a story that is greater than the two countries. <br /> <br /> This film is very good and every actor has a good role. Both leading roles will be performed for perfection. John Wayne is great when compared to Townsend Harris, which is a perfect combination between power and negotiation with Japan. Eiko Ando is great as well as geisha in the name, charming and delightful. The interaction between her character and John Wayne is especially good. This is how these two people (As shown in the movie) will behave. <br /> <br /> The script is very well written. It has no meaning at all. And is an actual image in the manner in which the incident may occur The character is a real person, not a "good" number, very nervous from history. In addition, the clash of cultures and interests shows great skills and subtlety. Indeed, the clashes of traditionalist and traditional authority, Japanese separators and new power-rising countries from all over the ocean, were very good in a single exchange between John Wayne and the Japanese Baron in ward Wayne complained that the crew that had been shipwrecked would be cut if they landed in Japan and that the ship that had passed was unable to enter the water. Baron replied that Japan wanted to be alone. Wayne's character responds that Japan is in the midst of increasingly important international transport, and if things continue to be like before the nation is seen as nothing more than a group of extremists. A very true summary of the ways in which both countries perceive themselves to be right and see each other as wrong. The conflict that arises between two people who are righteous in themselves and their conflicting interests is reflected throughout history, which is a continuing theme that reflects the present and future. <br /> <br / > Movies and images of the nineteenth century Japan Before the rapid growth into the industry that followed in this century was excellent. Healing with images and a deep understanding of the ancient civilizations of Japan. <br /> <br /> I would recommend everyone whether John John fans or not to watch this movie if you have a chance. Just know that it's not an action movie. It represents an interesting place and time in history and a love story that is slow. (Much to their surprise) came to occupy the personal lives of the two main characters. Watch this film about its advantages without any bias. Let yourself be obsessed with its story and you'll enjoy it thoroughly. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a movie that Excellent
