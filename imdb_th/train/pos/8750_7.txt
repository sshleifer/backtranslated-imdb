Brokedown Palace is the story of two close friends, Alice and Darlene, who travel naturally to Thailand and break into prison after being arrested with drugs planted in their pockets. In this way, the film has the potential to turn into a serious and moving movie, such as "Return to Paradise", but the movie chooses to focus on the situation of girls and their friendship instead. <br /> <br /> Cal Dennen and Kate Beckinsale both performed great performances and this film has a connection between them, including suspicion, jealousy, questioning and friendship testing. This movie chose not to go too deeply into politics or even the cruelty of life in prison. (Which is quite glittering) and focuses on these friendship issues. <br /> <br /> There are some points here. And some parts that seem unbelievable or real We do not feel true fear or despair on their situation, just as we might have. And we felt very little life outside the prison wall as well. Bill Pullman played a lazy lawyer who actually turned out to have a golden heart. In short, this right should be a darker movie than I thought. <br /> <br /> But overall, I enjoy it. The performance is good, the soundtrack is perfect and the story is distorted and turned to attention. Worth watching
