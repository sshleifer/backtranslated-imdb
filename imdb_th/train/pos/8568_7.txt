While this is a movie that is better than 101 Dalmations (live action, not an animated version), I think it's still a bit short from what Disney can do. It can be shot well. The song is more suitable for acting and the effect is better (compared to 101). The performance may be better. But after that, the human character was given a more appropriate role in this sequel and Glenn Close should not miss, as in the first movie. She makes it shine. Poor sympathetic people and her fierce colleagues are excellent characters to play and they add excitement to Disney. This is an excellent family movie with little or no offensive content. But it is still fun and interesting for children and adults It is bound to be a classic like many Disney movies. This is the third hope is even better - because you know they may want to make it;)
