Overall, I enjoy this movie and would like to recommend to indie movie lovers. <br /> <br /> However, I would like to observe the similarities between the different parts of the movie with Nichols' Closer, one scene Especially that the character of Adrian Grenier is interrogating Rosario Dawson about her sex life, while he is remarkably distant, similar to the scene in Colossus, please. Know " Anna "is the name of the character, both Dawson and Roberts. Can not be a coincidence Now, it is close to the play of Patrick Marber and is expected to be based on Arthur Schnitzler's "Reigen". So I'm not sure how this connection happened. <br /> <br /> People have ideas?
