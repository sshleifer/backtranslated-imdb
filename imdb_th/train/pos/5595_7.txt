Polanski returned to the theme of solitude and madness, where he explored this great impact on Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby in The Tenant. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is a trademark of Polanski. Uncomfortable about this movie and I'm not sure if it will be considered. <br /> <br /> Sweeney Whiste, who is responsible for Bergman's most beautiful movie, is not fair to himself here. Since his name is one of the things that made me interested in this film, I was a bit disappointed in the film's impressive films in a few films. <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes this movie a reality. Down is the show Polanski is not a bad actor. But he seems to be bitten more than he can chew with Trelkovsky's difficult role. Some of the supporting actors are excellent, especially Melvin Douglas as a tenant and Shelley Winter. As a facilitator It is also difficult to overcome the fact that all of these Parisians have an American accent. <br /> <br /> Somewhat unexpected, there are some funny moments in the movie. Anyone who has seen The Fearless Vampire Killers knows that Polanski is a good comedian. However, there are times when it sneaks closer to mocking himself. Trelkovsky suddenly (and cannot explain) changes. 'There is a tendency to raise giggles over the eyebrows that deviate from what should be an amazing moment in his journey. <br /> <br /> A fun and interesting experience. If too little for their own goodness There are a lot of cold times and uncomfortable and intuitively atmosphere. But this movie, while very good, isn't quite as successful as it should be. <br /> <br /> Alas, at the end of the day, Polanski's movie 'Okay' is still better than other 'good' movies. Great, worth watching. Of course, don't expect to be blown away.
