Hello everyone, I am a chess enthusiast at about 6 years old. I think I'm quite obsessed with playing chess. But hopefully not as much as the main character in this movie <br /> <br /> in this movie The character reflects the real chess player Curt von Bardeleben, who killed himself in 1924. He is famous for the games he played with Steinitz, which has a beautiful blend of Steinitz. Instead of resigning, he just walked out. From the competition hall, don't come back. <br /> <br /> The social folly of the main characters is a shame. Grandmasters are more serious. Sometimes you get a chess chess match. That's a big sacrifice, and sometimes you may pay the balance in other areas of life. An important example of this is Bobby Fischer's chess legend, although he is a genius. But he was still disturbed in many ways. <br /> <br /> In this film, the world championship match was described. The format is amazing, which in fact the world that Fide's rule sometimes uses is that - from 128 players to 2 people in the final round. But this is an amazing thing in the group - which shows a realistic style in which the winners of each group play each other. <br /> <br /> The position before moving out makes the chess puzzle interesting. within yourself In fact, I've already made a youtube video about it so you can explore winning combinations in detail - enjoy! http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=XZPtdtPhwdM Tryfon's best wishes
