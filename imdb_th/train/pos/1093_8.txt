I always enjoyed this movie when it appeared on TV. <br /> <br /> One of the most striking scenes for me is the scene with Myrna Loy and the foreman drawing pictures that she gave him. Clear instructions about color and as soon as she left, he would turn their backs and say "Do you understand that is yellow, blue, green and white?"
