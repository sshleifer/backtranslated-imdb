At least in contrast to the famous belief, this name for me, at least not so bad. in reality. I think it's the most popular movie ever. The story is not too well structured when you consider the difference between the series. However, you can watch it happily. For the documentary film of that day, the scene was well allocated and the characters were always confident. <br /> <br /> Audio / audio tracks are my favorite songs. Almost everything has the correct sound effects and most of the sounds are more suitable for the characters than they are. Perfect sync in every shot I have a little problem with casting for the 'alien' (please forgive the name of the crude oil for a long time that I have seen it). However, other actors seem completely balanced. I feel and believe in the characters of this movie. Dubs are often a topic that I rarely see long ago. I like the OSD since then. But casting often makes the series down. <br /> <br /> At this point, I want to add that this is the first anime I saw in my life. It has historical value for me. But even after seeing the original Megazone 23, it is still strong and can be seen in my collection. <br /> <br /> For my knowledge Personally, I think it's a great shame. If the audience is correct, I think Robotech the Movie will be accepted and not tarnished over the years. I relate to anime every day of my life and everyone that I have shown this movie thinks it is a well-known name. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie after the separate elements From each other will make the audience notice the plot clearly Holes during the show However, if you do not see the original, the viewer will not really notice. Since the animation has the same style, there is no reason to ask questions in those days. The UK has limited access to anime. Limited to laser discs is the most effective medium. Personally, I like the way Carl has the ball, at least pushing the genre. I mean, Harmony will not use the cash to use in this series to publish. <br /> <br /> Despite the few meticulous mistakes that had been made in this movie, Eighty felt That makes me fall in love. If you watch Megazone 23, now it's the original Japanese voice or a new dub. I believe you will be very disappointed with the OSD. Bring your thoughts back to the original Bubblegum Crisis Dub soundtrack and imagine. Eighty new sound <br /> <br /> say to all this E.V.E.. Today, the popularity of this movie tends to be rare in the open market. Personally, it turned out to be a collection for me. I am now getting rid of all the dirt on the world from the three components that make up and if I meet with Karl Masek, don't hold his hand for the effort and buy a pint or crate to take me. To anime
