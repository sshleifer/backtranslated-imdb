I must say that events on 9/11 didn't hit me until I saw this documentary. I spent a year to arrive with destruction. I am the person who changed radio stations and TV channels if talking about the tower. I'm tired of hearing about it When this thing aired on TV one year and one day later It was the first time I cried since the attack. I recommend this documentary. I'm watching now on TV 5 years later and I'm still crying with tragedy. The fact that this has one of the only video footage of the first plane that hit the tower is amazing. It's an accident and see where it goes. These two brothers made me want to be there to help.
