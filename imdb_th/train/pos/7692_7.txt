First, I will give my score for the overall series ******* 7 out of ten stars. I have taken three points for the downhill slide in this series after John Amos left. Travel Don't understand me wrong when having to press the button hard later, but after Esther Rolle went out for one season and returned to <br /> <br /> In February 1974, it was a really great sitcom. It was the first television program to show about African-American families living in Chicago in 1970, created by Norman Lear as a separate "Maude". Must be with the audience again <br /> <br /> No, since this program, I saw a funny situation, talking directly about the family's struggles in the city (ie "Central Central" of Fox in '94 but not being renewed). <br /> <br /> John Amos because James Evans Sr. is the best father for this family and behaves like any father. His family lives together and his children from the wrong path in life. <br /> <br /> Esther Rolle is a person who has no great feelings, no body on the same page. Her husband when it comes to children. <br /> <br /> Ralph Carter, while Michael is a bright, young man, but stuck in a school system that doesn't meet the needs His academic His character's name is the same as the founder of the program, Mike Evans, which is Lionel Jefferson's "The Jeffersons" (Mike Evans from December 2006). <br /> <br / > Telel was a girl aged 16 or 17 years and had to deal with the dangers of being a girl on a slum road. Jimmy Walker as J. Evans Jr. is a brilliant young man and a young man who doesn't take life seriously. <br /> <br /> It's easy to say, all my favorite is John Amos, except Penny's Gordon / Janet Jackson story. <br /> <br /> After the death of the character James Evans, the performance lost stability and the audience went away. Esther Rolle traveled all year, not wanting to play JJ-smart's second violin. mite "JJ-mite's" <br /> <br /> She came back next season after Wilona Woods, a neighbor of Florida, was a divorced woman who ended up receiving abused Penny Gordon girls (played by Janet Jackson, 10 years old). Totie Fields is Penny's inappropriate mother. The mother of Kim Fields <br /> <br /> In August 1979, the performance ended with leaving the project for a better life. JJ artist sold the idea for a comic book company and Michael went out on campus at the college. <br /> <br /> Keona + Florida Wilona & Penny, Thelma players and footballers have moved to the building. Same in Chicago Not the most realistic ending But at that time it didn't matter
