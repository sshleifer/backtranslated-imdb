Let me start by saying at the age of 34, I am a widow immediately. I was very sad because he was not sick - he died unexpectedly from a coronary artery - his carotene exploded - he died behind our house. There was a lot of speculation from the police causing him to fall to something and beat him. I was a suspect in the murder until the autopsy came back. <br /> <br /> My children are so hurt that I am so. I love my good father like him. I have three small children. No education. No financial support. I took it very hard. <br /> <br /> Within two years, my husband hurt me verbally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. I didn't regret my face and put on a mask and showed people that they wanted to see nothing. He saw My pain during the holidays ... No one stands for me, and I choose to sit and relax on a one-day holiday, except of course, the grief therapist I see that guides me to follow my heart and soul. My law doesn't understand! It changed forever, my relationship with them and I never returned. This is just one example of my grief that is not respected! My (new) husband saw me fall apart, talking about injuries when I share from my soul. I collapsed, unable to breathe, hyperventilate, and in general I died a couple of days if I tried to convey that pain. <br /> <br /> Now, about this movie ... <br /> <br /> Today, my soul has broken my heart. My fear and pain appeared again from the real devil that this movie presented. How much sadness is compared to what others expect us and the inner demons Adam Sandler depicts the terrifying pain that you have overcome and perfectly above all, to work at your own time! This film digs all the pain I have tried many years to deal with. Do you see that when there is something that is deeply damaging to your soul, so what is emitted from your mouth when you think you can't handle it without thinking that you die and walk? Through life <br /> <br /> The Bible has the Bible, Romans 8:26, which I stick to when my mouth and soul do not know how to pray, so that the Holy Spirit of God carries pain. Foot of God - - I do not want to say. Sandler shows that perfect! <br /> <br /> There was a scene in which he was investigated in court for mental health purposes and he returned to confront the husband - --- (familiar to me) --- and he told them the truth. Amazing that he was dominated by Se. He was unbeatable. It is a strong and deep performance. I started shouting and having a difficult time after the patient got up and walked out of the theater, feeling that my legs were too weak to do so. My son was with me and saw it with my first hand, my precise movements while trying to hold it together. Lessons for him, my youngest person, who almost didn't remember his father. It was 13 years ago. But this movie made me go back in time when I lost my rules forever when they demanded to wear a mask on my emotions and surrender to their wishes. <br /> < br /> I wrote this so that if you are a tricky person, you are ready for this movie. But recommending it at the 1,000-star level that Sandler gave <br /> <br /> If you are still unsatisfied, please learn the lesson from his film and listen and accept the choices of people in sadness Their grief, let them find peace in their own time! Sometimes the soul cannot utter words to convey our pain. <br /> <br /> Go and watch this movie with tissues and not prepare to bring it into your soul!
