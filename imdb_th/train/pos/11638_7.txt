I enjoy watching Red Eye. It's not a masterpiece. But with good governance and structure, Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are perfect in this chapter. Yes, it's an old story with a different environment, but Wes Craven gives a good rhythm. At least it's not a scream with other college killers. It is good that you will see a clean and continuous thriller, even when the initiative is not as prominent as the main character. Especially from filmmakers like Craven, who have brought many creative ideas to horror and horror movies in the past and now just let yourself go home to bring good movies to the home. !
