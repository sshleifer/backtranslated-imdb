At first I didn't like it that much, even though I did. They didn't include the Trueba version. The third love between Blanca and Pedro didn't explain well and some actors were different from what I imagined. <br /> <br /> Later, I realized that there was a movie. This story More loyal to the book, it would be like a five hour long and boring. Now I like it a lot because my favorite characters are there while I photograph them. Clara looks like an angel in real live performances and the introduction of her story about the beginning of this film is great, honest and short. Glenn Close is Ferula. But mourning throughout the story Esteban found enough I never really liked his character and even though I was interested in him But I hated him very much when he hit Clara. Just like in the book, the last part is the most exciting thing, and it has a real history as well. <br /> <br /> This film is really good, especially when considering it as a Gringo movie from Latin America. It's a book. It is amazing that there are many famous celebrities. Don't you think so?
