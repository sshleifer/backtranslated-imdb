As far as movies are parody, there are few that are worth the time and energy. But with the resurrection of scary parodies such as Date Movie and The Comebacks, it's a breath of fresh air to come back and discover truly funny jokes like Johnny Dangerously. <br /> <br /> After his mother has no place. End Little Johnny's medical problems go to work for the mob. What friends are, most of the jokes, work occasionally. But foreign connoisseurs who are unable to master the American language (At least blasphemously wise) A gangster, an opponent who likes to shoot his mouth (... once!), The brother of DA, who goes out to get Johhny dangerous and the hot young star for Johnny is busy. br /> and the audience is busy laughing, because most are the movie gangster clich√©, everyone is skewed By talented actors and good writing <br /> <br /> not perfect with a long shot But good for smiles on bad days
