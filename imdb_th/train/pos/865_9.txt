Vincent Castle plays the role of Paul, a former jailer assigned to work in an office where he meets Carla, the deaf secretary, who is quite deaf when she has no hearing aid. ) They help each other develop into people. <br /> <br /> The interesting thing about this movie is the complexity of the characters ?? Not suitable in the clear map Paul seems uneasy in the office environment because he is not cut off from work? This belief disappears when he finds work in the bar and shines. <br /> <br /> This film has a sense of humor that I find refreshing and shows how easily criminal acts are justified /> <br /> Finally, it's a movie that is filled with great moments, both touching and having humor. One is when Carla is babysitting and trying to comfort the baby screaming. Do you still hug it anyway? But take her to hear help out for her own comfort
