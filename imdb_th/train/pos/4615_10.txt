I think people are evaluating this incredible movie. People see it as a horror movie that scares us and prevents us from falling asleep. Which if it tries to do it, it deserves 1/10, but I watched this movie with a few friends and we found it very fun and even though it was a good movie after that, Stephanie got hit This is the reason I think it deserves to be 10/10 for pure entertainment of movies. <br /> <br /> The general view of this movie is that it has bad performances, simple scripts that are 10 years old. Old can produce and it can not be taken seriously and people give a low rating because of this. But I see that this is a masterpiece that is thoroughly entertaining ... with hilarious jokes that make the actors more fun and even if not very serious.
