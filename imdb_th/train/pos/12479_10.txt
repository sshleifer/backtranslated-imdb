The odds of "Mermaid" helium balloons traveling from Yuba, California (November 8, 1993) and landing 4 days later (November 12) in MERMAID, Prince Edward Island, Canada 4,000 miles) This is a great movie. It depends on the true story. This film is not only But helps children cope with loss But also to the elderly as well Hope everyone will enjoy it !!! Rhonda
