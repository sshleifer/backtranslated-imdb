I read Kerching's comment on IMDb and frankly I never saw good reviews. Until now, I like Kerching. Kerching is about a teenage boy named Taj Lewis. To make 1,000,000 pounds for his mother. Has created a website called rudeboy. The website offers many interesting things if only the Taj Mahal and his two friends - Danny and Seymour can stop the touch from being revealed. I found that this show was quite funny and fun to watch the show as O.K. But it would definitely be better, especially funny characters Danny Spooner, Taj Mahal's friend. His stupidity is what makes him funny. And other friends of the Taj Mahal. In addition, Carlton, the owner of the cafe, also called "The Chill". We never saw him. We just heard him. Omar, the brother of Taj Mahal and his sister Missy, is also funny. And Missy Kareesha's best friend, many times that Taj has almost been revealed. As well as comedy, drama in Kerring, such as life, love and loss of loved ones makes this program great
