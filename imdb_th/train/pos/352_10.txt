I just saw "Valentine" and I have to say it's the best slasher movie I've seen in years. Which is different from the latest trend of horror flicks in the 90s. This film is more frightening than self-defamation. For those who hate "Scream", no one refers to "horror rules" in this movie. (Although the rules of old slash movies are used here) <br /> <br /> This is a perfect combination of horror in the 80s and 90s. You will get a movie style and performance. The best of 90s movies and stunned madness in the 80s. I guess 2001 is going to give the horror fans they want. This is a movement in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Denise Richards stands out as a fun character. You can tell that she likes her role and that makes her stand out. I love you in this movie
