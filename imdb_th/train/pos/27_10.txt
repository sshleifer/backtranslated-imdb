Emilio Miraglio's "The Red Queen, killing seven times" (1972) is just the perfect example of the giallo that I have ever seen. Mix all the necessary elements in one awesome stew. First and foremost, for me, it has a complex and winding plot that makes the most perfect sense and the killer here didn't come out of the left field at the end. The story of the horrific murder (You already know how many titles from the movie, right?) Which happens when it seems that fulfilling the ancient prophecies about two sisters is related to one and the murderer. Thinking with the crazy laughter of crazy people, both scary and memorable. The great Giallo, everyone wants a cute lead actor and here we have quite a lot of arrangements, led by Barbara Buchet. As ridiculously as one of the two siblings and one of her previous roles. Another essential component of the superior giallo is the impressive and impressive score and Bruno Nicolai Prepare one for this movie that should be with you for several days. Beautiful scenery? check again. Filmed mainly in Wurzburg, Germany. This image is truly attractive for the eyes. OK. But what about those murders? Ultimately, that's what gialli is all about? I am happy to report that most audiences should be satisfied with the variety of knives, shooting, impalements and other killings that the film has been tastefully created ... no need to mention the truth room. Many strange dreams, 'em too!) Drug references Rape scenes, forced red fish and in Ugo Pagliai's person, male leaders, female viewers As I said And more than that, this DVD comes from a group of good people at No Shame, and you know what that means: beautiful prints and many extras to boot! thank you friend!
