With a special telescope, Dr. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) successfully proved that many years ago, the meteorites that landed in Africa had unknown elements. But very powerful, Dr. Benet (Belalukosi) is a survey leader led by Rukh to search for unexpected elements. Rukh discovers "Radium X", which is more powerful than radium and is very radioactive and Carl Asov becomes contaminated and can kill anyone by just touching them. Sparks fly between Lugosi and Carlos in a classic science fiction movie in the post-World War II era. Director Hillyer uses a few sets of "FLASH GORDON" sets that were filmed at the same time and put pictures. The electrical appliances from Frankenstein Universal made the public unaware of the special effects used in this classic movie. Karloff and Lugosi are the best and they both enjoy working together. And the next generation will be happy
