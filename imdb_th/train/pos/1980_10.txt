One of the last great musicals of the 60s. I was 7 years old. For the first time I watched this movie and it has always been a favorite since then. Music figures are memorable in the 60s. People performing in musicals have musical abilities (unlike the CERTAIN Academy Award nominated for music in the big cities of the Midwest in the West). Beautifully selected ... Ron Moody shines like Fakin, just like Chani Wallis as Nancy Oliver Reed is a scary Bill Sikes (without music numbers lol) and Mark Lester while At Oliver and Jack Wil d As the Dodger is great as well, Mark Lester finds it innocent innocent, which Dickens intended when he wrote the book! Of course, there are dozens of dancers in the show. "Consider yourself" "I will do everything" "Who will buy" and "Come back soon" Many people who are children! This is a great show for the whole family.
