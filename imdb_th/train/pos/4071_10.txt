I saw this movie for the first time when I was about seven years old and completely fascinated with this movie. But for many years that can not know what this movie is called Now I'm twenty-one and accidentally stumbled upon this movie about two weeks ago and bought a copy. Although my memories in this movie are a bit dark But I was not disappointed with what I saw The animation in this film creates a great image for the whole world that is believable and lively that you have drawn into the movie. But this movie also has a story that will fascinate and entertain children and adults With the floating island, madman generals, friendly pirates and a well-built love story, this movie will not let you down. I want to recommend this movie to everyone.
