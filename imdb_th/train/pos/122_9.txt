I began to lose my faith in the latest film that was flooded with the typical Genre Hollywood movie. The story failed and the camera work was copied from the last film with a similar taste, but then I saw Zentropa (Europa). And my belief was renewed not only as a slave-oriented metaphorical story But the use of color and black and white is a stimulating sight. The speaker (Max Von Sydow) takes you through an amazing journey every step and takes you into Europa 1945. We see death appearing on the screen as Hundreds of ways, every moment that moves slowly, leads you to death. Unlike many movies that did not cut after one second of the show (for example), the knife but forced you to watch the horrible beauty. I think we all can take things differently from what this movie tries to say. But it is worthwhile to take the time to find out what it really means. I like to talk more in depth about this movie for those who want to email me. Enjoy it!
