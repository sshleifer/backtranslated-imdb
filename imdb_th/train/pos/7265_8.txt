A good story, good script, handsome, good acting, good director. Good art direction Good photography, good sound, good editing, everything. Gather it together and you'll end up with good entertainment. <br /> <br /> The shame of this film is not enough. We may count ourselves. Fortunately, writers / directors like John Hughes can hear their creations from time to time. <br /> <br /> Whenever I notice that I am watching a movie for the third time. Or four and still found I have to conclude thoroughly that there is something correct about this movie.
