In the hands of the actors less than Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan, this movie may become nonsense and boring. But with these two experienced leaders, I found that "Silent Fury" is the most exciting and delightful puzzle. When their marriage was interrupted by strangers, claiming that Colbert was married and that he was the best man at the wedding, we could feel that there was some planning with her at work. As Colan Ryan and her lawyers proved to be strangers, claiming that they had married before, they would meet each other with additional evidence that seems to reinforce that she was actually married. Although it is not difficult to Think about who is the main "baddie", but still have lots of fun when the concentration and rhythm of the story increases. Overall, it is a good and strong mystery movie with good performances from two leading actors and good performing actors, including Paul Kelly, who often underestimates.
