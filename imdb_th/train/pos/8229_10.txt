This is a rather slow movie, creating a story of a former dancer who starts a new family life with a completely stranger. The audience slowly feels that something is wrong here ... <br /> <br /> Love this movie very much, although it has a slightly bitter taste at the end. It is intelligent and works very well. Both Philippe Toretton and Emmannuelle Seigner are deep into their characters. <br /> <br /> The little son "pierrot" is also impressed. <br /> <br / > Thriller like no other It's a very exotic movie, especially the atmosphere throughout the movie, although you may feel awkward with a few scenes. <br /> <br /> I'll give you 8/10 !!
