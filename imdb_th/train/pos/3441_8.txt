This movie is incredibly realistic and I feel it is fair to crime that many people do not understand because of lack of experience. Many people who think they can understand what happens in the heart of the victim is arrogant. As a victim, I felt that Dawson did a great job in the role of Maya. I agree that this is an incredibly brave movie. This looks like rape from a different and realistic perspective than any other film I've seen in the story. In the end, it was a bit long. But I know that many victims imagine this justice because of the chance that the attacker will be sent to prison for their 1% offense. Big brave to do
