I regret that ABC gave up on another program that had a real chance of winning. This show is very good, writing and the story is great, the original idea for acting instead of another boring reality show. The casting is great! Not only characters and actors But still a very talented actor Concepts and ideas are great new ideas for TV programs. Many of us share the whole idea of "Connection" I love the characters of Steven, Laura, Whitney and Damien. But in truth, no one is connected to this program that I don't like, even those in a few stages (such as Sheri Appleby). The performances and characters are easy to like and very talented !! I want ABC to get more opportunities for this show and not interrupt the show in the middle, and it doesn't have enough advertising Not truly fair !! To everyone !! This show shows great promise. I'll let ABC know how I feel and will send an email to make this show lively. Please join me, I know we can. It works with Jerico (now Episode 13, Where I want the last item!) Please support this show and send an email to ABC. We can !!! This performance is worth it !!! Online complaints for the sixth degree: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html We can do it !! Sign this petition as soon as possible !!!
