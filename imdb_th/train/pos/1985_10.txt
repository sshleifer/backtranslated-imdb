I am not a theater lover. But if I had to choose what I would like to have, it would have to be Oliver. The film was made very well. The characters that appeared very well, the costumes were the key points in the performances and songs. Excellent. I like 'Review of the situation by Ron Moody, the beautiful image of Fagin. I'm not old enough to see Oliver when it was launched in the late 60s, but my sister lived together for several weeks. I have to endure with them singing blood often. 'Who will buy my wonderful rose? I know. Every song before I watch this movie is an immortal music that you can't definitely create. Standing on its own, it is wrong with the book and I don't think it will work well if it is so. I don't think Charles Dickens will be disappointed as he writes Oliver to depict poverty in London. Orphanage, home, work and about what the poor have to turn to for survival Very good. Another good reason to watch this film is the British Bullseye the Old Bull. The Terrier noticed his slender legs that had been trained from the breed many years ago. They had to hunt. High and low to find, for example He and he were like the British Bull Terrier looking at the Victorian era that he had scars. {Which seems to be} on his face. Bill Sykes may use him to fight dogs. Terrier has a number of records of killing in the rat hole. He's a beautiful dog, either in any way and noticing that he doesn't obey Bill Sykes. A great stage drama to watch if you like the stage and if you don't like the stage, try to do it all in this movie.
