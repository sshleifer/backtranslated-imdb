I want Celine and Jesse to move forward in the relationship. I want to tell them that they were created for one another at a time in movies that we want them to die for each other. Their story is what we want and perhaps most of us never reach. This is about love. But it's not a stupid thing, like "notting hills" or that kind of movie This is life and I believe in them. I believe they are falling ... This is smart and impressive. I just finished watching last minute and I'm still there ... I want to go to Vienna. I want to see them as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I am now hating people and feeling that if love is just a fake concept. But with this movie In some way and sometimes some things may happen. <br /> <br /> I'm a French man and don't know. July. Delpy. Even Kieslowski. "Three colors: white." another Work because you look like an angel and have a perfect show. <br /> <br /> I saw "before the sunset" (the sequel of Paris) a few days before I saw it. "Before sunrise" and they are not important. They are both masterpieces. Prove that you do not need to make an impression with technology to receive pure feelings. I'm sorry for my English, which I try my best. <br /> <br /> Frua in France
