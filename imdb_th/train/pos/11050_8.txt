Magic works in a mysterious way. This film is about four prisoners who tried to escape with the help of a spell written by another prisoner centuries ago. It is a wonderful mystery horror movie that has many surprising endings and doubts. Although it has something in the drama - drama (almost everything happens in the cell), it never gets boring and it is doing very well in the tradition of "cube" that you feel is attached to the character and even if they To be a criminal, you have developed some sympathy with them only to change your mind by twisting the story used. Some events prevent you from being careful and having insanity in the air. Violence and overall entertainment and because I didn't expect anything at all. (Friends rent it) It's a positive surprise!
