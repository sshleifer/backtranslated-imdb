It doesn't shoot well, write well, or do it well. But it must be the most attractive item I have ever seen since Twin Peaks. Every revelation is well timed so you have to watch the next episode to close. They slow down the speed of the performances in which they reveal little information per episode. But it feels like they just tell you everything you want to know However, some performances are scary and some of them are completely cruel. Some characters have two dimensions. More experienced actors, such as Locke and Echo, are more prominent than the actors playing Jack Kate Sayid and others. The development of the show is also very disappointing since the following episodes may not be shown What did the previous episode lead to? The annoying side plot has become part of a story that sometimes doesn't tell you anything. However, the second season has developed to the point where the story unfolds about the island more than it used to be. Overall, it's a great show. But not perfect
