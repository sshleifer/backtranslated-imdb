And I really like Isabelle Blais !!! She is very cute in this movie and is different from her role in "Quebec-Montreal", which she is more like a cannibal I think she should be nominated for Jutra. I mean, Syvlie Moreau is good, but Isabelle is better than IMO. Pelletier works well for the first time and I noticed that he sneaked into his two friends from Rock et Belles Oreilles, Guy A. LePage and Andre Ducharme. It's fun to see them on this issue. I don't know if they will appear. <br /> <br /> I don't think I've ever watched a romantic love movie from Quebec that I don't like and this one is as good as that. Happy to see And if you are in the US and wondering how you can get a copy of the DVD www.archambault.ca Sent to me in less than a week
