My parents took me to watch this movie when I was nine. I never forget it I have never seen beautiful things like Elizabeth Taylor before. (She was twenty-two when she walked from Elephant Walk.) Remember, I'm nine years old, so the feeling isn't about sex. I just want to sit at her feet like a puppy and stare at her. She began to show her age. (She was almost seventy-four), but I still believe that she is one of the most beautiful and amazing women who have ever lived. <br /> <br /> I've been watching movies many times. Since and it is a joyous drama Of course, the thing that can help is the beauty of Miss Taylor. The beautiful scenery, the splitting of elephants is very impressive and the point that makes people arrogant in the face of nature. A couple of hours to watch movie or video channels rented
