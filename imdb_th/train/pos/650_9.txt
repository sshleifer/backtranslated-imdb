Great movies that are more challenging than entertainment. Sadly, there are no memorable words here. But my favorite person: Alexandre: If you leave someone you love, you have to say what I told you now: "Goodbye, I'll go." But the disappearance to hide as a criminal. (Not watching with English subtitles) <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is an expression of everything. There are many strategies related to the relationship between Alexander and others, and everyone is craving for a little more truth. However, knowing the truth can hurt more and more, according to Alexandre's experience. The common interpretation is that this film criticizes the only possibility of "Liberated love" by describing the undesirable effects on the people involved It shows reliably. But I will thank you if that reason has been treated more deeply: not that liberated love is in itself a term that will fail, but people (especially men, I think) should work on their own and try Overcoming the morals before and not through the training of liberated love <br /> <br /> That said the movie is realistic and worthwhile.
