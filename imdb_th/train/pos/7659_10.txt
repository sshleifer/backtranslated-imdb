Just finished watching this movie, which made me very disappointed. I've been to South Africa twice during the time this movie was created. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult and the opening scenes often 'make the scene'. Slow but steady speed increases makes it almost Can't stop and have a little time. <br /> <br /> Will not be able to see Nigel Hawthorne again. He finds himself very distorted and I find myself not. Like him more every time he appears <br /> <br /> Agree with Steve-Tram's clear opinion.
