For me, this is a great introduction about the talent and beauty of Marion Davies. She is not only beautiful but hilarious in this movie. (I believe Lucille Ball might model her career in Davies' style, which may be called "San Beauty"). And the star watching elements for fans of the silent era with many pendants add overall fun It combines elements of character, character and adult drama and old romance without time. For all movie fans who have a violent reaction to watching movies quietly sitting, watching this thing and it may change your attitude. <br /> <br />
