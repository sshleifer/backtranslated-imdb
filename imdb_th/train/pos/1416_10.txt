EARTH is a must see for children and adults. My son was very happy to see these funny birds and ice bears. We can learn a lot from this film and we should be proud of our great treasures on earth. There are some animals in danger that will disappear. That problem should prevent all officials in our world. <br /> <br /> This documentary presents many special images I have never seen before. Then it will come with heaven music. The director has done a great job here, which is highly respected. Nothing can stop me and my family to give EARTH the highest rate. I hope that will create a sequel.
