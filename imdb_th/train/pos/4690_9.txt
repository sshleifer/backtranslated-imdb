Twenty-five years ago I performed this film in class, some children in entomology and still able to remember the excitement of the children; They are spellbound! It is not just a termite that builds and lives in the "clay castle", but also about other animals that use a rock pile. There is a magical scene where the cobra fights with a lizard monitor while the mongoose looks. It's not only good for Entomology classes only But also for teaching about ecology because there is a lot about the interaction between termites and other living things and the whole ecology of all living things that live in and around the hills. <br /> <br /> I hope It will be available on DVD so I can watch it again and show it to others.
