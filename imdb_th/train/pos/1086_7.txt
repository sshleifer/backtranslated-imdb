This film has a slight abnormality in which it has a very thin plot and the movie itself is made slowly and comfortably. Although this is different from the general Grant movie, it can still be viewed and highly entertaining. It's like someone says "Let us follow Carrie around and watch as he suffers from minor problems that occur when you have a home that is being treated." Considering what he was a comedian in the film The great support he received from Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas. This film works very well. While the film has a modest excuse But it is the best material It's a great movie for Cary Grant fans or the whole family.
