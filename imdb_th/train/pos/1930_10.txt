This movie is a hilarious, original and beautifully directed joke. I became a terrible swim group. Follow me at the film festival whenever I can. I have seen about half a dozen now and every time the response of an enthusiastic audience confirms my feelings that this is one of the best movies to be released this year. In almost every festival that has been selected, will be sold out or won the audience's favorite award. Obviously, people love this movie and more clearly why they do it. The film has excellent looks and excellent performances, a great ending and a direction full of compassion, wisdom and the art of perfect moments. It's hard to believe that this is Ishai Setton's first movie. I hope it will be released soon so everyone can see it.
