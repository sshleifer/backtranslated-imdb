Blackadder 3 may be the least known series that people have heard - it has the same principles as the second and fourth, and there is no revolution. But it was also excellent - the Duke of Wellington, the fiery and ignorant priest, as Dr. Johnson (the author of the first dictionary in English) made this series to be considered too. There is one more hilarious piece that will be delivered in this series, and it presents humor in a little-known era - in the past, right and fun episode. Blackadder's third outing was not famous and famous. But the role of Rowan Atkinson as Butler to the stupid prince is funny and can be done effectively and Hugh Laurie is great! 9/10
