I just sat through a 45-minute roll that was very fun. <br /> <br /> Roll is about a Mat country boy (Toby Malone) who has a dream to be a sports star. Matt travels to the city and must go Get cousin George (Damien Robertson) That is the next plan. George deals with tiny gangsters. (John Batchler) and is shipping him. No need to say Mat was dragged into George's world. <br /> <br /> I think it's great that Mat teaches George to have virtue and respect while George teaches. Ways to relax and enjoy the life of Matt Toby and Damien were cast together and worked well. <br /> <br /> All the characters in the movie watched each other very well. Two policemen were great. David Ngoombujarra brought the cartoon. A great story coming to the movie Tiny playing as a gangster that reminds me of one of my favorite characters, 'Pando' from Two Hands. <br /> <br /> Another thing I like about Roll is that it shows the city. Where I grew up and Live in Perth and Fremantle for 20 years. It is good to see the attractions and landmarks that I grew up with, especially with the old Ferris wheel. <br /> <br /> Rocks this
