This is the fun "history" of the FBI. But it should be seen as a fictional story because that's what it is What would be more when Jay Edgar Hoover personally approved and played a role in the production of James Stewart as usual, and the supporting actors, except the incompetent Vera Miles, were very good. Murray Hamilton is a supporting role as Stewart's partner and best friend. The success of the FBI that the movie highlights are undoubtedly true. The important thing is that it is gone. <br /> <br /> One of the most embarrassing parts of this movie is the picture of John Dillinger's murder. It is beautifully transmitted as it happens. But no mention was made by the head of the Chicago office Melvin Purvis, who is the head of operations The operation will be replaced as if Chip Hardesty was wearing. It has been said that Hoover was the envy of public relations that Purvis received after Dillinger was killed. Purvis was later moved to a far away port and shortly after leaving the FBI. No doubt why Purvis never mentioned it. In this movie But at least this audience stopped thinking that if Purvis did this, things about all the agents that performed all the other things that appeared in the movie They were ignored and replaced by a hardy character. <br /> <br /> This movie should be accurate in showing FBI activities until the end of World War II. However, after this point, the film will allow us to believe that the only threat that the United States must face is from international communism, which is without a doubt what Hoover's beliefs do. Still occur in the south Never mind that blacks are being intimidated to prevent them from voting in the South. I don't know if the FBI started to intercept Martin Luther King data at the time the film was created or not. But if not, it will not be long after that. It starts. <br /> <br /> The first thing I say here is quite good entertainment. But it should be seen as a hygienic assumption
