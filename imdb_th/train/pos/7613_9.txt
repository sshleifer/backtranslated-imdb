/ The first episode that I saw at Los makes me think that I think this is something that some people are wrong and have been chased by a giant monster. But it's not like that. It's more than that because they're not monsters and every time you see Lost, it gets better every time. A deserted island with underground bunkers and especially the connection between people crossing the path together before they fall. That is the true secret. <br /> <br /> This rule and I can't wait to know what's going on there. I hope they won't air the last 2 episodes in this series. Deserved 9 out of 10
