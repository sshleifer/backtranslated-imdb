This movie is a long-awaited movie which is quite disappointing because I have set it up. When watching it again, I have to say that it's practical. First, it is very true to the original history. (Of course, not perfect) and is the same as that made to fit the movie. The history of the modest child is truly expressed and true to the manuscript. The show may not be the best and the plot is quite thin. But when you compare it to the 1966 movie, Vitti is better because he doesn't try to be a stage. In general, I would recommend Modesty Blaise fans or people who catch it on TV only.
