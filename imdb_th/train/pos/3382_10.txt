Often I have feelings for this movie. But it's clear that this movie has a hunch of seeds. <br /> <br /> We shouldn't tend to be panicked and see the world in something. But we do not talk about "1984" or if James Orwell knew the Internet became a reality shortly after 1984. In fact, it was in 1994; He may think of writing his story like he did. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter. The important thing is that we tend to look at ourselves above our environment. But actually became emotional about "Love Apple" when needless knocked on our door The whole picture of us in old age <br /> <br /> No matter what time it is for us, I know that we haven't seen the beginning of it. <br /> <br />
