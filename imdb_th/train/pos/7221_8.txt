Every time you think you have a Deathtrap, another plan happens. Best to just sit and enjoy this ride on. Mostly it is known that it was a kissing scene between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve (which is a shame that was cut from the version that I saw). This movie has many suggestions to suggest Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) as a person. That is not very happy When successful dramatists, many of his last plays in Broadway, failed. And while his wife Myra (Dyan Cannon) has nothing but support, both in terms of finance and emotional feelings, this makes Sydney's feelings a little better. In order to increase insult to injury, the young playwright Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) recently sent Sidney to play. This is the first time Anderson and Sydney can see that a young man is a talented writer. He joked with his wife that he should invite Anderson to kill him and submit his own plays. She laughed at him at first, but when Sidney actually invited Anderson to dinner, she worried that he might actually make his plans. And her fear may be proved ... <br /> <br /> It's a great script. There are twists and turns throughout the plot, and it becomes faster and more angry when you approach the end. It's a type of movie that has you at the edge of the seat from the beginning and keeps you there all the time. The masterpiece of suspense and absolute mystery. <br /> <br /> The performance is great. Ken shows his usual great performance, and he shows a talent for playing culturally trained. Reeve also gave a wonderful performance of people who didn't look wide or innocent as he saw. The artillery frenzy works well for Myra and Irene. Worth a good job as a psychotic nosy neighbor. <br /> <br /> This is the movie that has the ending. Never expected before and watching repeatedly, watching the classics that didn't sing, which, unfortunately, can only remember the exciting scenes at that time and that is a real shame.
