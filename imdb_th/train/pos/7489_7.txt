This film has a lot of strengths. It has one of the best horror movies outside the circle. Lugosi-Karloff-Chaney: Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye, including Melvyn Douglas, the top man Character type "Igor", beautiful woman, even the furious Burgomeister. The function of the soft focus camera is emotional and creative. Although there is a good relief cartoon, spaced throughout the whole story, <br /> <br /> But it's not a monster movie because nothing supernatural happens in "Kleinschloss" ("Little Castle") The plot revolves around a typical mad scientist (played by Atwill) that focuses on his work more than human life. <br /> <br /> It's not a class material. Elite because of the resolution of Ho-Hum and the embarrassing dialog box for Dwight Frye, but it's worth it to watch if you like horror pictures soon.
