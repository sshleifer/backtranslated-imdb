Hello Playmates. Recently I watched this movie for the first time and it was my first experience with Arthur Askey. I have to admit that I was very impressed with this film. As a big fan of black and white movies in general, a passport to Pimlico, a mob, a lavender and Tommy Trinder (which is clearly a distant relative), this movie appeals to the story that gives old English humor. Good I noticed that there were some people who criticized Askey's performance, but in my opinion, it stood the test of time, a good example of a forty-old cartoon show, and if there was anything in the picture by creating Characters that are more than just patterns It seems to have an influence on the movie. Now, if you can catch this movie, I suggest you stop this. The shame of these movies will not appear on Sunday afternoons anymore. I'm glad to have the opportunity to watch. Another piece Of work by Arnold Ridley (Private Godfrey in the Army of the Father).
