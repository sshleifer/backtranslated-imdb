Spoiler !!! This film is based on What If? Of course Mr Destiny will be able to answer this question. The main character must go through the same bad days as many of us and ask this question. Chaos theory identifying butterflies in China may affect someone here from a chain reaction. The importance of this film depends on one event during the baseball game. This event caused fate. Like Ashton in "The Butterfly Effect", except Mr. Destiny uses comedy and drama. The result is a relatively new and original movie. If one person's philosophy is in line with "The Butterfly Effect", we should be happy with Mr. Destiny. I gave 7 out of 10 amazing things for me to see the first half of this movie 3 times and finally see the ending. Of TBS
