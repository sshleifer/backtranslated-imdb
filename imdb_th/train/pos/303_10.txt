Since the day I watched this movie when it came out in 1981, it was one of my three favorites. What I wrote for Amazon is below and I'm just excited that it finally came out on DVD on 10/17/06 - 25th anniversary movie of <br /> <br /> Credit once Finally, in this film, describe the appeal - "Thank you to the Manhattan people who filmed this island." A charming and witty romantic comedy is a love story written to New Yorkers. (Peter Bogdanovich is a native) who can identify all positions (West 12th Street, Ansonia, FAO Schwartz, Plaza, Roxy, Chez Brigitte and City Limits, which are Country & Western Club). That the whole set of actors clicked off the screen as they did, and this intimacy was communicated clearly I laughed. I cried better than CATS, not just Dorothy Straten's poetry. It was also the last appearance of Audrey Hepburn. (She has a cameo after this movie) and her inner beauty is absorbed from the screen. Buy to make a big popcorn and curl up with your loved ones.
