Lost is the best TV series at first. It has great actors and is a great director. Writing is a controversial issue because in the first two seasons, writing is not unusual. But after Season 3, who is Jacob? Why is there a polar bear on the fog island? The island is gone. Who is Richard Alper? A lot of people think that writers disappear and make them question. And many puzzles They can't explain. I believe that these people are wrong. I have confidence in the writers. I think that if the mystery is revealed now, all the charms of the series will go away. And it will continue for a long time
