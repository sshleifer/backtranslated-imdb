Has not seen this film for a long time in 1958 and is very happy with Kim Novak, who plays the role of Gil Holold, who is a real witch, Jack Lemmon. Shepherd Henderson (James Stewart) who is engaged to a woman he will marry; The actor Gillian used magic with the cat and changed his mind about the bride intended to be full of lust and love Gillian. The story tells that the real witch couldn't fall in love, shy or crying, and this began to prove a big problem between Shep and Gillian. So Nick and Aunt Queenie decide what they have to do about the situation. Great movies for repeated viewing and great classic movies from 1958
