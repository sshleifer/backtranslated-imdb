I enjoy this movie But hate because I want to help this guy! I am in my fifties and have many friends in the music business ... which are now still trying to be adults .... no fans, friends, money, etc ... and they're hard to adapt to life. Normally ... when they see a new band and get attention ... it's almost like they have to start over ... This movie is a testament to what the old rocker from the 70s and era 80 is passing .... and that is Things that I found out that the film is sad and depressed. But it shows the life of an old, abandoned rock star and wandering in a convincing way. The girl who comes to his house reminds me of Hollis maclaren (Outrageous) ... and she is A woman in the movie that you will encourage This movie is a must have for people in their 50s who have seen the rise and fall of the band, people who know members and have watched them hurt when they age, creeping and fading away. This is the movie that Perfectly almost ... sad. But in a positive light .... because whales must watch!
