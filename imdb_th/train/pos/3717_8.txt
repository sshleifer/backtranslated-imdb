When I saw Napoleon Dynamite only I remember seeing a pocket nutcracker. Just a beautiful confidence and never bowed to being a mess There are some great movies and bringing a wonderful girl. It caught more than the nostalgia of time. It has a true heart for it. It is a beautiful and painful childhood Achilles. Simple things are always effective when done well. Glendyn Ivin, this person has a great future and I'm looking for his next project. Tracking is always the most different. It's like the second blues album for most people. <br /> <br /> I'm just hoping that his next movie isn't going to be a lame movie like the Bravo Sharks.
