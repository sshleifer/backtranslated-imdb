I always like movies that show life as it is. Sometimes life has boring patches, no real plot, and no need to end up happily. "The river flows through it" is the perfect name for this film. (And Norman's Maclean's novel) Life flows and flows like a river and it has rough spots. But it's a wonderful journey. <br /> <br /> Robert Redford brings things to the movie. His description has a friendly feeling that fits perfectly with the image. As a director, he controls and calms and captures incredibly beautiful scenes. As for the performance, Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt performed well as brothers. I do not know how to explain Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn's performances, except that they feel real. "The river flows through it" is a great movie. <br /> <br /> 8.6 out of 10
