Everyone we encountered, influence our thinking, change our approach a little bit of them crush us, "the eighth day" used in this theme (compare the "Rainmaker") in the film Harry (Daniel Auteuil. ) Businessmen, sales psychologists, meet with Pascal Duquenne, a Down syndrome child. The winning performances from these two actors make this movie strong. The opening sequence is great that Georges relates to his theory of the creation of the world and in the closing scenes we discover what God created on the eighth day. There are some moments in the story that makes it very frustrating to Harry, for example, the Georges completely uninhibited like expensive shoes and not enough money. It's a scene where you laugh through tears. I liked the scene with Down syndrome on a trip to an art gallery escape on a bus and the door collapsed amusement Paradis something amusing Among the most infamous was the scene where Harry and Georges float past on the highway. When looking back, Georges gave respect to the driver. But there are some gentle scenes as well, especially the impressive close-up hands - the hands feel the sun, the wind and the rain. This is a true cinema that touches the heart. There are scenes that moved substantially Georges proposed to Nathan Lee Georges cradles the head of Harry in his arms Georges calling for his mother, his beloved Georges teach. Harry laughs ... I feel beautiful - the presence of grass. (Did you know that it cries when you cut it?), Expense trees, bird songs, little insects - all natural wonders of nature. They are all happy if we sleep. (As Harry and George) to look around us and listen ...... beautiful film.
