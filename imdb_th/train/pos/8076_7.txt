The family is about two families who are under each other's blood. <br /> <br /> Viren Sahay (Amitabh Bachchan) is a hell-carrying people from Bangkok. He has a family in India. He accidentally kills Shekhar (Akshay Kumar). Like Viren Sahay, he has a family. (Brother, wife, and guardian) The Aryan (Aryan) brother of Shakhar went out to avenge the death of his brother. He kidnaps Viren Sahay's family for the same reason. <br /> <br /> The film has a turning point (Amitabh Bachchan). The second half of this movie is his complete, rather than his dialogue. More important than Akshay's diminutive role also makes him at the same level as Amitabh. I don't understand what Bhumika Chawala is doing in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are a few loose points in the script. ; Amitabh has been shown to be the most wanted criminal in the city. The kidnapping of his family seems vague as well. How are the families of major donors without security guarantees?
