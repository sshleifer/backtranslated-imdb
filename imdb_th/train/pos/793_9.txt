I really enjoyed this movie. (Which is the reason why it surprised me to get a low score from many users on this website!) I'm not saying it's a movie masterpiece But it's a great way to use cold and snow on Saturday night It's a joke, pain, and a wonderful story about the friendships that spring up and down the lasting friendship of women through difficult times and bad things that female friends often do for each other! (Accepting women, we are all there!) Bill Paterson shines as Gerald Marsden and Andie McDowell prove that she can be a good actor when the right role and she makes her thoughts. (And actually there "The best wedding escape" I've ever seen or dreamed of in this movie ... There is more courage than anyone I know!) You will laugh and you will cry --- Don't ignore any marketing campaigns. And how the film is marketing .... it is a hidden gem that should have already made a box office income (Now I have to look around to buy a copy!)
