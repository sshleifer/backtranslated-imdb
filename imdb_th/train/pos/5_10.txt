I came in the middle of the film so I didn't know about any credit or even the title until I watched here, which I saw that it received a wide variety of responses from your commentators. I am optimistic about this movie. But there is one thing that really attracted my attention when I watched: beautiful and delicate scores written in the Coplandesque Americana style. My surprise was great when I actually discovered the score written by John Williams himself. Wrote a delicate and intense score, such as Schindler's list But often associate his name with Star Wars such as But in my opinion, what Williams wrote for this film is beyond everything I've heard about his tenderness, sensitivity and beauty, fully according to the tenderness and plot of the movie. And his latest score for catching me if you can, showing more intelligence and complexity For Stanley and Iris, I like educational movies such as How Green as My Valley and Konrack. One film contains John Voigt and charged with African-American youth in South Carolina. Awakening the soul is a story that cannot be told often enough. This is a great addition to that category.
