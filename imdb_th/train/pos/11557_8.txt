Often laughing out loud, sometimes the tragic story of two divorced people - Lemmon "husband-house" with clean neuropathy and maturing as a dirty athlete - who decide to live together To reduce the cost. <br /> <br /> Take pictures and be well directed. The script is very thorny - that is, there is always more than one side, almost every line. The comedy scene, in particular, involves 2 English sisters (Evans and Shelley) that look amusing by everything that everyone says. But when Lemmon photographed his children and yes, his ex-wife was a woman who sobbed with him before, Matthau could appear with the promised drink. <br /> <br /> Very fun.
