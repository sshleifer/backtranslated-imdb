This plot is really scary. The atmosphere is very unusual for low-budget production, and at least for German production. Feeling the spirit of India, a little mystery movie and slasher mixed together. The plot development and the characters are excellent. This scene is close to reality without the studio atmosphere. It may be perfect. Unfortunately, there are some things that are a bit disappointing in general. Things that are not needed for a low-budget movie: <br /> <br /> 1.) Sometimes actors do not exceed the average. Almost every actor. People seem like ordinary people. Some people do good or very good work. But some people act like actors in German courts! But I'm very disappointed with the performance of Mathieu Carri√®re! His performance (In his old movie, his performance is good) here below average! But that may be the reason why today he has a part in the German pyramidal soap or TV series in private channels. <br /> <br /> 2.) Sometimes the dialogue will be at the drama level. <br /> <br /> 3.) Bad voice makes sometimes difficult to understand what the characters say. I saw it on a DVD and glad to be able to go back and listen again. It's caused by the scene (Great hall like in a hospital or with a mysterious group) and sometimes the actor's dialect! <br /> <br /> But in every story, it's an interesting movie worth watching. Far more than commercial movies, which are often more frightening.
