This movie may be one of the "soapies" that are commonly associated with the half-dozen daily events in which their lives have a strong relationship .. broken relationships, new friendships The discovery of babies that were left under some bushes! <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the filmmakers perform in addition to those daily activities and put questions to consider, even if there is no satisfactory answer. He asked that in this disorganized world, doing things that just happened, it was just a fortune or something that was right or a dead view, a predetermined person that would be in a certain place And will his future have a new perspective? Most of us have this strange experience. <br /> <br /> Is it an ego that makes us believe that we are very important? As one character says? He once sat on the edge overlooking the Grand Canyon and came to know that he was so small. <br /> <br /> This is not my favorite movie. But is a study of good human relationships. Danny Glover stands out in a compassionate role.
