This film is excellent in every way that modern action adventure is not. Take some time Relax, enjoy, think. People who watch this movie are slow or boring or really boring. Have to stop the week and watch it many times until the short minded mind comes to grips with the possibility to participate in the cause or story Beautiful in a beautiful place There is no reason other than because do not rush to make the score that you need to firmly in order to get in a short time. At first I was terrified by Brosnan who played as a Native American. When considering the story, I think it's appropriate for casting. Now, come back to my curse. -Jahfre
