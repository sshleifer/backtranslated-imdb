I like Timothy Dalton very much, although he is still young and too handsome for Mr R. But I think Zelah Clarke is too fat and too short. However, this version is very true for novels and filming is very good. I have seen 4 versions. Orson Welles is still my favorite. R Although George C Scott did very well and was a cast between Joan Fontaine and Sussanah York, though The couple is too old for the role. Recently, I saw Rebecca, a great TV series with Charles Dance and Emilia Fox. I like to see both doing Jane Eyre. By the time I watched the Ciarin Hinds version Jane Eyred thought I was, but I could not get the tires in the first few minutes of the hearing of Joan Fontaine recital debut. The first version I've seen I want to go back and read the book again.
