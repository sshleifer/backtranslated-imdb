I love this movie. My only disappointment is that some original songs have changed. <br /> <br /> It's true that Frank Sinatra didn't have the opportunity to sing a lot in this movie. But it's good that it's not just Frank Sinatra <br /> <br /> I think it's actually better to use Marlon Brando's voice while he has a proper voice and I can't see someone with a great voice. <br /> <br /> Stubby Kaye's song "Sit Down, You're Rockin 'the Boat" is the sound of Tappin's feet singing long songs that I love. That is difficult to follow his version and I still like him the most. <br /> <br /> Vivian Blaine is very good in this part and "Adelaide's Lament" is her favorite song. <br /> <br /> I think Jean Simmons is great for this part. Maybe I didn't consider her first. But after seeing her in this section, it was reasonable. <br /> <br /> Michael Kidd's choreography didn't have time. If there is a new scene in 2008, I will not change anything. <br /> <br /> I found something missing from the stage version to the movie. But this makes me feel like being on stage Even if it's a movie, <br /> <br /> I think this movie is very good. I acted as a regional version and one of my favorites during that time.
