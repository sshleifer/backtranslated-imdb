"tragicomedy" written by the famous Serbian drama / film writer Dusan Kovacevic is probably one of the best movies ever in the comedy category. However, the appearance of the theater that transformed into a documentary movie was not worth anything. A masterpiece that should not be missed to see. (Especially with subtitles and not dubbed) <br /> <br /> In the old bus on the way to the capital city of Belgrade, the war that appears will decide the behavior of passengers. Two gypsy musicians sing about their miserable life. But still expecting the coming tragedy Their singing is divided and linked to the steps in this special film on the road (the true Kostic brothers are amateur actors, but together with Stanojlo Milinkovic as a farmer who is plowed on the road Acting in real life) <br /> <br /> The characters give a vivid picture of a society that faces war. Understanding of the people of the country: Everyone is aware that the war is about to begin. But they try to live as best they can, hoping that ignorance can cause tragedy. With the use of a simple film language, director Slobodan Sijan draws a picture of a society torn from the previous war. (World War 1), but also emphasizes the portraits of success: the brotherhood of singers, the unskilled of the newlyweds Is going to visit a newly-enlisted son and a gloomy forecast from a man who seems to be a German spy. <br /> <br /> Great in telling stories with memorable songs (Especially Gispsy music) and the atmosphere is fine Take a picture and edit this feature.
