I was born on the day of "bathing" in the foreign movies of my local video store and passing it many times since the cover, it seemed like a joke or a joke. Then I was lucky to buy a copy at a cheap price and happy with my luck. "Shower" is the story of three (3) men, father and son, two adults (2). Each person accepts the change of Life as the world around them continues to change in modern China. Chinese culture is one of the most interesting aspects of this film as well as many foreign films. <br /> <br /> In addition to the interesting characteristics of Chinese local colors, the setting in this story is Difficult relationship But still touching only one man and woman related to this matter But contrary to the backdrop of the village bathhouse, <br /> <br /> The story of the family moved from a feud to understanding and made me glad to know these people. The main additions are small characters. Lots of customers, bathhouses and conflicts and their friendship. "Shower" is a movie that walks away from smiles and touches with warmth and humanity.
