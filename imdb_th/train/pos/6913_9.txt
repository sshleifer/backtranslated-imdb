As a community theater actor who works hard But not very serious about acting, I enjoy the people who hold it as a great art This film is a plug. Mercilessly "skilled actor" while laughing happily. <br /> <br /> Ham actors for this film are similar to dictators. When the dictator died of a heart attack from drinks and food too, actors were kidnapped and forced to play. "Part of life" by the secret service chief of Neo-Nazi. He played it until the handle made the dictator's girlfriend fall in love with him and on the other hand and turned the table to his beautiful captors. <br /> < br /> Many great actors, many good works By some unknown actors, especially house staff and two members of the security guards in the palace Sammy Davis Jr. makes himself Jonathan Winter, playing as a semi-retired American businessman with other things going on and Raul Julia Sonia Braga and above all, Richard. Drudfuss is a special, stupid movie, but there are many beautiful places (in Brazil), funny scripts and good actors doing things for them and it looks like they're really fun and not through the usual scenes that are about. With what Players only!
