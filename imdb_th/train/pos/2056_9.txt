I don't think most people give credit to this movie as they should. I like horror movies with a low budget and this takes time to make a cake, especially for the initiative. Yes, the scarecrow is a fear of fighting kung fu, but why not no one is willing to go that far. I didn't enjoy watching movies since Candyman, so the city chose this boy who called him a scarecrow. Even his mother didn't care about him. Then he was killed and the spirit penetrated into the scarecrow, which then killed fun. His end is quite easy to guess when the movie starts. The dedication at the end goes directly to many horror directors. But with the great dedication that Dario Argento made me feel really cool in this movie, there was a lot of Arnold tearing with one torpedo. I'll say grab a pizza. Some friends laugh your A $$ with this movie. I love it because the most fun initiative
