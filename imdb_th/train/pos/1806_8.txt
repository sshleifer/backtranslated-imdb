I hope movies for children will continue to do this; Dark and deep, character development (accept this) (and Charlie is the epitome of dynamic characters), the development of great animated plot, emotional participation and rational themes If not for a few music and dance routines, you probably never thought that this was a movie for children and this is the reason I gave such a high rating. This movie is a great movie, not to mention children. Which brought me to my second point: this is the darkest "child" movie I have seen sometimes from 22 years old. I was shocked to see a child under 8 years of age who was not completely scared during The second half and the first half of this film and it ends with one of the saddest endings you've ever seen (ala "Jurassic Bark" for you guys who are fans of "Futurama") and this is what makes This movie So much Just because the movie stimulates the senses at the international level. Usually, we don't like to feel and think that badly doesn't make the movie itself worse. In fact, it means that it is successful. Good comedy movies should make us laugh. A good horror movie should make us afraid. A good sad movie should make us sad. My point is that good movies should move you, not just entertainment. This movie makes me move. <br /> <br /> In addition, this movie is incredibly violent according to today's standards for children's movies and the content that follows today's standards may not be suitable for some children My parents said to watch it first. Normally I don't say anything about this. But I just saw yesterday and it was a surprise for me.
