For the audience that came long after the creation of "Winchester '73", there is something in common with "Casablanca". As you watch, you will get this feeling that you are viewing the ancient string that is common in style Then you know that clichés are only clichés after being copied from this movie and they are widely copied because this film is great. In other words, it is a fulfilling task. <br /> <br /> "Winchester '73" is a pleasure to watch. The wide line of the plot is quite predictable. But mostly because you've seen them copied many times in the next movie The conversation, the rhythm and direction of Mann is excellent. Especially the shining steward, and if you are a fan, this is a "must see", but he is not alone in delivering good performance. The most notable, prudent and / or most witty lines are secondary characters. Because this makes these characters (rather than) more grotesque. Cardboard gives more realism to this film. <br /> <br /> This is an amazingly low-value movie that is worth watching. The DVD also contains interviews with Stewart, which provides some background on the film.
