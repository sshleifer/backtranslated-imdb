<br /> <br /> This movie is one of my favorites. I saw it while in college in the early 90s, and while I couldn't identify with thirty years in the film, I felt that the stories, characters and movies in general were the best. For those who speak negatively about Indian summer, don't hesitate to stick to your Armageddon movie and let this movie be good and useful to those who can appreciate them.
