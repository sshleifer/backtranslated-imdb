This is one of the greatest Disney movies ever. It is a real answer for everyone. It will make you laugh. It will make you cry and it will make you wonder. <br /> <br /> Basically, what Homeward Bound is about is three pet households that are sent to the farm. While the owner travels to rest They don't know what is happening and want to go home. They escape from the farm and try to find their way back home through the wilderness. <br /> <br /> This is one of the last movies that Don starred Ameche. Shadow, an old and intelligent gold creature The movie starring in the movie is Sally Field, which gives the voice of Sassy the Himalayan cat, but seriously what this movie is about for the occasion! Pronounced by Michael J. Fox (my favorite actor of all time), the opportunity is what you expect from a cute, playful, enthusiastic and funny dog, and every time I crack when watching this movie, it's because of the opportunity; It's like a never ending comedy! <br /> <br /> This movie is sometimes sad. Sometimes it makes people think of when they are alone or when pets are lost. <br /> <br /> One scene that makes me wonder is the scene in which the trio try to escape from the pound. In particular, I was shocked at the opportunity to get his collar stuck in the fence and almost didn't make it. This movie has a suspicious moment. But there is no one who looks more suspicious. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a great family movie. If you like this movie, you may also enjoy the sequel. I gave this movie 9 out of 10!
