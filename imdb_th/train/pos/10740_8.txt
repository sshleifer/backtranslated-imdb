Produced by the French brothers Jules and Giddeon Naudet and described by Robert De Niro and firefighter James Hanlon. This is a fascinating and miserable story that shows that today is the darkest day in New York. I saw this for the first time when I was a 12-year-old innocent boy and that age still caught me. Knowing the seriousness of 9/11 that has seen this extend all the results of 9/11, we are finding out who the heroes are, how to dress their daily lives and how they make their lives in situations that most people will. Run away and save yourself These brave men put their lives in line and watch this thing just add my appreciation for them. Look, if you can, this is the best documentary I've personally seen.
