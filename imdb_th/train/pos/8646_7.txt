In 1990, Brad Pitt and Juiliette Lewis performed on TV Too Young To Die, where both played the same part that they played in Kalifornia. I didn't doubt that was what led to their casting in the movie. The giant screen <br /> <br /> Kalifornia finds David Duchovny, the aspiring writer and his young friend, photographer Michelle Forbes, in a strange relationship. By writing a book and entering the mind and soul of a serial killer In fact, he has the most unusual Odyssey plan. He wants to cross the country and visit the website of many famous serial killers. But he and Forbes flattened <br /> <br /> The fate intervened in many ways, rather than the arrival of Brad Pitt and Juliet Lewis. The strange southern partner agreed. To divide the cost of gas in this country. Traveling It turns out that Pitt is a serial killer himself, and he decides to do a little research of himself by penetrating deep into the hearts of the obsessed In my thoughts, <br /> <br /> Kalifornia is not the type of movie I tend to Go for it, but in fact, the ability to show and talents of Brad Pitt make it work at a high level. Pitt is a definition of the gothic refugees who are descended from liberation. But better than him is Juliet Lewis, who shows low self-esteem, which she seems to do well again. Watch her scene with Forbes as she does the hair and Lewis describes her sad and pathetic life. Lewis 'dialogue and Forbes' reaction should be shown in class throughout the country. <br /> <br /> For those who like their flicks, they don't come better than Kalifornia.
