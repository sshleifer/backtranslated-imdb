Fast and simple. I love this movie. <br /> <br /> As everyone else said, I haven't come from the south, not interested in country music and never wearing a cowboy hat. (I never drive around with a car with a corpse in the chest, but I love "Goodfellas"). This is just a great movie creation. Shoot at a ratio of 2.35 and transfer to DVD beautifully (VHS is 1.33 full screen) and yes, stable ingredients. 5.1 For your viewing pleasure. What do you say about this movie <br /> <br /> It's a great love / hate story in Texas that has a great performance. Travolta is great. Next to "Pulp Fiction", it's the best thing he has done in my top 5 for 25 years !! <br /> <br /> Let's see! !! It's 10 !!!!
