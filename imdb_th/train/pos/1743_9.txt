After watching a lot of Greek movies, I was very skeptical about most movies. But after watching this, I was surprised. Great movie without having to try big. You cannot claim that the screenplay is great or that the shooting is perfect or has some technique. It is true and happened in the Greek countryside in a forgotten place of God. This movie is like a punch in my stomach and I hope that things will not be like this. Obviously, it speaks of the foreigners' hatred of the Greeks (ignorance) and the different things. The problem of this man is not that he was convicted in the past. The problem is that he is not one of these people. He is different and they don't need them. (That is why all the good things he did were boomerangs changed him) and also talked about the indifference of people because there were some people who resisted the king's hunt. But they did not dare to say their opinions In the end, you can clearly see that the hypocrisy of that society is a religion and try to act like God says. But at the same time showing unfairness to the king This shows that people easily rationalize their feelings or beliefs according to the established system. In the end, you will get a positive lesson from this terrible story, which means you can understand and be a part of this society only if you want to be one of them. If you want to remain different and be alone, you get lost. (And not far from reality) I think it's sad that the story is true and this should be a bell for everyone There is no comment for the main actors because he has already won and I believe his plays are excellent. A small comment for Hatzisavvas (playing as a cop). He is like a dinosaur. He has many roles and I'm sure that this chapter for him is very easy. But he plays very well so you can't deny him. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good Greek movie.
