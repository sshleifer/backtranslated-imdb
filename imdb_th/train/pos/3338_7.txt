Fever Pitch is a fun movie. It had a very funny time. (Including fun disturbing shower scenes) as with most romantic comedies, it has a "dead zone" in the middle which is heavy. "She broke up with me." Things happened. But other than that, it was still funny until the end. <br /> <br / Although the plot revolves around the Red Sox fanatic. But did not have too many sports You don't have to be a fan of this movie. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's easy for me to say: I've been a Red Sox fan since I was a boy. <br /> <br /> 7 from 10 <br /> <br /> Barky
