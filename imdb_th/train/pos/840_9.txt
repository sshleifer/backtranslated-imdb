Not sure what will happen to this movie. I love watching Brosnan in every movie. He's always good. But this thing is totally different. He is organized and plays well. In fact, he reminded me of myself in the university 2-3 times :) Yes, there is not much violence, not much action. But the conversation was broken. The performance was excellent and very refreshing and very funny too :) I don't think you will come out of the cinema to "Wow! I'm blown away. "But you'll smile out and enjoy a good movie. Can't ask for more. <br /> <br /> Oh, and if you're lucky, some mental retardation will cause the ad to roll wrong and you will get upside down. (With voice reversal)) Advertising !! Bright, there is nothing like watching the ad, Jack Daniels, where the drink goes back into the bottle from the glass with an American description of "Twin Peaks" that is rude. :)
