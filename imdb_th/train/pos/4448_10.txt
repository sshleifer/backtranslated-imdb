Watch this movie yesterday for the first time and enjoy it thoroughly. I am a student writing the screen and I like the way the little characters intervene when things that are pivotal / climatic are happening in the scene. <br /> <br /> I think the conversation is very sharp and the evidence of The story is quite shocking - at one point, Barbara Stanwijk is openly flirting with her daughter's girlfriend. And reflecting on her husband's fascination which she had not seen in the next ten years And with gunshot signals 'Two shots from one shot', she connects with her old friend who is shy. (The reason she left town at first!) All the time! Most moral people have to get all the lights when they see this flick. Back in the 50s <br /> <br /> Love costumes and movies and straight from hip conversations - just to see Barbara Stanwyck and Co do. 'Rabbit Hug' is a good reason to rent this movie on DVD. <br /> <br /> One of the best movies from that period I've seen for a long time.
