This is Arnold's movie. Now you know that I have helped you a lot in reading this review. If you don't like Arnold, you won't like this movie. If it is another case, you may like it a lot. It's that easy. <br /> <br /> Now, if you still read it, I think you like Arnold. Good for you! He is quite good, not him. Running Man is a typical feature of Arnold. It has the usual retro-era future that we know well from the 80s of B-Sci Fi. It has a group of terrifying, violent and explosive explosions and a good-looking heroine and happy ending. <In this case, the evil opponent is the 1984ish government that can control all of which use television as an effective crowd control with the type of fighter game. Of course, Arnold became one of these shows and turned it upside-down with a little help from both the South and the good-looking amber. <br /> <br /> It's not a big budget. The big movie, but it can also create a good atmosphere in the future with matte paintings and sets that will help hopelessly into the 80s. But I found it charming The show is diverse. Arnold makes his usual grunt and shout with the help of a rocky torpedo. The heroine, Amber, is said to speak softly and Damen Killian is an evil TV actor. <br /> <br /> Despite all the shortcomings, the film clearly shows its message. Television is the drug of the masses, a good way to control people. There are also some features when the future of digital video editing helps villains change faces in the video to fool their audience. This does not look like the future, which is a bit shocking. <br /> <br /> If you have watched Arnold's movies before, you will know when to watch. Fun.
