This is a comedy acting in a creepy manner, like in Tim Burton's movie. It's worth watching because it's more creative than this season's show. Above all, it's not a "reality" show. I wonder why the audience is ready to receive such an item. (Which lacks creativity) and ignores this wonderful program that is creative. <br /> <br /> While some people condemn me It's really unusual More fun than "Ghost Whisperer" and "Medium". I think it's the most fun thing on the subway, from "My Name is Earl". <br /> <br /> Oh and the lectures and music are great. If you enjoy showing off the beaten path, I recommend It's not as strange as Twin Peaks. But it was seriously bent
