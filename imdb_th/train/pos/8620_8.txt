I just watched the 139 minute version (widescreen) with friends and we blown away. I will not repeat what others say. What the filmmakers did with the concept was unexpected and fun. The great battle is tiring. After that, we were shocked to find that there were still nearly 30 minutes to go, but that did not prevent us from being fully engaged and entertained. It's and that is scary. Music / songs, blues, country music / country songs and rock music are not here and every time we use all of us laughing with laughter. Warned But storytelling and storytelling help you reasonably. <br /> <br /> There are many outstanding moments that make you appreciate the talents behind the camera. There are many benefits of silence and beautiful, slow-motion photography. I hope I can delete the song, but <br /> <br /> find this It's fun, it's different and takes you to places you don't expect and it's very refreshing.
