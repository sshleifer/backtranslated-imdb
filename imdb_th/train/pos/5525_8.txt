Many problems that many people have with this film are that they seem to think that the story should be more fun. (Do not care whether it depends on the real story) or talk to the glorious movie Che). This film is close to Jon Anderson's clear biography on Che and makes the story right. Soderburgh works perfectly. Great to set the mood for the unbelievable collapse, that is Che's adventure in Che. You are impressed by the cowardice and confusion of the Bolivian peasants. The revolution of Che, or the hardships his people faced hunger and terrain. Sorry to be bored with the interest of challenging movie fans there. But that's how it happened So don't watch this movie, expecting to have a Rambo shot. It's real!
