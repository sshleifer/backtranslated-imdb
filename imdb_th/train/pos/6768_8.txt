One of my favorites in the 80s, after the first season, it started to fall when they decided to add Jean Bruce Scott to the selection. Deborah Pratt is great and fun to see her and Ernest Bondnine's characters together. The last episode that she appeared as one of my favorites in the second season Unfortunately, during that time, black people did not spend long time on TV. Some episodes in the second season, okay But the third season is more about human characters than Airwolf, and it's not shown until almost the end of the show. When arriving in the United States, it's disgusting !!!
