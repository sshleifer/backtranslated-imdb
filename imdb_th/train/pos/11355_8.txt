I was amazed at how charming this movie was. The performance is very good, especially with Rea as a sympathetic detective. <br /> <br /> Despite having a low budget, but without a big FX or a flashy photographer, Citizen X can beat the movie. The big Hollywood, just by telling the story <br /> <br /> The real story usually ends with a more groan than bang, and that's the case here. But other than that, this is a detective story that is highly recommended.
