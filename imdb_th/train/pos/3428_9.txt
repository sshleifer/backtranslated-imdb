I saw this movie in NYC tonight at Landmark Sunshine. I don't know what to expect. I didn't read much about it because I knew I would see it no matter what happened. Overall done very well. It does not focus on the general characteristics of the order. "Anti-war" which, for me, did not make politics Most soldiers talk about their toxicity in training in the boot camp and how difficult it is when they return to civilian life. It is a good thing to see Paul Rieckhoff and Camilo Mejia talking about the hardships of survival, not only the war but the refusal to return to morality Don't make mistakes - this is not an anti-war movie. Anyone who says that he has not seen or is not with the scars of war with their spirits
