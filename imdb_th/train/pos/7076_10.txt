The movie is very strong. Bruce is good and Brad is the same. <br /> <br /> Because I think there are two cities that missed the receptionist list from the list that Bruce remembered. <br /> <br /> That means women are real insurance and She works. <br /> <br /> Okay, Novikov's features seem to me to work in this movie. However, I believe in the theory, going back to the future of worldly diversity. <br /> <br /> So Bruce can save the world. But not his world. <br /> <br /> In the theory of parallel worlds The man can find himself. <br /> <br /> And I believe that there is no problem. Here I disagree with Dr. Brown from the back <br /> <br /> But the story of the 12 monkeys has their own beauty. Although all these theories of one world or many people or one can believe that he is really crazy and his doctor-girlfriend just got lost. <br /> <br /> The sequence of events that might make her believe that he came. From the future, ammunition - may be something wrong. <br /> <br /> I like this movie - have to buy a DVD. <br /> <br /> The best.
