Sabrina the Teenage Witch is one of my favorite T.V life shows: D I've watched it later every day when I go home. Until now, I think I have watched every episode at least once and the whole series 3 or 4 times. Melissa Joan Hart plays the perfect girl / witch with normal teenage problems that we can all relate to. She is funny, clever, witty, and many others. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick are well matched with Sabrina Zelda's aunt, the genius scientist and Hilda, who is mad and incompetent, creating the perfect balance of life. Sabrina, although I have to admit that the college year is not as good as her high school years. But that does not mean that they are not good. I think the ending is great, although it's not what I hoped for. It was reasonable and I liked it a lot :)
