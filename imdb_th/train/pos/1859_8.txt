In the introduction of his director, Denzel Washington brings the true story that happens to be a very difficult story coming to the screen with the honesty that we expect from the efforts of the Washington show. But now we see it as a director. <br /> <br /> Recently, we have seen some bad consequences for children who are under public protection. This story tells of the existence of nightmares that leave scary scars. But showing the victory of the human spirit in the end. <br /> <br /> We can choose the first attempt by closing too much and not the best. Editing these scenes But the simplicity of other scenes that show this power cannot be explained. <br /> <br /> If the educational institution sees this movie, it will be an imitation. This film does not have to punch and go to the strenuous facts of the story with innocence, usually not above the novel from the screen. Of course, this is a tribute to the director. <br /> <br /> This is so amazing. Try and tell your friends to watch!
