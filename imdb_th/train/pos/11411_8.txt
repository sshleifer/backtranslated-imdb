But it is clear that Van Dine has to sell his rights to each book about Philo Vance, one by one. Please note that Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers and many other Philo Vance films have only Tarzan to travel. Hollywood more than ever. <br /> <br /> MGM produced Case Kard, murdered and starred Edmund Lowe as a fashion detective. Of course, MGM has Philo's original screen. Under the contract at that time, but Bill Powe ll being busy making The Thin Man at that time and I think Louis B. Mayer decided to concentrate on him there. <br /> <br /> Edmund Lowe accepted Philo Vance. Lowe started quite large.
