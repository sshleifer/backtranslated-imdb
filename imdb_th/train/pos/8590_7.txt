When I saw that Keifer Sutherland played the character I liked the most in the history of the TV, it was a conclusion before I went to the movies and spent $ 15 on this. br /> <br /> This film deals with the leaks that the intelligence officers plan to assassinate the president. It seems that only a promising candidate is Pete (Michael Douglas) that is well-decorated. Begging Pete's innocence with the fun of refugee style to find the truth. <br /> <br /> It's hard, but it's definitely not exciting. Good actor, good story But it makes me feel a little empty
