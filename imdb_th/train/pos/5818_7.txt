In fact, this movie has a silly moment both in the soil and in Joe Pesci and the children's section, and it's worse than other MJ movies like "The Wiz", "Captain Eo" and "Ghosts". Michael Jackson's girlfriend who has been dead for nearly eleven years (Yes, that's half my life! You!) I can't complain too much. Just seeing this cute guy and listening to his wonderful song is a journey to heaven for me. But as a movie, it's not good at all, and I am afraid that it will get a much lower grade for me if my dear Mike is not the one shown in it. But since no one other than Mike IS, the moon stroller must get 7 out of 10 from me.
