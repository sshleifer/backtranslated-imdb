I've been watching many times since I thought it was a romantic and funky joke. It's a romantic comedy and may be a bit old. However, it is not too sensitive as in the form of office politics, adultery and loneliness. You think you know what is heading But there are elements of unpredictability that attract your attention and not everything that happens as you expected But with wisdom and charm enough to touch the most insulting person If you find someone who doesn't like this movie, consider seriously how you want to know them.
