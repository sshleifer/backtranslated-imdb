I know I know it's a good ending. But with sincerity, it's great I love when the movie ends in a completely dark nature. But this time I was impressed with Darth Vader who turned against the emperor. The pain sequence in this movie is when Luke is tortured and defeated by the Emperor / Darth Sidia. He is about to be destroyed when the Dark Lord, the Dark Lord, the Dark Master, eliminates the Darkness's leader. he Good sacrifice The film of this film is impressive. I was surprised with all the ships of the battleship and the Imperial War ships and destroyers of all superstars. I like the new competition that they present on the screen. Mon Calomari, ewoks, sullesteian (Lando's co-pilot) and many more ... Most of my favorite scenes are in this movie: 1 when Vader destroyed Emperor and seriously wounded. 2- When Luke saw the spirit of Obavan and Yoda, then Anakin Sky Walker appeared. (Sebastian Shaw) (The greatest scene in Star Wars) 3- When Leia kills Jabba, strangles Lord Hutt. <br /> <br /> I like the script and fight. Ender's presentation of ground and space battles, including the best battles of Star Wars between Darth Vader Vs Luke Skywalker on the Death Star. Post-script: A scene with Leia. In bikinis, slaves are memorable. 9/10
