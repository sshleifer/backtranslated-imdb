I love the cinema, so what I'm going to confess my shyness deeply I lifted my finger to "Che, Episode 1 and 2" without watching the movie. I knew very badly but I felt that it was a trap made by ... Who? I don't really know, but there are negative words that spread like wildfire, and no matter how intelligent I think I am. But fortunately I collided with the movie director Martin Martin Donovan, the man I loved and admired. When I told him that I would not see it because I knew that this movie was a failure, he looked at me as if he was ready to punch me on the face and Donovan was calm! He took me out and told me how much he loves movies and why. I watched both parts immediately and "Che, Episode 1 and 2" is the best movie I have ever seen in 2008. It is a matter of purity that will remind you of some great teachers' work In the past, consideration of the audience is something that we are no longer familiar with. I don't know if we used to be Stunned with no concessions and Benicio del Toro is great. We can see his spirit. We can actually recognize it. Humanity's humanity is overwhelming. So thank Martin Donovan again for giving me faithful education. Bravo Del Toro, Bravo Soderbergh and everyone involved in this film Don't make mistakes that I'm going to do. Go see now on the big screen.
