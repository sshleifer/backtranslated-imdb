Before watching this movie, I thought this movie would be great like Flashpoint, because before watching this movie, Flashpoint was Jenna Jameson's latest movie and Brad Armstrong that I had watched as long as the sex scene was concerned I was disappointed. I thought that the Dreamquest sex scene would be great like the Flashpoint sex scene, but I was disappointed. Except the sex scenes of Asia Carrera, any sex scenes in this movie didn't make me feel good. (You know what I mean.) Jenna Jameson, the great man, didn't do that kind of sex scene in which she could do Felecia and Stephanie Swift. Related sex <br /> <br /> Although it is an adult movie But if you separate from the sex scene If general adult movie standards are concerned, this film will certainly raise the standard of adult movies. The story, direction, makeup, and other technical content of this movie are great. The actors of this movie perform very well. They do very well. Dreamquest certainly raises the quality of adult movies.
