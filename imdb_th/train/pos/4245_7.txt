If the theme of The Girl From Missouri sounds familiar, that is because the screenwriter Anita Lopez has written the classic Blondes Gentlemen Prefer, which is different from Marilyn Monroe in this film. Harlow will accept any type of jewelry from the average guy. <br /> <br /> And a man who means Jean Harlow after She left the hash house on the street where the mother and stepfather did because she decided that the best way to get a simple life was marriage. Her talent as a singer is limited, but she will be able to exchange beauty. <br /> <br /> Odyssey begins with her and friends, Paty Kelly, is invited to perform at the event. The party that was rich in the cast of Lewis Stone, but not known to Jean Stone, had just thrown the last time before he made himself because he had no money. She still argued with a few earrings from him that the wealthy friend Lionel Barrymore noticed <br /> <br /> Lionel made a comedy until Jean saw his son Franchot Tone after He was not fun and he seemed to shake Jean from climbing the family tree. <br /> <br /> Girls from Missouri went into production in the middle, modified the code so it was under the censorship. Strange I felt that we could see more risqu√© movies. Jean Harlow is still the younger and grateful version of Mae West, still admiring. It's a great talent of comics that women have seen when a woman from Missouri is a reminder of the great loss in the film world over the past three years. <br /> <br / > Harlow has no doubt been influenced by the successful shorts that Kelly made with Thelma Todd, another famous golden blonde. Harlow and Kelly have the same chemical qualities. Between Patsy and Thelma, Todd will die a year later with a strange accident / suicide / murder that has never been satisfactorily explained. <br /> <br /> Don't miss a girl from Miss. Bright and cheeky must come from sparkling jewelry.
