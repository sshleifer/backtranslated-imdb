I remember Parker Posey about "As The World Turns" before she became the independent movie queen. In this film, Posey demonstrates her potential as a great actress. In this film that has supporting actors including Omar Townsend as Moustafa, a Lebanese immigrant who works as a salesman on the street Falafel The supporting actors have excellent actors who play as her godmother and have relatives in the same family as Judy, an old-fashioned, dedicated and desperate librarian. Posey, when Mary knew that she had to grow up and become an adult Losing her position, her librarian makes her realize how much she misses it in her life. Mary's life is surrounded by friends in the Lower East Side Village of New York City before it becomes a yuppies. The film is quite good for freedom and I have come to enjoy Parker Posey as Mary, including the characters. Other in other movies
