I saw this movie in Winnipeg recently - appropriate because the location used The first time I read Lawrence's book, back in the 70s and for me it was a very powerful picture of aging tests in our society. It resounded when I was young and it resounded more now. When this movie came out, I was eager to see if the story would survive or not. And very impressed, especially with the performance of Ellen Burstyn. She managed to make us a complete human being, even though the characters are crazy and judgmental - people you don't want to be with It was great to see the characters who really liked to come to life.
