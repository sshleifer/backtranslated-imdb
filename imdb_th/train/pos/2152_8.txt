I enjoy this movie too. <br /> <br /> Humor is a good time and a moment that feels real, so you can feel awkward between Sugiyama and his wife. Gee-He and Vick and the abundance of him on the dance floor makes me groan. <br /> <br /> All the actors do a great job. I watched it a second time and caught a little difference that I missed in my first viewing. Good entertainment!
