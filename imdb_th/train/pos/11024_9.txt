This movie is great. It's fun from beginning to end. You'll be at the edge of the seat throughout the movie. In my opinion, this movie has a humble critic. <br /> <br /> Sly fits the role of Gabe Walker, who has been well trained with him. Michael Rooker creates a great image as Hal Tucker. Then John Linckow, one of the best performances I have ever seen as a villain. <br /> <br /> And the fact that 75% of this movie takes place in the mountains along with the bad guys. many It causes a lot of action! <br /> <br /> Great movie!
