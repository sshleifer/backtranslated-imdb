"The Matador" received the star Pierce Brosnan as a fire killer. He is a James Bond, seeded in tight-fitting clothes, elegant clothes, gold chains and ugly hairstyles. Julian Noble, our struggling killer in Mexico, trying to regain his nerves. Staying at the same hotel is a lucky businessman like Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear), a lucky businessman and trying to regain his balance. Danny is desperate to close the sale and go back to his wife in Denver (Hope Davis) with good news. <br /> <br /> The nobles and Wright became friends unexpectedly. Wright convinces Noble to reveal some techniques that he showed in bullfighting. Eventually, Noble became the target of the employer and appeared at Denver. <br /> <br /> The author and director Richard Shepard made a question and answer after a delightful movie at Austin Film Festival. Shepard was also lucky After suffering from losing his agent and refusing the latest script, he decided to write a story that no one bought and created a character that no one wanted to play. Pierce Brosnan then called Brosnan to restore his balance in this movie. (Having a life after bonding!) He has a great flair for clowns that are no longer used. Don't miss. <br /> <br /> Keep the credit off to read what filmmakers talk about bullfighting I hope to get more of Richard Shepard's project.
