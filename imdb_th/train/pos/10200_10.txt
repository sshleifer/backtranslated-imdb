What I hear is that the animation is not good. It may not depend on what everyone expects. But watch this way Do you expect perfection in hell? I believe that the animation is dry and intended. It's great to see her character change in this movie because it may be as close to live action as we can. I hope to be a sequel soon. If we need a live performance, I think we should be better with Chastity or Purgatori. But as possible as it is, it is my own personal belief that every person involved in this movie is a wrong person.
