Stumbling over, I must say that at first I was a little disappointed at the beginning, but Abe Forsythe's beliefs in acting and the undeniable ability I still watched. I can safely say that I'm glad I'm doing now. The story develops quite well and every character has a strong base and most of them don't have any missing information. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can do wrong in this production is the sound and pronunciation that is quite likely. annoyed Being possessed by the Lizzie character <br /> <br /> Some good performances along with the stellar plot received this performance really. This is hope for another season!
