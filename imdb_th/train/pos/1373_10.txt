This film should be viewed for librarians or librarians. All the best lines are directly related to the librarian. The public library is compared to academic arguments. The library is a classic argument that lasted among librarians and library school students. In addition, the pattern of many librarians is also divided. Librarians may have fun - even if they don't * have sex in the language of love! (Best film about librarians? Desk Set with Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy of course)
