I want to know how critics respond to inspiring movies that inspired me, so I went to Rotten Tomatoes and was disappointed to discover that the peanut galleries that the film critics of our country gave mean. 43% (or "rotten") graded <br /> <br /> Everything I can say is that if this movie doesn't move you, you don't have a heart. (It is interesting to know that the same movie on the same website received a score of 74% of the audience.) <br /> <br /> Regardless of the critic's opinion, it is important to me. In the end, I can't think of a schmo worthless career. Some people get money to watch movies. (It's a difficult life) and do the same things that other people on the planet do, but the way these people have to cross over, like their opinions, is more important than yours and even worse than them. He likes to hate. <br /> <br /> I'll allow you to see that this movie is outdated (well, except for f-bombs), syrup and a little guess ... After that, you know from the beginning that Cuba Gooding Jr. which shows The hero of the fleet in real life Carl Brashear to be successful in every turn, by the way, he meets: determination and courage; Is committed and optimistic. <br /> <br /> But his performances and De Niro's (As Billy Sunday, the composite character of many real-life people) is strong and inspiring. Your feet cheer the scenes of the movie, especially in the courtroom. You have to be a real wood in the mud to prevent these scenes from moving. Like the film critics of our country, Michael Rappaport is a great student and a charming, lovable diver and friend of Gooding's Brashear. If anyone sees "higher learning", this character will redeem himself. The drama is totally <br /> <br /> However, this thing always confirms what I feel: Do not listen to criticism. Watch this movie and get inspired.
