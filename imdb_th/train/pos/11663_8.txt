The Secret of Kells is an independent animated film that provides a story about the Book of Kells, the original illuminated from the Middle Ages with the four Gospels in the New Testament. I don't know if this book actually exists. But knowing that now makes my interpretation and analysis much easier There is a story and a little idea that floats around how this book came, who wrote it and survived more than 1,000 years. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> We have been Introduced to Brendan, an orphan who lived at the Abbey of Kells in Ireland, with his uncle Abbot Cellach (as depicted by Brendan Gleeson) as his uncle. Abbot Cellach is building a large wall around the temple to protect villagers and monks. Brendan doesn't like the walls and other monks. They pay more attention to reading and writing. Something that the Abbot Cellach no longer has. He is afraid of "Northmen" who rob and leave cities and empty villages and Burned to the ground <br /> <br /> One day, travelers come from Iona Island near Scotland. Brother Dan Dan is a very intelligent person who holds a special book which is not finished. Abbot Cellach allowed him to stay with Brendan and be friends with him. Idan has a special plan for Brendan. First of all, he needs ink for the book. But he needs specific berries The only way to get them is to go outside the wall and enter the forest, which is the area outside the boundaries of Brendan. When he saw that he was the only chance that Idan would continue to work, he decided to sneak out and return with the berries before his uncle noticed his identity. <br /> <br /> In the forest, Brendan meets Ashley Woods. She allows Brendan to go through the berries and, on the way, is similar to his company. She warns him of the dangers that occur in the darkness and does not destroy it. There is something worse than Viking going out there. From there, Brendan meets more challenges with the book and the course of the invasion. <br /> <br /> I like more stories now that I know what it is about now. What is Kells and what does it contain? I am sure you have seen pictures or copies of old messages from hundreds of years ago, with borders, colorful images and extravagant patterns, creatures and writings that adorn the face. Like the opening frame of Disney's The Sword in the Stone animation, there are many similar designs and styles. It creates a unique viewing experience in which stories and animations almost try to beat each other. <br /> <br /> I can't take my eyes off the incredible details. This is the best 2D animation I've seen in many years. It is lively, stimulating and full of life. The characters are surrounded by doodles and patterns in the trees, on the walls and in the air floating around. It helps raise the film. <br /> <br /> The story is pleasant, even though I think the episode. The end may be a little more stressful than this. With a run time of just 75 minutes, I think there may be something special in the final scene. It does not provide much information and does not mention the importance of the book. We are reminded of the importance. But not fully understood We are told that it gives hope. But no matter what the reason or how That is only part of the lack of movies. Otherwise, I think the story is interesting. But it can be overcome with animation. <br /> <br /> I guess it's okay. Animation can bring movies before they are short. Partial story But it's an interesting story about interesting history I would recommend looking for a short book of kells in order to understand what this movie is about. I think it will help your viewing experience more. This film is an impressive movie and has illustrations that shouldn't be missed.
