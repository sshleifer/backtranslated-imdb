This film has the core of rotting morals and also a strange justice. Joes, among many of us, like to "stick to the MAN" "MAN". In this case, there are representatives from many characters Mr Keller, which Carla reported to her office Later, Paul owes the master to Mr Marsh and 70 club owners and Paul's parole officer. There seems to be many questions about the side story of the last character. The investigator pointed out that it was a weakness in the well-built underground game of playing ping-pong between the two protagonists. We became more and more intense until their lives changed dramatically. They value each agent of "human". One or both may be fired, killed or imprisoned if they do not do as they say. <br /> <br /> This film has a sense of relief in At the end Carla has been put in the end. Her boss is forced to thrust Mr. Club Owner into a mess in his own bathroom. They received $ dollars and ... They didn't have to worry about reporting to the parole officer because his moral weakness caused him to hide his wandering wife in the basement. (Or whatever the police found to arrest him), it was an important subconscious stimulus to lock the glass that made us tight Never mind that others may have received Paul's files later to control his release. For the moment they are free! They may escape with it! <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> They kept it with men!
