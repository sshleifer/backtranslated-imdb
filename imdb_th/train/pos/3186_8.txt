I found this movie very fun. The story is simple and easy to digest. The humor is light and clean, and because the story that is related to the misunderstood self is normal, I find myself looking forward to what this movie is Became very good The performance of the female lead is admirable. The innocent, naive young woman who tries to create a white lie to David's complex script is very charming. I found that Vera's dance performed very well as well. I found myself hitting her feet while she was dancing around the stage perfectly and flawlessly. <br /> <br /> For those who have rude movies today
