The title has too much content in this movie which may lead to unrealistic expectations. Frankly speaking, there is "Road fear" is very little to see here. In fact, in this film, there are only a few people who know that there are avid killers that may spread throughout everyone and everyone he meets. Having said that, what we do here is very well done with the level of suspicion that is quite high. (Because unlike the people who "follow the road" the audience knows what happened) and the director Elia Kazan created deliberately When an infected killer was found, one of the more interesting side bars I found was the relationship developed between Dr. Reed (Richard Widmark) and the Police Captain Warren (Paul Douglas). Like each other, even if they have to work together At the end, they have forged mutual respect. Kazan works well. <br /> <br /> All the performances here are great. Widmark and Douglas are great and I can quite see Jack Palace in the beginning, what would become his "heavy" script in his style I found very little to criticize here. Maybe Barbara Belveds may look a bit flat like Nancy, Reed's wife. But her role is not the center of the story Overall, it's a great work. 9/10
