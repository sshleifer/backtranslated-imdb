Since this film is Swiss dialect, it may be difficult for most German speakers to follow this movie. I'm not from Switzerland But I worked there for many years, so I had the opportunity to understand the great illusion of the Lord of the Rings. I've seen many movies of this type (such as Scary Movie, Scifi load, spoofs, etc.) but this movie is the best movie I've ever seen. I gave 9 of 10. The only reason I can't give 10 is because there are small details. Little that can do better and because they do not have any subtitles in any language on the DVD so there is almost no chance for Not Swiss to understand
