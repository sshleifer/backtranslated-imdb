Citizen X tells the real-life drama of the serial killer search, dubbed "The Rostov Ripper". This great movie shows a long journey that must be used to try to catch the murderer. This film shows that politics may help killers to rampage for over 12 years (possibly more than 50 victims, mostly women and children). Stephen Rea's performance as a detective leads and Donna Todd Sutherland, as the chief of the overall inquiry, is excellent. Jeffrey DeMunn plays Ripper Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo. This is the type of movie that will make you passionate and have you on the internet to search Take the real body immediately This movie should not be missed. It launched. I believe in HBO and never released my understanding drama. Great movie
