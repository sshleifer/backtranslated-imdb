Overall, I found this movie quite amusing and fun to watch while laughing out loud. <br /> <br /> But this movie isn't suitable for everyone. That is the reason I created this quick question. If you answered yes to the following questions more than I suggested watching this flick, <br /> <br /> (1) Do you like rude sexual humor? (2) Do you like humor related to alcohol? (2) Do you like amazingly hot women? (3) Do you like watching women? (4) Do you like watching many girls? (5) Did I talk about all the good boobies in this movie? <br /> <br /> If you notice spoiler alerts, it's a reference to the amount of nudity you expect in a movie The plot is about Not that it's important
