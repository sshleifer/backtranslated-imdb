Tintin is one of my favorite heroes as a child. I used to borrow books from the school library every time there was an opportunity. My favorite movie is "The Red Sea Sharks" - lots of action and humor. <br /> <br /> This documentary is a great exhibition of the stories behind Herge and Tintin's development. The personal experience of the filmmakers in the interview with Herge and the story of his relationship with the artist who inspired the character Chan to move well. <br /> <br /> Great documentary of talented artists. And being loved. A good example of someone who has become internationally known and brings the happiness of millions of children (And children with heart) all over the world
