This Oliver's production specializes in showing the layers of evil in the human spirit. What makes this story remarkable is the bright, unseen character that penetrates this darkness as he safely takes the innocent boy through the dangers of the grave in the hands of his relatives. Of death But he was not afraid of evil With a staff and staff to comfort him Eventually he escaped from the garbage of humanity. At the bottom is the most evil Fagin of the lot. Fajin considers repentance in his method, not once, but twice, but decreases because he is not willing to pay. Fagin's price is worse than Bill Sikes because he took a small bag that became a murderer. In the middle is Oliver His innocence was not proven. But have not tried as well The best is Nancy. She doesn't care about Bill Sikes' harsh nature because she needs deep love. But unlike Fagin at a possible price in her own life, she repented of her sins by helping Oliver from Bill. Things were not as seen. In my opinion, this quality is something that makes art work valuable - unpredictable. I will give this movie a "10", but the soundtrack created for the TV and the atmosphere in the 70s distracted. Overall, it's a good metaphor and a story that is suitable for all audiences.
