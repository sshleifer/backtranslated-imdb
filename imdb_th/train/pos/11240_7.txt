Low budget pop melodrama Brit focuses on a girl who wants to become a star and then finds it too. A good actor and a sense of time and place can not hide the fact that we have been here before. Many scenes are quite hilarious and O'Connor's voice sounds like a mini mouse! She disappeared from the sight shortly after creating this movie - so life can be imitated by art! Must see if you want to see the Star Is Born punk version or not
