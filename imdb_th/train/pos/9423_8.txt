I can't say that the British comedies after World War II, created at Ealing Studios, are the tastes that have been acquired or not. But I'm completely stuck and The Man in the White Suit is one of the best There is no need to go into a well-known plot about threats that occur to both the textile industry and the textile union with non-destructive fibers and impurities. When he was able to say that the sling and arrow had suffered from Sidney Stratton, who had a naive ideology in pursuing his polymer vision. Many well-known faces from the world of British character actors - Cecil Parker Neuroscience, Michael Gough, a ruthless and ruthless actor Ernest Thinginger Walsh - always and forever - excellent "Knudsen !!! !!!!"
