I think it's a great movie. Because you will see how Diana's life is at home She is very aggressive and she wants to prove that girls can fight as well. I think she and Adrian are great actors. Because this movie I am the same boxing It really impressed me. The only negative that I think is the end, because it's okay between Diana and Adrian. But you didn't see it at home And I don't like how you won't see how your father did with your brother But I think it's a great movie and I think I'll watch it more :) I recommend it to everyone even if you don't like boxing I am happy when watching it.
