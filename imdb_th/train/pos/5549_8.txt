The silent movie The Pride of the Clan, starring Mary Pickford, should be placed in a fictional island off the coast of Scotland. In fact, most of the external images were taken on Marblehead Massachusett on Marblehead Neck, close to many rocky marine areas, including Churn and Castle Rock. My initial interest in this film is due to two factors: 1) Marblehead movie positions And 2) the fact that my grandmother Lizzette M. Woodfin was hired as Mary Standford to shoot various scenes including "cliff scenes". Both women were small (5 inches) and both father And My grandmother was concerned with the fact that she stood behind her with the camera for the cliff scene as part of the Chiefton filming scene. I just wanted to tell this story to future historians and movie enthusiasts. This movie (My DVD copy is quite bad). Very well done with acting and acting, including various scenes that Miss Pickford represents. Strong female characters. I enjoy it and like to get a better copy, even if I'm not sure if it really exists as I have seen on various movie sites that the remaining copies are dark because of deterioration. Very good movie of silent genre with lots of action!
