I don't really understand why people get upset and pan this movie! Remember people. This is a movie. SNL is not everything that is unpredictable and original, whether it is a way or a direction! Ladies Man is a hilarious movie, although sometimes stupid, incompetent and normal actors, marvelous performances from Will Ferrel and Tim Meadows. Yes, some jokes are stupid and yes, the characters are unbelievable. But it's a joke! I do not really understand how many people laugh in this hilarious movie. However, what I ask is that people will take this role as it is - SNL jokes, stupid and disrespectful. Nothing will be rewarded. But even some modern funny gold "10-4 Apricot!"
