Chloe received a mysterious resuscitation from Dr. Caselli, a treacherous doctor responsible for transferring patients with the ability from Belle Reve to Project 33.1 and a few seconds later Clark arrived. Allan returned to Smallville and met at Kent Farm. When Bart is arrested by Lex during a raid on LuthorCorp's factory, Clark finds out that Green Arrow employs Bart (aka Impulse), Arthur Curry (Aquaman) and Victor. Stone (Cyborg) Clark accepts to join the trio to help Bart and invite Chloe to join their mission. <br /> <br /> "Justice" is the best episode in season 6. In this episode, Justice League begins an adventure with five heroes: Clark, Green Arrow, Flash ("Impulse"), Aq. uaman and Cyborg. Chloe's participation is remarkable, making the organization that needs to work as a team. In the end, Oliver broke up with Lois on the importance of fighting criminals and the Financial Secret Laboratory of the world. My rating is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Justi√ßa" ("Justice")
