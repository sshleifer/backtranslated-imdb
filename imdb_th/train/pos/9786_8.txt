I enjoy the performances of the main actors. Emma Lung is brave and interesting. The director has developed a show in which the character is not one dimension. Complex stories that have changed during the era Also appreciated the basic story of the union that lost power and the impact of a large employer closing a small town I disagree with the opinion that the old man must be charming. There are many relationships with older men and younger women - where men do not look good. The depth of the character can attract people who are not shallow. This movie has good looks and movies as well.
