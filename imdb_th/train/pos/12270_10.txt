I have been searching for this movie for many years and it is clear that it is not here in the United States. So I bought a copy for Ebay. <br /> <br /> Four hunters and their three girls In the wild to find bears Apparently killed several camps What they found was a former Vietnamese veterinarian. (He killed some of his victims by using gloves with long finger nails, metal and La Freddie Krueger). As soon as the night fell, a girl went to argue with her boyfriend. She was killed. After one group found her body, they all hid in the tent waiting for sunlight. When the sun rises, they all try and do it. <br /> <br /> Seven bodies do not have much blood. But it is a good murder, especially girls. Deaths, people killed in a rather bloodless way (Blowing up in the car, shooting a knife through the head) <br /> <br /> Overall, the INFERNAL TRAP is a good slasher movie in the late 80s. Nothing new, behaving well, walking fast and having a lovely woman. 10 From 10
