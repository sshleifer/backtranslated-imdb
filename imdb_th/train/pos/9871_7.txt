Return to the Lost World was filmed back with the Lost World 1992 version. <br /> <br /> In this sequel, the same five players, led by Challenger, return to the plateau where the group begins. Oil drilling which threatens to destroy the land Gomez is involved in this matter. They managed to overcome the drill and the plateau was recorded for the happiness of the native people. <br /> <br /> Just like in the lost world, the little dinosaurs we see are made of rubber and these include T- Rex and Ankylosaurus <br /> <br /> John Ryhs-Davies and David Warner printed their script as Challenger and Summerlee and the other three actors returned. <br /> <br /> Even though reading reviews Many bad things And those cheap-looking rubber dinosaurs. I'm happy to return to the forgotten world. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 stars out of 5
