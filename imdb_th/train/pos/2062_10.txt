First of all, I will be the first to admit that his own scarecrow is somewhat distorted. The reduction of the acrobatic scarecrow may make the film less. But overall, I think it's one of the better B movies. Tiffany Shepis is great. Not to mention the incredible beauty. Although this film is missing from important nude factors But there are many other movies that you can watch But here she gets hot, especially at the end, as she walks out of the swallowed scarecrow. Richard Elfman has also performed well as a sheriff and is a drunken fan. Yes, it's a low budget B movie, but from all I've seen, this is one of my top favorites.
