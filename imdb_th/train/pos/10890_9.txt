Come with people. This movie is better. 4 I see this happening ... The wealthy do more crazy things. And it's funny. <br /> <br /> I watched a comedy that would be entertaining, fleeing from the pressure of the world for a short time and not having to do anything too seriously. This film is fully suited to that purpose. I judged the movie with my own advantages and not about Surviving Christmas and Blazing Saddles. I watched the totally unusual people grow up caring for a satisfying person who can live along the road from my house. It will remain in the list of "favorite ..... must watch for the holiday season" if you just want to be happy for 90 minutes. See this.
