This review has been almost 30 years. However, I have to say that I have been given a chance from the copy of this movie in early 2008 and watch it over and over again for 4 months! I just have to write about it! I was beaten and forgot what else was available when I watched this movie. It was a very surprising story to see the most ugly male protagonists of literature. Also what the irony is welcome! It fits me perfectly because Timothy Dalton does his job fairly. He gave a surprising and successful performance! I've never seen anything like this before! Other actors are also good. This film is beautifully combined. I don't care what everyone says about this movie. I love it and love it! It makes me happy and satisfied. It crushed me a bit to say this, but I like Jane Eyre 1983 and A&E's P&J, which I believe is the most advanced mini-series. <br /> <br /> The excerpt from Jane Eyre makes me feel bad at school. I never read a book about it seriously. Seeing this creation made this story lively for me and shocking me. The scene and sound of Mr. Dalton haunts me endlessly and eventually makes me read the book seriously, which of course is a masterpiece. Cheers to all the teams and especially with Mr.Dalton !! Now this movie is part of me. <br /> <br /> I rate 10/10.
