The Ogre is a film created for TV in Italy and is not intended to be a sequel to the devil, while Lamberto Bava mentions in an interview in Sheirk Show DVD, but it is called Demons III as part of the Devil series. The songs in Demons and Demons 2 are rock music in the 80s, while this is a more eerie song, and while the first two are the horror of the demon Demons III: Ogre is a horror architecture. The sequel that is suitable for the devil, but I still like this movie <br /> <br /> Creepy music and add sound to the castle in this movie. The Ogre is another thing that makes me like movies. this There are two other films that are considered to be demons III and that is Black Demon (Demoni 3) and The Church (Demons 3) Demons III: The Ogre is a good movie as long as you don't compare it to Demons and Demons 2.
