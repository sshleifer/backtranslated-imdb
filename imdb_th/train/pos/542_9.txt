When I first discovered that Brian Krause was going to be in this movie, I wanted to watch. I spent many weeks knowing that I saw the original and liked it very much. So I have more reasons to watch. I see it better than the sequel of TV movies. I hate what happened to Brian's character. (You can search for yourself) and I don't like most characters included. But this movie needs a magical and annoying character and pulls back to make Stanley Caldwell (Judd Nelson) shine again At the end, I cheered Stanley and his happy ending. If you like the traditional Cabin by the lake or if you like horror movies without blood, I'd recommend you to watch it
