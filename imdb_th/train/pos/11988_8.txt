I used to watch this program when I was young. When I miss it, I can only remember it. If you ask me, it's a good performance. Two things that I clearly remember are the opening sequence and the soundtrack. In addition, everyone was selected very well. In addition, writing is very strong. That show is also the highest level. I hope some networks will bring it back so that I can see every episode. Before I sum up this story, I want to say that I will always remember this performance in my memory, even though I don't think I see it every time. Now, in conclusion, if some networks bring back, I hope you catch it one day before it can go out in the air.
