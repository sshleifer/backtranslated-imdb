I bought a DVD set according to instructions from Amazon.com. According to my other interests, they banged the nails on the head with this one. I remember watching the program when on TV. But always wondering what happened to it Ten years later, it's like watching it again for the first time. Lucas Black is Caleb Temple and Gary Cole as Sheriff Lucas Buck is great even if they are competitors. Almost representing Caleb and evil (Sherriff Lucas Buck). I never really understood what Lucas should be. But allowing him to speak, he has some special powers that I do not believe from receiving any sacred things. He can make the phone louder, write more, or even change the mood of the person. No less. There are only a few when he becomes a good person, even though it's true. All of this is a great set that, like many others, I think (IE Point Pleasant, Threshold, Nowhere Man and SeaQuest DSV to name a few) was canceled before their time. The Steven King The Dead Zone (USA's network Sunday) seems to be the only thing in this category that seems to create it. There is nothing suitable to watch on TV anymore. Because anything related to Christianity and Satan is considered disgusting and must be pulled out of the TV immediately So in the meantime, I will buy a DVD set and watch the programs that should remain on the TV. But was banned from the TV with religious enthusiasm so that we could see "quality" programs such as Family Guy and American Dad and The Simpsons, a bunch of crap that was)
