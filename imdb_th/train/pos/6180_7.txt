During the night of the Vanties, a woman was found dead on the catwalk above the stage. While the program continues, the police try to gather together to kill anyone and why before closing the final curtain. <br /> <br /> I've always heard that this is a classic funny puzzle that is great. visit Unfortunately, no one told me about the number of music that went on. While that number was the type that Hollywood did in their heyday, they would become intrusive because they would rather stop the movie. Death, even trying to weave action around them, this is not bad if the music has half-way features, but it's not good. There is only one good song. Worse than that, if the studio knew that they had one Cocktails for Two and we were forced to endure four versions: the pair, the large amount of production, the vanities finale and behind the scenes, the songs were not important. Spike Jones and his City Slickers have played so much. The rest of the film is quite good, with Victor McLaglen practicing like Jack Oakie. Charles Middleton is a very funny story, his scene as an actress who loves wardrobe. <br /> <br /> No It is necessary that I can recommend this. If you think you can pass numbers, music or are willing to scan through them, it's a fun movie that they no longer do.
