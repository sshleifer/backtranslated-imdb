There are very few mainstream movies located in the post-colonial Africa and diverse movies. This by pretending to be altruistic to reveal slavery in the 1970s shows Africa's best and worst values, which appear to be no different from the value of humanity as a whole. In addition, there are flaws with the improper influence of pre-Western concepts of Africans and especially Arabs. <br /> <br /> Dr. Anansa Linderby, a beautiful African-American wife The British physician David Linderby was arrested by an Arab slave trader along with a teenage girl, Zan, and a young boy. Suleiman, an important slave trade leader, was all Arabs with a touch of flowers and sometimes used words Humor and attitude to match - which would not be out of place. "Follow the camel" but not this standard This film definitely deserves that Peter Ustinov has enough skills to fix some of the script's shortcomings and he has rescued what might be a single-dimensional character. <br /> <br /> Continue Go in all three stereotypes Suleiman's Arab staff is not clever and one person is likely to be a boy who is not shown on screen. Fortunately, <br /> <br /> One of David's first ports is a local police officer. David then met two former British white stereotypes. (Walker, played by Rex Harrison) and Americans (Sandell, played by William Holden) Sandell is a mercenary with a "normal" view of racial relations, which initially refused to help unless David gave advance payments. Won by David's love for Anasa and realized that he couldn't find love. He agreed to take David on a helicopter to help find Anasa. They found that Sulaiman and his captives crossed the border and were unable to pursue them to nearby lands - due to Sandell's hesitation and the lack of experience of David in the gunship, his helicopter was shot. But David survived <br /> <br /> Then we saw David introducing Malik (Kabir Bedi), an African, who lost his family to Sulaiman. They met Sanufu and Tuareg, and knew that they were looking for the right Suleiman. <br /> <br /> In one of the most exciting scenes, they killed a group of slave traders only to find that Not a group of Sulaiman and no choice but to send prisoners to the Tuaregs they met earlier. <br /> <br /> Later, we found out that the raped boy was a witch doctor and in A wonderful scene with supernatural sounds. He uses his knowledge to kill one of Sulaiman Anansa's closest friends in her part - and despite the suspicion of a boy - can handle the death of another employee. Two of Sulaiman's people <br /> <br /> At this time, Sulaiman and his slaves were in a few days before the slave market. <br /> <br /> Suleiman is currently not required. No doubt that Anansa was a "problem" trying to sell her to the Arab prince Rich and rude (Omar Sharif) who is dishonest but wise from discovering that Anansa is an American who works for the United States. The prince decides to conduct negotiations without regard to the consequences. The scene in which two men negotiate is one of the best scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> At the slave market, this young boy was sold to a middle-aged German pedophile and we were left to guess. The boy will still be considered a "wunderbar" when his owner is nearing the end of his shamanic skills. <br /> <br /> David and Malik eventually confront Sulaiman and Finally bitterly from Malik's perspective. <br /> <br /> Finally, David and Ananda come together again and Malik, whose life is in ruins, can be comforted. Yourself when you see the work he has done. <br /> <br /> A combination of the film is excellent. But it lost the score by drawing the stereotypes of almost all the main characters Credits have to go to the actors, bringing everyone to mention the many flaws of the script.
