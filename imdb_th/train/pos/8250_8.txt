This movie was born in the 1950s. According to this, the dead (called zombies) have been born to eat life. However, the company developed a collar that when worn around the neck of zombies, causing them to tame and serve perfectly. Carrie-Anne Moss), Father Bill (Dylan Baker) and son Timmy (K'Sun Ray) hire zombies because everyone on their blog already exists. Tim named zombies Fido (Billy Connolly) and became friends with him. But his father hates him and Timmy loses control of Fido and things ! Every famous Lassie episode will spin here. My favorite thing is when Timmy sends Fido out for help before the zombies eat him! In addition, it was the words of the Douglas Cirque film in 1950, where everything was bright and colorful - but the dark secret made people break. The characters wear bright clothes in the 1950s (Moss is often in the set) - decoration, settings and cars, especially in the 1950s, with bright colors. Even when the script is repeated, there are still some things to watch. Is always a good script - but there are only a lot of jokes that you create Melodramatics are stupid, but the actors pull it out. Everyone here is excellent and accurate according to the goal. Even Connolly as an emotionless zombie can do well. Moss is the best - play each line for value --- but don't go overboard. <br /> <br /> This is not suitable for everyone (of course). Words may disappear with most people and blood That is quite tame Comfortably stabbed by hand and with the pleasure of playing music, it is hard to do seriously So for some people it really works. I give 8 items.
