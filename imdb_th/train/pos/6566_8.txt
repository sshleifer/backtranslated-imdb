Ever wondered what ideas for romantic novels and other documents that were published back? According to 'Jake Speed', they are based on real people, living the adventures they wrote and published. This movie is entertainment for families, quality, medium intensity and the worst stingy clothes. Language is not a problem and jokes at all levels. This is the appearance of 'Austin Powers' at 'Indian Jones' without Michael Myers popular comedy. I would like to recommend this movie for children from 10 to 15.
