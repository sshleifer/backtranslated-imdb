Oh, this is a famous musical drama. There is a little ridicule - Frank Sinatra is a very cunning man like Nathan Detroit, even though it is clearly seen in "Sue Me", which is a clear Jewish song. Sadly, the filmmakers decided to cut one of the best songs from "Marry the Man Today" and replace it with the inferior Citraat Sinatra. Taking into account two shortcomings, the movie is very beautiful. Jean Simmons shines like Sarah Brown. Marlon Brando can't sing a valuable song. But pulled it away. Stubby Kaye returned to perform the role of Broadway once again. (It's written for him.) Damon Runyon's language and rhythm and humor do quite well. This is a list that I see every opportunity I get.
