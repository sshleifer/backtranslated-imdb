The first time I saw this episode was something that shocked me. Actually, it was the first time I saw "24". The fast thing was amazing and it was surprising, exciting and interesting as if you Is reading When you start, it's hard to stop from the minute that Richard Walsh talks to Jack personally about the possibility that they have a mole in the CTU. I sit 6:40 hours, which means 10 episodes !!! (Sounds funny and crazy But I am the type that when he is interested, he cannot stop.) This series is one of the best types. And it is created in a way that will have a few different stories connected to each other, recommended in every way!
