This is one of my favorite Austen's adapted novels. Although it is not in the same category as the beautiful and reliable "Pride and Prejudice" "Emma" on TV, Austen's novels, especially considering the short length, the greatest change between This novel and film are good, because the unnecessary madness that Austen exhibited at the end of the story will be removed here and replaced with someone who is similar to The character of Emma I think the characters selected for the role have been carefully selected. Kate Beck Kinsale walked through the line between being a teenager and an insulting society with the grace that was lost in the '96 version of Gwyneth Paltrow Samantha Morton. The small blonde lock of Samantha Morton is suitable for attitude and Her character as a patron who came along with her role in the previous characters was replaced by Harriet, which we know from the book. Mister Knightly's role went very well in my opinion. Both the seriousness and the gentle mercy that the hero has been drawn with in the novel is here in an interesting and fascinating film.
