Men of Honor presents Cuba Gooding Jr. as a real life. Navy Diver Carl Brashear, who challenged the human fleet to become the first African American American diver. Sometimes by his side and sometimes his opponent is a man that Carl Bracher really admires. His name is the leader of the Sunday, Robert DeNiro, in many ways, pushing for relegation. Intensified and helped Carl become the man he wanted. <br /> <br /> I love Cuba in this movie. His depiction here is liberating and powerful, like Denzel Washington in the hurricane. In every scene, we can see his desire, inspiration and stubbornness to achieve his dreams. We can see the struggle within him as he begins to make his father proud. I like the director creating and creating tension in some of the important diving scenes. The confrontation with Brashear and the submarine during the salvage mission is to stop the heart and be wonderful. <br /> <br /> The only fault I see must be in the actors. The characters of Cuba and DeNiro are complex. And very exciting Which will make you a little sad when you have to head with two-dimensional characters. Lt. Lt. Hank, wife of Sunday (Charlize Theron) Colonel, an unusual diving school (Hal Holbrook) and interest in Cuba's love is a character that I find not very deep. What will make these characters more important and effective is the time to develop them a bit more. Why is the colonel always in his tower? Why Sunday is always a bitter and drunk wife. <br /> <br /> Another question is questionable. What happened to Carl Brashear's wedding? I mean, this movie is the story of this man's life. Will his wedding be a major event? Maybe just me However, the honorable man is a perfect example of the victory and belief that the human spirit surrounds. This film will inspire and make you feel for the battle of this man. Which I believe is the reason that this powerful story has been told My hat is gone with Carl Brashear. I really appreciate your strength. <br /> <br />
