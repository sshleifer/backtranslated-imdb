This is the tongue in the cheek film, from the beginning with the voice acting to stimulate fun in everything in France and then create a hero that is innocent. But very brave in Fanfan La Tulipe, a faithful young man, fully convinced of Lollobrigida's fate, in advance - especially that he would marry King Louis XV's daughter! The problem was that soon L Lollo soon found that she had fallen in love with Fanfan. <br /> <br /> Driven by good sword fighting, Cavalier and other lively actions, the film continues. At a glance, the moment may be the weakest direction. But this film was light and focused on himself so seriously that I could not give those flaws again. Look for Noel Roquevert, a French heavy film, trying to steal La Lollo, annoy yourself and enter the script With a fortune teller reading the hand of La Lollo! And what the jewel Marcel Herrand is like, King Louis XV, full of power and desire! That's not all: a beautiful woman in a movie makes me want to stay in France and come back in 1952! This movie may be released that year. But with bright, cheek, excellent narrative, impeccable photography and memorable Gerard Philippe ensuring that the film will be modern and happy. I will not hesitate to recommend my grandchildren to let alone with everyone who loves movies in general and especially swashbucklers! Try!
