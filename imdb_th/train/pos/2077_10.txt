This timeless proverb will be reflected in this film and in my heart. I've been waiting for many years to see this eternal story! I'm not ready yet. It is possible that my sensibilities will not appreciate the power of it. So, now, I am gratefully welcoming it in my soul with joy. <br /> <br /> My respect and admiration for PAUL MUNI for a long time now is a legendary glow. But in the end I discovered the precious gift from the excellent talents of the LUISE RAINER. Oh, how many people can speak like you? Some people say that it is made from her quiet years and this pond may be just her words. But with enough eloquence when given the opportunity She deserves sufficient Oscar. <br /> <br /> This film has the greatest proportion in the classic. Every part is equal, necessary and perfect. Naysayers may walk away if they want. But they will avoid telling the story that is with one lifetime. <br /> <br /> A good world creates one of the ways we don't expect. But all will not come from it with the joy that I do But I hope that this movie will be remembered for many years. <br /> <br /> Don't fight me with tricks just about the main players' competition. This is the expectation of modern times when we are obsessed with perfection. But I dare to create over a million new movies to tell the story of PEARL BUCK with violence, power, confidence and elegance. <br /> <br /> If any modern artist dares to show a masterpiece this piece Will not come close to the fragrance that still emanates from the core of this telling Time will not diminish this effort and will not develop according to its greatness.
