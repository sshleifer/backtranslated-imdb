I met An Insomniac's Nightmare while looking for an unusual and independent film that was glad to say it didn't disappoint. This crazy half-hour journey made me wonder all the way and the ending was great. At one time, NOOOOO was with you. I showed it to everyone and everyone agreed. The little ghost girl is very talented and I think her performance will steal the show. She crawls the heck out of me. I can say that much. Nanawat works very well by combining this story together. All parts fall into place and you can tell that she is a great writer from what she did with this script. Very well written It is undoubtedly the strongest part of the movie. The director was great and the performance was fun. But the most important thing here is the strength of the screenplay. Well done with this girl, I can't wait to see again!
