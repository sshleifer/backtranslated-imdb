In my field, I was contacted by independent filmmakers, sometimes trying to publish their movies. When I can, I will watch these low-cost movies and often they make me think that the future of Hollywood will be a dog. Although sometimes movies are born from pure passion and desire as if created for the purpose of warning the film industry that good movies are still possible. BROKEN short films directed by Alex Ferrari are a genuine surprise and worthwhile. Value for a second look. <br /> <br /> Reinforce the truth in 20 minutes. BROKEN tried to tell an interesting story back. The audience was plopped down. With no clue about what happened, the woman (Samantha Jane Poll) woke up from the dream of hearing a gun and being kidnapped from her home. When she woke up, she was surrounded by a group of mercenaries that seemed like they were at home in a comic book. These nasty men and women are larger than life. They are all guns and knives. There is no way out. <br /> <br /> The players here are even though they are low-budget movies. But it doesn't play like anyone else From the very beginning, the feeling is that B R O K E N was shot, modified and produced by a professional. It seems that some of Quentin Tarantino's things might be done on his holiday when he gets stuck with the Wachowski brothers. This movie is sharp and cool. It looks good and feels like a big deal. <br /> <br /> The performance is better than I saw in these small movies. Polay and Paul Gordon (the player's chief killer) Duncan) was selected well As two of the few roles spoken in the film, it is up to them to perform the movie. There is no special technique, no matter how good it will help the film to escape from a bad performance. Fortunately, Polay tries to convey true fear and Gordon tries to come out as a real psycho. Some limited roles. Seems to be full of less capable <br /> <br /> The downside of B R O K E N is that it is only 20 minutes long. The story ends with the Twilight Zone that seems to be slightly invented and almost insignificant. Look, I feel like I should be holy. But there is only a feeling that it is more common than I hope it will be This film tries hard to be one of the puzzles that make the audience talk for hours at the local coffee shop. But it was not satisfactory I always think that this is the first 20 minutes of movies that are longer than <br /> <br /> My score: 8 out of 10
