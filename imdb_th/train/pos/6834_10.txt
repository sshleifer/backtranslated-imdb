Come straight to the point: This is the movie that I will take with me on a deserted island. (With a DVD player) It's perfect If you have a reason to watch this movie, you love actors. You like to see them free to participate in the space and feelings. This movie is perfect for you. See the scene at Myrtle (Rowlands). On stage and Maurice (Cassavetes) have to blurt out because she doesn't follow the script anymore. If you are sensitive to the movement of the camera, you will be amazed at how the camera moves on a specific flow stage that makes you appreciate the camera that tracks the actors as if it were led by the theater principle. "Private space" ... amazing, and the story is just a wonderful combination of drama and true story. Cassavetes is arguing with Hollywood and the politics of the Doctorate. But this time he made it through Broadway, making it one of the most exciting movies about the theater. This movie is happy.
