This movie looks like Marty. You may love or hate it. If you go into this movie, expect to have the right movie that has the right production value, good plot and excellent character that you will hate. If you enter this movie, expecting a small budget, you may hate it. <br /> <br /> If you go into this movie, hoping to see one of the most crazy characters ever filmed in Harry's Russo, you will love it. John Giancaspro is great in showing the ultimate image of a cruel coke madman. <br /> <br /> The special effects are the best. But who really is interested? If you are the person who is ready to watch the movie Schizophrenia: The Whore Mangler, you have never seen a horror-filled horror movie. With the budget that this movie created, even if they tried it, it might look best. I would like to laugh at things that are nasty than not being affected by others. <br /> <br /> If you want to sum up, you might hate this movie. But if you are one of the few people who decide To see it further, it will become the best thing since slicing bread. # 2 I hate marmite.
