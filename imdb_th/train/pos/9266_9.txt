Anyway, I just watched this story in Film 4 [2008-12-21] and I can't determine PVR) <br /> <br /> This is my favorite football movie, my second story after "Mike Bassett: England Manager "But this time by increasing the look of the guerrilla of filmmaking from the team that clearly created a movie that was banned in the country in which they were created.

Mike Bassett, England Manager 2. Offside 3. Glory Glory Date 4. Shots at Glory 5. The Mystery Stadium Arsenal
