For 12 years since the beginning But it continues with the same spirit until the past season Because that's what "friends" are based on: words, special circumstances are happening among the six friends who will never leave our hearts: thank you very much for Rachel Ross, Monica Joey Mandler and Phoebe !!! In our first meeting, we saw that Rachel left men. (How does the church ... (understand) Monica's search for "The perfect man" (no perfect man, why every woman is obsessed with this story ??) and how your marriage will be destroyed when your partner discovers that she is a lesbian until we Will meet with Joey, Phoebe and Chandler in the next episode ... Enjoy with friends!
