Some people may call it "Polly" as a movie for children. But I want to confirm that it is more than that It may be more than anything else. This film was a great success in showing the fate of immigrants in the United States - only because of the recent debates. The picture of a parrot told the Russian immigrant janitor (Tony Shalhoub) of the way he searched America for his original owner. The film tells many stories. There is an old woman (Gena Rowlands) in which he is friends with him and Cheech Marin and others. <br /> <br /> All of this is a good movie. I usually don't expect much from this type of movie. But this is a cure I definitely recommend starring Jay Mohr, Buddy Hackett, Bruce Davison, Hallie Eisenberg and Trini Alvarado.
