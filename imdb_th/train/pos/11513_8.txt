One of my favorites back in the 70s as I remembered that it would air on Friday. (Or maybe Saturday) on the Nine (?) Network here in Australia. Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland are excellent In the fight against hands and supernatural opponents The writer is trying to escape from vampires and ghosts as normal Big, which started killing people in the city hospital The final showdown saw Kolchack try to short-circuit. 'Beast' amidst the explosion of sparks and the flames of the waves. Oh .... You have to stay there all the time. <br /> <br /> McGavin is always full of power and enthusiasm in his role, and this is one of the best. Br> <br /> Deserve to get the place. In the "Hall of Fame" of the TV to reference Tony Vincenzo .... 'Kolchack, you're in there' ... or in the case of Hall of Fame 'IN it'!
