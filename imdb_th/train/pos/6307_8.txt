I have never heard of this before, even with the connection with George Clooney (the company that produced and he appeared in very funny support) and Steven Soderberg, 11 directors Worse than that, we picked it up in the tank. The price reduction for $ 4.99 (Canadian coins there!) Is a surprise. But I see that if William H. Macy is in there, you won't be disappointed. This is something that is reminiscent of those comedies from England in the 1950s. OK with more rudeness. This is strange and sometimes a funny movie. The actual robbery made me laugh so hard that I cried. Perhaps the most fun use of underwear in movie history Maybe it's a low expectation that I have entered. But I watched with a group of people and we exploded the best. $ 5 I spent a long time.
