Good Woody Allen? Woody Allen number, good? Absolutely. I found myself with the audience to join in, laughing hard and often the best Woody Allen episode that we had heard for a while. Allen Age has created a role suitable for himself as Scarlett Johansson's "father" ... uh ... some people say Johansson plays the role of "Dianne Keaton Boy". Daddy, in his film, often gives a very similar feeling ... as well as a parody of Woody Allen. That's a good story for us who appreciate Woody. Of course, Woody's dialogue is better than the young actor in the comedies. His last one is Melinda / Melinda. Some might find that Woody's humor is boring. But for us who love it when it's done right
