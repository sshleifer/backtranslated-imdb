The movie "Comedies" today generally has 100 minutes of humor in the bathroom, inappropriate language and kicking the groin. Modern comedies attract attention to the lowest participation, the needs and the slowness of the brain. Of course, there will be occasional good comedy. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Blandings created his dream home", showing that the 1940s Hollywood is capable and funny, just screaming. Jim And Muriel Blandings (Grant Cary and Myrna Loy) decided to build a home in the Connecticut suburbs. The following movie, their story begins with a hunting trip in the house, the busy construction of the house to the completed house - with the water softener zuzz-zuzz. "<br /> <br / > Grant and Loy are suitable for their role. (Grant is a joke, especially when he looks at the cost of an uncontrollable home). However, the film was stolen by Blandings' clever lawyer who played for perfection by Melvin Douglas. Management to steal every scene in Douglas is fun, as he watches Blandings hailing from the crisis. Reginald Denny's as the architect of the bullies Blanding and Harry Shannon as the drilling of artesian wells was excellent as well /> <br /> I see <br this story. Many times I think it's a good movie to watch when you need a lift, whether you build a house or not.
