My interest increased as I turned and saw the name Iphigenia. My name is Eugenia. So I thought, OK, let's see what this is. I'm glad I'm in the box It's a wonderful story. Drama, sadness, great performances But it's a wonderful time I watched this thing and it made me sad for things that were floating in the film industry that brought out. Try Iphigenia and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. I get my children (27, 25, 20 And 17) To enjoy it, it starts slowly, but the drama is created and you will enter the story. Watching this lovely movie made me want to wrap myself in the tragedy and Greek pathos.
