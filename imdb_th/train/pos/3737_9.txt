First of all, this movie is a game full of excitement. The story of training soldiers fighting with their chiefs and at the end of the group. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end This is one of the most dramatic dramas that should be worth watching if you participate in the mocking (sometimes) and the horrors of the boot camp. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of the way that the actors. Interacting in time And sometimes there is a sense of humor that Bozz (Colin Farrel) relates to Paxton (Matthew Davis) throughout the story from the camp to Tigerland and even ultimately helps him <br /> <br /> Free hand-shooting Which is innovative, has added flavor or Taste for the movie Continuous movement, constant action and constant confusion Sometimes it can help a lot of other people. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie Some points in the movie (Especially the sex scene) seems to be true too, even if they add effects to movies that have never been without them It's a very stubborn movie. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is one of Colin Farrel's better movies (if not his great performance). The body is great. 9/10 -sysnuk3r
