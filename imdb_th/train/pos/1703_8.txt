From a small town in Illinois, I can immediately relate to this movie. Considering the era that was created, the townspeople seemed uncomfortable like many people that I grew up with. Yes, the plot is so-so. And yes, the show will not be nominated for an Academy Award soon, but that's not the point. The point is to suppress reality and just have fun. And this movie has lots of fun From the greed, the banker who doesn't care about the good meaning But the dim helpers, this movie was created to stimulate the fun of sciFi and small city life. Who can't smile when seeing the Drone Enforcer or Vern Droid and I love FarmZoid? I grow up Overall, considering the technology that is available now, this is a delightful rhythm in your childhood when you can sit on a Saturday afternoon, popcorn in your hand and laugh at the city life. This is a movie that I will watch again and again if there is no reason other than to motivate myself and my small town.
