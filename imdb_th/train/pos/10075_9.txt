"Masks" are animated movies that can be used at many levels. The easiest, it is a haunted story of a street performer bound with a small child while trying to pass on his creative art (mask) to the next generation Although sometimes the story will make the old man enter the job But it is a very good craft (Writing an act of directing excellent production) is easy to overcome the fate And if you go with it eventually, the movie is sweet and raised Glorious all around This film is a great movie for children and adults. The trick is how to make Americans who don't like foreign movies to watch!
