I did not expect the experience of creating a powerful movie of "Girlfight". It was an indie. Low budget, no actor, big name, new director I heard that it's good. But it is not that good And frustrated with her high school friends causing problems with her school and friends. She was raised by her only father who seemed to love her and her brother. But using the standard two strict sexual standards with his children, the two standards of the father are shown by the fact that Tiny, a brother, is studying boxing at a local gym. But Diana was denied a similar quest Diana was punched by boxing. Tiny didn't like boxing, so he and Diana made exchanges. He received money from his father and then gave Diana to attend school instead of him. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that feels really good when Diana grows and learns about himself through fighting And fix some serious serious problems There is no joke. Everything that can go will go right. Resolution is "Bend it like Beckham" The reality and problems of the participants are too big for solving the problem of stroking. But in my opinion, "Girlfight" is a better and more satisfying movie for it.
