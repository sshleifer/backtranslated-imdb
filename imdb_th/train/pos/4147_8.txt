I don't think this movie is suitable for everyone. But I saw it this weekend in Seattle and I thought it was very funny. I didn't laugh hard during watching movies for a long time. I think all actors are doing very well. You will find yourself laughing from the first moment to the final scene. I wonder if some movie viewers (Especially those who take the guidelines too seriously) will be closed by the humor of this brand, not me. This movie is really surprising And the whole theater rolled with laughter throughout the performance that I went to, making me think that many people enjoy themselves and are happy to have a good time in movies for change. I can't wait to see it again! If you are in the mood of LOL, this is what you need. Funny jokes funny jokes!
