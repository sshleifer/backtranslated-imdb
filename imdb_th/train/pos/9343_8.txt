I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler. In fact, I don't think I've ever liked him for what I've seen him. The opening scene of this movie confirms my worst fears. There was Adam Sandler playing a ridiculous character that rode around New York City with a ridiculous and lost motorcycle. General character Sandler loser again. I think I almost gave up and there. But when I am stuck with this, I discover things I never knew before: Adam Sandler can show! He is truly outstanding in this film when Charlie, who is a lost and lonely person, the whole family. (Including dogs) were killed in one of the hijacked planes on 9/11 and apparently Don Cheadle played as a roommate in his old college, which connected unexpectedly with Charlie and used it as his mission to help him improve. Of course, Alan Johnson of Cheadle had problems and sources. Come of dissatisfaction and these two men manage to help each other through their difficulties. The two of them create a team that is completely believable and especially Sandler makes Charlie a reality by working through his emotions and feelings. This is not Sandler's comedy. If you are looking for what he wants This is a rather heavy movie - sometimes sad, sometimes with hope and always obsessed. There are some funny parts in it. I like the scene in which Charlie convinces Alan to confront his partner by reminding him how he is in college, and then the two conversations later. <br /> <br /> Personally, I don't. Thinks that Saffron Burrows has increased in the movie Donna, Johnson's poor patient. The only reason for the character to seem (Looking back only) that she looks creepy like Charlie's wife But that was never developed at all, and I didn't care much about it. Do not look for the part of the judge. However, played by Donald Sutherland, which I think has been caught in some parts. But as far as I was concerned, this was Sandler's movie and his glory for a great performance. Of course, in my opinion, 8/10
