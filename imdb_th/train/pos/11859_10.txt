In MTV, all ball cribs and callers pull the Scarface classic movie out of their DVD set. This may give you the idea that Scarface is a "gangster movie". Of course, there are gangsters and villains in there. But that's not the point of Scarface. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is the only Cuban refuge looking for a new way of life. He falls into the mob and becomes a well-known drug master. Montana is for doing what you want to do with your life. The classic phrase: "Say hello to my little friend!" In Scarface. This quote is always in my heart when I think about Brian DePalmas, Scarface movies. This is under my top 10 movies. I will give you a score of *** 1/2 (from ****). The movie you have to watch is definitely amazing.
