I remember when I was five years old and my parents thought it was a normal animated film .... except when the bras and bullets began to fly. I have to admit, this movie will make everyone and everyone upset because it is determined to distinguish everyone and everyone .... But the truth is that it's a joke like hell while it's deep. I recommend this to everyone who likes classic cult. Try Fritz the Cat and NINE Lives of Fritz the Cat. If I'm right, Ralph Bashki also makes that movie. It's related to cats that have to go through difficult times. With my family, street, work, etc. When I was old enough, I rented all these movies because Coonskin was a disgusting name in that era. It was therefore identified as the Street Fighter Ralph Bashki. very Heavy traffic is another cartoon related to life on the streets of a young man.
