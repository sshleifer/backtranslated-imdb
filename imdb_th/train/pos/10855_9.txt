Looking back over the past 28 years (from the first time I watched the program), what I can say is: when you receive it - it will be with you forever. I remember my initial reaction was: 1) overacted, annoying 2) under production 3) different characters <br /> well <br /> two years later I watched some episodes again and not Think it's almost annoying One year later, I was able to play the entire series from the beginning and quickly became the story of the bitterness of human error and the perspective of happiness. Yes, the list has a style that is not suitable for everyone, and I am confident that outdated production value will be difficult to manage right now. But I still think about acting at least once a month with eyes filled with tears that yearn for things that seem easier ... <br /> <br /> BTW I'm a married man ... (For everyone who thinks This is a list for women)
