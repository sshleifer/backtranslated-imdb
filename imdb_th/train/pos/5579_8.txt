I have never heard of this before, until I accidentally discovered when browsing IMDB. I saw that it had received many horrible comments with very colorful annotations. Of course, this means I have to see it. I'm surprised because whipping is a really good movie. I watched it with a group of friends and we laughed more than we used to be, a very famous Hollywood comedian. This film is an independent film and shows the story of it. (Sex and dating) without the usual Hollywood fakery I clearly doubt that the opinions of the people in this film will be greatly dependent on their life experiences. If you have never been dating or dating, you will not receive this movie because you will not meet people like these characters. If you have, you will be aware of the many situations that are shown in comedic ways. The ending is also good because it does not show that a woman is a romantic person who is innocent, doing nothing that is contrary to Hollywood movies.
