This is a great little film about the loneliness of a single man, Phillipe Harel, while Notre Heros is like a combination of Robert de Niro in Taxi Driver, Inspector Clouseau (in Stoicism) and Chauncey Gardiner. That (like Peter Sellers), he is single, but still has no clue how to attract the opposite sex. In fact, he doesn't use effort. <br /> <br /> He has patience and destiny that challenges. Can any - Jose Garcia to While his Tisserand is in the same condition But at least tried bravely to overcome his long-standing innocence (he was 28 years old and admitted that he had never had sex) <br /> <br /> Very good outdoor image in Paris Rouen, where two people travel to the software business They try nightclubs and places, but they are useless. My theory is that they are wrong - they go to the nightclub 'youth' more or less. They should try more types of older people, their own age. <br /> <br /> Harel became more isolated and tried De Niro a bit like in Taxi Driver. Ask your friends / colleagues. He stabbed The doctor who draws a beautiful girl in a nightclub. <br /> <br /> Look!
