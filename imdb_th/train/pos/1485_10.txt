This movie has a personality that plays on my part. I love the last scene when nobody knows what they will do with their lives. But it's great when you see and realize that the right priest is the second person. What are you doing there? The movie embraces you with a new life, an experience to be able to dream with others and reach those dreams. Also shows you the difficult life But give you the option to choose what you want and what you really want Hope this review is right for you. This film works well for me. I bought the movie by the way;) Take care
