The third movie and the final episode of this trilogy is the most obvious. It's a political movie rather than an ordinary entertainment. Eventually, Jason Bourne knows who he is and he will discover and remember the torture he was sent to kill his old self: he really killed the person who became his corpse. But in the end, the film revealed that all of this was organized and planned by the CIA in the BlackFire program that was clearly revealed in this film that it was intended to eliminate the American people. Everyone who seeks to prevent control of all societies, a limited number of people, who are the key officers of the CIA until 1980, when he was vice president That corresponds to what is being said on the internet Then the truth must be thanked Jason Bourne himself, but the main person who can bring that truth to the public and the only authority that can make decisions about the CIA is that the woman and the woman received the Senate. Generally related to examination. Women and the Senate; Read my lips. In US politics, there is a struggle in the media and two media are important for the presidential campaign: it's music and movies. Now, Hollywood and beyond intellectuals, academics and intellectuals are using theaters in general and this particular film to create a public concept that salvation comes from women and from the Senate. So go to the movies. It's quite fun and has a sweet scent of a moment and a big change that some people expect and others are waiting, but no one can pretend that it won't come: the only point is knowing that It will be profound and serious. <br /> <br /> Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne and Versailles University Saint Quentin en Yvelines
