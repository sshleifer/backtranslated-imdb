In a small town in Montana, two brothers grew up. One of them is Norman (Craig Sheffer) and the other is Paul (Pitt). Their father is Reverend Klein and they grow up with lessons related to religion and lessons of fall fish In this fly-fishing movie, it shows a little life. <br /> <br /> A good story and draw your attention. Maybe the movie has this period because it's not about the incident. But about the message Something happened Norman went to Dartmouth to study After six years he returned and participated with a beautiful girl named Jesse. (Emily Lloyd) and he was invited to teach in Chicago. Paul became a journalist and was known as "Fishing reporter" He is famous and seems to have a good life. But he drank too much and played too much. <br /> <br /> The film is very well directed. The most beautiful thing in this movie is the movie. The mountains, forests and rivers are all very beautiful. If movies are created for these things only, it is good enough to watch. Good luck with more
