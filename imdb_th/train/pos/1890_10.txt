This is one of the movies I've seen many times that I can reference almost anything. Some lines in this film are unbeatable. I enjoy watching him stumble and fall, especially while drunk, go out to the drunken fancy restaurant and the moose section. <br /> <br /> I don't know how many times I saw this sequence at the time. . From the moment Arthur reaches the place of Father Susan to the moose, you will laugh all the time. I remember watching the time spent with moose. It goes down like I imagine. They laughed so hard. It was difficult for them to shoot. <br /> <br /> Sir John Jill Kut, the deceased, is a great member of this story. One of his gestures in his fleet and the way he handles Arthur is funny. It was always a funny moment when he hit his head with his hat or told him that he ____ was a bit broken. I laughed every time I listened. "I'll shower" and the next chapter
