Not only is African-American classic comedies But also one of America's classic cult They don't make movies like this again. My family is a movie enthusiast, so this website helps a lot in debating problems. I have been deployed in Iraq now. This helps me connect with the world that I know in America. Thank you, IMDb. I recommend this website to all my friends. Don't just obey my words. Try it yourself. The ten lines are very useful for commenting on a movie that I think But if it gets the point, I'm enough!
