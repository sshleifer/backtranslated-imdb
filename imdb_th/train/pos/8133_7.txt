I don't like personal rap But I still found that I was scared of the black hat I'm sure I didn't get a joke. But I know and it's funny enough to make me laugh after I stop laughing. I am a big fan of the Spinal tap. So naturally I have to try it out. This is from This Is Spinal Tap. Sometimes blatantly. But this film still stands on its own as a satire, clever and funny My personal favorites: "Back in the time of slavery, they had no hats to protect them from the sun, so at the end of the day they were too tired to protest. Now we have a hat."
