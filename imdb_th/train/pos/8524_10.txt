Children aged 7-14 years have been very popular with this film, which we have made copies for other children on our birthday list this year. They all like it! Children from 2 to 7 look repeatedly and often, and we get kicked from watching with them. <br /> <br /> It's hard for the movie to entertain children for a long time and offer sound. Laughing with adults too. Most enjoy it more than the first time. <br /> <br /> Excellent quality production and great actors led by Christopher Showerman as George. Great - strong, powerful and amazing. Trust in every aspect with The simple, cute and special. The special ability of facing trees - well supported by Christina Pickles, an evil parent, Thomas Hane's Church, is a wicked competitor and others are fun.
