Daniel Day-Lewis is the most versatile actor in his life. The English noble snobbery in a room with a view of stealing Irish thieves in the name of a father who killed a brutal and violent gang in New York. Brown with cerebral palsy in My Left Foot (only a few names). His role has influenced others. But each one is separate and fully unique He changed completely with each character he used. And I began to believe that he could act as anything else. <br /> <br /> As Christie Brown, he was amazing. He didn't laugh at the characters, and he didn't pity the character. The difficult achievements and Cristy Brown come back to life again. The smart man, the evil man, is human. <br /> <br /> This film, despite the small irregularities of changing scenes and things Inspiring Yes, it's predictable. But is it a foolish feeling? No, I laughed. I cried. Not a single moment of cheese. Prove that this is not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the scene in the restaurant when Cristy talks to the painter with Eileen Peter and her friends. This is what Daniel Day-Lewis came to the top of the show. "I will kick you in one part of your moving anatomy" "Wheel deformed!" And his performance never slows down, never stumbles and is beautiful. He has a lot of time here I watched it again and I never got bored with Christie's sharp eyes, jerky speech and throaty words. <br /> <br /> Must see for sho, yo!
