I have seen this movie many times and for my life I cannot understand why some people compare it to BABE. This movie is not about the secrets of every animal that can talk secretly. But it was the story of a parrot who learned to talk to help the stubborn young woman who was severely overpowering her speech barrier just to separate herself from the scene of a heart attack. Then the great journey began. Paulie the Parrot set out and tried to find a close friend named Marie. <br /> Along the way he met many great people and many nasty people. He falls in love with a parrot and loses her. He was put into the life of a crime and then a bad scientist who wanted to find him Will help him escape and find the people he loves. Marie <br /> <br /> Tony Shaloub shines as a charity with an open mind and a great heart and those who strive to Help little Polly even There will be risks. Jay Mohr shows Parrot's voice and is one of the fiercest characters he encounters. <br /> <br /> There is a language that has little guidance. But this movie is suitable for most children and even more so if parents join Fun and watching too It is the story of the adventures of an intelligent, witty creature and ultimately a great love story about Bird and his little daughter. He searches for Marie to end with an unexpected surprise for most people who do not know about Parrots. <br /> <br /> Children who have seen the green parrot tribe in Los Angeles And Pasadena would be especially helpful This film and understanding that birds, especially parrots, are not disposable pets. Every child everywhere will see that pets create a strong bond and love and loyalty of dogs or parrots is a lovely gift. <br /> <br /> So there is no BABE here. Twist. > <br /> Fun and trying not to tear between the sad parts
