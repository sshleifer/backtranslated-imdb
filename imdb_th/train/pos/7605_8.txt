Lost is a well-made TV series about some people wandering on the island. There are many fluctuations and you can't decide who your favorite character is. One minute, he then does something to make him the coolest. He will do something to make him create things. The coolest To blow the ending and what you like noooooooooooooooooooooo !!!!!! So you have to wait a whole week to watch the next episode. But it is worth the wait Suspense, action, romance, humor makes everything different from naked women. But that is good because it means that you can concentrate on the story more and the story is what it is about. So if you like a good story and like suspense, this is a good thing. However, 24 I think it should be better. (I have comments about that as well as you can check.) I will score 8 out of 10, mostly because it's unpredictable. You never know what will happen next.
