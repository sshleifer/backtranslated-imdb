Most comments that I have heard about meatball machines have been pretty mixed. The couple said that they thought "It sucked". Okay, for the person I said would have imagined f @ ckin and go to f @ ck yourself. This is a very fun flick. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a mechanical bug that attacks and transforms its host into a Gwar series, which is a Deathbord called Necroborgs. These mechanics are also attached to a small parasite that can control your actions because your nervous system is hot. Unfortunately for the two young adults with love, they encounter mechanical obstacles and before you know that the changes have occurred and the blood is splashing. Is there a way to stop the change? Could it be a way to stop this mechanical error? Why is Necroborgs fighting against each other? Two desperate singles have expressed feelings for each other and do nasty things? There is only one way to know. <br /> <br /> Getting into the meatball machine I'm worried because of the mixed reaction. Questions that have not yet been answered, some questions, average performances at times, and slightly confusing ends are the only weaknesses I can think of. From the anime to the senses of the parasite, becoming a small character and even a low budget feeling, this movie is more popular than it is missed. With a developing story that is interesting enough to ask questions all the time, mixed with makeup and bloody effects, this is a big fan of strange / horror fans / Tetsuo fans. 8 outta 10
