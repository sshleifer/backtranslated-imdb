The perfect movie is rare. Although my favorite movie often has flaws - the rear window looks periodically. Sometimes Chris Elliot's character in Groundhog Day doesn't work. Our Best Years of Lives score is too wonderful - but the movie This proceeds perfectly from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The script is great, great performances (although Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston are great, all performances), directors and photography The inspiration intrusive (as Miramax score some distortion too) every time I am truly moving moments of light makes me smile. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I hope that there will be many movies that I like. <br /> <br /> I'm glad Reese Witherspoon is a star after the movie. this But I regret to see that her latest film is both escape and ridiculous, more than a serious movie about real people. True feelings and true problems. Excellent! Must see
