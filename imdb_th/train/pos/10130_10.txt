The pilot did very well. It shows how the characters are bound in the next episode. I don't think anyone will create a better pilot for this program. It shows outstanding creativity in the writer's section. Although not everything that is stretched out because it is the first But there are many events that occur in the next season in the pilot. An example would be the future relationship of Ross and Rachels, although the nervousness of the first episode appears But was overcome with an amazing plot and outstanding options
