I really enjoy the movie. But I didn't realize that Little Richard had many things going on in his life. First of all, I do not know about Lucille. There is very little talk about the little girl associated with Little Richard, even in his life today. I wonder why this part of his life was not mentioned. Overall, this movie is great. I don't like Leon who plays Little Richard. He's a good actor. But I feel that part should go to be an actor His eyes didn't remind me of Little Richard. I didn't know the promiscuity that Little Richard was part of. From the movie, he is seen as a sex addict. At the present time, he will be referred to his counseling for sexual enhancement. He is a voyeur I do not want to destroy movies for people who have never watched movies before. But there are many things about movies that I feel should not be part of the final cut.
