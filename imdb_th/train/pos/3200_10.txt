This is Canada's best comedy series. The film tells the way in which Jean Paul Tremblay- (Julian) and the screenwriter of the show and his friend Rickie and Bubbles play above all else in real life that is satirical in the trailer park. This film will tell you. Why Ricky and Julian started to attack more advanced in the crime world Why and the reason behind everything is a spoiler, so I won't give the real reason behind their wonderful escape. Bubbles is a great character. All performances are excellent and missing. The movie will not affect the way you see one sitcom. It's a joke with capital C and great words about living in parking, trailer and crooks. Little time with little thought but big dreams. If you ever have the opportunity to see-buy-steal this program, grab it. You will be glad you did. And for my American friends --- it will give you 10 out of 9 TVs that the TV should be like
