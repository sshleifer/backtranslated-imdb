Just watched this movie again after thirty-seven years I am eleven years old and caught this flick at South Beach at the cinema theaters in Washington Avenue in 1969. I think where it is! Is a very good movie However, after almost forty years, it is not as good as it should be. The time has changed and now this movie has become a war between the weary new generation. However, it captured the place at the time which was just a memory. It's a very interesting story to see the old mod, vegas fashion, Don Rickles somewhere, smoking in a bunch. The show is quite good, the script is quite outdated. But memories are still new It may not be for you. But for me it is still a good and enjoyable journey
