I saw this movie at the BIFFF festival in Brussel in the spring of 2004. It was really amazing! This German manufacturer is a shocking, stylish and imaginative one of the most terrifying things I've ever seen. Be warned: This is not a joke! This terrorist has a good actor (example: Peter Martell as a European guru has a strong position), excellent direction, good production design, eight great soundtracks, ripped flesh with bones ... and Blood is red ... This fierce heart will catch you ... and give you a dark dream ... have to watch !!
