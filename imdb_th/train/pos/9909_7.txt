Serious comedy movie Ross Hunter produced the movie version of the French drama "Les Joies de la famille" (later Americanized in the name "A Rich Rich Woman"). Unfortunately, there is no time. A wealthy California widow who seems to have abandoned her money, she is being coveted by two daughters and growing up, both of whom are afraid that Mama Rosie will use his legacy in negligence All the problems that are important - but older - women are sent to the shelter home with her will and after that have to prove themselves that there is a reason for a court hearing as a comedy for actors. Not loading images overload with jokes or clear convictions) Some humor is quite wide and unusable, but Rosalind Russell understands the gravity that arises in this situation and never receives false messages. Sandra Dee is like the granddaughter of Rosalind and James Farrentino, very charming as a young lawyer. The movie has a lot to say about the importance of our elders and how they choose to spend the rest of the time. That is the theme of the theme "Rosie!" Almost disappeared during the time of happiness The picture makes you smile - and at the same time wondering how many older women have never been so lucky *** from ****
