People call this funny. But when I watched it, I laughed <br /> <br /> only once I guess the problem is that I first saw it when I was 14, <br /> <br /> And I wasn't old enough to understand that it was not intended to be <br /> <br /> serious. A few scenes that <br /> <br /> are funny But I pay too much attention to the characters to laugh. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch this movie the next time you fall in love. <br /> <br /> and try hard I think you will find that even with a few flaws. <br /> <br /> But it's one of the most moving love stories you've ever seen.
