This is a movie that I saw when first released and I saw it many times over the years. It's always fun. <br /> <br /> One thing that is funny is not in favor of: It tilts labor and capitalism equally. Sid seems to be outside of the classic battle, even though he is responsible > <br /> Warning Spoiler: Don't read more if you don't see this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a fantasy. But offered reliably Ask yourself: Can someone support his or her weight in one line? It will cut through almost all the support. <br /> <br /> In addition, when the corner in Soi Sid uses garbage can cover, such as the knight's armor. Cute symbol <br /> <br /> One day I'll put it on the DVD.
