This is Jackie Chan's best movie and I like it personally. After the United States created a disappointing 'The Protector', directed by James Glickenhaus, Jackie put this concept in Hong Kong. This may be Jackie's most violent movie, with audiences stunned by acrobatics. <br /> <br /> The action is fast and furious. Jackie and his team put their best effort. In combat design Broken bones and blood spilled in the process of making this film as you saw on credit. <br /> <br /> The script is easy for the police and the robbers. There is nothing special after it is written around the action. English has some dubbed dubbing But it shouldn't cause you too much. <br /> <br /> So get around the players, open the beer and enjoy the beer. By the way, the film was nicknamed 'The Glass Story' by the talent show team. Why? I will let you search for yourself !!
