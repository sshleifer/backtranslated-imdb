The Woman In Black is an English film created for the television movie which first aired on BBC on Christmave Eve in 89 years and again in the year '92. I believe it was done around on American TV in A&E. It was released on the VHS. In the United Kingdom in the early 1990s, but printed out, the company in the United States released the DVD later. But that model was sold out as well According to the author's website, the rights to the movie are owned by others and it will not be released again and has sold informal bootlegs on eBay. <br /> <br /> I heard first about With this movie recently on the message board and must try I found a copy on eBay about $ 28. Of course, it's a fake from the Far East seller, although the DVD says "Made in Canada." Haha. But it is a good copy and you can't really make a mistake with the bootleg label that releases rare stuff and is lost in legal disputes. <br /> <br /> I love movies. It was a period that was set in the 1920s with authentic English and unusual settings at that time. Women in black have a very dark atmosphere and atmosphere. In most cases, the movie is a very low key. But effective and scary There is no cruelty, violence, or anything in the special effects, but The Woman In Black can still create a chilling moment for sure. It's a cool classic ghost movie. The movie itself seems to have been created in the 1930s, except for the color. If there were no modern horror films of all kinds, I was afraid that this movie would always be a lost gem. For me, it poses as one of my favorites all the time.
