This movie has horrific reviews. But because it is unusual and because critics often do not "get" an unusual movie, I think I will try it Unfortunately they are mostly correct. In this case, <br /> <br /> The movie also feels awkward. The type of feeling that is impossible to explain But it's not good The script is the only pointless, interesting and interesting thing. <br /> <br /> Thurman, who is very talented, just floats through this mess. Hurt and Bracco tries in vain to add. Something in the movie with an enthusiastic performance But nothing in the script It may be less embarrassing for them if they choose to drift and get it as well as Thurman. <br /> <br /> One thing the film critic "Popular" not to mention quite funny, whether it is the time of the correct words or some strange moments, such as when the cowgirls hunt down, attacking their pets with an unwashed smell. Their ... Ahem ... The front of the chortles are constantly experiencing. Although I do not recommend this movie, there is entertainment to be had and watching even the Cowgirls Get the Blues is worth it for different things.
