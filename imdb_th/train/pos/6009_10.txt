Mark Frechette is Mark, a radical left member. Mark was accused of killing the police during the riots on campus and he fled to the desert. He did it by stealing a small plane at a local airport and flying by himself. <br /> <br /> When flying out in the desert, Mark would spot the car from the air. A young woman named Daria stepped out and saw Marge in the plane. Mark swept the plane very low several times, causing Daria to throw or hit When he landed, he would become familiar with Daria, who was fascinated by Mark's high-air mark. <br /> <br /> After hours of emotional conversation Then Mark and Daria were naked and loved in the sand. But when Mark avoids the law, they realize that he wants to continue running. The short appointments of Mark and Daria are quite severe because they do not develop into a romantic full of impressions. <br /> <br /> Zabriski Point is Eraserhead of the early 70's. Unclear quality travel with complex meanings and characters. Frechette is a careless person like his character in this movie. A few years after scoring Zabriski, Frechette robbed a bank in real life. While serving a prison sentence, Mark died of atheism. He was killed with a weight of 150 pounds, which fell to him when he lifted weight. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is the great movie and special effects. The incredibly slow moving scenes of the ruins that float in the air after the explosion are intelligent rhythms. Although not a new movie like Easy Rider, Zabriski Point still resonates with the anti-culture era of the early 70s. I recommend for those who like the protective film that represents the major changes of the rebellion in the early 70s.
