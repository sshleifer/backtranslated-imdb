I just saw this at the Toronto Film Festival and I hope it opens because I want to see it again! It's a character-driven movie, and Andrew and David are more than a mission. Any discussion about the plot may be <br /> <br /> which is considered a spoiler, so I just say that the story is wise. The performance is excellent. Good shooting and walking as well. One of the best movies I have seen for a long time and is very refreshing in the dull summer of movies. <br /> <br /> There are people laughing all the time. See if you can (I especially like the "Candy bar! Candy bar!")
