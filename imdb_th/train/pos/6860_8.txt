Bobby, a transsexual psychopath, murders the patient. (Angie Dickinson) from a famous doctor (Michael Kane) then prostitutes with a high price (Nancy Allen) Liz (Allen) is in suspicion of a crime and cooperates with the patient's son (Keith Gordon) to catch the murderer. <br /> <br /> It can be summed up in two words. : It's very sexy (Dickinson) and Allen looks very good) It's very blood - with normal blood that is reserved for water splash movies and kids are good crafts. The script of writer / director De Palma is ok. But it uses the ability to make movies for that man It has been very successful at the internal organs level and I am involved / interested in these characters. I can observe that De Palma shows respect for / tearing Hitchcock's - at least from one of the teachers' pictures. <br /> <br /> And above all, there are professional and reliable actors. <br /> <br /> This is De Palma's third film and Nancy Allen, the ex-wife (after "Carrie" and "Home Movies"). <br /> <br /> By Rachel Ticotin is the actress. With performance Production Assistant There is no matter for you. <br /> <br /> I don't think the thriller will have levels and blood at the same time. But this image pulls out. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about it is the outstanding score of the typical Pino Donaggio song. <br /> <br /> 8/10
