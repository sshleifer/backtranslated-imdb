David Duchovny has a leading role in this film. Now, a lot of people, when finding out the truth that will not interfere with the look, are not fair to say the least. Eugene Sands (Duchovny) is a drug addict who is out of malpractice by a real accident. He became a private doctor for the criminals Raymond Blossom. In Eugene trap block Blossom Angelina Jolie plays the role of Claire - Moldova thugs her strong character. Timothy Hutton plays Blossom as a great person and deeply absorbs his character. Duchovny himself is not as bad as many people think, and in the end I will give him his performance. Credible. He has a boring tone and a straight face that is already familiar. But did not deviate too much from the movie
