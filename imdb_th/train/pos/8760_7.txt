Feeling refreshed to see a movie that you think will end happily like almost all American movies and be surprised when it doesn't happen. I like the ending that is as happy as the next man. But sometimes it is better to convey things in a more realistic manner and I think Brokedown Palace is doing well. <br /> <br /> The ending with a friend in general. Sacrificed himself for others, thus redeeming her previous duties, which caused them to get into the situation at first. I almost do without the last line, which proves that she really did not do what she confessed because that would make the film about friendship between two girls and crime less. No matter what you do or doesn't matter, <br /> <br /> The story is surrounded by ancient ideas. But the actress paid attention to their great performances. Very realistic, very cute. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
