I might say that Hitchcock's shade ... is better than MMM, which is obviously wrong by most Woody fans. Did you know that Annie Hall thought it was the first murder mystery? However, Woody is back in the comedy movie. The plot is good and tight. I would say that in the first 20 minutes or more, some actors rushed to send their chapters slightly. Scarlett Johansson proved well in the role of Diane Keaton, and there was no time to have an uneasy moment between her and Woody Old, no one can imagine the perfect actor for the role of Peter Lyman than Jackman.
