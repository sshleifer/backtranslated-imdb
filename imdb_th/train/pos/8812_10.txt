I saw this series when the world premiered at the Toronto Film Festival. I like the idea behind this film, which the two men gathered and told the director from each country to direct the film about 911. These directors never met before until the project was completed. Warning: Spoiler Ahead !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Every piece is very powerful and some people argue. If you are an American, you may not like this because some pieces may be counterproductive to Americans. However, I know that some Americans like these series. The parts that I find best are parts from India. It's about a Muslim family living in the United States with 2 sons and one of them missing. The Americans gave them a cold shoulder and assumed that he was automatically linked to the terrorist bombings. It caught my mother's despair and humiliation of these allegations as well, causing my tears. In the end, we saw that her son had died while trying to save the victim from the collision of the tower. This is true and that's what makes it true. There are many emotional and powerful parts and African pieces are one of the best. It is funny But with the same power as others, must see for everyone and hope that America will cancel the ban and play in their country
