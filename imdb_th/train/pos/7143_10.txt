"Holes" is my favorite movie of all time! So far I have watched this movie three times in the cinema and I hope to buy it on DVD in the coming September. I read the book after watching the movie and was amazed by the same books and movies. The director of this film made a great contribution to creating a new book in the form of a movie. In addition, all the actors who choose to play the role are excellent in playing their characters. In particular, Max Kasch is ZigZag. The props for everyone involved in making this movie is a real success. ! 10 out of 10 stars. I would definitely recommend everyone to see!
