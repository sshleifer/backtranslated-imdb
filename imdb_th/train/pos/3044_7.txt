For anyone who may not know that this movie is the best example. This story is ridiculous and unreasonable. It is full of lamentable situations, hacking, melodrama, jokes ... you name it. <br /> <br /> But Amitabh Bachchan can create credibility and this movie is no exception. Everyone changed in the proper performance - Shashi Kapoor, Waheeda Rehman, Ranjit, Om Prakash, Smita Patil ... but it was Megastar that took care of everyone with his towering appearance. Without him, this movie will not be a beginner ... stories about discrimination / identity, misunderstanding / misunderstanding / love / hate / loyalty / good for evil - everything is true ! Amitabh has great performance in all the films that are stupid! And I mention that it's funny, right?
