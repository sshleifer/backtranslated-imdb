Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God gave everyone the ability to love the whole world. But because the human heart is very small, every human being has a special place that he loves more than anywhere else For me it seems that this may be the motto of some of the most famous directors today when they come to accept eternal love for a special place and describe the situation in the lives of residents and visitors. visit The result is a great collection of Paris je t'aime short films, which our guides, Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne and others take us to a breathtaking walk through the Parisian district Of men /> <br /> Always every quarter. There are also many moving stories about ordinary people finding love, whether in parking lots, art studios, subway stations and Paris je t'aime. Is a story of many love - Love for the spouse, children, parents for those who have meaning to our world But not around love that wants to rekindling serendipitous love For that stranger Or love that doesn't mean ... today, but tomorrow - who knows. <br /> <br /> However, this movie is not about love alone. But life itself, happiness, pain, loneliness, confusion Up and down every day And the most important quality is the fact that it doesn't seem to look right at all. But quite warm and full of hope <br /> <br /> I gave this movie to 9 because the last part of this story shows that some stories May develop further But not all of them and that is what I found missing and by "Further development" I do not refer to specific references about the future of the character. As far as everything is concerned, I can only speak. Makes you want to leave everything behind you, flee to Paris and live your own life
