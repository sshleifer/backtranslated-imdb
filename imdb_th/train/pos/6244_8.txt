Every country that has a working film industry has conscious artists. (Some people may be crazy) that create movies that you can understand completely when you are part of this country. I guess Hundstage is a movie like this. <br /> <br /> You see the society of Austria at the lowest level. Dirty, strange interference and hate But they still have enough money so they can buy cars and big houses. And they are doing many strange things here, which may seem like they are 'normal' because they do it all their lives From a general human perspective, you can follow this film easily and objectively or fascinated and watch the Austrian art film. <br /> <br /> But if you are here and you know who you see the characters in Hundstage is a tumor of society. A society that is more crazy every day. Create your own rules that no one understands. Understand the social system from the inside. And you see people sitting in the park standing at the corner of the street opposite waiting for the same row. Maybe you find them in a bar or disco where you may go. Maybe you work with them on your job or they're next to your home. You start to hate them without knowing the cause. You will try to escape - but you can't. Maybe you like them But it seems 'normal' for you because you have done it all your life. Now ... <br /> <br /> Life is not bright, even though Austria is one of the richest countries in the world. Beautiful people ... But some people are ugly There are a lot of hard-working people trying to do the best ... but there are some people riding in the back of others and destroying everything that the Austrians have built up until now. <br /> <br /> Pessimistic A lot of movies
