This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I was very impressed with the theme that the movie intended to convey. One sentence that came up in my heart was "History repeats" Life is what appears in movies: when young people, they don't seem to understand their parents, their spouses People have excuses every time they don't share their love with their children until too late. People have to work hard to support the whole family. But tend to ignore the deep feelings of their partner People often change their views during different periods of life. People can be forgiven if their hearts are filled with the love they love. There is nothing more important than a blood relationship that people have in this world, and no one is too late to talk to people about the things they feel are at the bottom of the heart in order to achieve understanding between together To end some days, people should not feel sorry or sad because they keep their words and always have hope. --- New life, actors and actresses are excellent. They understand the director's intent completely. The charm of this movie, for me, the effects of bringing cheers and tears that fused with the audience.
