This is a bar. There are no funny movies that I have ever seen. Beginning with the four offenses that their father sent to the military school, Wienberg has a continuous setting throughout this goofball movie and it doesn't give up for a second. <br /> <br /> It's hard to explain. This film; The humorous element is an important point and can be realized perfectly. When looking at it for the first time, it seems nothing more than a foolish 80s teen comedy movie, but it's even more! Fresh from the thoughts of those people at MAD Magazine Up the Academy offers recipes and styles that I have never seen before by offering any "jokes" coming out of Hollywood in the past year. Essentially, this film is filled with material made from baby corn in childhood, which you might have guessed that writers younger than 14 years by themselves watch this movie if you like to do "soft" classic * ****
