Man, I love the new DVD that Universal took. I have never seen THE SENTINEL look good like this before because I have to endure the crappy VHS tape for many years. Unfortunately there is nothing more than a trailer that looks worse for wearing. And avoid DVDs. Goodtimes at all costs are terrible. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the fashion model with Alison Parker problem (Christina Raines) moved into the New York Brownstone Haunted. It has more than just a haunted. It is also the gateway to hell and the Vatican is still an old priest. (John Carradine) takes care of it and makes sure that the demons and angels don't escape. <br /> <br /> All actors are full of old-fashioned actors such as Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy. , Jose Ferrer and others ... including the upcoming 80 stars, such as Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum, inexplicably coated) and Tom Berenger and you won't know Jerry Orbach from LAW & ORDER me Have to do it twice when i'm not in the position that i've seen him before > <br /> Alison's great gore scene slits his eyes and nose from the rotting father's corpse that is possessed by the devil and has a dead end that the disabled, the disabled, try to haunt Alison for suicide She will not be the next person to protect the portal. It seems that Alison's troubled past makes her an important candidate for the Vatican to become the next guard. <br /> <br /> The eerie classic 70s from director Michael Winner shouldn't. miss I also recommend for those who want something beyond imagination than stupid and horror funny teenage fangs. <br /> <br /> 7 from 10 <br /> <br /> -
