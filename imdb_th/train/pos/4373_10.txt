I asked everyone that they were not interested in this movie. Some examiners say that it doesn't have enough action. Some people say it's too long, etc. Don't listen to them !!! If you like Shawshank Redemption and / or Braveheart, you will definitely love this movie. <br /> <br /> The performance is great! Tim Roth, John Hertz and Jessica Lang are great people and Liam Neeson works well and is a very impressive character because of his size. The movie was excellent and amazing. It's about a few films that I have seen in my life (along with Shawshank) that is almost flawless from selection, directing, writing, acting and more !!! In 50 or 100 films that have received criticism I feel very passionate about this that I just registered with IMDB to let everyone know that there is a real scoop. I've watched this movie about 10 times (each time with different people) and everyone loves it! You must be vigilant and careful in the first 30 minutes because they introduce quite a few characters at first. If you have more interest than children, most young people who write movie reviews on this website more than you love this movie! Come ... 3 movies, Lord of the Rings in the top 9 and The Matrix at # 32?!?! That should show the age of the most criticism here. <br /> <br /> This is the top 50 movies !!!
