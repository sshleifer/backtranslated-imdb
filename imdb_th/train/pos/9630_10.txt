I've seen Dirty Work many times, and it may be a short story that I and Stella love. <br /> <br /> In this Stan and Olle chimney sweep the chimney and find a job. Clean the chimney at the house of Professor Noodles (Lucien Littlefield) while the noodles are experimenting madly in his lab. Stan and Ollie cause a lot of chaos in cleaning the chimney and cleaning the room. play In the end, Ollie fell into a special recipe tank that Noodles used for his experiments and made him become a chimpanzee! The best part is that Ollie fell into the chimney and the bricks that fell on his head. But it seems that he doesn't have much pain from this story. <br /> <br /> The dirty job is Stan and Ollie, the most fun. <br /> <br /> Score: 5 stars out of 5
