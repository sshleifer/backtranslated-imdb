If you delete the first twenty minutes of this movie, you will get a great comedy. As it is, I still find that it's a pretty movie that doesn't have any success when considering the coma I put into the opening scene This movie has a boring beginning that is not funny or is in the distance. However, when things happen, you will be left with a comedy that is still famous after three decades. Worth checking out, especially if you are a big fan of Lemmon and Matt who want to see previous work.
