Everyone who has watched this movie and examined it is not good. I will recommend them to Roger Ebert to review this movie. He is one of the most highly regarded critics in the industry and he gives 3 1/2 stars. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. It may not be perfect or exciting. But I enjoy it. Chorus is not a story because it's a group of stories about the life of Broadway's hopes. I read a review that says that too much time has lost love between Zach and Cassie. That is the wrong view. It's another story, along with all the other stories that tell each story about Broadway's hopes. What people do not realize is that the dancer for Broadway shows the same things that people have to face. And I think it's the point of all the performances. It not only shows the talents of these special dancers. But also giving us the painful things that are considered in general life This is a study of life as a Broadway star. Anyone who wishes to become a Broadway star, watch this movie with a good sense of relationship because they get through what the characters are experiencing. <br /> <br /> This is a great musical It has a slow point and sometimes a little confused with the rhythm of some stories. But overall I like it very much Try to see this movie more thoroughly, then maybe you understand what I'm talking about.
