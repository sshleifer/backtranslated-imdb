This is a great romantic comedy movie! Past inaccuracies (Einstein does not have a granddaughter or nephew as specified elsewhere in IMDb), but he created a great matchmaker. He compiled two very good people who played by two of the best actors working. The supporting actors (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Gene Saks, Stephen Fry and others) all click on the screen and make this a great viewing experience. The fact that he drove around seemed to contradict all his pictures and posters that rode around the bike and he wore socks in one scene ... As reported, the teacher never wore socks! (Two new shows for the IMDb goofs section.) Historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies. This is a great movie to watch along with the great actors.
