I was lucky enough to watch this film while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival. I am a big fan of classic horror movies and especially the tricks of William Castle. So this is something that I shouldn't miss. <br /> <br /> It's about the life and work of William Castle, who in thought. My being a real underrated director, he made cheap horror movies. But he added something to these movies: real theater features that you no longer see For example, he had a nurse in the event that someone had a heart attack in his movie and placed a vibrator at the bottom of the chair in THE TINGLER. <br /> <br /> This is a very well-made documentary and directing the director. Shadow To light and celebrate his participation in horror movies It also shows that the castle is a character that is larger than life, who is very fond of and has a smile on his face. <br /> <br /> Unlike most documentary films shown To see evidence from movie history Showing the most interviews from family members and directors influenced by his work, such as John Waters, John Landis and Joe Dante. Must watch for classic horror and sci-fi fans.
