This is the second episode of the 6 movie series "Tarzan Classic", with Johnny Weiss Muller playing the role and Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane. <br /> <br /> As usual, this is a great movie in this series. And may stand out as a movie "in the middle of" in a progression that almost exemplifies the development of movies since the beginning of the 1930s to the beginning of the 1940s. As such, it shows good speed, even if not as good as movies. Follow me Similarly, the movie will be less successful than the Tarzan movie later in this series. The stock I see is uneven, with grainy scenery and some scenes that are exposed and exposed to low light. The sharp display of the Tarzan movie later lacks here. On the other side, there is one scene which is very fast, where the jerky movements of the camera with the leaves are lashed forward while the backup camera shows that the safari men are disguised in the forest. Style and stand in contrast to the still images that make up the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> About the plot, one interesting story here is uncertainty and uncertainty of Jane. When Jane is close to Martin, kissing the charm? And Jane is shocking and has some guilt. Reaction ?? Tell the story of Jane that we see in the future as well in these movies. For example, compare in Tarzan Find a Son! Jane's repetitive actions trick Tarzan and send the boy to his family. After that, she admitted to Tarzan that she was wrong. Here, nothing is clear, but we have Jane "back" to Jane Parker of yesteryear and the actions to be almost routine for her to take off the dress that Martin and Harry lured her away from Tarzan. /> <br /> There is a whole set of depictions and sequences that make me very impressed with this viewing. <br /> <br /> For one thing, the image that we get from Tarzan's home life is here. as follows The combination of idol-sensual and the near possibility of serious death For me, this is the heart of the Tarzan experience. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised with the violent scenes, even in today's standards. <br /> <br /> There are both series. The scene that makes me especially happy: Tarzan leads the elephant into the valley of the elephant's tomb. Tarzan was rescued from the death of the water by a hippo, then a nurse for health by a monkey Cheetahs go to Tarzan when Jane and others are trapped at the foot of the hill. Cheetahs, especially across the river in notes The final battle scene of the forest & the lion on the ground and the barbarians & monkeys in the tree. Jane shows us that she is truly the world of Tarzan. At this time, shows a brave professional carpenter to put out the fire to chase the lion. <br /> <br /> The last scene of the series is excellent: Suddenly Tarzan is In the scene, throwing savages from trees and taking care of the lions and calling elephants to help! The last successful cry of Tarzan holding Jane happy in his arms, along with the choreography and excitement of the cheetahs beside them, is a memorable picture and a great summary of the story. Tarzan and Jane <br /> <br /> All of this is another classic Tarzan movie. I would like to recommend this movie very much to everyone.
