14 years of age, I'm very happy that now they can create good-looking fantasy movies and they're angry with Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia. Cash at the box office for the year. This will see (and have seen) many other things, most notably the Golden Compass, which has the most exciting example I have seen this year. Stardust from Neil Gaiman's novel appeared in theaters in Whether this week's more than just a peek. I don't see only a few examples for this ad. The important reaction is kind of blah. I won't see it if it's not because of the fact that I have to wait for a friend to see The Bourne Ultimatum and nothing interesting to open this weekend. If you forgive Pun that is horrible, the star must be in the correct position because I watch Stardust and I like it. It's not a big movie like Lord of the Rings. The plot line is your basic fantasy mission. (Hero determined to look for falling stars) that are full of obstacles. But within that basic outline, the story is lively and imaginative. It is just aiming to have a lot of fun and charming little love, and it is amazingly successful. This summer, there are many large movies. But none of them are as fun as this There are many stories going on. But the story has been told well and almost completely It's not a masterpiece. But of course it can occupy the same ground as the princess bride has (Although I don't like it as much as the previous movie). Lots of fun coming here if you're a fan of the genre.
