My 3rd year French classes have always enjoyed this movie. In a multicultural high school, this film provides many discussions. (In French in class But I know that there is a lot of talk in English after school.) The most obvious thing is the relationship between Protée and Aimée compared to Protée and France. <br /> <br /> I always say I feel. That this movie has a scene "The Sexiest" I've ever seen in a movie. One year, a 17-year-old African-American shouted "Yes!" When he sought the scene: the scene in which Protée was helping Aimée knit her evening dress all the time Inspecting the reflection of the other person in the mirror, the director uses "mirror techniques" to focus on internal conflicts in one or more characters. In the scene: This is a perfect example of techniques and Being "sexy" <br /> <br /> Most students have trouble understanding the end of the movie. It has been suggested that one theme of this film is "Africanism" and no matter how much people love Africa or Africans, we cannot "become" African (like a driver trying to do): Must be African
