The first official movie of Ghibli, Laputa is the same as the previous generation Nausicaa, but while Nausicaa is an epic SF, this is the action of a comedy action that is quite weak. A movie that i think i will love it Once again, you find yourself fascinated by Miyazaki's attention to detail and his ability to create a fantasy world in perfection that is beautiful and meticulous. Animation, although not yet in the league of Ghibli later, but better than Nausicaa. <br /> <br /> I'm talking about Nausicaa's criticism that one character was drawn in The style of anime here has them all: pirates. They provide cartoon elements in movies. But even then, why is it like a cartoon element? I'm not sure. There is nothing funny about Nausicaa and I think it is better for it. Still have to say that Dola, the pirate leader, is the most memorable character in this movie. (Even though she is a Long Long Silver woman, John, don't be surprised if you think of 'Treasure Planet' sometimes) and be well-voiced by Cloris Leachman in American dub. <br /> <br /> Voice overs. England is well tolerated. However, there is something starting to be a pear shape for me about this movie, about half way. I think the best way I can explain is that the characters are swallowed by the vast extent of the story. I will come back later. <br /> <br /> There are many things to admire about Laputa and many people, obviously, love, I almost feel that it means only 8 out of 10, but for surgery. This is 'admired'. It's more impressive than having personal effects, and after two hours, it just started dragging. <br /> <br /> The important thing for me is: I find that I really don't care. What a lot about characters.   สนีย์จะใช้ความระมัดระวังในการพัฒนาตัวละครทำให้คุณตกหลุมรักพวกเขาแทนที่จะปล่อยให้พวกเขาเป็นชิ้นสองมิติที่ค่อนข้างจะขยับไปมาในขณะที่คุณจ้องมองทิวทัศน์ที่น่าทึ่งในภาพยนตร์ Although it can be tolerated if there is a difficult matter in SF's story But it is very funny about the princess and the magic crystals That is what Laputa fell into as far as I was concerned and that was what made it impossible to be 10 in 10 movies. Having said that, have to admit that Miyazaki is a Disney advance league in 1986 when you consider that the movie's They in that same year were the horrible movie 'Great Mouse Detective'. <br /> <br /> Laputa is a good movie in some ways, an amazing movie and you should definitely see it. But I feel that it has been rated too much. I like 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind' earlier. <br /> <br /> BTW, if you manage to watch them, respectively, watch for the squirrel fox from Nausicaa. Appeared briefly in Laputa
