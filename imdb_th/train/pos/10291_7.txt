After a slow start, BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a funny movie that has something positive to say. It's not one of Jim Carrey's best performances, but he's still ok. Morgan Freeman is right like God. Jennifer Aniston has a good time. I miss Steve Corel in "THE DAILY SHOW!" <br /> <br /> I like Tom Shadyac's movie options. He also acts as a lie, patch Adams and nutrition expert. In the trio and in Bruce Almighty, he plays a great comedian and tells the story of a man with him. The director who knows jokes can get the talent he has received and can tell a meaningful and intelligent story that is hard to find. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is that they should use it. More scripture references I only remember three scripture references and it is the most fun part of the whole movie. I can guess that the first few screenplays have more scripture references. But they were cut because the manufacturers were afraid to make mistakes Terrible because I think it's a missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> My class: <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
