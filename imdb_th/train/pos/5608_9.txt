Of course, he is not always fast after this movie, but from "knife in the water" to "tenant" Roman Polanski can always count to give something interesting and unique. Although there are many themes (Strangely paranoid) His two films are not the same. The story of this story is similar to his "Repulsion" ten years ago. But the tone is completely different. "Tenants" manage to balance darker, darker, darker. (I hesitate to call it humor, though strange characters, occasional behavior and funny interactions) with some real suspicion. Polanski is a teacher who always creates uneasiness and time in this film. Creepy and almost unbearable The overall peculiarity of this film is another advantage. <br /> <br /> In addition to the beauty of Polanski, in the normal direction, the actors and the rest of the team are very involved. Polanski is often overshadowed by director Polanski, but his performance here captures his character awkwardly and feels like being driven out. The theme of social discrimination makes this film more than a strange novelty. The remaining actors also have strong performances, especially the sympathy of Isabelle Adjani and Melyvn Douglas and Shelley Winters. 'Properly annoying' tenants "are often underestimated because people are ready to appreciate both "Disgusting" and "Rosemary Baby" both, but it is as good as those classics (9/10)
