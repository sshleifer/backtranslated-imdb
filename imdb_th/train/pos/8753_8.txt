I saw this movie in the cinema and was very impressed with it. Then again, that was when Claire Dennes was a good actor, not a foolish woman who was arrogant in Hollywood today. However, this movie made me feel like one of the more raw, realistic and beautiful friendship movies. How far are you going to find your best friend? I ended up tearing and still tears when I watched now. (I own it) I remember as soon as I left the theater. I called my best friend and sobed with her how much I loved her. This is a great movie to watch with your best girlfriend. However, prepare for the exact conversation. After that, she turns to you and asks if you will do something like that to you or not.
