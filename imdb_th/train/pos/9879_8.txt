The presentation of Lily Mars may make Judy Garland one of the simplest roles she has while at MGM because Lily Mars is a character that she can definitely identify. The girl who has enough talent for the ten, she knows that she has something to do in the cinema, regardless of whether Van Heflin, the producer from her hometown, will block her. <br /> <br /> I like Judy in this story. Much One while the girl is determined to make it in the theater. Because it is Judy Garland's gift of Judy Garland, you in the audience know that you have the right thing, even if it takes Van Hevlin almost the whole story together. <br /> Both Judy and Heflin greet from the same small town. Heflin's father is a city doctor who sends her and Heflin as he may move out and become Major producers on Broadway, their mother, Feyben Ben North Bennington Springs and Dubai. That is her story But Heflin does not stop with starred children But there was never anyone like Lily Mars. <br /> <br /> There was no big hit from Lily Mars for Garland. The best thing in this movie is the resurrection of chestnut. In the age of light, every little movement has its own meaning. Judy sings with Connie Gilchrist and plays the cleaning lady in the Broadway theater with the performance of Heflin Gilchrist. It is the star of the FloraDora Girls and she and Judy deliver great style music with Connie. The best in this movie while Gilchrist encouraged Judy to keep it. Songwriter Karl Hoschna died a long time ago. But composer Otto Harbach is still alive and I bet he likes what he hears. <br /> <br /> European musician Marta Eggerth is presenting Lily Mars as a star. Who was puzzled at first, was angry and eventually understood Garland and Heflin. She made a few movies with MGM and then returned to Europe to work on other continents. I bet MGM didn't know what to do with her and her Hungarian accent, although Louis B. Mayer never met a soprano. <br /> <br /> Van Heflin did well as well. The producer of the patients who made a lot of Garland and Eggerth. Heflin had just released his Oscar for Johnny Eger last year and he and Garland will not be the ideal team. But they weren't bad. <br /> <br /> The presentation of Mars lilies is normal. Show the ability of Judy Garland And she doesn't need to share the screen in the backstage movie with Mickey Rooney
