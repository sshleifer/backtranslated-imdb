Ah, Kelly / Sinatra's Sailor Suit is familiar, right? Yes, but this is not something you often hear. About that city But if you go wrong, you may learn something that doesn't matter. However, Anchors tells Aweigh the story of two or three crew members taking a leave of absence for four or three days. Joe is "sea wolf" and Clarence, a bookworm type, asks him Get "The Heroine" Joe. Now, after they are picked up by them, they get Donald to go home. That's what they found with the seductive Susie. I'm joking! Clarence falls in love with her. At least he thought he was doing Is he right? Or is he a mentally retarded person? Or is he misunderstood by society? Find all this and much more when you look at the Anchors AWEIGH! <br /> <br /> P.S. If you want to see Kathryn Grayson as anything But cute, try Kiss Me Kate (1953)
