Things to Come is a historical film like Metropolis (1927). It is one of the first great science fiction glasses. It is also one of the first doomsday movies. It is amazing that filmmakers predict the beginning of World War II within one year and even in the year that will end in the real world. But then the film separated from reality, showing the world the damage from the war. (Instead of toxic gases for nuclear weapons, which certainly didn't exist in 1936) <br /> <br /> The last half hour of this film is incredible. Visually use the advanced forms and drawings to become a master of science fiction genres. It is a sad story that after things came, Sci-fi would become a cheap b movie that acted as a plan, not broken until 2001: Odyssey Space over 30 years later if they were stuck The quality of the effects in this movie, things in Hollywood are very different. <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey and his co-actors have many roles in the movie. This is for good results. Massey plays the "great doctor" - Like being a pilot from an advanced civilization (for the 1970s) trying to overcome the people of a destroyed country ruled by a simple minded warlord Finally, the story covers 100 years, but that's a big problem for this film - there are unrelenting stories. <br /> <br /> Maybe in this movie is a scene - quite a reminder of the loss. But actually it's hard to have a normal plot But I felt that it would be made from more material As it is starting to be interesting, perhaps the manufacturer may be thinking about future sci-fi innovations: sequels or not. <br /> <br /> The thing that must follow is that every movie should be interesting. At least once However, it may be different from watching the city repeatedly.
