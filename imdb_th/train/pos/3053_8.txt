William H. Macy is the most sympathetic and interested in him as a father and father who loves to step out of the family business without being angry with his parents. Trampling the same territory as the TV "The Sopranos" during the mid-life crisis of crime. (Here he visited the contraction) but still worth it to watch with the tense direction from Brommel. This guy is the next director). It is a great script and a great acting cycle. As usual This may be his best role since "Fargo" Donald Sutherland is the most creepy person as a father above. Tracy Ullman turns astoundingly astounding as Macy's wife. Young David Dorfman is great as Macy's bright and delicate son (many of his lines sound like the wrong and wonderful ad Even Neve Campell (which I often find disgusting) is appealing, while Macy's watched girl is all separated by a sharp movement and pace that leads to a point. Top picks are predictable. But still powerful and the result has meaning and touch This film deserves to be released more broadly because I suspect it will be relevant to the audience.
