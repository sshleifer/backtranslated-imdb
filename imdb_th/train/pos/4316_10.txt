I must say that Grand Canyon is one of the most impacted movies I've ever seen. I've watched it many times and I still feel like the first time. In which the film itself can do all the courses of the graduate program in film direction. <br /> <br /> A long time ago, the movie trailer had promised that "It will make you laugh. It will make you cry." That's a repetitive and shorthand way to explain what Grand Canyon does. It will take you to the best place in the human experience, and the next moment will lead you to the gates of hell. <br /> <br /> Most movies walk between people near to Happy and people close to horror It's a short step as well. Just manage that swing with elegance without making it look wrong or exaggerating genius. Direct the direction. <br /> <br /> Spoiler (strange) is coming. After making the audience familiar with rocking through the emotional spectrum, this film projected the curves that were badly bad and returned. But instead of rising from the quarrel by using a wound knife The wound that may or does not need to be stitched from the earthquake that has the character running from the house In the time of their relief, the argument forgot the forgotten fingerprints, the earthquake survived. A young woman called for her elderly husband to fall down. The couple rushed to help him. I cried when I saw this sequence. I cry every time I see I am crying It is not a sadness to do this for me. Not a particularly tragic sequence What makes me sad is that this movie is a few minutes perfect. That is perfect! Surprisingly (ending the spoiler) <br /> <br /> There's a lot to say about Grand Canyon. It shows that ordinary people who experience epiphanies and make the audience experience them instead. They are not flashy or too revealing and there is no pause to check the time carefully. This film continues with the rhythm of life. Although the characters try to understand what is happening, they are not sure what to get from their experience. <br /> <br /> Grand Canyon is a very human movie.
