Kafkaesque thriller of distribution and paranoia Very well done and Polanski worked as well as an introvert who tried hard to adjust to a dirty Paris vacation home and his roommates were terrifying at first because they saw that they were average and were obsessed with friends The tenant and scary later, as he develops his defense, which will eventually be canceled Personally, I can do without cross dressing elements. But I accept the nod to Psycho and the fact that it has some logic, taking into account the story. However, it can work without having to use it and will remove the minor drama elements. But that may be because the courtyard looks at the theater at the end. I can not feel that there are more than a few feelings of true French and Jewish directors. There are lots of fun, including good performance from the beautiful looks of Isabelle Adjani and Shelly Winters. The good old is as reliable as ever.
