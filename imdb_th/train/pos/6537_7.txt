The kids that I shoot this movie like very much. (Four children aged 9 to 12 years, they will give 10 stars) Emma Roberts is cute in the title role. (Expected to see the story of Robert's future in the future) After experiencing people like Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton, it was refreshing to see women who do not like her. Happy to see supporting actors including Tate Donovan, Rachel Leigh Cook, Barry Bostwick and Monica Parker (along with Bruce Willis). The last takeaway: Cute movie. <br /> <br /> (Note: I didn't read The book series, therefore, my opinion therefore depends. G Advantages of this film alone).
