I watched last night with low expectations. The reason is I usually don't like movies. "Made for TV" and I do not like "cast reunion", but critics in the Los Angeles Times seem to be like this, so I gave the opportunity I'm glad I did It's quite good. Adam West and Burt Ward reunited. But on the other hand they show themselves as "Batman and Robin" They have a camp and don't care about themselves or this movie seriously. The movie begins with searching for "George Barris", who designed the Batmobile, which had been stolen before being auctioned to go to the orphanage. While they are searching for cars, they still think of the series they do together. This is what is said in flashback. It did very well The actors that they received for the young Bert Ward and Adam West were dead. And for television movies, it goes down to the true content about their true behavior both on and off the screen. I gave this a 9/10. I like it a lot.
