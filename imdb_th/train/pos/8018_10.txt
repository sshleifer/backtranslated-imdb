In this Muppet movie, Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf, Scooter, Camillia, Dr. Teeth, Floyd, Animal, Janice and Zoot are college graduates. Unfortunately, no manufacturer will meet the Muppets after many manufacturers reject the scooter, showing that the Muppets decided to move forward. However, Kermit still believes that he can perform on Broadway but later. Eventually he let everyone know that he sold that item. Kermit will receive memories and others don't know where he is. <br /> <br /> This property has many wonderful scenes including A live action scene that presents Muppet Babies. The wedding scene is filled with Muppets including Sesame Street cast and Traveling Matt (from Fraggle Rock), scooters to bring movies and scenes that Rizzo and other mice do. Breakfast <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that there are more characters. Of course, many of them appear at the wedding. But should play an important role for Bunsen, Beaker, Beauregard and Sweetums and lips should be part of The Mayhem in this movie, as in the previous season The Muppet Show and The Great Muppet Caper and Miss Piggys dog Foo Foo should be With you as well (After all, Rizzo The Rat, played by Steve Whitmire, also plays an important role in this film and he is not very well known at that time)
