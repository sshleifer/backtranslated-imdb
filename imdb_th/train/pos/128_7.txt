Von Trier has explained how he created strong participation from audiences with his films by placing his film world in the middle of the real world and the world of fantasy. So while the audience, we think we look at the "real" story, in fact, we have been carefully managed to the point where the movie is working (Dancer in the Dark) or pain (The Idiots / Idioterne). Dogme serves only as a vehicle for this theory. (In addition to creating a spotlight to welcome on Von Trier) <br /> <br /> The story is typical of Von Trier: Our hero is an ideal. Relations with others, but soon became victims of problems that others created in the past for themselves. Idealists would have to reject society in order to be ideal and become terrorists. Humanity is destroyed and purity only leads to self-destruction. (These elements are still everywhere in Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark). The film is full of mockery. (Even humor) about the role of the Germans and Americans in the war after Germany. <br /> <br /> As a technical achievement, the movie is wonderfully designed: scrolling and fading, stacking. Screen overlay actions on different overlays (By shooting the mayor who is becoming the most interesting) in this film, we can see how well Von Trier handles the movie as a technical medium. In his later work he seems to have stepped down from this. (As if he was no longer interested in technical success because they became easy to use)
