I want to watch this movie a long time and be a fan of both Peter Cushing and David McCallum. I admit that the plot is a romantic time. But McCallum's talent shone through the role of Juvie. Thank you for the turner classic that aired last week. I can imagine that there are many problems about children after the war, especially with things that happened in the 1950s. Some boys are a little scary. Of course, I do not want to meet them on a street with much less light than dark. There are great insights about firebug's feelings as well, or they call him Firefly.
