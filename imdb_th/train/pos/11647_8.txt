I give four reasons to watch this movie: <br /> <br /> 1 Four of the best filmmakers in contemporary Mexican movies. <br /> <br /> 2 Four good stories related to The big project <br /> <br /> 3 surprisingly good performers <br /> <br /> 4 bitter reflections about the biggest problem in this country (and many more) <br /> <br /> (Spoiler possible) <br /> <br /> Alejandro Gamboa opens this movie with a story. The good mood to joke about. The authority practiced coercion with normal people and still expected to be appreciated by their efforts. <br /> <br /> Then Antonio Serrano would receive amazing results in the scene. The second along with the heirs of the modern Italian people "Peter and the Wolf" is like a little story Wrong at the wrong time But after the Tlahuac debate and the gruesome tradition at the State of Mexico, this story can no longer be updated. <br /> <br /> And ultimately Fernando Sariñana returns to the dark humor in "Grand Finale", in which he has collected most of the characters from the previous sequences in one of the best comedy movies. Printing the central scene from his previous movie "Todo el poder" Sariñana gave the last lesson of the theme. And by the way that the scene that steals movies with Anna Ciochetti makes a short striptease. <br /> <br /> When the movie ends, you'll get bitter feelings about watching a good movie (and maybe enjoy it). With a very painful story They said that in Mexico, people laugh at their shame and this is the best example. This film is a testimony of how Mexicans learn to live in the midst of crime. (And may accept it) between the two fires: criminals and officials called full of corruption Even this movie is a desirable idea because almost every good person is a victim of crime and they don't get hurt. If you have an attack without scratches then you are lucky. At the same time, don't waste the opportunity to watch this movie. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> And it's a beautiful life in Mexico ...
