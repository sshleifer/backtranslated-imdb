It's hard for me to believe that all negative comments about all this star flick. I laughed the whole picture like my family. This movie clearly defines itself as an old joke - a hysterical player - I bet that they have a good time while doing it. Of course, Gold Blum and Dreyfuss are great - and how each of those Everly sisters of Falco and the sacred music. Rob Reiner is an amazing limo driver. Laughs and Gabriel Byrne is a laughing laugh Not to mention Gregory Hines, Burt Reynolds, the character Sleepy Joe and the whole body of the body and the grave digger Paul Anka is his usual entertainment, along with the growing interest of work after Byrne decided to create a pair of his "My Way". Welcome back home to the performance of Vick as a funny tribute to Frank Sinatra and his friend Dreyfuss. I thought that no one would think of the action that occurred in this movie - it's a joke - not a horrible "thug" movie. Cars and clothes are as impressive as decorating "Vic's Place" <br / > <br /> Truly, I think "Mad Dog Time" is a far less dangerous musical comedy than many cartoons about crime drama on TV and talk shows. I will recommend videos for evening entertainment in my family. cattle
