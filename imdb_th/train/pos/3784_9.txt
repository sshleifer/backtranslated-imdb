One of the lowest value movies I have seen for a long time. Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey is the second adventure of Bill S. Preston Esq and Ted Theodore Logan, also known as Wyld Stallyns. There are two ways to watch movies. This story: First, you will see stupid conversations or .. You see stupid people who still see themselves again in situations that are too big for their brains. Throw Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzeneggar. Into this plot and it will become a huge blockbuster movie. Bill and Ted enter the story with the same level of sincerity. Only Bill and Ted is a complicated fence to achieve balance. But when you watch movies, it's not a joke caused by throwing. But is an adventure that has two people who do not have a business in the adventure
