Watch this movie for the first time when drunk at a motel in Canada. While flipping through the channel to come across the easy hub My friends turned around, but I told him to go back. Something about the lubricant name is simple. It doesn't sound right. Watch the rest of the movie. It's funny. Write down a few names from the credit and return home to search. Became the first film of Chevy Chase. I can't remember him. Remember rarely about this, so I rented it and gave it two veiw. It's quite funny and has graphics. It's like Kentucky Fried Movie except that it's not funny Love finger lubrication is easy and I am part of the president. The panic dealer is quite cool as well. I give 6.5 or 7 out of ten.
