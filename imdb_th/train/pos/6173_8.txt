Great movies, performances - from doctors to pavement artists to prostitutes with very few exceptions. I think soni razdan (mrs.noble) and vrajesh hirjee (saurabh) are the least known actors. Even Guruch De Bu (Tehun), who may have been accused of being too many servants, has a reliable and familiar character. <br /> <br /> Another great thing is the camera. Work - and the way it uses the energy of Bombay Road The peace of Gustad speaks his prayers and his life in a small apartment. <br /> <br /> I like the story of the wall that became a shrine and then collapsed - and The artist's philosophy spends time with it. <br /> <br /> It's great to see good movies in Indian themes.
