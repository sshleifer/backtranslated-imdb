La Maman and la Putain have to watch as movies related to the time they were published (post-68) and eternity in many ways. Actually, the actors couldn't "act" ... actually they talked a lot. ... but what they say is just what makes life worthwhile ... or is dying The very long monologue spoken by Françoise Lebrun may be the most accurate and impressive message ever written about femininity, masculinity and love. Even if the translation is not correct easily This film is a statement about the difficulties of being a man and a woman. (Or two women in this case) and IMHO, Jean Pierre Léaud is one of the greatest French actors
