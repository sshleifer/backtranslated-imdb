I like this movie a lot ... When I started watching it, I thought I would be bored soon, but it surprised me ... I thought it was a great movie. The character is reliable and I must say that I fell in love with Brian Austin Green again (first time at Beverly Hills 90210). I would like to recommend this film if you are his girlfriend. But I agree with other comments that were made earlier that the ending was disappointing. I will love it so much so slightly different! It doesn't matter, even if it's a good story.
