The dying kung fu teacher sent out his last student to follow up with what had happened to the five previous students who were members of the flat Poison tribe. Will he have to see if they perform well? The teacher wanted the students to find the members of the group that ran out with the money that the boss wanted to use for the benefit. All previous students were taught in various snakes, centipedes, scorpions, lizards, toads while the last student was taught a little in each style. All students end up in the same city looking for an old man with all the money, and soon everyone must fight for money. <br /> <br /> Classic martial arts movies have names that even fans know. I used to talk to a couple of casual fans and this is the only movie that is stuck in their heads. It's a very good movie, even though I'm not sure why this movie is with people when my money has other better films from Studio Shaw. (For example, one armed Swordmen or Brave Archer) This is not a short film sale. But not because the movie is structured like a puzzle, our hero has no clue as to who it is and the Venoms themselves know who they are. We received the identity of the four But we still have to find out who is really ranked fifth. This film is strange in the martial arts movie, apart from the training scene at the beginning and killing the old man and his family for money. He doesn't have any actions for about 40 or 45 minutes. It is bold to do. But it can do well since the plot and the show make you interested (This movie is a strange story in the first film of martial arts. I think I have seen where there are no women. I don't think there is a role in speaking and I'm pretty sure no one appears in the background It indicates anything. It's just something that makes me lost.) This is a good little movie that can't live with the fame that exists in the circle. But it's still a really good movie to curl up on your couch. Br /> <br /> About 7 out of 10
