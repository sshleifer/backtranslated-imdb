After waiting a long time after seeing a small clip about 100 Scariest Movie Moments of Bravo, I have been waiting for a long time to watch this movie. The plot is simple. Alison Parker (Christina Rain) A beautiful model moved into an apartment building which is the gateway to hell. Sentinel is a creepy movie, though it is a bit slow. It is a combination of The Omen and Rosemary's Baby. The performance is good and there are some really annoying parts, such as the orgy scene with the dead father and the fat woman in the middle of the cake. But in the end I believe in a really great movie! One of my favorites from the 70s, although nothing is very original. It's very strange and eerie! May be one of my favorites all the time. 9/10
