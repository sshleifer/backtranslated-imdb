See this thing on SBS TV here in Australia the week before the name "Laputa: Castle in the sky". I enabled the subtitles and I think SBS is self-service, which is normally very good quality. <br /> <br /> Just searched for "Laputa" on Wikipedia and confirmed what I suspect ... The floating island of this tale is taken from the classic Jonathan Swift novel "Gulliver's travels" which was published in the early to mid 1700s. <br /> <br /> However, this is a Japanese fairy tale that is involved. Speak voice I think it's suitable for young children. But it can be used for more than two hours, so it may be too long for some people But not for adults like me. <br /> <br /> The story involves two children searching for a legendary floating island with a castle on it. Children are not the only ones looking for this island. They have pirates, armies and spies looking for the island and looking for capture of children (Sheeta, girl, voiced by Anna Paquin and Pazu, boy, voiced by James Van Der Beek) to help them find. > <br /> The graphics are beautiful ... sometimes sort of realistic images, especially the scenes of rocks that have been lit, torches or beautiful scenes on sunny days with white clouds or fog. <br /> <br /> Recommended
