The first "story" in the universe of the Gundam century, offering a fresh new look in the war between Earth and space colonies. The focus is not on a small group of people who will play an important role in the conflict anymore. But with the civilian population in everyday life and seeing the war through their eyes, <br /> <br /> There are some parts of Gundam. It is the effort of the ZEON team to capture the Gundam experiment. But it is the action of the plot that makes this show very interesting This set focuses on the experience of a young boy named Alfred, and the relationship between his neighbor, Christina Mckenzie, who is a secret ally pilot and a rookie pilot, Zeon named Bernie Wiseman. Alfred developed "Love Me. The brothers "gave Bernie while our young Zeon pilots fell in love with Christina. <br /> <br />" The war in the pocket "proves that you don't have to have a story about someone. EL For a good war, there are no uber ace pilots or big naval battles to be seen here. OVA 6, this short episode focuses on drama, emotions, characters rather than other subjects such as politics or philosophy and I like the image. Realistic drama Alfred is your typical child every day who plays violent computer games and thinks the armed forces are cool. From then on he will receive a terrifying crash path. Unlikely friendship and bonding between Bernie and Christina, each of whom does not know that they are soldiers in various areas of the war, are truly playing without having to end up with a romantic story. Aside for the loving relationship between Alfred and Bernie That being said, I don't want to waste a lot of stuff here. But it gives a bigger heart to see the tragedy that unfolds when the show runs all the way to the end of the intense emotion. <br /> <br /> Even without action But this program never falls into the category of "bored". The character has enough participation to show all. Don't worry because there are a number of mobile action suit scenes scattered here and there. Each animation can be beautiful at a higher level than the OVA and is sure to satisfy the desire of a "forced" fight in the Gundam series. <br /> <br /> Normally watching anime is language. Japanese or English Will be released according to personal preferences But in this case, I would recommend the English audio track for Japanese, not just the characters that everyone except Alfred will be white people, who believe in English more. But the performances of English voice actors are at an equal level and superior to one Japanese, cultivating each character with a realistic mood. Acting in a live TV drama <br /> <br /> In short, this program doesn't try to impress the audience. What is it that indicates the many friendly forms that come near the house, especially the death of innocence on the battlefield and the horrors of war through the eyes of children? A truly small story that deserves more credit than received.
