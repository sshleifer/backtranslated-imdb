Worthy of being nominated for a Hollywood award, this is a small gem that provides entertainment along with music, pizzas and delightful surprises. Outstanding funny scenes including hilarious photography (And taking repeated pictures) of the WW1 engraved scene with Australian comedian Clyde Cook as a non-computer optimist All under the eyes of Raul Sanford that was painfully delightful; McDoakes, who lost his way, was guided and directed again by Jack Carson, who puzzled the assistant director Chandler to rejoice in the opportunity sent by McDoakes: "I'll be the director!" Cartoon cartoon O'Hanlon has two roles. Play both McDoakes and himself. Play McDoakes! Oddly, Richard L. Bare, who played himself on one of the shows in the series, opened that opportunity here. In real life, Bair is a small person who is similar to Rock Hudson's six feet. But here he was imitated by professional actors (more than 500 stories!) Jack Mower
