First thing first! This is not an action movie, although it has a lot of action! I think you can compare it to American sports movies! In the event that a team of poor players succeeds in not being able to win a game or competition beyond expectations In this case, it's not about football or baseball, but Taekwondo! In the beginning, these street thugs seem to be good for anything! But soon we will find that they do not want to be a gangster and achieve real things in life! It's good to see them fight and practice! I'm surprised how funny this movie is! From beginning to end, you will laugh your pants off! Korean actors are very reliable! Go to see this great movie. Feel good!
