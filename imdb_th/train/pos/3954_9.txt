Whenever people ask me to name the most horrible movies I have ever seen, I will respond permanently "Black Noon" and to this day no one has heard of it. <br /> <br /> Watching it alone, younger than 13, when my parents went out for the evening As far as I know, there is only one show in the UK and sadly there is no DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> If anyone can follow a copy, please let us know. <br /> <br /> If I watch it again now, it may be a big disappointment. But it stuck in my memory as an extraordinarily annoying little movie!
