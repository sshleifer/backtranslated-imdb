I have never seen Barbara Steel's movies that I dislike and tend to be sucked into the story of a good haunted house. (Especially for great images such as "The Legend of Hell House" and "The Haunting Traditional Version" "and" House on Haunted Hill ") so I have the feeling that" Castle of Blood "should be at My alley And boys, it used to be! The imitation of France-Italy at the moment may not be Steele's first horror movie. "Black Sunday" that remains to this day Filmed in black and white, it manages to convey a truly creepy miasma. The film involves one journalist who bet on Lord Blackwood and the author Edgar Allen Poe, that he can spend the night in Blackwood's castle on the night of All Saints when the spirit Of those killed in the castle The audience will see these deaths and they are very scary. This film makes the spine of the audience shake up and on the uncut DVD that I just watched - thanks to the good people at Synapse - despite the surprisingly bare-chested scenes. And Barbara is great in this movie The beauty that is across her is considered very well. Her appearance just changed the creepy ghost story into something truly memorable. She was not called "The Queen of Horror"
