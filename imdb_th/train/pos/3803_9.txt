What people don't understand about this movie is that it's not the beginning, the middle, and the ending. It's just a summary of the 26-episode TV series. So remember, when you all talk about the way the world can't. Enough exploration That's all done on the wonderful and amazing <br /> <br /> TV show as seen in the picture. I think the argument *** *** Spoiler between Lian-Chu and Gwizdo near the point. End of the movie What really makes me love this movie Seeing the characters that I followed 26 at that time was a painful battle and saw Gwizdo walking sadly amid the ruins that were floating, while Lian-Chu secretly cut his blade almost torn. br /> Then we are completely different from Lian-Chu fighting with these super cool dragons (which had been previously in the series) while Gwizdo is ranting madly and indirectly. Threatening to kill Zoe * * I was surprised that this scene was not mentioned in additional warnings. Any child who has the feeling of seeing that Gwizdo is not himself and is fully determined to strangle that little girl is enough to annoy me and I am at 15. <br /> <br /> The world That is amazing. The plot is better than millions of blockbuster, mostly and it's a good way to see some of me. Favorite characters. Try it. :)
