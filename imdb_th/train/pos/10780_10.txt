Now Spielberg is my second favorite cartoon. Although the ratings are so low, what I still enjoy it and love it is very funny and I love actors, Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille are in it and are just wonderful, all handsome, especially in the legend. Frank Gerber <br /> <br /> I want to see this cartoon again. It's great and the jokes are great. In addition, I can remember the hilarious moments that Brain Pendant has in it. You hear his voice and it plays as a tool of a wonderful PATB theme. I love it in those cartoons when the pendant appears in I hope the cartoons and Animaniacs Come back i love them
