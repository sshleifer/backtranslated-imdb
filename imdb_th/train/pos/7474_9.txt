This is one of the hard-to-check movies without plotting. Enough to say that there are strange things and unforeseen things happening in addition to the first plot "Tom Cruise screw with many women" Plot <br /> <br /> Quality actors raise the film above the norm. Suitable for their part, sailing as an annoying cunning prince who has everything and loses it to Diaz as an attractive lover But slightly mocked Cruz as a new kid in the new scene and Russell was the father's psychologist The story relates to elements of love, morality, mystery, murder, suspicion and sci-fi. And in general, it's a fun trip. <br /> <br /> I should add that photography is great Regularly and interpreting various metaphors Beautiful when you know what happened. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy a movie that has a good movement with twists and turns and is ready to accept a little bit of Philip K. Dick's style, this must be See. <br /> <br /> 9/10
