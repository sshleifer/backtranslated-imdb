This is just about in the same league as 'Black Cat'. Even though I gave this 9 more than 9+, that is a commendable thing for an extremely low rated movie. <br /> <br /> `The Invisible Ray 'is a horror movie, drama and sci-fi novel. For movies created in 1936, the sci-fi element is an agreement in advance. The mixture of horror, drama and sci-fi is the perfect combination, while acting in the section of Lugosi and Carlos is not better than director Lambert Hoyer, director Lambert Hillyer. Gathered many elements that James Whale frequently do. What I say is this film is creepy and well shot. The scene with the gargoyles outside of Lugosi's room is a perfect example of emotions. It was a wonderful time in the movie, which was sadly lost in today's movie genre. <br /> <br /> Like 'The Black Cat' and 'Island of Lost Souls', I don't understand why. Like this This film has not been released on DVD. When you consider some garbage that has been transferred to the DVD, it will be more confusing. <br /> <br /> However, watch this movie if you have a chance. When released on DVD, grab it quickly and place it in a prestigious spot within your DVD library.
