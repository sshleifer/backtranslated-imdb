Critics are stupid. This movie is funny and clever. I love this movie a lot. Why do everyone hate this movie? I hope people will love this movie more than they can't. Ben Stiller and Jack Black are true comedians, and they are dedicated to making this movie. I don't see you people doing movies like them. So people should see and not comment. I like this movie. It's ok. There are some parts that it is dumb. But at least they do it Jerry Stiller will love this thing because this movie has the same performance as the King Of Queens, but it's better. I can't believe that this has been a very low score.
