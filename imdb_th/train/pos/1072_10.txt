I want to comment dress is a great effort. The story that needs to be improved slightly is quite good, especially in Season 1, Season 2 shows the mania and lost the original charm of DA. The story in Season One is more interesting as An interesting aspect for the life that Jampo, while a serious plot focuses on Manticore, pursued the X-series. I waited for the new season. I hope the FOX and DA production team will know that many are still waiting for DA to come back to work again, even after 2 years of being canceled. DA can make it bigger if working properly and I Think that the name James Cameron should use this challenge
