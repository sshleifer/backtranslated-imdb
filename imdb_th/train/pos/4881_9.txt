"Kaabee" shows the difficulties of a woman before and during World War II raising her children alone after her husband was imprisoned because The movie was directed by Yamada Youji and as expected, the atmosphere of this movie was really great. Although the historical accuracy of some scenes But to be noted is that the beach scene is a suspicious thing. <br /> <br /> The acting in this movie is definitely unbelievable. I was baffled by the way they managed to collect all the actors for the 2008 movie Yoshinaga Sayuri, who may be the best female actress in Japan to win her acting award in this film. Shoufukutei Tsurube has to wonder in the supporting role as well. It is Asano Tadanobu that gives the most impressive performance, showing the flair of his character and the difficult situation <br /> <br /> Movies that have scenes before the war are not my stories. Excellent governance and acting. I was totally absorbed with the story. Moreover, it is not the remaining nonsense, such as "Yuunagi no Machi, Sakura no Kuni" and examining the controversial and delicate issues of government oppression. Great movies are highly recommended for all audiences.
