This movie is genuine and really random. It's very difficult to find a movie like this in many movies in Hollywood. I enjoy watching this movie a lot. I bought a DVD this Tuesday and I watched it 4 times. I love Paz's Spanglish accent. It's really cute. And her performance with Morgan is funny and natural. <br /> <br /> My movie tastes may be very different from others. But I have to say that I really love this movie. The simplicity is the best. <br /> <br /> I've learned something about life from this movie. (At least or at least in the life of USA) ... Life is really random ... Sometimes you meet someone, they pass through your life and become your friend by chance. And you don't spend much time with them, maybe you will enjoy them and they won't see each other again But when you are together, it is difficult to forget. Just keep those moments in your heart as a thank you and good ... <br /> <br /> This movie may be cheap to make. But its meaning is not right at all I can't really learn anything from movies. But this is an exception
