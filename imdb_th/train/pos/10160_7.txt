I entered this movie by thinking that it would be a movie with a rate. B I came out surprised and very fun. Eva was good, but Lake Bell stole the show. She had an amazing funny moment. The jokes in this movie are original, surprising and really funny with one or two flat jokes between them. The plot is enough to tie it together. A woman (Eva) dies on her wedding day and comes back to haunt the woman who is going out with her husband-to-be husband. But actually it works well. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Overall, it's a worthwhile cinema watch, if not on a DVD when coming out.
