At first I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch this movie when it came into my manual, so I searched it on IMDb and thought that the cover looks so cool, so I thought I would try the movie Chang. /> <br /> When I got through the fact that I didn't like the Alicia character played by Busy Phillips in a great way, I knew that this movie did very well to create a relationship between Alicia and Deanna Alicia has a meaning for Deanna, played by Erika Christensen almost throughout the movie. But in the end we found that even though they were opposite, they had one thing in common, apart from being in the filming. They share the loneliness and the extent that is revealed when the movie proceeds. <br /> <br /> I have to say how much I love this movie and I'm glad to see all the positive comments about it. I could not pass the elephant because it seemed to be taking advantage of the Columbine tragedy. This film is interesting and realistic. Phillips' performance is busy at the chain !!! That is a good thing and I like to see her progress in a more mature role.
