I found that there was only one comment about this movie that was not entirely too intense and so I decided to write it myself. I saw this movie for the first time when it came out and caught it a few times since then. First of all, let me say that overall, what this movie received is worthwhile. Does not matter whether there are budget constraints and other shortcomings, it's worth watching The concept of creating a movie about Walt Whitman's visit to a strict and narrow Anglo-Canadian community in southern Ontario. The movie is about the human reaction to Whitman that was inspired by people. And in that sense it is absolutely accurate Performances, especially by Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as a doctor, are very good. Scripting and conversation are strong and pay attention to traditions and time variations. Overall, I don't like anything. In addition, the title of another film that Whitman brings to life in life?
