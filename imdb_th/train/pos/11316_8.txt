(Some spoilers) I haven't read James M. Cain novels (`The Postman Always Rings Twice '), which this movie is based on, so I can't compare this film version to this story. But I've seen and liked the American version of 1946 (also called <br /> <br /> Even better, this is a jewel from Italy which I have read that is "deformed" in corrections because there are too many references to the fascist regime. Remaining is a movie that seems to be a pioneer of neoreal movement in film making. One can see why Even if there is a severe correction But the feelings that spread throughout society and culture, including personal oppression, still hung over the protagonists who faced many limitations in their lives. <br /> <br /> Consider Gino. The homeless children are not educated. Well unemployed and turned to steal and meet people to go inside his only pair of shoes, causing it to be flaky. <br /> <br /> In Giovanna, he saw the exit but he should still continue. While Giovanna was enslaved by her unloved marriage and an old man with money for her work (working at the Trattoria for her husband, emptied behind the bar and in the kitchen) and her sex in the past, she had herself. Choose the limit and decide to marry the restaurant owner / gas station (Giuseppe Bregana, played by Juan de Landa). However, knowing that he will not make her happy. She told Gino that she felt sick every time Bregana touched her. <br /> <br /> He claimed to help Bregana repair his car and send him into the village to buy the necessary parts. Gino won the favor of Bregana (promised to repair the damaged water pump or a symbol of life or lack thereof) and was left alone with Giovanna. They started a hot love story that Bursting with love <br /> <br /> Soon, Gino is uncomfortable with the relationship and wants to move again when Giovanna offers to leave her husband. Gino left town with a train, which he could not buy. Please pay him by another gypsy man named Spagnolo, a fellow train passenger for Gino. Spagnolo represented freedom and they became friends (Spagnolo also Is a symbol of Gino's virtue and conscience), traveling and finding work together. Finally, Gino has a stable job. (He still didn't love Giovanna) One month passed when Bregana and his wife went to a carnival and Bregana persuaded Gino to go home to go back to live and work with them again because he had a lot of benefits. /> <br /> Too weak to resist because knowing that this will unite him, and Giovanna Gino agrees and returns with his lover. Soon after, he gave up on Gina's demands to get rid of her husband. When the evil action is complete, Giovanna becomes more cold-blooded than he once seems to have very little conscience, while the guilt and shame goes to Gino, attacking someone who has never harmed him. As much as he wants to leave her? He did it again briefly. Now they are inseparably connected and face the consequences. <br /> <br /> I like the way Spagnolo's characters come back to Gino's life to act. Judge his fault? That is a very good and interesting thing, adding a new dimension to the story. <br /> <br /> While the '46 US version with Lana Turner and John Garfield got a little lost in the outside characters, especially the police and lawyers. Ossessione did well to concentrate more on the psychological impact of crimes on lovers only. This gives the end result that is more powerful and makes the powerful message reinforcing self-help in the society in which the characters have to live. <br /> <br /> A little laugh: the time (hardly) that Passed before the love that Amata announced to the lovers that they had killed the husband as soon as possible Gino's fast and quick relationship with dancers / prostitutes? They accept their love quickly as well, and she is willing to risk so much for the person she just met! ?? All quite unrealistic, right? I find this time frame problem quite distracting? It made me think that I had to miss something. Otherwise it will be worth the time of the viewer The performances and directions are both good and consistent. Recommended
