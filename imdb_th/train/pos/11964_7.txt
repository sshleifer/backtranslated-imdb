I went to the theater this afternoon, expecting to receive help from Scoop. Happily, this movie exceeds expectations at least. There is nothing heavy, nothing deep - and not everything that is as good as all of Allen's masterpieces - but it's fun, like a comedy. There is something simple and cute about it. "Cute" is a word that I hear from people in the audience while they are walking away after the performance. It didn't feel like Allen started to create a masterpiece here. But felt like he wanted to be a little funny and enjoy doing it Compared to everything Hollywood is producing, Allen's tends to be charming. Even fluffy things Today, it's just refreshing to see a real man-made movie.
