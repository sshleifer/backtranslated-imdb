If the filmmaker tries to introduce reality to the plot, it would be a waste of time, money and creative effort. Fortunately, throwing all the excuse about reality into the wind, they created a funny miracle. Who can pass the movie that foreign pilots use, both movies that act like Jack Nicholson with a Lakers T-shirt. Don't leave this movie as a trash.
