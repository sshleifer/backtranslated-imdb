Only 9/10 from me will only have ten perfect people if there is more story in the movie. But Moonwalker continues to this day as a music, dance and entertainment festival. Beginning with editing video clips from Jackson's long career, it reminds the audience why he is often seen as 'King of Pop' from his hit 'I want you back' to 'We are the World', a charity record that has received many awards for the benefit of Africa. After this, there are many short films, although the winning script for Oscar is lacking. Still, there are great plays and fun for the audience. Ending with the perfect translation (Sexy!) Of 'Come Together', what everyone in the family can watch and enjoy.
