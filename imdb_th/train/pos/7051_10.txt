Let me start by saying that "War Inc." is not everyone's cup of tea. However, it's very fun. (And makes you think - "crap, shit"). The comedy associated with this movie is not clear - it's rather fragile (Tamerlane tanks, dry cleaning, etc.) and it changes with twisting & turning in the plot. <br /> <br /> I may be the only one. But I won't compare this to "Grosse Point Blank" because it's different. John Cusack - I won't say that he is "amazing" or "excellent" - but he is good. His (Joan Cusack) is unbelievable in sending her funny and time-chapters - even though she is barely in the movie. (I will say the same thing as Ben Kingsley) <br /> <br /> Marisa Tomi plays as a reliable journalist and tries to pull it out. Hilary Duff is very commendable for her role as a central Asian pop actress, Jonica Bayah. Duff's development as an actor is very noticeable in this film and she works very well. (Although her accent is not realistic) <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is what I call "fun." It doesn't have a specific story and it's quite silly at times. But it has a profound message I think it's worth watching.
