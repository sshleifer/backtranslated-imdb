This movie is still a favorite all the time. There is only an insolent and insolent moron that will not enjoy this great movie. This movie feels like a warm apple pie topped with French vanilla ice cream! I think this is the best work of Sher and her most reliable performances. Cher has always been blessed with special talents, good looks and slim shape. Whether you like her singing or not - there are others who like Cher? Cher has established her reputation in the entertainment industry and will be remembered by others. She is one of the unique artists. the best It's funny because anyone would think that Chats is an actor with natural talent. She is the head of a movie called "The Star". Today, Cher is a true actor with the same level as Debra Winger, Alfre Woodard, Holly Hunter, Angela Bassett and a few others that she never seems to "show" her. Became a really reliable character She is respected by the people around her and the public. <br /> <br /> <br /> Everything about Moonstruck is great - characters, scenery, dialogue and food. I never get tired of watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch the scene in which they sit around the dinner table at Rose's house, I stop for a long time to see whether Rose's delicious food is What service I see spaghetti mushrooms (I think) but I can't, whether they eat Ravioli or not. What is the main course? It looks fantastic and it scares me! <br /> <br /> Everyone in the family is hardworking and they respect and care for each other. Grandfather didn't push and be patient. He was an important part of the family and he listened and respected his age and wisdom. It seems that he is a beautiful person who is healthy and an old code writer. <br /> <br /> Loretta's mother is not just a housewife. But she is the glue that makes the family together and is the example of the wife Mother and house manager should be She is proud of her chosen lifestyle. But she does not allow it to determine who she is Highly energetic businessmen do not feel comfortable like Rose Casterini observing how stupid she says. "I have no children until I am 37 years old. It is not over yet." You have the feeling that she is a type of woman who does what she likes and gets her way without knowing what happened. She is charming, witty and very intelligent. What a wonderful mother! <br /> <br /> I don't like Loretta right away because she seems to know - all - those who are not adventurous and control themselves like you want others to think. You can tell others about yourself and The place they made a mistake But she didn't use common sense to her own life She is about to marry the son of a middle-aged mother, just because she wants her husband and touches herself and the purpose of her life. She is more ordinary than her mother. She dressed and wore her hair like a housekeeper in the house and imprisoned without humor and boring. But under you feel that you are weak and lonely and have many love to give the right person She may be a great mother as well. <br /> <br /> I will see in the future, a house full of loud voices, Loretta and Ronnie. Loud voices. Happy children and Rose and Kos. Mo enjoy every minute
