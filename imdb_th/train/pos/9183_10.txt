The production of the excellent BBC television program of 1983 (not the movie that others wrote here) of the classic love story "Jane Eyre" starring Timothy Dalton as Rochester and Zelah Clarke is Jane, because it is Charlotte Bronte's most honest novel, both concepts and dialogue. <br /> <br /> Classic became a classic for very specific reasons. When the filmmakers began to take part in classic creatures, then the classics would be destroyed. Fortunately, the film producer "Jane Eyre" approached the story with respect and faithfulness to the manuscript, which resulted in an exciting mix of drugs that should be worth watching many times to enjoy. Sweetness and happiness Happy performances, music is the right thing, even the gothic design of the house and the beautiful outdoor pictures and sound settings suitable for production. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is a little bit. That this model, like all other versions of Jane Eyre, does not care about the influence of Christians who create Jane's character and influence her moral choices. In the modern world today, women in Jane's situation don't think twice. But stayed with Rochester after discovering that he had a crazy wife and still married her "Oh, just a divorce". She will speak to her people or she will live in sin with him. But Jane Eyre knows that she can't pay for this course in life and why self-respecting? This decision was based on the foundation of Christian faith that she had been teaching since childhood, not from the cruel Calvinist Lowood Institute, but from the true Christian friend of Helen Burns who suffered more than not. Facing the other cheek Someday I would like to see some versions showing a little of these influences in adaptation. Classic novel that ends with writing the heroine "Even then came to Jesus!" There should be no foundation of faith that fell out.
