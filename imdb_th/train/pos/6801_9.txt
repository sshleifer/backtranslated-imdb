While in the Kent Farm barn with Shelby waiting for Chloe, Clark was attacked and woke up in a mental institution in the middle of a meeting with Dr. Psychologist Hudson told him that for five years he had mistakenly believed that he came from krypton and had power. Clark succeeded in escaping and met with Lana, Martha and Lex, who confirmed Dr.'s words. Hudson only has Chloe who believes in his words. But she is considered crazy as well Clark struggles to find the truth about his personality and origin. <br /> <br /> "Maze" is undoubtedly the most interesting scene of "Smallville". The author is very lucky and the manuscript denies the existence of a powerful boy from Krypton. The annoying hum humming gives a calm feeling and requires an elaborate mysterious explanation. My rating is nine. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Labirinto" ("Labyrinth")
