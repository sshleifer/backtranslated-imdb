I saw this movie for the first time when it fell on the US cable one year after the film was released. It caused me to lose my little head. I was only 16 and it was the first wave of music I heard, which is a classic child growing up strictly. This song makes me fascinated by the amazing looks of Hazel O'Connor and the performances of charming singers and the strong but gentle Cockney manager of Phil Daniels, just stealing the heart. But I think my favorite character is Jonathan Pryce, who plays a boring saxophone. He was out of place in the band and was not dangerous and poor. He just asked for compassion. Scenes that like acting when the lights go out and the love scene on the train <br /> <br /> Okay, so the movie is not a rose! But it was really great for the limited budget and the image of the United Kingdom in the early 80s, exploding with a stubborn boy looking for a way out of the queue I went to the UK a few years later and found that the film reflected the atmosphere I found when I was there. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, try it. It's a great movie, with great performances and music will blow you away. <br /> <br />
