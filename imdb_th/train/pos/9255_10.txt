If you want fun filled with delicate humor, you will enjoy this flick. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why nobody enjoys this. Apply for what it is: a vehicle for Dennis Pogo to mess with your head and make you laugh. It's not Shakespeare, but well done. Ericka Eleniak is beautiful and has her own in this story - better than any Baywatch episode - and shows a sense of humor. Unfortunately she didn't have many opportunities to expand that story. <br /> <br /> Tom Bergen is suitable for the role of Perfectly true "Navy" and William McNamara working as a businesswoman Interested and making me laugh I bought this as soon as it's ready. <br /> <br /> Brain-candy
