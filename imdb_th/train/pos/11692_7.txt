I didn't say that like Chris Rock fans, I say this as someone with low expectations in this movie. The first flaw is that it's all the work that everyone sees. The second flaw is that I find that chemistry between Regina King and Chris Rock looks like a fake. Eventually, acting in this film is not important. The best actors are Regina King and Mark Addy. The worst, but I see that there are flaws in the past and seen as a joke. In the head-up situation, watching heaven can wait instead. It will be better. So for everyone that Chris Rock, fans there, watching this movie, you will enjoy it. He is outstanding in this film. <br /> <br /> Overall: 7 out of 10
