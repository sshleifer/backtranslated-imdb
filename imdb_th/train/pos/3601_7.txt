Michelle Rodriguez is a determined actor who may be the driving force for other actresses to look out. She had the courage to put her role in the role of a young woman who was not seen at the beginning of her career. (And pulled out) which is the song that should be accepted Although her next film will help her in the same role But this movie was created for her strength. <br /> <br /> Her character is a student / fighter / romantic lover who struggles to overcome. Too little in the movie ... but not by women The aspect of this film is not original. But the story progresses deeply when the hot relationship that this woman has to deal with, her first rage and wrath enters. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen an actor with such aggressive attitude. In the making of the movie and I'm glad that she received the original manuscript there in Hollywood This movie has 7 stories from me because of the average story of a slum boy. But it has a great actress who plays a role that is rarely seen in the movie about the least budget Good work.
