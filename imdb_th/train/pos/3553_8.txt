Guys and Dolls is a movie that has itching to create a new one. It was built forty-eight years ago. Two of its main stars are dead or 409 pounds, although there is a remake with a big star right now. But was not successful But was unable to capture the magic that came in this version The boundless energy cannot be reused, and you will not be pleased when receiving this: large wide-screen movies and big entertainment. <br /> <br /> Last Marlon Brando I heard) Show Sky Masterson, one of the biggest gamblers in New York. Frank Sinatra is Nathan Detroit, which is the most common game that he can easily find famous throughout the city. However, when one place he left to charge $ 1,000, Detroit needed money quickly. He bet on Masterson $ 1,000 that he could not take Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) missionaries to Havana the next day. <br /> <br /> Guys and Dolls are nothing more than singing and Nasty type dance Like here, add fun Obviously it's a Broadway musical: There are many scenes and scenes that are long. If I would complain about one thing, it is an uneven song. Sometimes there are two songs in one scene. Again, thirty minutes passed without anyone. Guys and Dolls are not boring. Just a good time. <br /> <br /> My score: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Don't score.
