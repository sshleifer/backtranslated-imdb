My name is Domino Harvery {Edit * Dizziness * CHOP} My-my - My name is Domino Harvey {CUT, CHOP} My name is Domino Harvey {Edit, cut. Play} <br /> <br /> I have never seen anyone. First directed for his style By now it is clear that most people do not appreciate the lackluster techniques of Tony Scott's flashy and dizzy. If I had to choose between love and hate, I would say I loved it. It is a border that sometimes distracts. But the results are quite good and it is good to see the creative director according to his style and some creative ability This stylistic edge shows himself as Keira Knightley, playing the role of a bounty hunter, domino, Harvey, and even her conversations seem strange changes. Otherwise, she couldn't play well because I hated her character a lot and didn't sympathize with her. We followed Domino throughout her life as she joined fellow bounty hunters Micky Roque, Rizzan Abbasi and Edgar Ramirez. The crew was disorganized in the FBI and suddenly there was a reality show contract under the television producer of Christopher Walken (Christopher Walken was doing anything in every movie. I guess this is a clever movie technique because now Tony Scott is free to use the flashy video editing MTV / Reality Show as he likes. It became the pastor of the MTV culture. At this point, <br /> <br /> After that, the story was told in a surprisingly fast speed. It was funny, modern and surreal. All at the same time. It's a mess But a mess that is quite fun In the end it has many flaws (the actors try too hard to make their characters "cool" for one person) but it works. I give it a weak 7/10, which may look generous when compared. With the general consensus of movie viewers who rate this film ?? But I feel that it has a good idea and can perform well. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
