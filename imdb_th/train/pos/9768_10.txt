This is the best movie ever created. It is a masterpiece that makes my tears. I will never forget my experience of watching it. I do not understand why people do not think, as I do, dinosaurs turned to focus on De Niro's performances in Raging Bull, Pacino in Scarface and Crowe in Gladiator. Superbit, so I can fully enjoy it, as if it were created to be happy when they produced and filmed. Whoppi Goldberg literally changed the life of the show as a policeman with patience Against her will to cooperate with the dinosaurs hot as her partner, then hi-jinx say the least. By the way I say the complete opposite of what is true, this movie is the most rubbish.
