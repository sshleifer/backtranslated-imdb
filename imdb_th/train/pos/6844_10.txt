"Dressed to Kill" is Brian DePalma's best movie. The excitement is full of excitement, humor and unparalleled style. Today, DePalma has butt rap in Hollywood. Most people claim that he rips off Alfred Hitchcock. Can't, Hitchcock only dreamed of what DePalma showed in his thriller. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the original "Dressed to Kill" version was not cut in the video anymore. The current copy released by Goodtime is Jack Valentin, who has approved R for the score, but some copies of DePalma's original cut are still available. It is a game developed by Warner Home Video. Either in a green cardboard box with Angie Dickinson on the cover or in a black box with a poster with a silver lining This is what you get if you can find a copy. I am green and my treasure. <br /> <br /> However, go back to the story. Dickinson plays Kate Miller, a sexually abused wife who was treated by Dr. Robert Elliott (Michael Caine) for her obsessive imagination During the trip to the museum (True tourism for DePalma in terms of camera work and suspicion) <br /> <br /> Miller was picked up by strangers. You can guess what happened to her because of the ads and box art giving stories. But with a slight complication, Hooker (Nancy Allen) is only witnessing the murder case. Kate Miller's son Peter (Keith Gordon) is a teenage genius committed to solving crime. And the answering machine of Dr. Elliott has some messages about it ... about missing razors ... <br /> <br /> I didn't make a movie for you because what I described above happened. Within DePalma's half-hour opening and the biggest surprise was reserved for the last hour. However, this film is clear enough for Valenti (the leader of the MPAA) to claim the cut in this film. What surprised me was what he wanted. Wounded several times in the shower scene and one or two scenes, slashing and the conversation of Nancy Allen. (Valentines wants "chicken" to change to "bulge"). This is a very violent and bloody movie. I like to hear Valentin's explanation that seeing two women in a gentle love scene in "Lost and raved" is more damaging to the minds of children than Arnold Schwarzenegger. It's not fair. <br /> <br /> The thing that makes "Dressed to Kill" very good is not only But is the first technical credit only But the performance is also very good. Michael Caine, who is very shit during this time, gave one of his best performances as a doctor. Angie Dickinson is better than usual, probably because she has a strong role here. Nancy Allen added this to her performance that was emphasized as one of the most overlooked and overlooked actors in the world. Keith Gordon was fantastic, like a genius and I loved these inventions. <br /> <br /> DePalma is one of our best directors who has never received the recognition he deserves. The recent joke of the best Thrillers AFI 100 shows that there are only a few people who know what thriller is. If they really had to open their eyes once, they would see that DePalma had participated in his thriller and was actually the best craftsman. This is better than "Psycho". It's a shame that Actually, I know little. <br /> <br /> **** from 4 stars
