I've watched freebird movies and thought it was great! It was fun to be back again about the British film industry in the past with fun !! It is a good way that people who meet them at the service station are mentioned in the movie method in the news agency. The show is reliable. (I'm a biker) They remind me of the good times I have in the bike scene. It was good to see the director of the film doing very well. Jon! At the end, there was a mention of new plants in Ireland. Is this the basis for the second film? Hope to make them come Great movies, characters that are well written and realistic!
