The Invisible Ray is an excellent performance of both the performance of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Karloff draws on impeccable performance as a scientist who looks defamatory and contradictory, which seems to lead to scientific success He went ahead with his relationship with others, even his wife. His lonely personality became unbearable when he became paranoid. <br /> <br /> Lugosi played a complete professional role with enthusiasm about his work. A close friend. One of his few roles as a good person and he played very well. It was difficult, but when he heard his accent and believed he was French. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this film is that they are I came from "Junk science", but in any way, even junk science makes it work well. Because various ideas and theories are completely stupid, they are "Related" today, like when making movies And they are still ahead - and will be <br /> <br /> This is a very delightful movie that has been watched again and again I saw it maybe 5 times this weekend and I can sit through it five times. The performance was fantastic and science was amusing. I highly recommend
