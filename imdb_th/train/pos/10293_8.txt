`Bruce Almighty 'will sweep the Oscars with a record of 14 Academy Awards! It will surpass 'Titanic' as the highest grossing movie of all time! Jim Carrey's fame will be at the highest level that he will announce the presidential candidate for the 2004 White House Grand Final These great fantasies will appear if filmmakers (Carrie is included) will have the power of God The same place is an important ingredient in Carrey `Bruce Almighty's new laughing riot." Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a television journalist who is fully obsessed with being the main announcer for God. All his fault Lord Morgan Freeman, played by Heaven, gave to Bruce `The gift of God '(His power) to challenge him if he can do God's work better than this. Clearly, Bruce makes 'Carrie' disappear with his newly discovered happiness and uses them generously. Carrey returned again in his great comedy style in 'Bruce Almighty'. Jennifer Aniston is not Bruce's girlfriend. However, the glory of my premier went to the director Tom Chuckyak to not let the dog go out of the house for the second time and show the most funny dog ​​toilet scene ever! `Bruce Almighty 'is not the deepest carrie movie But it is still a great exhibition of 'Carreyism'! **** Well
