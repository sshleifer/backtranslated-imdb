I ran across this movie at a video store in the area during their annual sidewalk sale. While scanning thousands of videos, hoping to find a few selling animated movies, I found this movie. I read the back of the movie and knew that it was God's hand at work. Let me buy this movie. Do you see that I have three siblings with foster children? (And soon will be adopted) who live with my family As soon as my foster children connect with the three children who starred in the movie This movie helps them to better understand their situation. For the first time, the oldest brother (7 years old / female) decided to open my heart to me a bit about her past and the injuries she had experienced. She has struggled with all reliability issues. This is the first time I saw her cry. After watching the movie, I asked her what it means to adopt a child. What does it mean? She says "It means happy." Must see for families that support children and are considering adoption Of course, it opens the communication line with us.
