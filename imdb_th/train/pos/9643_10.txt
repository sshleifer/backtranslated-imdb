This movie has everything, emotion, power, love, dancing on Stephane Rideau's lovely beach ... It shows the need for participation and external communication in every relationship. Just because Cedric and Mathieu are gay couples that don't mean that no one understands it at all. I may be classified as a gay movie. But one thing that can be admired and loved by sex workers, including homosexual and bisexual Mathieu's ability to deal with his emotions reveal the way our society does not encourage us to do something different, and that is what caused him and Cedric's conflict. This is not to be missed !!!!
