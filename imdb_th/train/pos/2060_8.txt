This movie is not your typical horror movie. It has a sense of humor filled with scenes and death scenes that are funny. I personally like this movie because of the humor outside the story. It's not a scary movie, which is good if you don't want to be scared and paranoid later. I like the performances of the hillbilly and Leicester ... very reliable. I think I will dye red hair like that woman in Scarecrow-excellent! However, overall, it's worth the rental of humor that is full of extraordinary experiences and horror.
