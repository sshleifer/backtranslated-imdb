Little Richard's life and time, as Little Richard recalled, as directed and directed by Little Richard, is about one side of his music. This is not a biography or even a documentary. But with good writing, great energy and a leading actor who plays Richard All songs belong to Little Richard, so it has a tight lips in every song. <br /> <br /> This film covers his early childhood through a long time in creating music. Praise God It is well connected and clearly returned in 1962, keeping away from the idea that Little Richard discovered the Beatles that opened him. <br /> <br /> The main objection of I underplayed and you will not feel that his audience is experiencing him at that time. Some of his energy, which he still does not, is fully formed. It seems that he is tame compared to what I remember at that time. <br /> <br /> The best scene is Richard, who has been damaged by Lucille and wrote a song about the story. this Point out that there is no suitable place to change. <br /> <br /> If they enter "Bronze Liberace" as Richard uses to refer to himself in the interview Trust me, I just saw him perform a couple of months ago and he still flirts with nearly 68 lovely white girls and still remains strong. Always open
