I bought it for a while But didn't care to watch until last night. I like Juliette Lewis even though I don't care about Brad Pitt. I have to admit that he is the best actor - his character is completely believable and I don't think "Brad Pitt". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I can't speak. Same as David Duchovny. I am a fan of X-Files and I have to watch twice to confirm the date of this movie because I think it was created a few years later. I like Duchovny but find his character A little two-dimensional In which except where he made the voice That part is strong, looks like a letter, good tone, etc. Otherwise, I still think "Agent Mulder". Unfortunately, <br /> <br /> Michelle Forbes is a cute person. Why didn't I notice you before? (I would look up to see what other roles she did and saw as soon as possible). I was a little worried about Lewis's new image, this film and "Natural Born Killers" (the company's favorite). Interested in seeing the differences of characters - in NBK, she is a willing accomplice while she hates violence and tries hard to accept the dark side of the tree until being pushed into the leaf. /> <br /> almost unreservedly film Apart <br from Duchovny's character seems to have a complete form. (And perhaps "washed out" by Pitt's) it's perfect I was satisfied with the ending - glad that the innocent heroes didn't die. But they have to suffer first It is really stressful, stressful. <br /> <br /> If you like NBK, you may like this movie and vice versa.
