Going to see this movie, I'm quite skeptical because fantasy movies aren't my cup of tea. Especially romantic fantasies. <br /> <br /> I know a little that I'm riding a car through movie magic. Everything in the movie, from the plot to the dialogue, the effect is almost perfect. <br /> <br /> Claire Denness shines like a star in this movie. You will fall in love with this character more and more. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer is threatening that the evil witch bowed down to star for youth and eternal beauty. br /> Robert De Niro is a cute character that makes the audience feel extreme relief while the film is inspired by the climax. <br /> <br /> Overall And this is a movie that surprised me. If you are looking for a fun and entertaining movie that will be fun for children and adults, Stardust is the way to go.
