It's so good to have a movie that the whole family can watch together. Josie Bissett and Rob Estes (Who is married in real life) playing a couple who is married in Las Vegas with the intention of not only But have to share the news with their children, but have to try to gather their families Two boys and girls) entered the family unit firmly. What will happen when a group, including four teenagers, two preschoolers and two young children, are surprised at first if having real happiness for Carrie and Jim The fight between the children (and the love affair between the two of them) makes them wonder whether everyone can get together or not. More interesting than Brady Bunch. This is a completely fun way to spend a couple of hours. Recommended to be a movie that feels good for all ages
