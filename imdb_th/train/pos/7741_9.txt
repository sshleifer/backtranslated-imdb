The first time of Jim Thompson's first two adaptations, launched in 1990 (the other is better known as GRIFTERS). After dark, there are all Thompson symbols: dangerous women, games, confidence and characters. <br /> <br /> Jason Patric is great like a former boxer who has been disqualified from playing sports for life due to the events that happened in the ring (Director James Foley uses the sequence RAGING BULL-esquire. The latter) and Rachel Ward, who saw too little, also gave great performance, but Bruce Dern was the secret weapon of the film: Grifter, his melodious voice instructed each of his scenes to be clever. <br /> <br /> Compounding is nothing strange in this film.
