Clausen's general film, but not normal. Clausen wrote, directed and played one of the leading roles. This is a great movie about a normal person who lives normally, trying to make the best. The 4 main actors are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Fritz Helmut is reliable You believe he is really sick. <br /> <br /> Sonja Richter plays the nurse as an actor. But it turns out that she is the best nurse to take care of the elderly. <br /> br> Everyone has problems and people who don't believe that they are happy. But nothing good comes easy. They have to fight to win life and love.
