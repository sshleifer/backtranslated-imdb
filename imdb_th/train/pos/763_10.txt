This movie changed me all ... I've heard about dancing and hip hop. But never saw it done professionally (Hey, I'm an 11 year old boy from Holland!) When I saw this movie, everything changed. I participated in the hip hop movement in our city, started dancing and writing lyrics. <br /> <br /> To this day, I still think that this movie is a personal favorite movie. Of course, filming and importance "movies" may not be that important. But who cares that shooting a wide angle is not good or if you see a mic hanging over someone? It's what you think is important to you.
