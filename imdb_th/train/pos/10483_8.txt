Yes, this movie can be predictable and certainly not rewarded. But it didn't try to be anything that it wasn't The fun-filled running game with one of the really funny torpedoes. A stellar and very funny performance by Peter O'Toole. Performing on the ground and down to earth from Joan Plowright. Each person plays their role in a funny manner. Good music, though not good. But filled the movie well From some negative comments, I deduce that some humor has gone through their heads. A good example is comments about "A strange baseball-like game" My dear American is cricket - which is a baseball sport that has been received - and the explanation about the US group that is not known is very funny for people who know cricket. No, you shouldn't wince when Carl broke the window; It's funny that Lord Foxley said, "Oh, yes!" To get more money for the break, and the manager said at the same time. "Oh no" also means money. Jeez seems like everyone has to tell jokes Listen ... all the things I like it and have some wonderful laughter! Worth watching
