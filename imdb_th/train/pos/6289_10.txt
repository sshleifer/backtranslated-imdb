This movie takes a lot of time. It was determined by critics when it came out and was blamed for the destruction of Nicolas Cage's career. What I don't think people will get is that it doesn't mean being an epic film actor. Action "Bruck-buster" is the best. Fast cars, fast editing and an excellent soundtrack - it does what it says in cans. In addition, for everyone who likes cars, it is pure. It has everything: Ferraris, Mercs, Hummer and let's not forget Eleanor! I think you will be pushed hard to find better action movies, and personally all the better movies !! Then again, probably just me!
