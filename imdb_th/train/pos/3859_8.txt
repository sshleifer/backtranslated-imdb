De Vierde Man of Paul Verhoeven (The Fourth Man) is one of the greatest thrills I've ever seen. It was a really pleasant surprise. The story relates to a bisexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe) as he is lured into a relationship with the beautiful hairdresser Christine (Ren√©e Soutendijk). But in Gerard's twisted mind, there may be more stories. And the filmmakers create a beautiful and dense atmosphere that is filled with scary and ugly sex images. This is what will pull you into the story you don't want to watch. But you can't turn yourself away This is Verhoeven's best movie (maybe secondary from Robocop) True The Fourth Man is not for everyone. Some sex scenes are quite worthless (just ignore, but believe me, if you watch at least ten minutes, you will Hooked. This is one of the movies you want. In order to know how it will end, it is a real investigation in Hitchcock's tradition, interesting, controversial and exciting. I also like the metaphors of spiders. <br /> <br /> 8/10
