Gena Rowlands plays the actress who lost her occupation in reality when she saw the death of her boyfriend. She became more and more astray from the reality and her emotional turmoil became more intense with her work as an actor. In the sense that she made a mistake in acting and did everything better But still makes the audience participate in making this film interesting (If it is important to yourself) as Cassavettes' rival as a filmmaker There are many ideas that are thrown away and make it become a little confusing. (I still ponder the relationship between dead fans and Rowlands, among other things) but the way they present in their raw form makes it Movies that are interesting and thought-provoking continuously It is very good to charge twice with Mulholland Drive. <br /> <br />
