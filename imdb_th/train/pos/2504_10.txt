When I saw this movie for the first time, the first thing I thought that this movie was more like an anime than a movie. The reason is because it involves incredible vampires who have stunned Houston. Acrobatics is like the movement of a matrix, like moving too fast for a bullet and jumping very far. Another reason I did this movie is because the cute anime faces that they made during the movie, the way Gackt made a pout or the way they were shown. I think it is a movie that looks very good ^ _ ^ The action in this movie is 10 (not to mention Gackt and Hyde is 10) ^ _ ~ If you are a fan of Gackt and Hyde, you have to watch it.
