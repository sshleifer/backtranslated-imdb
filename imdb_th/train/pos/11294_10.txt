This movie is correct as the former USAF Aviation Cadet. I can tell you that this movie has everything. Boredom of the application process, waiting for words, the joy of acceptance Concerns about getting through the course The sadness of watching their friends (Probably the best of them) washed away the anguish of paying the highest price - the death of a student pilot The glory of graduation Aviation is always flying, always flying. Many were called But few people will be selected We do to pay what we have to pay enthusiastically to do.
