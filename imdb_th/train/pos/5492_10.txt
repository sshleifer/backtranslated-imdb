I was impressed with Chavez's stance on globalization for a while. But it wasn't until I saw the film at the Amsterdam International Documentary Festival that I knew he was really successful. This film tells the story of a coup / conspiracy by the elite Venezuelan government, oil and oil companies that love the corrupt government in the west to eliminate the democratically elected Chavez president and return to Venezuela back to the regime. The cruel dictator This film is suitable for anyone who believes in freedom and justice and is also a lesson for the rest of the world! I would like to commend the Venezuelan people who deal with their own hands and save their country from the Haliburton regime and the Bush administration.
