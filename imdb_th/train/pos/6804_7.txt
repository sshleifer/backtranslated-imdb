Don't let my constructive criticism stop you from buying and watching this Romy Schneider classic. This movie was filmed with a lower budget, which may be contrary to Ernest Marija's intentions. Filming, for example, England has pictures like bordering Germany. By sitting alone, they arrive too quickly. This may not be able to help. But the castle they rent for the movie is Austrian When she said that she was a queen, she went to the royal court room where members of the court bowed her. The British people came out of the castle to cheer for their new queen. Why didn't she show herself on the balcony to greet her subjects? Low budget! Which the audience returned and realized these imperfections? I wonder what the critics' feelings have happened to the inn scene in which she met Prince Albert. But I'm not excited about it Regularly meeting in the hotel restaurant where you hear music from the famous American Civil War song like "My old Kentucky State House" and "Old black Joe" What? Civil War music in 1830? Romy Schneider is shown as Scarlet? Where is Mammy? Magna Shnieder plays with her? Adrian Hoven Rhett or Ashley? What is in Marishka's mind? This is the only reason you should gather or see the solution. 03 11 09 Germany and England are already connected.
