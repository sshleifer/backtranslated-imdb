This film, 1939, from director John Ford and writer Lamatott, tells the fictional story of young lawyer Abraham Lincoln, his experiments (letters) and his difficulties. It is a movie that has a sensitive mood. But almost uninteresting The selection of Henry Fonda's cast while Lincoln seemed to be a mistake while the actors were qualified for this role, despite the many makeup and fake noses, he was too handsome for Honest Abe. It was a great effort from Fonda, who was not guilty if not sincere. But his scrutiny caused the entire movie to disappear. The supporting actors are excellent, but including Alice Brady, Ward Bond and Donald Meek, but Ford has a great respect for Lincoln's practice, which is only offered as a shy saint and in the final scene. Went to the top
