Also known as "Ladder to Heaven" in the United States During World War II, British aircraft Peter Carter (David Niven) was shot in the fight. But he still lives He met and fell in love with the lovely June (Kim Hunter), but it seems that there was a mistake in heaven - he would have died! The spirit of France came to accept him, but he refused. Soon, he confessed his case before the heavenly court that he should be allowed to live. Incredible The script is good with actors who play a straightforward and beautifully directed role - the scene on earth is technologically colored. (I've never seen this beautiful blue sky) and the scenes in heaven are black, white! Sometimes Niven is slightly stiff. But Hunter is great (And very beautiful) and Roger Livesey is great when doctors try to help Niven The whole picture is amazing. (Especially the stairs and during the final trial sequence) and special effects are excellent (Considering the age of the movie) There is also a very strange sequence when Niven runs into the sheep herd. Shepherd! This film is a thought-provoking and highly recommended movie. This story is still unknown in the United States, which is a shame.
