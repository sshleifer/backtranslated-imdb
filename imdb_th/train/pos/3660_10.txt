De Sica, this vague product delivery And there is a saying "The humble man will inherit the earth." This story is on the surface. But is a comparison for every homeless person who lives in Europe after a great war They don't have housing But cheerful in a poor society and too selfish to take care of or accept them De Sica chose to say that it is a fairy tale about fairy tales. I have not read the book. It is up to me so I cannot predict that the deus ex machina is the structure of the writer or Vittorio. It starts with the word "Once upon a time ..." to exemplify the timelessness of its tales for stories that can be set anywhere and everywhere. The caricature of a noble figure that intersects the homeless natural bones of the homeless, especially when they begin to desire and end the end of Spielberg De Sica's most accessible image is one of his best. He created a movie that broke the heart and at the same time filled it with the desire to go away in this world. Gracias Vittorio! Gracias! Gracia !!! Gracia !!!!!!!!!!!!
