This is a manga image that has very little dialogue. The dialogue that appears in the word baloons is like in a manga. The story of this thing actually exists. But thought only as a trough. There was a problem with the manga which was available in English in the explosive book collection. 'Japanese underground comics' and a real dialogue describing the plot rather than here I suggest checking that volume if you like this because it explains some of the "plot" of the movie which cannot be explained. Intelligent animation. This is a good thing. Unintentionally using a computer and most images are well recognized. It jumped in and out of the episode as a cat and cat character. His sister, the dead brain, walked in and out as a series of strange images: a circus circus desert. In just half an hour, they had to go through many schemes and settings, which made me believe that the director chose issues related to manga that took a long time to randomly adjust. But choose the basic model Knowing what has happened may increase appreciation. This reminds me of what they used to play on the MTV sushi comic, especially the short-lived cat chasing the bottom-cheeked cheek of people around the house. More and their adventures extend to include death and reincarnation and a number of other themes. The DVD of this story has the director's comments and the "making" feature. I can't comment on these things because I didn't get close to them. I gave 8/10 now. Not too much to compare with in anime and I hope to be like this again.
