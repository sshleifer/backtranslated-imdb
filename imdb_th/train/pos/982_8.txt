This is one of the western qualities that stand alone in its dialogue. There are very few people who will stand for a long time. That said the rest was not good Anyway, I gave it eight, because there is no other western that has a good conversation continuously. For example, maybe except The Wild Bunch, Jr., Bonner and maybe a few more <br /> <br /> It's full. The most vulnerable John Drew Barrimore However, it has one truly memorable scene. Nothing like it after Kid Wichita killed the sheriff and then went to Jack Elams to try to fight him. wonders Correct with the best in the west
