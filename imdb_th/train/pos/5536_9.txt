I really enjoyed this show. Even as a child, I am also interested in all types of sports, including horse racing. It will always be difficult to create a series based on corruption in the competition and at the same time get permission from the race track. One time I remember that there was a horse in the middle, especially that was expected to win a big, colorful competition. The syringe was found on a stable area and everyone thought it was poisoned. But nothing appears in the blood test Too late, they know that horses are not doped. But with cartilage in the knee Like running a car without oil and the engine holding the horse collapses with sad results
