I see a fair share of comedy and vertical movies. But this movie is fresh, new, will make you wonder why you went through it in a video store. Murphy has a rather obscene joke. But it's too funny to go through If every movie could be a joke It should be called "107 minutes of the most amazing comedy movie". Murphy is a comic genius in this movie and will make you say "This is the guy Dr. He talked about the ice cream man, the mother of his aunt throwing shoes with mustache, mustache, racism and everything else that you might conceive and someone you don't know Please, if you've seen a comedy in your life, it's only if every movie is raving.
