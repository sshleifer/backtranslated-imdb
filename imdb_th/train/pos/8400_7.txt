I picked up this movie at my local library. When meeting the director of the film festival at the end of last year, I was curious to see "check out" his work. Familiar, love, dishonesty, friendship, friendship, jealousy Sometimes it is 'talkative', but not as much as to sink a movie. I enjoy watching love stories with clear characters together and watching them make conscious decisions rather than "falling" into something as important as love. <br /> <br /> The difference between movies This story with a low budget black film shoot-em 'is quite clear. Let's see if you're lucky. Your copy will come with a soundtrack like my good stuff!
