This is Keaton's first feature, and in fact, three shorts are set at different times. (Stone Age, Roman Age, New Age) on the Triangle of Eternal Love Parallel stories, as well as in Griffith's loneliness, which are intended to mock The strengths of jokes and jokes are almost all. But depending on the offense, modern business enters the ancient era. <br /> <br /> **** Warning - Spoilers follow the best score. <br /> This is the classic moment: <br /> <br /> Use the turtle as a wee-gee board (Stone Age); Wristwatch with the sun (Roman era); Chariot with spare wheels (Roman era); Using a helmet as a tire lock (Roman era); Before golf with clubs and rocks (Stone Age); Determining the intention to be carved into stone (Stone Age); Weather forecasters (Roman era); Snow horse race - Blockbuster using ski and husky, along with a dog with a boot of the horse carriage (Roman era) <br /> <br /> The above is a joke that makes us laugh <br /> <br /> The buster took off the shaving device to match the makeup of a wonderful pair of girls. Spend time when Buster is stared at his plate to search for crabs. Staring at him (Within a second he jumped to stand on his chair from the sitting position and jumped again in the arms of the waiter - one of the most fun The time I've seen) and the lion - manicure - excellent. <br /> <br /> There is also a slight racism when four African-American litter holders abandon love in Roman shit game <br /> <br /> Kino's printing is quite vague and there is a sequence of nitrate deterioration and damage of many films that may be at the end of the wheel. The Metro feature gets scores from pianos and flutes and borrowed heavily from Grieg. <br /> <br /> Lots of fun and full of laughter.
