Shawshank, Godfather, Pulp Fiction ... all good movies Great movie But nothing and I mean, not living with the greatest Christmas movies of all. Santa Claus <br /> <br /> This film is very good and has lots of messages. I cry while watching. Seriously, this is one of the movies you want to watch 10 times. When we saw Pitch saying that he had to eat ice cream, we saw the sadness in his eyes and we felt a deep sadness. Then we wondered. .. This ice cream has nothing bad. Does it mean that we, as humans, are performing ice cream well when it makes us evil? Think that the movie makes you think <br /> <br /> This film has the best meaning of Santa Claus. Unlike other Santas, he is a normal person. We saw him trapped children and spied on the dreams of children and we wondered. Santa, we believe in something really good? In addition, Santa also speaks of Christ, all the meaning behind Christ. <br /> <br /> You owe yourself to watching the masterpiece of this film. We should stop making movies and broadcast without anything except this epic 24/7, whether it's Christmas or not, this movie gets 500/10. Anyone who says that this movie is not good is foolish.
