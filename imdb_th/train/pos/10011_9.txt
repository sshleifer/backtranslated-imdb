I really enjoyed the audience at night. One of the best summer movies. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams is one of his best performances. Actually, all the actors are very good. Everyone plays just the right notes for their characters - not too much and not too little. Sandra O adds impressive impressions with the Toni Collette cartoon, which is great like a mother and will never pass. Everyone is very confident. <br /> <br /> It's a short movie, less than an hour and a half. I noticed that the general version was nine minutes shorter than the Sundance model. I wondered if some disturbing pictures were cut from the movie. <br /> <br /> The director told the story and made it straightforward The job is to impress the audience more than tell the story and tell it to listen to each other. <br /> <br /> Don't be sucked by watching samples and advertisements. It's not Hitchcockian's thriller. See The Night Listener because you want to see a good story. If you expect to receive Hitchcock, you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> My only complaint with this movie is the ending. The director may leave the imagination of the audience a bit more. But this is a bit vague
