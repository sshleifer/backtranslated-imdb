The French production of the leading film directors from 11 countries was invited to create an 11-minute short film that reflects their reflection on the September 11th event. <br /> <br /> Film groups vary. In content and quality Two people refer to the terrorist conspiracy in Chile. (In Chile, following Aldende, who died on September 11, 1973, appeared in the British director Ken Ken Loach and in Palestine by Israel backing the United States). Two other destructive acts ( Palestinian suicide bombings in Tel Aviv, shot by Israeli director Amos Gitan; Japan "Sacred War" in the West in WW II by Shohei Imamura) <br /> <br /> Ironies are rich in many shadows that make the apartment in New York City of old men who are sad to disappear. Suddenly, while the World Trade Tower is adjacent to the ground in the piece of Sean Penn, bring joy for a moment But in this bright light he can finally see that his wife has really gone away In the movie Mira Nair, following the real incident, a young man who disappeared in New York City, the son of a Pakistani family, was the first to assume that he was a terrorist. But later he proved to be a hero who sacrificed himself, trying to help others in the tower. <br /> <br /> There was a painful time. Loach had his exiled Chilean man referring to St. Augustine, for the result of hope, anger and courage: anger in the form of courage to change them Imamura tells us that there is no holy war. Samira Makhmalbaf shows her teacher and her little Afghan student who is exiled in Iran trying to tell them about events that had just happened in New York. But they were more impressed with the important events in their refugee camp, where two men fell into a deep well. One man was killed, the other stood on the broken leg. This is a tremendous understandable tragedy for a 6-year-old child. <br /> <br /> Idrissa Ouedraogo from Burkina Faso creates a drama in which the son of a poor, healthy girl sees Osama bin Laden in their village and collects His friends to help the refugee terrorists to receive a $ 25 million US dollar reward. He told his friends not to let adults know their plans because the old people would lose money with cars and cigarettes while entering. Plans to help mothers and other people who are sick and poor. <br /> <br /> Be a Mexican director, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (producer "Amores Perros") that is served by the most powerful part. And cold, most of which only show dark screens with audio tapes of prayers and sounds and Occasional sounds The picture flashed briefly, gradually allowing us to see the corpse falling from the high floor of the tower and it began to us that thuds were these bodies bumping the ground. That sequence ended with an elegant orchestral and shot with the first phrase shown in Arabic. Then there was an additional translation: "The light of God guides us or makes us blind" (in different languages With English subtitles) Grade: 8/10 (B +) (see on 10/31/04) If you want to read more of my comments, send a message to find directions to my website.
