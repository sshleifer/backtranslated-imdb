Until the sixth episode and the final episode of the Star Wars saga, which eventually ended in 2005. I watched this program in 1983 as a favorite movie of a long-running series. Various action scenes and truly different characters (Jabba The Hut, long-haired wild animals and others) make this movie very appealing. <br /> <br /> No action. Any focus on a particular point for too long Half an hour ago was the most typical example when the scene changed every few minutes from the forest to the battle between the spacecraft into the laser battle between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. br /> <br /> If the previous two pages were not a lack of fighting between the two stars Continued bickering between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford has continued to disappear. Finally everyone is on the same page! It's good to see <br /> <br /> At the end, this is just a great adventure story.
