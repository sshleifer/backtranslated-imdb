This movie has to be watched. The real picture of what is happening in the world that I've seen since Darwin's nightmare. Let's see! And if you're lucky enough to open your city, don't forget to watch it on the big screen instead of the DVD. The writing is sharp and the direction is good enough for the idea to pass, even if not perfect. Joan Cusack is great and the rest of the actors do well as well. It inspired John Cusack to create this movie and I believe he had to use his own money to do it. It is a ridiculous and ridiculous journey that makes it clear that no resources are needed. But still successful, Jon Stewart, Steven Colebert, SNL, even Bill Hur does not show the courage to say what the film says.
