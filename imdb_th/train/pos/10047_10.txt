For everyone who is happy to have done everything from complaining about budget conversations, this stuff and what .... want to hear. If you miss the purpose of this more beautiful movie, that is your loss. The rest of us who love this movie deeply do not care what you think. I am a man over thirty years old who has watched thousands of movies in my life and this story stands out from my own book. It shouldn't be a documentary or an actual story that night. It's the most amazing love story ever. I know that it is the 90s, the disdain and the millennium. There is everyone in chaos, but there are people in this forum complaining that making too much money! really? It made a lot of money in every country that has grown on this planet and is the highest grossing film in the world. I am happy to be with the majority of people at this time. Okay, people cynical when crawling back under your rock. I'm finished.
