Good: participation in the firefighting of movies, excellent presentations, vehicles, fun driving, many people attracting attention from movies and programs. <br /> <br /> Bad: Main mission That is quite short /> <br /> This game defines what a good "third person" athlete (doesn't have to be a spy game). Excellent firefighting continues in the story and makes you want to make every mission. The achievements and unlock bonus games are all genuine. This game is already up and I think you should buy it and connect with a few friends and play this game. A lot of fun <br /> <br /> The sound of this game is an incredible achievement from the previous few games and the shooting of the weapon feels like shooting a real weapon. It's linked to the aspect that you are a deadly and cruel spy. <br /> <br /> All of this game makes you excited and satisfied after you pass it and many players that can compete with the standards of the game.
