The final part of the thriller action movie is the hardest scene in three movies. It goes beyond playing the theme against Bond. Bourne doesn't like what he's doing and wants to know about his blurry past. Everything about this movie is stuck on the nails, from filming to choreography / acting, to acting, <br /> <br /> The film begins suddenly as Bor. Was running from Moscow police It seems that the story begins as soon as the first movie goes out or not. The time is a little messy here. But we understand that Bond is suddenly remembering things while trying to clean himself, almost causing him to be caught. But he did and didn't kill anyone They are not his goals. From there, we received more attention from his past with new players, Noah Vose, who seemed to know everything about Bond and to protect it at an affordable price. Pamela Landy came back again. With Nicky Parsons that seems to have a past with Bourne as well. <br /> <br /> Movies are in your face. The car chase is more severe if possible than in the beginning. And an experienced actor like Bourne is also great, with the good part of Albert Finney. There is also a slight political upheaval in relation to actions and other government policies, but small and well integrated. Within the plot All of this is the best summary of this year's trilogy, if not the best ending.
