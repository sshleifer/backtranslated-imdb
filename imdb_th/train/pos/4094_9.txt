For anyone who has seen Disney productions, a beautiful animated version of 'Beauty & The Beast', or even Jean Cocteau's imaginative fairytale vision is shocking in 1975, the French version (but with the director from Poland) Lot about the noble family in France who married an English family The important thing to catch is that the groom holds an ancient curse to the family. The film also has many sequences (probably) describing this family curse. Since opening the credit to the very end, it is a fun ride in a home that is never stopped with very clear sexual content and graphics. (Therefore, the X rating of this film in the United States at the beginning, which is now not rated), the insulting feeling of the film in the trial floor may remind one of Bunuel's flights to enter the land. Similar If you have a truly bizarre taste and are not offended with "forbidden" content, this movie may scratch you.
