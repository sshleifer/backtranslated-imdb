The US Department of State doesn't want us to watch this movie because they have beef with the Iranian government. However, it shows us how real Iranian civilization, despite the content of this film, focuses on the women's struggle there for equal rights in the simplest terms: the ability to watch limited football games. Male audience only This film is a hilarious joke and in itself is evidence of freedom of speech and expression in Iran. I enjoy this movie a lot. Five girls tried to penetrate the police border at the ticket gate for football matches between Iran and Bahrain. The comedy that followed was too funny to explain from a bus trip to the stadium to police requests and detention of children. Don't miss this classic movie. It must watch one of the movies. The best country I've seen for many years.
