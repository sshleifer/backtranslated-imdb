This wonderful Marvel superhero game pays the right tribute by staying with the cartoon. In every game, the Marvel Super Hero is weak with graphics and weak gameplay. Spiderman develops both departments. In addition, there is the voice of Stan Lee, the creator of Spider-Man comics. <br /> <br /> As you expect Spider-Man to do everything the spider does. He did more than rotate the web. In fact, he uses them as weapons and shields. When he didn't use the web to fight, he punched and kicked. Spidey had his hands full while he fought Venom, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpion and Dr. Octopus. To name a few, look for Captain America in the form of a cameo. <br /> <br /> Most levels are challenging. But some people need patience to overcome The only complaint about this game is that it is very short and can be completed in less than three hours. If you are a big fan of real Marvel, this game is for you. But don't expect long game play. Good luck in "Spiderman 2". My rating: 9 out of 10
