No, I tell lies. This is true. It's not the best movie of all time. But it's a really fun movie that no one knows. <br /> <br /> It's a companion movie starring Jay Leno and Pat Morita (Miyagi) with a creepy story about a missing car engine prototype Or something But that doesn't matter The reason that this movie is fun is because of the interaction between the two leaders, who at first didn't like and didn't trust each other. But in a shocking fate that became friends All cultural differences are done quite well, because it's fun to watch it completely ridiculous. But with a wonderful and fun way The soundtrack is great again in the style of the 80s. It's suitable for movies. I tried to find one of the songs for all ages. But when I work from the memory of what I think The words I don't seem to find. <br /> <br /> Another thing that this movie is the best movie ever. But I won't let it go. Oh no! In conclusion, I will take this movie for 48 hours Eddie Murphys, mostly including Beverly Hills police and anything that is close friends Jackie Chan or Martin Lawrence must be their name. If you are looking for a police buddy movie and are bored with "White police meet a black woman police." You may be surprised because this turns out that all the recipes are upside down. "The Japanese police met a wireless white police salon." <br /> <br /> I gave 7 things with honesty. I like it more. I should watch more than what I give. 8 But I think I know deeply that it is the madness that makes me like this movie.
