The first movie is a good movie. But it's not as good as the great animated movies that I find painful and even more intriguing. The sequel of this story is inferior. But not bad at all Sure too much pain, the script has weaknesses and the plot is not boring. But the dog is very cute here and Eric Idle is a cheerful person like Macaw. This film is good to watch with stylish movies and interesting eye makeup (especially Cruella) and the music is good. Most of the performances are very good. Get better performances, have fun, be a collaborator of Cruella, but the best thing that has ever been in the first movie is Glenn Close, which is amazing in the great performances like Cruella Hundreds more than she had been earlier, overall good 7/10 Bethany Cox.
