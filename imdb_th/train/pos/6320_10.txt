The main reason I want to see this movie is because of the great actors. Many of my favorite actors in one movie have amazing values ​​without actually seeing them. But this movie made me careful Not what I expected A long time ago I saw it. But I remember I couldn't stop laughing !!! And it's not just the actors doing for me The script was written amazingly. Every time you expect something to happen, it will not happen. With a lot of twisting and rotation But fits perfectly with the whole tone of the movie The movie along with the scene is very beautiful as well. I can't say anything bad about this movie! Expect me to give Andrew Davoli a little more time to screen!
