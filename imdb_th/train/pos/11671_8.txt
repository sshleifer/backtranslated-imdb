"Against All Flags" is a classic swashbuckler game. It has all the elements that adventure fans can expect, and in this game, the girl in that suffering is not in distress. As Spitfire Stevens, Maureen O'Hara is her best athlete, managing her enemies through challenging social norms of that era. Anthony Quinn released the top three actors as a brutal Captain Rock Brasiliano. For classic adventure fans, "Against All Flags" is something that shouldn't be missed. Although it may not be in the same league as the previous work of Errol Flynn (Blood Captain and The Sea Hawk, for example), but still a very fun game.
