I think this movie is excellent. There are many reasons. But these are some of them: 1) Good performances by Tom and Tyler 2) Great machine gun scenes that are pieces of brightness 3) I think the ending is good. Twisted because I never expected that at the end of all credits for Sam Mendes, as well as these 3 points, the style of this movie is also good. I am a film student at the college and we study this film thoroughly and one of the best movies I've seen for many years. I just want to say thank you very much to everyone involved in creating this movie. Finally, I want to say that the best scene in this movie is the machine gun scene that John Rooney was killed. It is only the ingenuity of filming the scene in silence until John Rooney says "I'm glad you" is better. So much that I think because the audience creates their own voice and the sound is completely different for all the wonderful audiences. <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading this comment written by Ross Kirk. 16
