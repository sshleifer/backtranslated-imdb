108: Tarzan and His Mate (1934) - published on 4/20/1934. See 8/6/08 <br /> <br /> John Dillinger escaped from prison and robbed a bank in Iowa. Bonnie & Clyde killed two police patrols. People in Texas. Birth: Ralph Schneider, Gloria Styen, Alan Arkin, Richard Chamberlain. <br /> <br /> Flour : After we were disappointed with the original 'Tarzan the Ape Man', we discovered among friends, users and historians. 'Tarzan and his partner' are the best in the series. it's true. I have seen this movie very much. Johnny Weismuller is back again as a giant vine swing. A fierce battle with wild animals and Maureen O'Sullivan shows her role again as his beloved lady. Jane (who was dressed in two pieces for the first and last time) in my review for 'Ape Man', I stomped Jane very well for her fascination with clothes and green noise. The incessant her But she redeemed herself for me here Don't make mistakes: O'Sullivan is the star of this movie and Jane is the most talented character in all the performances. She acts as an ambassador between Holt and Tarzan. She is able to work perfectly in the woods and into animals, and she knows how to block the pride of an angry lion when she leaves the bullet. She also screamed her own forest now. The chemistry between Johnny and Maureen is irresistible. She is fully trained. Charming cheetahs as well, removing Martin's cigarettes Most of the story is an excuse for Tarzan to fight the wildest animals in the wild, especially lions, crocodiles and rhinos. Although the effects are visible at all times, they are more dynamic and cool and complete the action. Oh and you can't talk about this movie without talking about the nude swimming scene. All I can say is: Yes, she is naked. <br /> <br /> Kevin: Wow, just wow when talking about the action / adventure that is uninspired premium. Nothing holds a candle for 'Tarzan and His Mate 'The inevitable sequel of Tarzan the Ape Man is a fierce and intense dialogue. I wonder if there will be another Tarzan movie in the future that doesn't require this method. You have to press hard to find the full scene in this movie, which will be approved according to the code of ethics or certified by Animal Animal. Up before it pushes the limits of current adventure movies And after T&J came into the picture, there were many hugs in the early morning and swimming in the afternoon that was naked. See for yourself if you don't believe me. I love Maureen O'Sullivan, mostly in this movie. In the first film, Jane seems to be in conflict with the walk like the writer went back to that time, not knowing how to show the character like that. But here she is a great precursor for female players in theaters later. Although she still needs the help of Tarzan to bring her out of most jams But she still can do more than waiting for help Her personality is perfectly believable for a woman who lives comfortably in the forest for one year. I watched this with my mother and I enjoyed pointing out how much Jane had Tarzan. She has a monkey man that she all beckoned. Although there are a host of dated light effects throughout the movie But there are also many Tarzan fights that are fed with fighting (mostly) for real things That and the man dressed up like a monkey is a more reliable thing at this time. ** Spoiler ** The movie climbs up as the forest grows boisterous with the shocking violence of the animal kingdom that left Tarzan and Jane to humans. Only two people still breathe. Although both couples rode in the sunset together and were victorious, I couldn't help but imagine that this would look like the next safari to hear about the previous group that went to Tarzan and Jane. * * END SPOILER ** One thing that is still bothering me is Johnny Weissmuller, which is soft and silky. In addition, this is a pre-action adventure that should not be missed. <br /> <br /> Last movie: It Happened One Night (1934) Next movie: Twentieth century (1934)
