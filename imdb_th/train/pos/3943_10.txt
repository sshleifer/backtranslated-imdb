In his excellent book, Lincoln, in memory, American historian Merrill Peterson called Young Mr. Lincoln as a movie. "Boring, scary, scary" This amazingly misleading analysis proves that great historians are not good film critics. I worked for a doctoral dissertation on Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass as part of the preparation for writing a thesis. I made a careful analysis of this film and the superb interpretation of Tag Gallaghers in the Ford seminal book. His young man, Lincoln, came out last year during the first year of Ford's film composition in 1939, the biggest year in Hollywood. Film directed three films. It may seem odd to say that the Stagecoach has not been fully appreciated all. But most critics have to understand that it is one of the greatest and probably the greatest Western movies of all time. However, what is not fully appreciated is that these three films work together as a trilogy - one worthy in reality. Ford is making history about America's legend on the screen. The Mohawk drum is a revolutionary war. Young Mr. Lincoln is a pre-Civil War America. Finally, Stagecoach is a Post Civil War America. What the three movies have in common is that they are doing an extended meditation on Adam American. And "Wilderness errands" What is the mental and social cost of fate that appears in America when America is determined to build a new human city in the Lincoln wilderness as a symbol of America's journey while He tried to reconcile with the law. Lincoln was not history. (Full of history, "Howler's" - because both Ford and Trotti are well aware), but this legend is Lincoln, a symbol of justice and mercy. To discover civilizations within themselves and become "Outstanding Lawmaker" of Young American Young Mr. Lincoln is not a historical story that James has long forgotten about Lincoln Agee and as well as the Sandburgs biography. It is an epic poem ... Great poetry. Very beautiful epic
