This is a great movie! Although only about 15 people, including myself, are great! My friend and i laugh a lot My mother also enjoys it. There are two middle-aged women there and 20 years old, and they seem to enjoy it. I like the part that Corky and Ned are both like Nancy and what it's cute lol and when she gets the car open and Ned is there Yes, this is a great movie, even though people think that the assessment is low. Go see it, I bet you will enjoy it !! I really enjoyed it and my friend did that. <br /> <br /> People are strong in this movie and they have never seen it before. I bet the next time they will give the movie and actress the opportunity. They all work well in my opinion. But if you have small children, it is still appropriate I might take my granddaughter, 7 years old, to see as well.
