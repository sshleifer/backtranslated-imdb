This is a great performance and will make you cry. This group loves each other in real life and it will show time and time again. Send me an email and request a chat. I've been to Australia and they actually say this 40 episodes on the DVD-R that I have compiled in the last 5 years. See my Five Mile Creek tribute at www.mikeandvicki.com. And listen to music from additional songs Let's talk about them. <br /> <br /> These guys are really cool!
