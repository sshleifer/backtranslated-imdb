In my humble opinion, this film is not recognized as worthy. Robert Redford lives near me here in Provo, Utah, at Sundance. I enjoy most of his work and this is my favorite thing. I'm sorry that there are many people who don't like it. My grandmother was an avid reader and read many years before it came out on the big screen. She gave it to me to read after we watched the movie together. The movie and the book were impressed by the feeling in my heart and I wept for days after watching the movie. Sometimes love is not enough to prevent those we love to hurt ourselves. We see this in our family relationships. But our love and family and their stories remain all the time. The film was perfect and amazing. I was shocked by the beauty of it and the author's words were Norman Maclean. "But when I was alone in the half of the valley That will fade away with my life and the memories and sounds of the big black river and the four beats and the hope that the fish will eventually increase. Everything merges into one and the river flows through The river was cut by the great flood of the world and flowed through the rocks from the basement of the time. On some rocks there were raindrops that were timeless under the stone as words and some of them belong to them. Taken from the book and speaking at the end of the movie (by Robert Redford, which tells the story of Norman Maclean) is the basis of the Bible. The beauty and elegance of the story and the movie pretty much it!
