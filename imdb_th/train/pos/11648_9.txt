Someone claims that this is another "bad language". Violent, violent Mexican movies. They were right. More than that, this movie is a line that creates awareness of what we are. The horrible truth causes pain or boredom when you accept the paradigm of living in the third world as the only possible goal. One of the most important things of "Cero y van cuatro" is an open invitation for a deep reflection over our current identity. Is that what we all? That's all we need I live abroad and I know what the spoil of Mexican society is when the Tlahuac event comes to light. I still do not understand the audience who saw the mass murder that aired a lot. I almost puked when I saw some pictures. It's not Iraq or Rwanda, which is just a small village near Mexico City when rampant, being released from the media and government. Relaxing in a similar situation in this film shocked me. Other stories are good images in other situations of corruption, corruption, betrayal and violence, but I think "Tamales de Chivo" is the best. <br /> <br /> This movie is deeper than "cabr√≥n" and "pendejo" screams These things are meaningless compared to people's actions. With some exceptions, they are all perfect examples of human waste. Like in real life, honesty is becoming an exception rather than a rule in our country. More than that, honesty is only miraculously rewarded.
