If the Lion King is a Disney version of the Hamlet, Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata is a version of Guildenstern and Rosencrantz are Dead. Like Tom Stoppard's enticing movie, we will see action from the perspective of two secondary characters from the original. : Timon, meerkat with a penchant for breaking into the music that the hat and Pumbaa, pig with flatulence problems From following their story - instead of a lion - we can see why every animal bowed while the lion was presented from Pride Rock. We found what made Timon and Pumba decide to follow the lion back to Pride Rock to expel Scar And how we find that they deal with hyenas every time. Nathan Lane plays the most funny Timon, but he is supported by Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa. It is also good to hear Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg Replenish their roles. Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller deliver outstanding voices for both new characters: Timon's mother and uncle. The only downside is that the fast-forward stop device does not help develop the story. Having said that there is a great zoom near the beginning of the movie. With more laughs than the third series of films on other subjects, Hakuna Matata is worth looking at - if only for the hot tub scene, which is still funny, even slightly predictable.
