This film is not a schlock, despite the production and links to the production of Troma. Dark tales for adults. The exploitation is the theme of sugar cookies and one thing that suspects that the actor is not the victim of that theme. A strange movie with attractive images: shadows and contrasts are outstanding. Worth watching, especially from Warhol fans and stylish decadence. All cruelty and evil can be morally distorted, even if it is valuable.
