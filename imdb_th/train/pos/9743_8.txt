First of all, we watch this movie as part of the new Argentine film festival in 2000 at Walter Reade, although we like it. But we don't think it's wonderful See for the second time, we find different meanings in looking at life in Buenos Aires. <br /> <br /> This film takes place in one of Argentina's darkest days while the DeLaRua administration ended the country. Was in turmoil after a flourishing economy earlier in the 1990s under the atmosphere that President Menen created. It was a time when bank accounts in dollars were frozen and Each brings together people of different nightmare <br /> <br /> The story begins when Santamarina bank employee was fired because of the economic collapse. Instead of receiving sympathy from his wife, she locked him out of the apartment and he for all practical purposes became a homeless man. He spent the road trying to make the meeting end. <br /> <br /> Another story introduces us to Ariel, a young Jew. An interview with a Spanish company is almost a miracle for him. Getting a job Simon, his father, was the owner of a small restaurant in the Jewish neighborhood of "El Once" in the city center. Things started to get worse when Ariel's mother died immediately. Only Estela, a young woman who loves Ariel, comes to help her father and son. <br /> <br /> Santa Marina, who is clean, must turn to shower anywhere he can.

Ariel, who has released a spear with wedding photography and other occasions, is fascinated by Laura, but he realizes what Estela sacrificed to help his father and still love him. <br /> <br /> Daniel Burman Those who "El Abrazo Partido", we think are excellent, do wonders with this movie. Things have been put in the right view after the second look recently and we apologize for not understanding. for the first time If there is anything this second time, the difference of playing on the screen that Mr. Berman and Emiliano Torres write makes more sense because they reflect the chaos of things in the country. Live in those dark ages. <br /> <br /> Ariel players have collaborated with Mr. Burman before, to get surprising results. He's not a 'beautiful movie star' but he's a handsome actor. This person expressed sincerity. Enrique Pineyro is another beautiful surprise. His Santamarina is armed. Despite all the bad things that fall upon him, he still has a cheerful attitude towards everyone he meets Stefania Sandrelli, an interesting Italian actress who has been very involved in this film with her Elsa. Hector Alterio One of the best Argentine actors playing a small part of Simon Chiara Coselli. The beautiful figure is seen as Laura and Melina Petrielli, who appeared in the noble Estela. <br /> <br /> "Esperando al mesias "proves that Daniel Burman is an unexpected voice in the Argentine cinema.
