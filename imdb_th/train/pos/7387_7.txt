The event of September 11, 2001 created the shadow of this Oscar award with a silence one minute before being cut in memiam and there was little in the way of singing all the comedy we expected from this story. Award show But this is not a bad thing The entertainment is much reduced with the LOTR delivered with Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson and that is the rest of the show being brought up with clips from the nominees and I have to admit that it's more fun than music and The dance that we have seen for many years and Whoopi Goldberg has never been a terrible presenter. David Letterman, who was mysterious from a few years ago and a one-minute silence for the victims of the 9/11 event <br /> <br /> For the award, New Zealand is definitely robbed. FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING Go home with four minor awards while A MINA BEIFIFUL MIND picks up big prizes unreasonably. Except the best actor The only Academy Award that I agree with, other than that given to FELLOWSHIP, is the award for the best female actors and the best supporting performer, both the correct call.
