My son is 7 years old. When he watched this movie, he is now on a Russian fishing boat and said that the most impressive and his favorite movie, 39 years, is the movie of the legend of Boy and his eagle Asked if it was possible for me to receive this from him I am sure that many things came into his head because he had only 3 hours and he was on this boat for 3 months and will have another 3 months before his contract expires. Since we have an Indian blood line, he is linked to this movie on January 27. He is 47 years old and I want to get this movie for him. He lives in Thailand and is a commercial fisherman in the last 17 years and because we all know that this is one of the most dangerous jobs. Can you help me find this movie Thank you in advance, Dolly Crout-Soto, Deerfield Beach.
