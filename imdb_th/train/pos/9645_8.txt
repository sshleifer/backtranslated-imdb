'Presque rien' is the story of two young men who fell in love in the summer by the sea. I don't want to tell the story because it's not the most important thing of this movie. (But you can be sure that it's interesting and original) The best part of this movie is the movie. The visible image of the 'Presque rien' is so amazing that it deserves the highest note. It makes you fascinated with its beauty. <br /> <br /> For the story, it shows in a way that is not smooth and quite complicated. There are no easy events and no answers for every question that the movie brings. But this is what makes 'Presque rien' more interesting. I recommend this movie to everyone that the art of movies is very important and they will not be disappointed.
