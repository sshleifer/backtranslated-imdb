Oh wow, wait a minute This film leads you to a wonderful ride and will not let you go until the final explosion in your face ends. This is a movie for fans of the Stormriders. And like that, the Legend of Zu is beautifully built, even though I don't like anything. But they use a lot of stand I want to see real people fighting, but oh ... a little less, and I don't like it so much until I see it again when you understand more. I recommend to anyone who wants to see a real Asian movie to watch this movie. I rate this movie, one of my highest ratings, to watch when it's screened in America !!!
