James J. Corbett, the winner of the World Heavyweight Champion from 1892 to 1897, became Errol Flynn's favorite role. Probably because he didn't have to wield a sword or be in a foreign country. He became tired of the player, Swatler, and spoke in his autobiography that he felt he was a person in the West and didn't understand why people liked him in them. It's a fun movie. But almost not telling the true story of James J. Corbett. <br /> <br /> The image that Corbett is the first scientific fighter to win in the heavyweight division. Than the strength like wild animals to win He defeated John L. Sullivan and defeated Bob Fitzsimmons heavyweight crown. In addition, he is also a flirt that has to do that, and in that is like a man who shows him. Of course not showing on the screen. The character that Alexis Smith plays is the daughter of a banker who falls in love with him. There is no basis in reality. In fact, Corbett was married twice and was unfaithful to both his wife. <br /> <br /> Although after losing his position and after the film's conclusion, he suffered a great personal tragedy. His father, at a time of depression, could be financially because he lost his gambling so hard that his son beat Bob Fitzsimmons, fired his mother and turned the gun on himself. Suicidal hardly happens with the happy group that Alan Hale serves as president. <br /> <br /> One thing I like about Gentleman Jim Wardborn has a role in the career of He played John L. Alzheimer's. Levant Director Raul Walsh received great work from Bond as a belittling person. But lovely Sullivan Even though Sullivan's bad points are not on the screen, like crazy racism, Bond's image is John L. who is the essence and the best thing about gentlemen. Jim <br /> <br /> What should be said is the fact that Sullivan, as the champion, refuses to compete to meet Peter Jackson, who is black and from Australia. And may be the best model in His ass I said that it might be because as a challenger, Corbett found him and fought him 61 times for a draw. Sullivan-Corbett Of course, when Corbett was the winner, he refused to give Jackson a shot. Maybe he doesn't want the 61 rounds of marathon with someone who might be better that day. <br /> <br /> Gentleman Jim isn't the story of Jim Corbett. It is Errol Flynn's movie that plays. Was James J. Corbett, but he still lives in Corbett in the summer of 1942. No doubt he must love movies and love the picture of Flynn's life. It is like he would like to be remembered.
