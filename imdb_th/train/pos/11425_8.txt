The story is about a small girl who grew up in the African colony. But it is more. <br /> <br /> Everyone who grows in the South will experience the same thing. Another desire of other races that cannot be achieved Even if it is forbidden, there is no need for any words. Their facial expressions say everything. <br /> <br /> It is the story of a black servant Protée (Isaach De Bankolé) and a white woman. Aimée (Giulia Boschi) Their wishes are so strong that they torture each other because they don't have one another. <br /> <br /> French little girl (Cécile Ducasse) is lonely and spends all her time with Protée You can't see this dance. <br /> <br /> Another annoying aspect of this film is the colonial laziness. They can't even pull off the bed by themselves. The world is about to end. They don't know Their racist attitude will be erased by their presence. <br /> <br /> I think I want to go to Africa Seems very quiet Especially at night when you hear animal sounds
