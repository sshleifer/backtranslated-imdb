I'm not sure that I understand that those who oppose these discontent are talking here, perhaps because some people like to brag about things. <br /> <br /> The film is absolutely flawed. There may be a problem with the change of time every actor is willing to go in a place that I do not want to go, etc.) but IMHO has something beyond that to create imperfection. <br /> <br /> First of all, I Love a bit 'breaking the rules'. Normally, when you leave the Haunted Haunted House, you will be alone, when you regroup, find friends, and search for mysterious paranormal types. ) When you hide Under the blanket, they can take you through small open channels. Normally, at the end, the ghosts are less creepy because you know they are misunderstood or free or whatever. <br /> <br /> Second, the production is excellent. While this film has almost no special effects But full of supernatural bits while the conclusion is very good. <br /> <br /> May not be the best movie for those who think Freddy and Jason are the most scary ones. With them, they have their place), but excellent for those who have begun meeting to receive and those who do not have problems with time distortion
