When I watched this movie, I heard good stories. Coming out of it, I'm not surprised or really disappointed. Simon Pegg plays a character that is quite young like his other movies. There are a few laughs here - nothing too funny. The favorite part of this movie may be when he dances in the club scene. I have to try it completely the next time I find myself in the club. A few stars here and there, including: Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, that chicks from X-Files and Jeff Bridges. I find it very fun to see Thandie Newton's look in one scene. Previous story with Simon Pegg, Run Fatboy Run. I see it as a throw. You will enjoy it to a certain extent or find it a little boring. I might add Kirsten Dunst cute in this movie: 3
