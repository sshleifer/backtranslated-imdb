Although Stardust seems to be a fantasy movie with an average ending and projections But certainly not When I watched movies, I knew it would be one of my favorite movies and I was right. <br /> <br /> Stardust is more like a fairy tale than an adventure movie. From the beginning to the end of the movie The story is well written and makes you sit at the edge of the seat. It has some morals as well as every story. So we know in the heart that the evil brothers will not hold the throne. But innocent children who can overcome all obstacles and difficulties that he encountered during his travels We also know that the true love is Ewon, not Victoria, who is a shallow material. <br /> <br /> I have to give extra credit to Claire Dennes. She truly shines in this movie. Her eyes had a spark that matched her personality. Moreover, she and Cox have the chemistry that makes the romance in this film stand out. The remaining actors are well-known actors and actors, which of course will make Stardus an interesting movie and a high-level movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie Is a great movie, a wonderful place Was very disappointed that the film was not nominated for additional awards. I have to give at least 9/10 stars for this.
