And not because from the day "Clarissa explained everything" that I had a little interest about Melissa Joan Hart, which, while this program was popular, was good at her 20 years of age. "Sabrina the Teenage Witch" is a big leap of Hart after her "Clarissa" day, according to the comic strip Sabrina Spellman, is - you guess! - A teenage witch who tries to balance her magic with the needs of teenage life every day. She is assisted by her efforts by her two aunt and a black cat that is clever when she goes from high school to college. The heart and soul "Sabrina, Teenage Witch" is quite animated and very funny, and it's a shame that makes me spend a lot of time realizing that it's great. I hope there are new episodes that we can all enjoy. <br /> <br /> 10/10
