I love this movie First time because it is a family movie Secondly, because it offers a freshness in dealing with HIV news in families with less hysteria than what I've seen in movies Very close brothers But did not judge Their desire to protect the youngest brother is a noble thing. But do not want in the end I understand that choosing Leo to handle his treatment may not be the most popular method for people. But I believe this is the right choice for him. I can't believe that this is a French television program. It has excellent production value. I gave this movie ten stories and I think you will get as well when you see it.
