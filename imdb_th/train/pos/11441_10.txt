As a person who seeks to live as a 'professional' person with income that is supported by BS in chemistry and MS in business management, my consciousness is always rhythmic in soaking up. External art My post-graduate classes have always been emotionally and mentally supported by their interest in photography, stained glass, ceramics, metal melting / welding and art painting with silk screening. <Br /> <br /> With jogging, walking and recently hiking to remote destinations in California and neighboring states like Utah, Arizona and Nevada Jogging, walking and climbing, get close to the world with the time to stop and watch and listen and take pictures or record sounds. <br /> <br /> In the background, I was obsessed with Angry and tidal I was equally impressed with the documentary content of Andy Goldsworthy, including the skills and softness of the director / film director Thomas Riedelsheimer. I can't separate Goldsworthy's art with the camera's path. Riedelsheimer <br /> <br /> Excellent, wonderful, excellent.
