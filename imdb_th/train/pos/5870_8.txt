JACKNIFE is the adaptation of Stephen Metcalf's Strange Snow drama. (The screenplay is also written by Metcalf) directed by David Hugh Jones, who is sensitive to the senses that explores the often forgotten effects of fighting with veterans. Especially when we returned to watch this movie when we watched soldiers returning from the war in Iraq and the raw treatment they received in our veterans' hospital. <br /> <br /> Three friends Go out to Vietnam The war together and only two people come back to life: the problem is that while the two men suffered from the fight, Flannigan (Ed Harris) of David (Ed Harris) received the Severe damage from posttraumatic stress disorder Martha's sister (Kathy Baker), when David's condition deteriorates. Joseph's 'Jacknife' Megessey (Robert De Niro) returns to the city to try to help his friend. During the event, Jacknife initially proposed to Martha and eventually two days - that Prom Martha had to join - and at that time Brahma, David, drunk, drunk, gushing together, destroying relics in the school and causing the people City and students Jack Naidu makes Dave remember his time in Vietnam when they lost friends and brought David to the point where he could climb into revival. And Martha, who has suffered for so long, finds that her needs are taken care of by Jacknife. <br /> <br /> All three actors give amazing performances: Ed Harris offers one of His most perceived role, while De Niro and Baker determined by their profession Many people should resurrect all this. But movies that have been forgotten because it is a fragile reminder of the damage that our war brought to those who fought with them and the families that received them after the battle ended Highly recommended.
