Ah, true memories I lived in Holland at that time and looked forward enthusiastically every Sunday evening and Tuesday following. I saw it in the age of 14-16. Very good for me (at the time of study -). English because Dutch TV has subtitles for other languages, except for the kiddies shown today. So you will hear the voice and the original language - the best series is the first three. Then, after the third series, the great character, Nazi von Jel, the formidable enemy disappeared from the series. (I don't think they really can catch him Leaving the room for him to appear again in the next story) because it was clear that the series was distributed to Germany and the enemies of the Nazis did not go well! Terrible because Jeffrey Tone has done a great job in acting to the Nazi noble lords who constantly dominate England for revenge. It was a real pleasure to see high-quality performances in the youth series, but Ronald Leigh-Hunt was a good partner and a normal child. They believed me at that time and as a child I could imagine. Can be said to be part of these children, which at that time were older than me for about four years It was a very exciting series for me, stand out in my memory at that time as a special performance with "The Prisoner" as well. I hope they will publish good quality DVDs of the series. Which is great Even the bad copies around are still fun to watch. The following series are not good, how much water is reduced and not as fun as the first three. Hopefully they will find other series of Von Gelb that will be put on the DVD. Greetings from Canada
