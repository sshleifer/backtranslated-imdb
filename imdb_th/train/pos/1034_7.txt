I think this movie might be more powerful than the first episode debuted in 1943, but today seems to preach and remain too quiet to raise the level of greatness. This film was created in the year. Fri. 1940 - Before the United States entered the war, Paul Lukas played a serious and reliable family leader. He was a German who spent seven years fighting against the Nazis and avoiding being arrested. Betty Davis is a long-standing wife who understands and can educate and raise children without him from time to time. When the movie began, they were crossing the border from Mexico to the United States and for the first time in many years they would relax and stop running. <br /> <br /> The problem for me is that the family too. Perfect and suitable too - makes them look like clear positive propaganda instead of a true family that has to suffer with real problems. There is now a very noble goal at that time. It looks like a fake today. Especially the strange dialogue and the incredibly used script that the kids use is not louder It sounds more like a speech against fascism than the sound of a real child. They are extremely annoying results - especially those who are small, sometimes come out as children. (Although he doesn't have an accent that can be seen) <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that Ultra - the one who hears the truth is Betty Davis and the American family. Expanding her, the famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this conversation because it sounds unreal for life. This story is based on the play of his lover Lillian Hellman. And the basic concepts and plot are good ... but the conversation is not good sometimes Overall, it's an interesting Curio and a movie that has a great time ... but that's true.
