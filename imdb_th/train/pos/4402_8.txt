After seeing Jesse James Kwon Rill Jay Hunker in all of the movies in the 1950s, it was exciting to see this film in a new perspective of director Ang Lee. Lawrence, Kansas's attack scene is great. The romantic relationship between Gems and Toby McGuire became the best and Jonathan Ris-Meyers distinguished himself as a bad guy. All the time this movie makes you feel the horror of the war and the hopeless situation of the main characters who do not know whether they will survive the next hour or not. Definitely worth seeing
