Bottom line - the best romantic comedy ever This film succeeds in everything that the great movie strives for: the creation of the world and the time we want to visit again and make us happy to be a part of the human race. When I was blue, this film elevated my soul and made me laugh. (And still be true after watching many times - always fresh) <br /> <br /> Every actor is in the best style The character is dead and the characters get along well until you forget the actors. (Often difficult to do with Matthau, Robbins and Ryan). The supporting actors are consistently excellent: fried ("agae", "dwarf package included"), Jacoby & Saks & Maher (theoretical physicist All three are "Greek singer" - "But without time"), Durning ("What we can launch from NJ"), Shalhoub & Whaley (Chief and colleague of Robbins at the service station) and Curits (Eisenhower - How many The theater with Eisenhower ??) <br /> <br /> Don should not miss this hidden treasure.
