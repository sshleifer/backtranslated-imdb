This is incredible, which means it is difficult to believe that "Forgotten tribes" will make this migration surprisingly twice a year, and filmmakers Cooper and Schoedsack do not show scenes and shocks. But what they shoot! Movies under the most severe conditions are excellent and the scores of Iranian songs added to the video release make this memorable documentary more complete. <br /> <br /> I'm happy to see things. And this "Kon Tiki" on the same weekend, which is exciting and definitely makes me see how strong and strong and brave people can be, whether surviving legacy or To adventure or in the name of science.
