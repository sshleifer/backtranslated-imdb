I saw this when I was 17 and didn't see it since then. 'CBS Late Movie' is used to perform regularly. At one point I remember how sad and sad it made me feel sick Effects are not what they are today. However, it expresses the feeling of being alone in Amazon after losing both parents and finding a good solution. I remember the errors and worms the most like they actually eat her meat. It was a black film that was a contentious issue at that time, although it is possible that it would have a lot of editing for the TV. I hope I can remember more details and if I have the opportunity to see again, I can comment more. I've been searching for this for many years. I believe it may be displayed in CBS under another name. I don't know if it came out in the video or not.
