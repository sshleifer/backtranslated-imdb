Write and direct the best performance ... Woody did the best in the 2000s. If it's not the best of him since the 80s !! Hugh Jackman is the perfect choice for his film roll. Scarlett Johansson and Woody teasing how well she proved to be an actress. <br /> <br /> It's refreshing to be not in love on the screen with top women. He plays the perfect magician. <br /> <br /> There are a few opinions that make this movie terrible. Don't let them stop you from watching the movie that is created magically. People in the crowd that I agree with are laughing loudly in some lines. I miss the next line. If you like Woody Allen's movies in the 70s, you will regret it. <br /> <br /> I suggest you go and watch this movie with an open mind. If you do, you might smile.
