I joined the Camp Chesapeake, located at the head of the Chesapeake Bay on the North East River in MD. It is the same type of summer camp as the cottage. Founded by Coatesville, PA YMCA, I started as a young camper and later became a senior counselor and later Waterfront director. If the camp continues, I will do everything in power to be the camp director. Alas, the power of YMCA decided to close the camp and sell it to Maryland. I visited the old camp many years later on the boat and felt discouraged by neglecting the MD status and natural destruction by nature. The 350 acre site offers many services with all the benefits of dealing with natural offers A black man named Curtis Ford and his family are residents and trustees. Curtis is my friend and advisor. I worshiped him all Although he can't swim, he is a paddler. If I asked him where the fish was biting, he would set that point and I would have children. She is also a family camp at the end of the summer. These memories will be with me forever.
