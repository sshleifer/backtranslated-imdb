Excellent series, expertly executed and directed But no one loves (I have been told) by Mr. Diathian and withdraw from him after one presentation. Can now be viewed in private collections and through the British Film Institute on special requests Unfortunately, when Ian Holm draws an interesting picture of Bernard Samson who is tired But purposeful, excellent One of his best performances Supporting actors including Amanda Donoho, Young and Hugh Fraser are excellent. When Mel Martin played the controversial and betrayal wife and Michael Den, as Werner, the mercenary, the story had a tragic positive impact on the consequences of the game
