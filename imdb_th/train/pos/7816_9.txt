Richard Attenborough is a director with the same name as the Academy Award winner 'Gandhi'. In '83, I didn't know his other work until I just found 'Cry Freedom', which was released in 1987, while it may Will not be as popular as his Gandhi But it is a fascinating story Was released when South Africa has not eliminated the shackles of apartheid While most movies are about social problems after the incident, I guess this movie will be released at that time. <br /> <br /> The story depends on the characters and real-life events. This book is a movie written by Donald Woods. (Kevin Kline) A reporter who had worked in South Africa until the end of the seventies. It has the origins of the friendship of Woods and the charming black leader Steve Biko, which was miraculously performed by Denzel Washington. I can't imagine a better choice for this role. Washington expresses the natural charm and presence of the screen that requires Biko's character. <br /> <br /> At first, Woods resisted what he felt was a black nation spread by Biko after Found the man Is a fight and his thoughts The bond between them grew stronger and Woods and his family realized and were sensitive to the fate of the people who represented Biko. <br /> <br /> In the end, however, the tragedy strikes and Woods had to flee from the south. Africa, along with his books so that he can publish and let the outside world know what has happened In the second half of this film is a memorable story about his escape from South Africa along with his family and will put you on the path. Tenterhooks <br /> <br /> There are funny conversations, scenes between Biko and the lawyer in the courtroom are examples. <br /> <br /> Lawyer: Do you support violence? Biko: I support the confrontation. Lawyers: Well, that violence isn't it? Biko: No, you and I are facing each other. But I do not see any violence. <br /> <br /> However, there are moments that take you back to the horrors that spread throughout the country before getting better. The scene in which the army opened the protest by schoolchildren is to bite their hands and heartbreak. <br /> <br /> This is a must-see thing. I would like to introduce people who are not familiar with Attenborough's work. Try spending time with it. There are many movies that make money. And have movies that make it live I will like the other day
