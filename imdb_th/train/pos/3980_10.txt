I watched this story every night in VH1 last week. This is a wonderful picture of the epidemic of drugs and how to show drugs in the media in the late 60s and 70s. Woodstock Easy Rider, The Beatles, Death of Morrison, Hendrix, Joplin are all here. Vh1 has drawn a completely complex picture of life and time during the "Year of Medicine" from the San Francisco Bay Area to Studio 54. This documentary shows the evolution and progress of Drug business and Death and new life that breathed into American culture from marijuana to LSD to cocaine. This documentary shows how drugs travel into the country. The hippie movement, conservative resistance and the way that drugs affect art (Music, movies, etc.) There are interesting interviews and many news video clips. <br /> <br /> Drug movies: The Trip Easy Rider Up In The Smoke Reefer Madness Blow Boogie Nights
