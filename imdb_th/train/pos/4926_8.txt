Elia Kazan, one of the best drama directors in this country, has shown that he is at home with movies equally. "Panic in the Streets" Mr. Kazan gave the first version of what would happen later with perhaps the result. His masterpiece "On the Waterfront", although both films only share the water scene. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kazan shot in New Orleans. The adaptation by Daniel Fuchs of Edna and Edward Anhalt, which is the basis of the film, is unique in bringing us to a place where travelers do not dare to see when visiting "The Big Easy", one of the great works. The film is a beautiful black and white film by Joseph McDonald that shows that New Orleans is the best. The music of Alfred Newman and Billie Holiday's music makes the prosecution well. <br /> <br /> This movie may be filmed in New York or other northern cities because It presents a character that speaks like "broklynese" rather than the southern accent that may be heard in that part of the country. <br /> <br /> One thing that is clear in the movie Jack Palance makes his screen open. He was serious. Eat! At the same time, this strong man showed his gentle side when he met his sick partner who was unaware of him, seriously ill with the disease. Blackie comforted this man, smiling his wet face and holding his hand through the greasy hair of a man who was dying and abandoned. It is worth noting that the fact that Mr. Palance and Mr. Mostel seem to be doing their own stunts, which is refreshing because both actors make it look real. <br /> <br /> This film also brings Also offer the normal side The introduction of the reed family at the beginning of the movie We saw the family painting the furniture with his young son. Later, he and his wife talked about how they could not earn money with some things that many families had to do on a daily basis. Richard Widmark, playing as a normal person, was not as effective as this actor playing a witty person. And more concentrated Barbara Bel Gedes, as a wife, seems as if she is a suburban woman from Connecticut. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun, thanks to the direction of Mr. Kazan and the actor. Wonderful in this movie
