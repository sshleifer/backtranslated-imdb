According to "Kingdom" is more scary and brutal than before. I see only half (I'm exhausted and can't sit for 5 1/2 hours) but I like what I see. Blood ghosts, poisonous murders, mutant babies, voodoo ... it's all there! If you have a strong belly and like a strange movie for you, <br /> <br /> You don't need to see episode 1 to understand this ... You will understand! > <br /> Does anyone know whether Kingdom 1 and 2 are available on DVD? Sitting to watch a movie in a theater is a tedious matter. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there may not be "Kingdom 3" - Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (Sig) died a year after filming. But you never know!
