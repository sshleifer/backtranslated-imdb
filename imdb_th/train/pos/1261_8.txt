I really like this movie. All three stars (Connery, Fishburn and Underwood) give credible performances and Harris is the most fun actor. Light and angles in some scenes of Harris make his face look truly cruel. The surprising turning point at the end made it interesting. Not a great movie But it's a fun movie. I gave 7 out of 10
