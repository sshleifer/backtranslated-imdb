This movie is ridiculous! That is what I like about "Guilty Pleasure". This piece is easy to condemn. This film does not include Pat Priest and Butch Patrick, Marilyn and Eddie, but the traditional year and math Pat the priest and Butch Patrick have flourished for a long time! When doing so with young stars Yvonne de Carlo, who plays Lily again, pushes Big 6-0 (although she looks good and is still "Lily" perfect) <br /> <br /> It's Shame that Yvonne De Carlo didn't get the most. Even so, it's good to see Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis in the role that made them famous! During the 2 seasons that THE MUNSTERS was in prime time, it was the chemistry of Gwynne / Lewis that made the series successful. The rest of the actors support the cast members, not to say that they don't want them! The TV series won't survive as long as they don't exist. When choosing between Butch Patrick or Happy Derman (the original "Eddie"), that option is too easy. Yvonne de Carlo is a better choice than Joanna Marshall. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is not measured according to the original series. But still has a better size than the boob tube in the late 1970s / early 1980s. <br /> <br /> '
