This is a great horror movie that fans of indie movies will really appreciate. It has good performances, a lot of blood and a good plot. One will be warned by movies such as The Hills Have Eyes and Pumpkinhead. Clearly, the budget isn't a big deal. But this movie was created with the atmosphere and strong performance of the actors, which seems to be lacking in movies that present many large effects. This movie moves in a great direction and the camera works well. There are no wasted scenes, so the length of the film is quite short. In addition, it seems that the ending will open the sequel to the sequel, which is very interesting as well. So pick up some popcorn, turn off the lights and enjoy this one.
