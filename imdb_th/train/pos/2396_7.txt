This is a very entertaining film that follows the practice of NY production of Macbeth, although there are many things to say about the power, jealousy and ambition (Macbeth's theme) in our modern world. This film works best when it is not too serious. Famous actors like John Glover, Gloria Reubens and David Lansbury perform well in the main role. But the highlight for me is the hilarious scene that "murder" of Banquo (John Elsen) was rehearsed. It may be more entertaining movies for those involved in the theater. But anyone who likes Shakespeare should enjoy this movie.
