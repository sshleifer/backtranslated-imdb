Viggo Mortensen is the new inmate of the haunted prison that the jailer (Played well by Lane Smith) There is a gruesome secret that may be the reason why many prisoners and prisoners in prison are killed by supernatural appearances. Lincoln Kilpatrick is a living person who knows the secret and fear of his life. When I think of the prison movie, I tend to think of action movies starring Stallone or Van Damme or a highly capable drama such as Shawshank Redemption or The Green Mile. Of the Sorcerer III, however, the prison is an atmospheric effort, and of course it is still the best movie in Renny Harlin's career. Best Actor at the (then) Lane Smith come off best because of his jailer's not a clich√© terrible. But quite nervous and jerky, which adds credibility to movies that exceed expectations. <br /> <br /> *** from 4 (good)
