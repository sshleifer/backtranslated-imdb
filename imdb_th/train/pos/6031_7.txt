About two hundred members of the Cleveland, Ohio, USA movie society named Cinematheque August 19, 2000 gathered to see Michelangelo Antonioni's ancient Cinemascope movie in the 1970 film "Zabriskie Point" Cinematheque. Received the best print results for his series. Share with the audience in advance that this print is flying from Italy specially for this event. <br /> <br /> The audience is organized. The film is a psychedelic artist was spread out on the large panorama. Watching this great print shows Antonioni's intention to realize that this is a modern art. It is more appropriate in this series in the Cleveland Insititue of Art in University Circle. <br /> <br /> The composition of Antonioni was created for the Cinemascope landscape, beautiful image balance, use. The outstanding color, movement, all-choreography are all works of real artists using the screen as a canvas. <br /> <br /> Finally, the audience can understand "Zabriskie Point" when its lectures spread. Go out for it Keep clear that this is not about the story. But is an impressionist drawing of the artist in the story of a fleeting image The setting of more turbulent activity during the sixties is just an amazing mechanism for the collage of artists. <br /> <br /> Antonioni is not bound by general narrative standards and can pause when To create any event that is created with great flavor The audience is willing to go with the flow of his amazing imagination while his large image on the enormous canvas is meticulously arranged. While the audience may be involved in the character's relationship But I can see that the theme here is humanity. <br /> <br /> In addition, I realized that there are no smaller or lower-quality prints in Cinemascope that can be displayed fairly. The audience therefore admired the "Zabriskie Point" in all of the amazing traditional styles and broke into the thunderous applause at the end.
