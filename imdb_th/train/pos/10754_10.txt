I am a little skeptic if I should see this when it first appeared in CBS. I am one of many people who are in New York. On that day I will go to school at Hunter College. I don't want to see deviations and killings again. But like many people, I want to know what this is. Tears came to my eyes. Watch this documentary. All my memories come back and just an incredibly intense image. I bought a DVD on the one year anniversary and watched it a few times. How can these people capture this video incredibly? If you haven't seen this documentary, do something you like and check. Obviously it was depressing and tears. But it is an incredible document of this darkest country
