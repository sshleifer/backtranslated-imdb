Another great film from a country that has been enslaved by the fundamentalist regime for decades has no problem creating a passionate subject. Panahi uses this different approach with a mix of comedians. Ironically and non-professional actors While still receiving his message of what he saw as an innocent offense in his country, he did so without having a heavy story. It is good for the country, especially the population of the country in which the Iranian population is extremely desirable. The greatest pity is that it will not be released in the country. The isolated and paranoid Iranian government insists that this great filmmaker succeeds abroad because he is part of a global conspiracy to shame them. After growing up in the midst of the revolution and watching the scholars, artists and education 'disappear' in the last 25 years, he has demonstrated the great courage to continue his work there. The realism that can be achieved through the shooting of the World Cup qualifiers will lead you to the competition. The fact that he was filming in 35mm was as amazing as possible using digital format only. It looks great His confirmation of the use of non-professional actors worked well in this film. Good performances all around After watching many films showing the problems that Iran has and the news media reporting the fact that we can destroy people and governments This film does the opposite. It shows us that they still love the same thing by laughing at themselves and the rules of Islamic law that are ridiculous, which may be a change for the better. Not too far away. Some people call Panahi as a female filmmaker. Popular But I think he just fought for the most oppressed people in Iran. Independent girl
