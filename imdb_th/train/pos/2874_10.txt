Cinderella is a beautiful woman who has been brutally treated by her stepmother and evil guardian. One day, the ball will be held in honor of the Prince. But Cinderella had no chance to go because the stepmother and caretaker didn't allow her. With the help of her godmother and her animal friends, she went out to find the ball and warned him to go home at midnight. She meets a charming young man like Prince. At midnight, she runs home, leaving her shoes behind. With the help of her animal friends, reveal her true identity. After that, she and the prince were married and they lived happily afterwards. <br /> <br /> Cinderella, which was launched 56 years ago, was very successful. It has a well written script. Memorable characters, songs, including "Dream is your heart, make", "So This Is Love" and "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo". Great. Tell the story. This is my favorite movie that grew up and it didn't lose any charm. A true Disney masterpiece! Introducing 10/10 P. The latest DVD release is the best way to appreciate this film, including deleted scene sets, music videos, antique radio programs, and restored movie prints!
