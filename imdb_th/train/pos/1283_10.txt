This film revolves around a man who believes that all forms of media are obsolete. The idea behind his art project is to expose the ridiculous culture that we bathe naturally. This film takes place in Los Angeles / Orange County. He attacked, stood up to cartoons (caw, caw, caw), rock bands, models, Hollywood blockbuster movies, and exposed to many other media. He eventually found himself in the eyes of the weapon he had. move This movie is five years old and is more realistic every day. It is the best explanation of the anger behind the punk I've seen. It is also one of my top 10 movies.
