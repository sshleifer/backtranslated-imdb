"The Lion King" There is no doubt that my favorite Disney movie is forever, so I think maybe I should give the opportunity to the next sector. Lion King 1 1/2 is quite good and has both laughs and fun with Timon and Pumba The only problem I feel is that sometimes do not want an explanation because they can create a plot hole and just feel like wanting your own explanation. I would like to recommend this movie for Lion King fans or just the same night as the family. It's fun, flicking with laughter and cute characters like the first one. So hopefully I will be the same as the third part of the Lion King series. Lean back and think only Hakuna Matata! Do not worry! <br /> <br /> 8/10
