Abe Lincoln's early career has been beautifully presented by Ford. Not that everyone who lives can see the real image of Lincoln. But Fonda wearing a fake nose is a strange thing, like Lincoln, with sounds, transmission, walking and other expressions. Ford, in the first three consecutive films he made with Fonda, was at the top of his body. The story focuses on a couple accused of murder, which Lincoln defends and the trial scene is quite good. Supporting actors include Ford's regulars. This is Alice Brady's last film since she died several months after being released.
