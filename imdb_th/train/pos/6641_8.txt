On December 28, 1895, at the Grand Cafe in Paris, the film history was written, while Louis Lumir showed his short film every match to the paid audience 'La Sortie des Usines Lumière. 'It's the first movie to play, and I hope I will be there, not only to watch movies, but also the audience's reactions. <br /> <br /> We started by closing the doors of Lumière factory Obviously, since the picture looks like a photo, people think they are going to watch the slideshow, not what they hoped. But then the door opened and people poured out and headed home. First, many women, some men and a man on a bicycle and a big dog When they were outside the door again, <br /> <br /> whether it was the first movie or not (some say 'L'Arrivée d'un Train à la Ciotat' is the first movie recorded Lumière) It is an impressive first movie. Being bored with this is not possible for many reasons. The reason is simple: it is only fifty seconds long. But for those who like special effects movies, there must be something interesting. You don't see things like this every day.
