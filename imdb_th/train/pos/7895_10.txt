In the opening scene of this movie, a man shot an arrow through his room into another man's bathroom and threw out all the fire. This should be very important for 1936, but quite far away and not related to the film. Robin Hood didn't appear as much as I saw. However, Betty Davis (Daisey Appleby), "The Whales of August", '87 is a child and is very attractive and plays one of her best roles in a long career in Hollywood. Daisey never stopped teasing or being very sexy with her pajamas and calling a swimsuit on her yacht with George Brent. (Johnny Jones) "Spiral Staircase", '46 Dise also proposed marriage to Johnny in the Ferris wheel, upside down and even with black eyes. Davis and Brent created a great pair, probably very rich, and the other one is a very poor journalist. Outside the stage, Davis and Brent have a passionate love story, which is a good reason why there is a spark when both appear in this film. If you like Bette Davis and George Brent, this is the movie for you. !
