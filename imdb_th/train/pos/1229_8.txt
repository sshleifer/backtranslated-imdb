I waited a long time before seeing this because all the reviews I read said it was terrible! I rent it, hoping to be the worst, and while it's the best Sandler movie there is hardly any. Sandler often spoke to the camera and the movie wasn't serious about himself. But that's part of the fun! A great way to waste time in the afternoon and you may find yourself laughing twice! Good movies worth renting!
