At first, you think that another Disney movie might be good. But it is a movie for children But when you watch, you can't help But enjoy it All ages will love this movie. I saw this movie for the first time when I was 10 years old and now 8 years later, I still love Danny Glover. It's great and can't play better Christopher Lloyd is cheerful and suitable for this chapter. Tony Dasa has the same belief as Mel Clark. You can't help But enjoy this movie! I let it be 10/10!
