Emily Watson's Natalia is the most lovable and romantic lead character I've ever seen on the screen. She is undoubtedly the queen of this movie. Or is she sent to the king? Weaving in chess and family battles to control power and victory is amazing. Like a chess expert in this film, the director is playing many games simultaneously with our thoughts at the same time. The period of the costume and imagination of the Italian lake in the early 20th century was captured beautifully. It's not the only square space that is lost. <br /> <br /> Many beautiful scenes. I can't tell them all. I recommend spending enough time to watch this movie twice, maybe one week apart, because you can't capture all the poems within the 64 square meter frame, but with many dimensions in one setting. <br /> < br /> I didn't read Nabakov's book, but to try to compare it with my own, what I was reading reminded me of another successful poem in Barry Levinson's The Natural. The end of the book is the death of Bernard Corona Mohamud entirely in terms of romantic impressionist Zionists are uniquely American. The director did that better by seamlessly combining the morals and traditions of Russia and Italy to be the backdrop for enlightenment. The real story here is that the game has no sum. There are winners and losers, unless both contestants catch each other. But in life and especially in the context of our immortal souls, we are restricted by those limitations and the meetings of life as much as we let others destroy our spirits. <br /> <br /> Love that Innocent by Natily Natalia, who embodied Emily Watson's ability to transcend and allow all of us to be updated with gifts at the same time. There are only obstacles created by our fears that can cut us out of this story. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful movie. (10/10)
