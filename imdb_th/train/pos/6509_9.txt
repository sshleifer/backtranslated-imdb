I can't believe the comments on this list! Performing as a genius! Of course, it doesn't follow the effort and truth. But we are consumers who want the same things as us. We shouldn't have the option to sit back and enjoy new things for a period. The style is not as realistic as the previous "Scooby Doo", but it shouldn't be. The show is called "Shaggy and Scooby Doo Get Clues". Which part of the title indicates that the beloved actors of other translations will participate in the action continuously? And nowhere to say that they want to solve puzzles and they can't stand with monsters. Why are they? I am really glad that they put up a long voting point that worked in the Scooby-Doo program. They are still playing clumsy, high-clumsy, fast-changing sets in the chase scenes, standard gag halls, and even Scooby Doo In fact, I'm glad this item is out there because I love it. I'm glad they got rid of the rest of the team for a while and focused on only two main characters and villains. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's ridiculous. It should be! Of course it's different, it should be It should make you laugh at the villain and encourage the stupid robot butler to defeat every nasty animal, regardless of size. You should get a joke "Roobi-Roo" that works. All of this is just a good combination. There is not the only thing I can think of wrong with it. Writing, acting, animation, rank first. All the title songs are excellent. (My computer plays "GET A CLUE!" When booting up) and background music is interesting.
