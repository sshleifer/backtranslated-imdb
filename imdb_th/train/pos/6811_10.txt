Although in general I do not like remakes that believe that remakes wasted time, this movie is an exception. I don't really know until before reading the previous comment that this is a reuse. So my opinion is about the real movie and not the comparison. <br /> <br /> Stories and ways of writing. Ie Capote does not need additional words. <br /> <br /> The play of Anthony Edwards and Eric Roberts is great. I saw some movies with them, each one being the same thing. I'm sure they are good actors and in the case of Eric, I often wonder why his sister is the # 1 star, not her brother. This time, this confidence has increased to reality. There is no question. His play, like Mr. Edwards's play, is the most obvious in their career. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to be ranked in the top 50 of your movie.
