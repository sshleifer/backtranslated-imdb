There are some that I hesitate about what this movie offers. For starting the casting, it doesn't seem correct. Kiefer Sutherland performed very well in "24" and the preview did not offer anything challenging for him or the audience. <br /> <br /> When the movie finally ended, I was completely dissatisfied. Responsible parties receive a little more care to see the narrative gap and receive a little more character development. We have seen this type of threat before and that makes the main conflict challenge more writers. As an audience, we do not want to sit old stories again. We want to see different things, excited and fun. <br /> <br /> There's nothing wrong with casting. From the first lady of Kim Basinger, delicious. She held herself with grace and sexual attraction enough to make this chapter memorable. Michael Douglas had done it before Unfortunately, the president is an organization that does not have a stake, even with his fate. Sutherland offers him a difficult approach to "24" that is powerful enough to make it big enough for large screens and Eva to work well. As a newcomer, <br /> <br /> Don't expect a lot of twists and fireworks. Is a partially established classic ("North by Northwest" and "Fugitive" comes to mind). Let your expectations go out and enjoy riding on what it might be okay.
