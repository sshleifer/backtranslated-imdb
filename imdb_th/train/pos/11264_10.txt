This is one of the most fun and informative programs I've ever seen. This is a must see for anyone who is over 16 years old. This show has me and my 2 boys laughing loudly from the beginning. I do not know whether everything in the show is true or not. But there is little doubt that Mr Wuhl not only has knowledge But he still has a bomb that presents this information to children. If Mr Wuhl decides to do this again, they will have to rent a Georgia Dome building for everyone who wants to see it. I agree with the idea of ​​creating the HBO series. It will have an amazing track.
