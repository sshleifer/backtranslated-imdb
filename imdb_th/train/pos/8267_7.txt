Brown of Harvard is a movie that is hard to pin down. We expect more from our movies today, so it helps to remember that the 20s of the audience were a little more innocent. William Haines had a charm like a gangster who had to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and even Even glory All the relationships in the movie felt arrogant, except for a very homoerotic relationship between Billy and Jack Pickford, a weak city. This film has everything: love, tears, love, death, and even sports ... It is a great study of social change in the 20th century.
