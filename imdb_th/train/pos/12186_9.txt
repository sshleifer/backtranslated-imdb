It's not a great movie as many people believe. (Including my aunt who said it was her favorite movie) but because of the better part of this movie, Noir, especially the last scene with the famous "Fun House" THE LADY from Shanghai received The position is more important than the true value which is the key to the legend of Orson Welles' failure. <br /> <br /> In 1946, the position of Wales as a Hollywood figure together CITIZEN KANE is not recognized as a great movie that had been seen because it was attacked by Hearst Media and Hollywood insiders. Wells' efforts in total control (Directions and production and performances) His films seem to threaten the entire system. His best work at this time was Edward Rochester in the JANE EYRE, which was shot by Robert Stevenson, but actually filmed in a wide range. (With Stevenson's blessing) by Welles, but the credit to Stevenson is only THE STRANGER. The movie benefits from post-war interests in escaping the Nazi war criminals making a profit. For five years in Hollywood, it was almost no good record. <br /> <br /> Wells returned to Broadway in 1946, hoping to be able to bring the important talents of He returned by creating around the world in 80 days, but even helping Mike Todd and Cole Porter to score the music failed. His failure occurred at the same time that his wife Rita was based on her description of Gilda. Therefore, marriage also occurs on rocks as well. <br /> <br /> Wales must make money. - His Broadway production led to his personal bankruptcy. He sold the interest in the possible film rights to AROUND THE WORLD for Todd (which he eventually regretted) and he sold the movie's ideas about the career of Henri Desire Landru to Charlie Chaplin. Which should be (and become a MONSIEUR VERDOUX) <br /> <br /> The story takes place at Welles with a worrying $ 10,000,000 tax bill called Cohn and offers to make movies with Rita to pay. Money Cohn is willing to do that. But naturally asked what the movie was It's a clever question. Wells is on a paid phone in New York in a pharmacy with a book department. He grabbed a book called THE LADY from SHANGHAI and said it was a great thriller. Well, Wales is convinced that the usual wise Welsh Cohn knows what he is talking about. Cohn said he wants to check the rights and send money to pay $ 10,000 for Welles after Cohn calls the Welles to buy the book and read it - And found it really terrible He spends time writing, treatment and screenplay to create Elita Bannister's character Rita. <br /> <br /> Of course, it has developed a strange story. Michael O'Hara is a crew / laborer. He helps Elsaban. Nister, when it was clear that she was attacked by gangsters in a park in San Francisco, Elsa married Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloan), a very famous disability criminal lawyer. She convinces him to hire Michael as the yacht captain. This cruise also includes George Grisby (Glenn Anders), a terrifying partner of Bannister and Sidney Broome (Ted De Corsia), who became the detective Bannister hired to see Elsa when they could Michael and Elsa try to find Time together, but Broome or Grisby shows up. <br /> <br /> Grisby makes Michael propose - he wants (for reasons linked to the so-called fatalistic view of modern society) to move out of it. Die As Grisby (The plot became dull here) He was able to keep his life insurance. (Even if he died?) And use it to escape to the South Sea He will pay Michael $ 10,000.00 if he pretends to shoot Grisby. Which includes the signing of documents that actually accept murder (Michael does not know that such admission will help eliminate the need to create a corpse if other evidence shows that Grisby should die) < br /> <br /> Of course, Grisby was killed and Michael was arrested on that charge and to kill Broome. (Michael's gun shot) Michael tries with Bannister to protect him and discovers that the latter is working second because he wants him to be convicted as Michael. Michael believes that Bannister is the real killer and tries to escape before the jury decides. He was knocked out and placed at a deserted event, and this led to the famous "fun house" sequence and movie summary. <br /> <br /> It's a very confusing movie. (As I've commented). That doesn't mean it's not worth seeing - it's impressive. Witnessed a fight between Michael and the police in the courtroom, where the judge, who knocked him into the judge's bookcase, made the glass broken. Or using clever photography to capture Hayworth's dive from a rock reflecting on Grisby's gloomy binoculars. <br /> <br /> The performance is quite good, especially Sloan. (Probably the best screenplay of the actor) Glenn Anders is a leading Broadway actor. He rarely created movies before THE LADY from SHANGHAI and his slim and grisby is memorable. Ted Corsia also performed well with Detective Detective Broome looking for his own interest at his own price. <br /> <br /> For Hayworth, she turned to show at Unlike what she liked the most, she had done before (blood and sand, tales of Manhattan and strawberry blonde are exceptions) and is a memorable siren. Welles's Hara A very strange drama for a cute male actor. But innocent, who learns the hard way to not believe in what he secretly wants to believe. It's not KANE, AMBERSOMS, OTHELLO, TOUCH OF EVIL or CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT. But it's a good movie for all things.
