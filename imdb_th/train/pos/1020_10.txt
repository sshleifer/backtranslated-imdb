"Stargate SG-1" follows the team's space exploration, named SG-1, through a device called Stargate and a surprise waiting on the other side of the worm. <br /> <br /> See this set for a period. It was the first few seasons when it first came out. I don't know how good this series is. 10 years after I watched the last episode. My old impression is that the dress is great. But my impression is far from the truth. "Stargate SG-1" is more than a simple sci-fi series. It is one of the most well-made, interesting, long-running and exciting sci-fi ever produced. Come and why? Because it works on an amazing place. <br /> <br /> This set is far more than the film is based on, and I think it's a very good example that television is a medium for places. appropriate Can give something that is not compatible with the movie's time limit The feeling of familiarity created by the series that takes a long time, watching the characters and their situation are progressing over time is a remarkable thing and increases the ability to suppress unbelief and it is The result of an excellent writing performance. <br /> <br /> "Stargate SG-1" continues to present great adventures throughout the past 10 years, but has never feared the challenge of moving. Move the plot and give it Thi for a very different time of acting: <br /> <br /> - The first few seasons may be the 4th / 5th sequence, which focuses on exploring the planets and many different situations. Various episodes are not fairly related, if not for the threat. Goaul'd is going to happen. <br /> <br /> - From the 5th to the 7th, there is a focus on fighting against Goaul and preventing Attack on this planet After this season, planetary exploration is just an excuse for putting SG-1 in the place of Goaul'd / replicator / ori conflict. <br /> <br /> - Season 8 seems to be the most mixed season. It has a stream of episodes, including stories of the sub-world, which Gates rarely mentioned even the last episode will have a wonderful simulation time. <br /> <br /> - The 9th and 10th trips Because they have a new enemy as well and no Jack O'Neil, they are both good continents, although the first episode of season 10 is a little weak because it looks like they have more than SG-1 and humans. / Jaffa lost Fight after fighting with Ori. <br /> <br In general, after the 7th season, the survey was pushed to the background, where there are many ways to be ashamed because of the potential and mystery of each planet (episode) presented; On the other hand, it was made for many wonderful episodes of the ongoing conflict, which changed the nature of the program, still working and showing that the great and brave writer <br /> <br /> Even strong, with a high quality endpoint that is well placed. The feeling I have is that it can go on. People involved But being a great professional and many lectures are available The past season that returned to the beginning of the series is very possible and will be most welcome. But in the end, things were like that. <br /> <br /> In the end, because I enjoy everything It's a little difficult to find out that it's over. However, the big picture drawn by the work of hundreds of people over a 10-year period is a beautiful picture and a testament to the dedication of the outstanding actors and characters we will always remember. As a group using the name of SG-1
