Dumland focuses on the life of one family (American?) ... Father; Violent and obscene people who love farting and use profanity and those who do not have the mother's redemption feature; Those who appear to be psychotic, paranoid, do not speak much. Son; Annoying little friends Animation is simple and rough. But with stories and characters The first part is only available from the website. davidlynch.com But now released on DVD, the DVD has 8 episodes and a brief summary: <br /> <br /> 1- Neighbors: We meet the next door neighbor and find three things about him ... He has Really good He has one arm and he likes to do naughty things with ducks. <br /> <br /> 2- Running track: We find that the wife has a good relationship with exercise. But the husband doesn't think it will be good idea. Finally, jogging is a victory. <br /> <br /> 3 - Doctor: Father has an unfortunate accident by using a fresh line. Touch ... The medical examination is quite detailed. (If not official) The diagnosis is "You are a completely normal person" (but we know that) <br /> <br /> 4- Friends visit: After quarreling with new clothes, friends come to visit. (Believe it or not, he has one, but after we meet him, we can understand why). Not surprised when he tells us what his hobby is. <br /> <br /> 5- Get Stick: We meet with neighbors. The other person was stuck in his mouth (although we didn't know how it got there). Unfortunately, putting his staff out of his neighbor's mouth ended with heavy weight. (And more severe) than expected ... but he was finally victorious ... Some Jesus may be ungrateful !!! <br /> <br /> 6- My teeth are bleeding: this is When I like it ... and it's the most boring and annoying thing. (Hmm, what I said about myself?) Not sure why the son's teeth started bleeding. But believe me when I say it is the story of a little story Which is a poetic form because the story does not have a plot But there is a funny ending (Relating to flies) !! <br /> <br /> 7- Uncle Bob: After finding Uncle Bob and his wife Uncle Bob, we get a different feeling at Gene Damland's swimming pool. That is very shallow. Uncle Bob is a sick friend. (I didn't do it thoroughly, fearing that I would do it for you) Uncle Bob's wife wore pants in his family. Of course ... and the father ended up in her fist. (And spend the rest of their time visiting a tree in the backyard) <br /> <br >> 8 ants: After the house is infiltrated by ants and the wrong attempt to spray them Went wrong ... he ended up spraying the bug on his face and began to scare The ant shows great music and dancing ... He tries to kill them madly, full body ... and just saying that the ants have finally taken revenge. <br /> Not as good as the story. These are some things that make me watch them. They give more insight into the minds of one of my favorite directors, David Lynch. Maybe they are the solution for him to get rid of his violent thoughts? Actually, I laughed out loud in many parts. Many aspects are ridiculous. Jokes !!
