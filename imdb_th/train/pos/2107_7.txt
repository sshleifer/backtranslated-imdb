I just bought this movie with other LaserDiscs from eBay. I normally go to war and action movies. But sometimes I like romantic comedies. <br /> <br /> If you're bored with the special FX movies today and the most romantic comedy. The drama is very appropriate. Nothing fake or pretentious about them. For example, Mr. Matuschek: When he found that his wife was cheating on him with one of his employees, he tried to shoot himself. Not just because of shame But because he was unfair to Stewart's role (OK, a surprise example) <br /> <br /> Yes, the focus of the movie is narrow and predictable. But still, I like it a lot. If you like Notting Hill, you'll like the nearby stores. In fact, Hugh Grant reminds me of Jimmy Stewart.
