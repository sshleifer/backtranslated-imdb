I think it takes a lot of courage for you to come forward like that. It's a shame that when celebrities endure suffering, that's what helps the most people. But in her case, what she did was amazing. I've been in the mental health community for five years and I think it's a good thing that mental illness is no longer scary and I believe she helps. I always thought that she was excellent and willing I'm glad she wrote this book and this movie was created. She is an amazing woman and I hope she will continue to act. She passed a lot and faced it. I like to see her work with more children, especially child actors. Her pain should not have happened and I think she would be great as a young advisor. This film made me feel very impressed, tortured TBI, which brought my attacks and plot. It was good to know that someone had the courage to show her life as she I believe it helps this country and people in general realize that there are others like them and have help. Thank you, Ms. Duke or Anna, who you like.
