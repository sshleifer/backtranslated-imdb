Reign over me (Titled after the song) is a movie that is sure to bring tears to almost everyone. It was a moving story of a man (Sandler) who lost his family in an attack on a world shopping center 9-11. Years later he ran into a roommate in an old college (Cheadle) at He didn't even know much because of the stress that occurred after losing his family. The two have returned to their old friends again and Cheadle's character, Johnson, realizes that he has to get some of the characters of Fandler Sanders before helping him. Too late <br /> <br /> Time. It's worth watching and after seeing it, I'm sure the audience will appreciate his or her family more.
