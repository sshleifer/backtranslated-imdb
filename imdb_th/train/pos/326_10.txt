"Jag är nyfiken ?? Yellow" is very fun. Like other critics at least once, I laugh out loud many times. Yellow is energetic, energetic. Don't expect Bergman here. This film is about young people in the early to mid-60s in Sweden and about various issues. Read * Conflicts * that countries and the world are facing. Sometimes, yellow seems to be a serious social-political documentary about Lena, the main character and others, interviewing both general people and politicians (such as Olaf Palme at home). At other times, yellow seems to mock this documentary. Throughout his time, Yellowfin served as a personal documentary in exploring Lena's life - her home life, her love of political views, her own views. Are you perfect? Complicated, defective, conflict, happy, sad, curious And putting it above these things is a wonderful additional dimension of director Sjöman and his team, recording himself as a Lena document. This is something for me to really yellow wings, not only will they appear at the time That is funny and in some sudden aspects only remind the audience that this is a fiction and a trick They are shooting themselves. Do I think of the Bjork music video with the same quality? Music video about creating a music video, ad infinitum. Each repetition will be more strange and comic. I think Sjöman may have something similar in mind, while "Jag är nyfiken ?? Yellow" may not be everyone's cup of tea. But it is a wise, witty, refreshing, refreshing, antipyretic and genuine
