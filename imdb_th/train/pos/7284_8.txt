When I was young I watched a lot of movies. My parents used all their wisdom to rent this one. I'm careful what this movie actually is. I'm not allowed to watch. Of course, my brother and sister and this thing made me very angry. And what do I do? Late at night, I left the VCR to the trash! Kick the TV screen and call the police and report the pornography I was arrested. Of course, I couldn't get out of the TV before the police arrived. I received only a strict talk and sent home. My parents grounded me, of course, and made me work to pay off debt for TVs and VCRs. This caused me to break down, slave labor sucked me to really believe, but I had to do so all over the house. What happened in the ending? We have a large screen TV, DVD player and surround sound system for my work. How do I get paid? Easy. I created a movie by myself and sold it to Disney! Do you remember finding Neno? I wrote that movie and took my goldfish in their aquarium! They write the plot of the course and do it on CGI because they are unable to make it an action movie in real life like I did! In the end, I never saw the movie "The Head" that was not dead and the rating I gave was my life! It can do quite well!
