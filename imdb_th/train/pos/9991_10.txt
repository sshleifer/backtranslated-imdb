I think this movie is crazy. I've watched it many times Mel Brooks is excellent. The actors were great .. I didn't understand that the film received 2 out of 5 points. I liked it .. I used to watch his other movies and they were funny But this story stuck in my heart because of humor .. He just didn't talk about this enough. I look for it to be periodic. But never enough for me People who play homeless people compare to the most fun standards as well. Please make this movie more often. I can't see it enough .. Lee Ann Warren is another favorite of mine since Cinderella. I always thought that she wasn't really funny. But love her performance In this movie, she was very funny .. and she and Mel did a great job together. They should add their movies to the TV more.
