German private TV is famous for copying Dutch and? Naturally ?? US style, in the case of Edel & Starck, making Xerox can only be basic: Screwball <br /> <br /> You are not able to act funny like a ball. Don't look at Edel & Starck seriously. If you expect this drama to be similar to Law & Order or something like that, go somewhere else (or see Law & Order because it's great in what it's doing. E&S is a joke, often talking about themes that stimulate thought, funny, romantic, funny, funny and witty. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I'm quite disappointed. Offer better after the last series And my cynical nature needs to adjust myself again: the production of German private television programs The Germans will understand what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> Speak briefly: Look, I'm not a misunderstanding of how English is coordinated. But hey, it's worth it to learn German just to see them four seasons. End up fooling with total happiness
