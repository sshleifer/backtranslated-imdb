Should this be an American movie? I'll give you a score. 7: We've seen it before. Being an Argentinian film and being myself in Argentina, I want 10 because it's the quality I expect more than I expected. Amazing quality, amazing, due to all the limitations imposed by the third world ... <br /> <br /> I can't forget the scene when Díaz forces Silverstein's fiance to confess - you know what I mean if You see the movie. I think that is the important moment of the movie. Not surprising. But it is original That is when the real action begins. <br /> <br /> Before watching the movie, I always try to gather information before this. As a mainstream commercial entertainment, I press "Play" and suspend reality and logic. I will tell you the best conditions to enjoy movies like this. It is impossible to talk about the possibility of the whole plot. But can believe in one way For me, I can't stop laughing at all of the jokes and comments - "sos malo" ("You mean") ... Put on the mouth of the greatest Díaz. <br /> <br /> I'm quite bored at Will watch the movie "Designed for" Peretti. I know he's a great actor. But sometimes I feel that his role makes other people indignant about the role of Luis Luque. In this case, I don't like TV shows in Argentina so much, so I didn't see many works from Luque, but it's clear that he's an actor. Excellent His physical role staring at his attitude in this film made me fall in love with his performance. I think his role should have an upgrade just to show him how good he is! <br /> <br /> I don't know if Szifrón is planning to build a sequel or not. I know that he will not do it if according to the rules that "The second part is never good." So if he did it I would definitely go and see it. And I hope that in the future will take into account the possibility of giving Peretti's partner the opportunity to develop their roles. <br /> <br /> Great movies, great performances and lots of laughter!
