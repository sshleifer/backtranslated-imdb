The best Blaise Modesty movie I've ever seen. It's a good pilot for TV series. I still think it is a little "cult", such as the touch of Quentin Tarantino's magic or something. They catch Modesty's character well, but I admit that I lost a bit from Willy Garwin. Although I read many comics and books from Peter O'donnell, I was not disappointed with this movie Plus the surprise of this story about modesty and her childhood I did not expect very high due to the bad movie from 1966, so I might evaluate this movie a little. But if you like cartoons and other stories about Modesty Blaise, you should definitely see this! Can't wait to follow ...
