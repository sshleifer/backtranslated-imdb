This is a very amazing and suspicious movie. There are many plots and turns. The story or director opens a question mark in the death row or presumably commits a crime by a black person. The film was directed by Arne Glimcher and James Newton Howard's beautiful voice was excellent. Strong performance of Sean Connery and Ed Harris. If you like this, don't miss "TRUE CRIMES" or "THE HURRICANE". My wife and I give 8/10.
