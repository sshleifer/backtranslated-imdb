I like this flick thoroughly. I firmly believe that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are geniuses in our cartoon era. They have an amazing ability to increase this level of absurdity for pop culture and make it ridiculous. But in reality ... if that makes any sense, this is what makes South Park very funny. When you go through the fact that it may be the most rude and unwary cartoon ever, you will see a message that is meaningful in every episode, clearly seen in BASEketball, although it is directed by David Zucker and is Merciless person But there is a sincere message about the American organization and the shame that is a major league sport I am also a sports fan too, so I found that the movie was hilarious many times because it was true in a strange way that people hate to love. The first opening prologue was excellent ... Tears from laughter every time I saw those football players start River Dance! Some people may not like this movie because it is not just everyone's cup of tea ... but like South Park when you look through nonsense ... it has a true message conveyed through a true comic genius. I gave this movie 8 out of 10 stars.
