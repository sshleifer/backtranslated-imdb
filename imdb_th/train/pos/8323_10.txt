"Now a little ridiculous and a love of a wise man." <br /> <br /> If you are too smart to watch this movie, you are too smart to live. br /> Great jogging, wonderful places, time pieces made with acute eyes to see the details. <br /> <br /> Walter Matt, Ryan Mek, Tim Robbins - and al - great! <br /> <br /> Rent, sit down, relax, take it, smile a little. Enjoy yourself. <br /> <br /> Thank you.
