It's sad to see this movie. Now we know how ANC is affected by international capitalism. Biko died for nothing. Woods achieved little success. Yes, the immediate apartheid was canceled. But all the tools of power were reserved by a minority of white people, leaving the ANC government more or less, while Naomi Klein wrote in The Shock Doctrine to talk between black and white leaders. The first two strategies to draw on Washington consensus that there is no single way to manage the economy. Economic decisions - such as trade policies and central banks - are "technical" or "adminsitrative", then will use a variety of new policy tools - international trade agreements, innovation in constitutional law and structure. Adjustment program - to control those energy centers for unbiased experts, economists and officials from the IMF, the World Bank, GATT and the National Party --- anyone except fighting for the release of the ANC. But not as successful as it should be, and AIDS is booming. Watching Cry Freedom in this light is really sad. --- Sadly, ANC has changed itself from being a solution to a major problem.
