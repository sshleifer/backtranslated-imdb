Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra hated each other while doing this movie, and over the following years Brando asked Sinatra to learn to sing some songs, but Sinatra (which was really upset) Then Skye Masterson wanted to become a lead singer and didn't want anyone better than him. He told Brando to get lost. So he came back to him. Marlon took seriously the scene in the restaurant. Sinatra is eating a cheesecake so he can eat, eat and eat. In later years, Sinatra gave Brando the nickname "Mumble" or "Mr Mumles" because of the way he spoke.
