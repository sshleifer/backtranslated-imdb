Philo Vance (William Powell) helps solve the murder among millionaires after the dog's performance. <br /> <br /> I tend to hate the mystery that is too complicated (like this) but I love this movie It's moving very fast (just 72 minutes), directed by Michael Curtiz beautifully (he uses many camera tricks that just increase the speed of the lecture as well) with a very ingenious story) and a very good actor <br /> Powell is very polite and wonderful, like Vance - he doesn't seem to act - he's Vance! Mary Astor didn't do much. But she adds class and beauty to the production Others are good too. But the most important is Eugene Pallette as a detective. He is a very good actor with a very distinctive voice and some of his hilarious stories. <br /> <br /> In general, the 1930s Hollywood murder mystery is excellent. See <br /> <br />
