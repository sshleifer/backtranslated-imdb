The last film that I believe about The Boys, which was made with Hal Roach. This is the last comedy they made before going to the fox in the 20th century, which made their reputation worse. Even though there is a weak time - a business with a "lung tester" is a little bit ah ... overblown (but it's worth it to see "Dr." Jimmy Finlayson) - but in the picture This is a good summary of what the children brought to the screen. Richard Cramer (uncredited) appeared in other L&H flicks and he was happily intimidating here as judge Nick Granger. Eat their own synthetic food ("Looks good, smells good and it may have a good taste. Eat it.") It was one of my favorite moments in the work. Stan & Ollie will be a pleasant companion in the lives of dedicated fans. They are millions
