After watching this movie again since 1998, showing that VH-1, I have to comment. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie on TV, it was about 1981 and I remember that it was my mother's Betamax closure. It made the tape black and white for some reason, which made it look like the moment I started to like it. <br /> <br /> I remember that this movie started with music. "My Bonnie" clearly The camera panned over the scene of Liverpool. I still remember the opening scene where Paul used gestures with some women and said "Look at the talent." So it was a very annoying story that I appeared in the 1998 tape version and "remember" that the movie opened with "She Loves You" instead of "My Bonnie" when you saw that the camera slowed down when Compared to the speed of the song, you will see that "She loves you" is not suitable. Also, in the "Later" version, when Paul sees a woman, he says, "Look at the girls!" .. And when thinking of the previous version, the words Any one that looks Used to be incompatible Why do they feel the need to make this film an American model for American audiences is something that is beyond me? Personally, if I were to watch a movie about the British band, I would like all English and that would be part of their words, manners, etc. <br /> <br /> What are other irritations? "Missing. "Editing for television For example, after Stu was beaten, the movie trailer was cut to 'em. Yes, I know it depends on the network. But actually it destroys the impact of the movie to separate it from each other as we all know Something that some people may find insignificant in terms of conversation (And therefore it's okay to edit) actually can be a way of explaining specific actions or scenes that follow. <br /> <br /> My point is "best". The version of this movie is probably The previous version that I recorded since 1981, which just happened to the scene "Shake, Rattle & Roll" at my 1998 version, I started thinking that there must be two different versions for the TV and see the link. "Backup version" about this movie proved that I was right. The American version has a short / cut / different scene and / or the conversation is very frustrating for me and what is worth talking about. If anyone is interested in this, Imo, the best solution is to Try and get a European version of the movie if possible and (Probably less) versions that are not modified Sadly, I had to throw away the old beta version of Europe betamax because I didn't know how to convert it. <br /> <br /> Every story I found that this movie might be one of the best movies about. The story behind "The Birth of The Beatles" Recognizing that artistic and creative licenses are often used in movies and TV shows when historical events, I do not let any difference destroy the enjoyment of movies. My Of course, you see the Beatles playing music at Cavern, which makes me wonder if "Do they write it backwards? I don't think so. "Still, I think it's a great movie and a great performance. The truth that really stands out for me is the actor who plays John Stephen McKenna. I just fell in love with him His personality, appearance and speech seemed to be a key point. He looks like a young John enough for me to do twice at the end of this movie. When you see the Beatles performing in Ed Sullivan for the first time, I actually find myself questioning whether it is true or not. Beatle footage Until I saw other actors in the scene. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a precise history of life and the beginning of The Beatles, you can't go better than "The Beatles' Anthology". As "written" by the author own However, if you are looking for a fun snapshot before their Beatlemania day, which leads to America and you leave an anal evaluation at the door, you will not go wrong. "The birth of the Beatles" - must be used with "true" or informal Beatle fans
