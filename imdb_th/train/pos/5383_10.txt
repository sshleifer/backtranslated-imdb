I think this movie is great because Corrine and Sean are new entrants in the business. It is full of action and little love, but there are some issues that Corrine doesn't say clearly. (When she threatened Sean with a gun) and she bites her teeth ... Maybe she should do. I think Joseph and Sunny's role is a very good picture and there are obvious differences. Also because of me. Watching the next action movie star and Sean doing their own stunts that play very well. I wait for another movie from the couple while they create a great team or maybe a sequel to bet. Your life may be Than that 'This time may be the story of Carmen .. Let your life be great!
