I didn't expect Gackt and Hyde's performances to be as good as they had been, and I didn't expect them to perform in a well-developed movie and have enough plot Make you interested and have enough variety This movie is an unexpected masterpiece for me and I will watch the next movie like this. Especially I like the fact that it's a vampire movie. But it's not a magical vampire movie and doesn't make it real Every character has human characteristics. The way it shows the character's growth is incredibly tasteful and it makes you feel really sorry for them for the rest of their lives. I gave this movie with two thumbs until now. The best movie I saw in the past five years
