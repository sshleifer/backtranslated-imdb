The second story of the Gundam universe (G-Gundam first), Wing Gundam is another different view of Gundam's poetry. Found familiar elements But the Gundam is different from the real thing. Being the biggest Gundams is nothing more than a terrorist fighting with one organization. In fact, the series didn't become a war program until Episode 7. But in reality, the real conflict, the Eve war, didn't happen until the next episode. <br /> <br /> Things The best of this series is the character. All the main characters have been broadcast throughout the 49 episodes, and you can sympathize with their roles in each chapter. Another great addition is the excellent character and mecha design of the series. The design makes some parts of other Gundam shameful. <br /> <br /> One of the greatest reviews of this series is the number of UC fans who die hard claiming to be the original UC. Why do Gundam Wing get this rap when UC clones are clearer than Gundam Seed? In fact, there are many times that are raised. But they tell in a new way and have different differences as well. <br /> <br /> For example, the usual comparison of Zechs Merquise and UC Icon Char Aznable throughout the Zechs series is the driver. Chase in the alliance and in the form of OZ, while Red Comet is the symbol of Zeon. Another important difference is the fact that Zechs lost many soldiers under his command, so other nicknames he Received in the episode Craig: "assassin his own people," Char has not been /> <br /> This label of Serie <br was not jumbo philosophy. But is two problems The first thing is the reusable animation of the Gundams attack. Of course, it's very fun to see the tank attacking Heavy Arms, MS and the plane for the first time. But in the fourth scene, will come back to use again as it used to be. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that the whole series should happen throughout the year. If you think about the actual events in the entire series, it will happen in one year. <br /> <br /> But I think you can easily cancel this fact when ignoring the intro line. every time It may be the best in the story of the Gundam universe and is a good introduction to the world of Gundam. In the end, this is the first anime Gundam broadcast on US television.
