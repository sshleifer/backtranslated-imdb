Valentine is one of my favorite slasher movies. The scene of death is complex and the show is very good. Marley Shelton performed well as a female lead (better than Jennifer Love Hewitt in the movie "I Know ...") David Boreanaz, which is the main reason I saw the movie This has a minor role. But he played well The exception to the list of good actors is Denise Richards. She's scary in this story. The only scene that I'm glad to see you is the spoiler scene. * In conclusion, it's a good movie to watch. You should definitely look at this before watching "Scream" or "I Know ..." again.
