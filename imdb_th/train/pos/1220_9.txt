The origin of caring for bears and their cousins If you see the original movie, you will notice the difference. Relatives were raised with Care Bears instead of finding them later. However, I have no problem with this. I choose to consider it as a separate interpretation. Cute and fun children who have seen them play and grow My favorite item is Swift. Heart Rabbit The villain is a scary etch. I can sympathize with the three children since I never played good sports. Cree Summer is great, like Christy. If you have an open mind, love toys, or like the original, this should not be missed. 9/10
