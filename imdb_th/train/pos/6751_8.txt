A good movie from Preminger; Sometimes the maze explores the set and place from various angles and views as if it were a natural film on the citizens of the modern city and how they lived. In this sense, it is a pleasant and satisfying image as a bad-tempered police hero enters into the hot water when he accidentally kills a man with a piece of iron in his head. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews The show is as if it were a hamlet and has never been better than before. The story may be a pure melodrama. But Andrew gave weight and almost elevated it to a tragedy As his woman, Gene Tierney is charming, but not extraordinary. Gary Merrill makes a very interesting villain with his natural warmth, giving a great difference to Andrews' coolness; The person who seems to be cute, cute, smiling, seems to constantly challenge the nemesis by the fact that he is only emotionally open compared to the police with wounds and morals that are hunting him. br /> <br /> There are no major surprises in this movie that seems to be changing for everyone involved. For director Preminger, it was a reunion of celebrities Laura, Andrews and Tierney, who were passing the peak of their careers during the time the film was created. Supporting actors - Merrill, Karl Malden, Neville Brand - are more understanding and optimistic as they are traveling Preminger as a quiet observer. As always, letting various events happen without showing a strong view, because the moral ambiguous ending is disappointing for the cat and mouse game between the two rivals. There is much less correction. <br /> <br />
