Like other critics, I've seen this movie for the first time. (On TV never appeared on the big screen) when I was a kid My father always looked at this movie very much and recommended it to me, and I must say that he was not only correct, but this movie has been with me forever for over 2 decades since I first saw it. I saw it two or three times since then. (Just a few days ago I gave it a look again) and it didn't affect the time. It's still a great movie and worth watching! Manr considers Peckinpah to be a RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY, which is one of the best Western countries of the first and later, which has a lifelike look in the old West. But LAST HUNT, better known, is a better movie. In fact, it may be for the next 3 decades or maybe it will still ... <br /> <br /> Although thinking hard and seeing the 100s of the West (I like this genre) I don't remember being a West Bleak and depressed like this The two men were tied together in part by the hatred that seemed to have no other choice. Surrounded by a beautiful packet of old men, disabled men and young Indians brought the life of a buffalo killer to their fate. <br /> <br /> No one who has seen this movie can forget the ending and the last frame of this gem. When the camera moved from Mr. Taylor, the white buffalo skin appeared on the tree and reflected from the past when hate began to appear again. Mr. Taylor has his buffalo. But in the end, the buffalo received him. <br /> <br /> In addition to the leading performances of everyone involved, intelligent scripts and excellent conversations should also be mentioned as THE LAST HUNT. Receiving excellent photography, I almost never saw Westerners. From what was directed by Anthony Mann, which is a great photo), where all the places were chosen wisely and even the soundtrack was good for the picture. <br /> <br /> The director of BROOKS is Tell a really wonderful story. Craftsmanship! He created a few great movies and succeeded in almost all the unexpected types. But despite being in a prolific career like this movie, THE LAST HUNT still shines one of the best, if not the best of him. <Br /> <br /> Of course, it deserves a higher score. Compared to 7, RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY
