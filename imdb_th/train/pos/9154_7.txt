Very good, except for the ending which is very disappointing. <br /> <br /> The script is very good like acting. The images are usually a little grainy, but in a way that adds to the movie while the snow features are in a good place that helps create emotions for this film. This effect was destroyed by a very unbelievable ending. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie 8 out of ten, but the ending causes it to drop to 7 because it seems to go out violently. The first 75 minutes of the movie That will make movie makers look smart. <br /> <br /> This film, although better than movies with a large budget and seems to be filmed like the first movie with special equipment. There is nothing special in the way of effects, but it is very good.
