It's hard to bring this movie in many ways. Everything works really well here; All casting, screenplay and movie filming But is the first job For movie watchers, it is a story of intense love and human redemption. For film critics, there are many excellent techniques and techniques. There are some tactical mistakes and, as has been discussed on the board, the ending lacks realism if someone is serious with the CIA agent training corner. However, I ended up moving more and more due to the fact that instead of following the CIA agent's guidelines, Creasy generally praised his spirit to the fullest, regardless of the consequences like Creasy, becoming a human over the sacrifice of He whether it is true or not In any case, I appreciate the fact that Creasy dealt with the morals of the traditional middle class and just slander the villain one by one on his systematic quest for justice. <br /> <br /> No matter In any case, this movie is very appealing if you are interested in that direction. Great soundtrack, excellent writing, impeccable casting and strong performances across the board, making this movie the top 100 (or better).
