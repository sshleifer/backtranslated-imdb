Not suitable for people who do not have a quick mind or have no blood of the Balkans in the veins. If you don't have these things, you can't understand it. And if you don't understand, you can't enjoy it :) For example, if you think Picasso is the name of a car produced by Citroen, or if you see Picasso's drawings, you will walk through it by deciding that it is the painter's work Road :) So do not judge before trying to understand :) Finally, I think it is necessary for everyone with an open mind. Still, my N1 still redeem Shawshank! And remember that not everything can be put in the frame Because there is something in this world that any frame does not fit
