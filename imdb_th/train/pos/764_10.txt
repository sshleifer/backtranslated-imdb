Beat Street is the best movie about the brakes. Everything about it is a spot on clothes (puma), music and most importantly dance! The story is basic. But hey, what's the matter to tell? The whole issue of this film is to show what children are doing at that time. The important thing for them. It shows that teenagers are generally good. The important thing for these children every day is music, dance and friendship. After watching the DVD recently, I was very surprised how long it had passed the test! Clothes don't look old. (Probably because now Puma has a big comeback), the song still sounds fresh Every movie aged 10-25 years should be seen as part of their youth culture.
