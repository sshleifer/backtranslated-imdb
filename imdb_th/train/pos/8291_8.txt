"The Lady in Question (1999)" starring Gene Wilder is a mysterious, well-trained drama that reminds me of the Raymond Berber Perry Mason series. "Cash" makes me guess until the end. There are many suspects who have motives for murder. But I don't know what kind of character it is. <br /> <br /> Gene Wilder has a special ability that is charming about him, even in facial expressions and voices. He is perfect for this part. The part of the movie that showed the actors was very good. I'm sure this is an additional challenge for actors to pull out. I was not surprised to see that he wrote some screenplays. Even his singing was happy. I like him in this role more than his past "sillier" roles, such as "The Young Frankenstein" and "Willy Wonka". I hope A&E will continue this series. They should call it "The A & E Gene Wilder Mysteries". <br /> <br /> The song fits the time. I enjoy live combos and swing music. At first I was not clear whether we would see the picture back or what happened during that time. And I do not agree that the combination of vulgarity is necessary for the operation of the script For me, it often distracts me. <br /> <br /> Overall, my wife and I are the second happy to start well in what we hope to be others - like One of our other favorites: Raymond Perry Mason
