Holes (2003, Dir Andrew Davis) <br /> <br /> When Stanley Yelnats IV was found guilty of theft, he was sent to 'Camp Green Lake' at this camp. Sir and Dr. Pendenski ordered the terrorists to dig a hole after the hole. But for what reason Stanley plans to search. <br /> <br /> I never really had the intention of watching 'Holmes' and I had to admit that I only really watched movies. Even if you're not his girlfriend, it doesn't matter. 'Holes' are one of the Disney movies that families can enjoy. This story is written lovingly and incorporates great ideas about the story dating back to the past. These things do not distract and give a really great story. All the actors are excellent. The young stars perform well and the addition of Jon Voight and Sigourney Weaver is a pleasure. Shia LaBeouf shows that even on the 17th, he can perform without any flaws. This is one Disney movie that you will enjoy With the family, of course. <br /> <br /> "I learned from failure" - Stanley Yelnats III (Henry Winkler)
