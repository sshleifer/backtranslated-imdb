Good performance <br /> <br /> The basic background is humanity at the intersection. There is a set of moral problems that are facing. Humanity made a number of technological inventions. But are humans mature enough to cope with new toys? There is a moral decline in the virtual world. There is a religious fanatic who is willing to kill to receive attention. I predict (based on BSG) that there will be problems with Cylons and slaves. There are also other problems that humans bring to ourselves. <br /> <br / > This list is not BSG - at least not as much as humanity is fleeing from cruel problems. In the end, doing his own There are not many shoot-em-up or space-based effects - at least not in the first episode that I have seen now. <br /> <br /> What it has is a story that excellent Characters and themes There are also good performances from actors. They can create a culture that is similar to modern society. But aliens at the same time believe completely. Like BSG, this program is about humanity - our strengths, weaknesses, potentials and shortcomings. It may seem a little strange that human society in a different world has necktie, antique car and chicken. But those are things that create a semi-familiar background more than anything else. Anyone who stuck to those details really missed this point. Whether you come from a mafia culture or a rich and high-tech culture, humans and human nature are not different 150,000 years ago in the high-tech era than we see in the world today. Wondering what the writer is trying to tell us?
