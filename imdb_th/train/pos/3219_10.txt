This is a great movie. It has a fascinating story, a great main character, a great performance and a killer action. Most will happen in the year 2036, but show the scene that happened in the past year to explain the story. <br /> <br /> The story is very well done and has no holes. Kurt Russell is a lonely man named Todd, who has been trained from birth to killing and like other soldiers who have never lived like normal people. Eventually the army introduced a newer, younger, faster and stronger soldier. Jason Scott Lee was one of them. As a result, they do not want old soldiers like Todd. They tested the new soldiers by letting them fight some old soldiers in the fight. Russell was injured and assumed to be dead. The soldiers left their bodies, including others less than, assuming they were dead. But what they don't know is that Russell is still alive. <br /> <br /> Todd finds a camp full of civilizations on this planet, where the army left him for a moment. But cannot adapt to normal life He rarely speaks a word and sometimes he is very aggressive towards others. When they felt that they were dangerous to them, they sent him to the desert. <br /> <br /> Just as Russell left the world, was attacked by a new soldier. What the soldiers forget is to train the soldiers wisely like Todd and other old soldiers. Therefore, while these new soldiers are faster and stronger than Todd The soldiers became aware of this and Todd killed all of them. But the only one is Jason Scott Lee. And finally, you will see the classic fight scenes between Russell and Scott Lee. Clearly, Russell came out on top. <br /> <br /> This is one of those. The best action movie I've ever seen and I've seen a lot. This has everything you can ask for in a movie. The writer did not forget that Russell had never seen a woman before, as he even called "You". Women do not have any holes in this movie. Every minute has a purpose and it is fun. <br /> <br /> An excellent male army action movie for Rambo, Commando and Missing In Action fans. Perfect for Kurt Russell fans and action / sci-fi fans.
