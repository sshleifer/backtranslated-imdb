Like Arabian Nights, this film is played with storytelling in order to make us feel that there is a plot, a synopsis and a more open story: it opens with what looks like a frame device of a blind man. Backward, which led us to the present day of the blind where we discovered that about half of the story had not yet arrived (Have to admit that the second half of the year was not in accordance with the first contract) as well as Arabian Nights trying to squeeze as many Middle Eastern incentives as possible A beautiful princess, a flying carpet, a wonderful mechanical toy, a marine journey, a crowded market, an evil vizier, a gem ... I don't know why it all works. All things are very beautiful The set is beautiful. June Duprez is beautiful. Rozsa's score is exceptionally beautiful. Usually there will be a Hungarian language. In any way he was able to convince us that he was a Hungarian in Persian style.
