As one reviewer said that Hanna's war is a remarkable movie about the outstanding person Hanna "Anniko" Senet, who will become Joan of Arc Jews. Unfortunately I do not agree that Miss Detmers as a leading actor is too beautiful to be serious as a fighter. In fact, for me, her performance was not held by her beauty. But it makes Sadistic's brutal fears a resistor she must face The performance of Maruschka Detmers is true, courage, pain, or understanding and truly believable. In other words, for me "in the zone" from opening credits If you want to learn about the suffering of others for what they believe and have impressive entertainment, try Hanna. War with Maruschka Detmers. Try my hat off at Ellen Burstyn as a mother. Hanna, a famous and famous actress who can try to walk with the movie In that it is the team's efforts, probably of two female actors. But not all about Eve
