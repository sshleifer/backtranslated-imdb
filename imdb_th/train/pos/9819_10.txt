This is a great movie from the lost era of drama created for conservative TV. My favorite actor Robert Kult, plans the path through fairness and confidence in liberal systems, knees, knees, conservation and fear of crime. Adolescents are a collection of ridiculous schemes and the final message of this movie, making the Dragnet episode look rough by comparison. But what shines in this movie is the great step of the movie, creating fear and paranoia according to degrees, including the feelings of the entire California scene. The car is also great as I can remember. I gave this movie for 10 hours and I challenged everyone to watch this movie and not enjoy every minute. Remember that just because it's created for television doesn't mean it's not a great art.
