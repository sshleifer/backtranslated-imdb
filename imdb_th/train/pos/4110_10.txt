This and the "hidden fortress" belongs to Kurosawa that is my most beloved. I didn't give out 10 sweets, but this is definitely worth it. If anything Although it is quite long (Like all that Kurosawa has) it agrees with the problems that make me with most of his movies; The story is often too loose and develops slowly, containing unnecessary scenes or wasting too much time without the true purpose of the story or description. The character Dodesukaden gives me the same experience as "Fortress" even Will have its length But I cut it out for a moment. <br /> <br /> This is a very unusual Kurosawa movie in a way that doesn't have a story. With more character descriptions than the story, which is different from other Kurosawa movies I've seen In addition, he leaned on many conversations which he used very well. (Especially in the story between the father and son who are planning their "new home") <br /> <br /> What makes this a masterpiece is a very sad story as it is. It was managed to explain humanitarian and compassionate. From beginning to end, it gives the whole mood level from laughter to tears in perfect balance.
