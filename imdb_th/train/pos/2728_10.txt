Is one of the best things that has ever been! The adaptation of the novel by Richard Brooks of Truman Capit is a true artistic achievement. Beautiful black and white movies (Which should have won an Oscar) which is the score of Quincy Jones and the great performances of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as an oddly matched killer This movie is 0 for 4 at the Academy Awards and is not nominated for the Best Picture, while Dr. Doolittle is thinking! <br /> <br /> Even if you do not know the Clutter family, just as you do in the book, it is a good decision to focus on Perry and Dick and the steps to track down the pain of these people. John Forsythe was impressive as Alvin Dewey had no flaws in this matter. 10 out of 10. Best performance = Scott Wilson and R. Blake in seconds Highly recommended!
