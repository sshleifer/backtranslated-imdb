We saw this in a local art theater in Montrose County of Houston, Texas. It is very surprising when compared to the articles in the theater newsletter. But both of us are impressed with the art It is beautifully done and (obviously) photographed in the schloss (German name for the castle) somewhere in the Munich area. It is a clear survey of the sexual relationships of twenty men and women who separate from day-to-day restrictions. It's great at the level that I remember. We arrived home after the movie and talked and talked until about 4 o'clock the next morning. <br /> <br /> The version we saw in English (mostly), so there must be at least two movies In (may be original) German version I searched and searched for a videotape version But never thought of anything Like having a VHS or DVD version like this. It explores relationships at a basic level and is also a great exercise on how to relate to your partner. If anyone knows the writer / director, please convince him to release again, especially on the DVD. Today, I can't imagine the fatigue of watching the straightforward performances of the actors that may now be. Was in their forties. Please bring it back.
