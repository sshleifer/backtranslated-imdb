It's a delightful story when this program is launched because it is a fresh and original program. Makes every item that I used to look plain boring The moment when the first episode aired, I joined and I was stuck with every character very easily. (Which usually doesn't happen because I hate a few characters) It's a shame that this program doesn't have a third season because it must be one of the best shows I've ever seen and that doesn't make me feel Exaggerated in acting There is nothing that can replace the pushing daisies because ABC may find something to replace this item? This is the best TV program easily. <br /> <br /> I came to Kristin Chenoweth and I stayed because I fell in love with all the performances.
