The blood house is the third time in the seventh series, Amicus. A horror movie if THE MONSTER CLUB included in this series will create eight movies. Although the movie is very different from other people, <br /> <br /> I look at the poem Amicus with good memories because I used to love them when I was a teenager. My feelings for them today are very strong. <br /> <br /> I spent many years following this movie. The conclusion of the story was so appealing that I had to pay as much as I could when I finally found a copy. Excellent, as if this film I felt disappointed when I finally saw it. It's not as good as I believe. While better than the previous two models But there is nowhere near and better than the four successors that I will show. <br /> <br /> The story of the connection makes John Bennett a police inspector, tracking the missing people who live in Mystery House. His journey begins at the local police station where he learns about the previous passengers. The story of the link later saw him visit a real estate agent who sold the house. While this story links seem tempted on paper. But it is smooth and lifeless in practice and is the weakest point of Amicus poetry. The easiest. I can't help but get the feeling that John Bennett is a poor version of Donald Pessons? Ian Hendry I want to see one of the two actors in his role. We may have both here - one as a police inspector and the other as a real estate agent. They can do it and I believe it will bring the weak elements of this movie to a much better life. <br /> <br /> The film has four stories, each of which focuses on the residents of the house. br /> <br /> The first story saw Denholm Elliott, the author of the crime story. He was absorbed into an exciting story about a wrestler, even going so far as to draw a sketch to help his writing. Soon after, he began to see the vision of his own creation. Some of the great directions of Peter Duffell, especially when choosing a camera angle, help to deviate from the restricted script. Elliott's performance is excellent as a tortured writer and he also helps to raise Story level The story ends with a semi-distorted. But I can't help but understand the chapter that doesn't allow it to continue as potential. <br /> <br /> The second story suggests that Peter Cushing moved into the house. He was a lonely man who still peeked. Looking for a beautiful young woman who was once upset by him, and he collected images of Cushing's performances, making the story really lively. He was assisted by the director who chose to continue to focus on the loneliness of the mattress. This is the next scene of great hallucinations that help us see within the mind of the couch. However, Cushing saw a sketch at a nearby wax museum that looked like his woman. Naturally, his passion grew. But this romantic story seems to be twisting. At the end, Joss Ackland plays Cushing's rival, but his performance is crushed by the great Peter Cushing. <br /> <br /> The third story And the best to see Christopher Lee - the favorite horror actor of all time His daughter. Mr. Lee gives him the perfect ice cold show here. He does not show any love or attention to his daughter. He also brought the school's rule to educate her. The rule played by Nyree Dawn Porter in her great performance once again tried to find out what's wrong. I can reveal that the spell has a role. The appearance of Christopher Lee is truly fascinating. In every scene he came in, Chloe Franks deserves special recognition for her humble performances as a little girl who is an amazing character. Most feared in all movies This movie is worth seeing even one story that only one story can see. <br /> <br /> The last story is almost all played for laughs. But of course it will entertain and that is important. Jon Pertwee plays as a horror actor moving into the house. He was very dissatisfied with the way the director used to watch movies by watching everything that was right and fake, especially the costume. So he decided to buy a real cloak for his latest vampire role. Geoffrey Bayldon had a great cameo as a dealer selling Pertwee ancient robes. When Perth V wore a robe, he began to develop fangs and turn into vampires in general. Pertwee's performance must be believed. It is truly hilarious. Ingrid Pitt is still in this story. But her ability is lost in a role that should be much larger. <br /> <br /> The story of the link ends with a loose connection with the last story. Ideal because the inspectors are looking for Pertwee and decide to visit the house naturally. The rest you can exercise yourself. As weak as the story is linked, it is appropriate if the ending is quite funny, unintentionally. <br /> <br /> I believe that the blame for the flaws in what should be a truly beautiful movie doesn't lie with Peter Duffell. The director who does the best with what he has I think that the script is too limited and lacking ambition that can be found in the next four movies. <br /> <br /> Overall, the house that bleed out despite the flaws that Amicus fans are fans of Other Amicus movies or fans of horror movie portraits If my conclusion has a movie that attracts you enough, try it. You will enjoy it!
