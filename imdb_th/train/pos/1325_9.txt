I saw this movie at the Adelaide Film Festival '07 and was very intrigued throughout 106 minutes. I liked the documentary, but often found that they dragged with for about 25 minutes. <br /> <br /> The subject of this film is Norma Khoury, a Jordanian woman who found fame and fortune in 2001 with the publication of her book, Forbidden Love. Approval of A story related to her Muslim friend who was killed by her family because of a relationship with a Christian man. A few years later, a few reporters began to break into this story, causing people to believe that it was fraud. The film covers this story quickly. But thoroughly at first and then we spent most of the time in Norma while she tried to convince us that her novel was more than fiction. <br /> <br /> Director Anna Broinowski discovered A woman who is truly fascinated to study and she has an endless interview with Khoury when she seeks truth. As always, in life, the truth is not easy to find. Norma is afraid of her life, worried about the violent backlash in her unsightly paintings in the Jordanian novel. She refused to return to Jordan and showed us the facts. However, Broinowski didn't interrupt and put the pieces in front of us. <br /> <br /> The result is an incredible image in the heart of the fraud. Naturally, what we found was a little feeling and it was difficult to follow and ultimately we didn't know whether or not to believe Norma or not. She is an unjust woman trying to survive. The lie and the truth and half of the truth that she screened through that movie was excellent. <br /> <br /> The film uses a lot of interviews, including plays that tell the story and Broinowski uses these plays. To show us Why do people like Norman arrive? We want to be packed. We go to watch movies every day and allow ourselves to believe that what happens on the screen is true. That may be because I read too many things. It didn't happen in the questions and answers with Brionowski after this movie. But that's what I took from it. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful Australia. Movies and must be released internationally and receive many awards if you ask me. Of course, it's the best movie I've ever seen in AFF07. <br /> <br /> Go see if you have a chance.
