I watched this movie last week and still miss it. I am very impressed with this movie. I found the character to be reliable and satisfying almost as a mistake. In real life, though sometimes people are disappointed, like Leo, who, although I like his character, I can not be more disappointed when he is willing to have unprotected sex. I was disappointed with Leo who refused to give him medicine and the horrible way he treated Marcel when he decided to send him home on the train. I think this film shows that the reason why HIV numbers are stuck in young gay men This does not mean that it is a gay beat. (I'm gay) and the movie is doing very well about young people who choose not well and don't seem to know the consequences for themselves and others. Part of the movies that I don't understand are the reasons the family. (Gay-friendly) Not willing to include Marcel in Leo's illness to the point of not allowing him to go to the funeral. <br /> <br /> I think the greatest message from this movie is That gay or there is no unprotected sex!
