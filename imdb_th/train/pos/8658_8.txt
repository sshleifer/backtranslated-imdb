It is a street-themed movie with a killer on board. Brian Kessler (David Duchovny), an urbane writer who has a complex, wants to do field research about an American serial killer. But both he and his girlfriend Carrie (Michelle Forbes) do not have money to visit murder sites in foreign countries, so they advertise for someone to share travel expenses. Who they ended up with was the early grayce young couple (Brad Pitt) and his girlfriend Adele (Juliette Lewis). Two better examples of "Poor white trash" You will never find in the entire movie theater. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the beginning and Adele are the things that make this movie fun, as they say babbling, babbling, trust, Meditate, speculate, disdain and others work in ways that I have not seen since the release of "The Beverly Hillbillies". California's first thought: "People think faster because of the warm weather that cold weather makes people fool" enough. Will He gave Adele: "I guess to explain why there are so many stupid people around here," which in the beginning responded proudly: "Of course." Previously, Adele still ordered about California: "You don't have to buy results Wood because it's on the tree ... and they don't have speed limits and I hear that your first month's rent is free. State law. "<br /> <br /> But poor people have some psychological problems. Which became clear Up for Brian and Carrie, as the four travelers proceed west throughout the United States, when they enter the southwest desert with a completely beautiful landscape, "Kalifornia" begins to look like "The Hitcher" (1986 ), And before this began to show more and more, such as John Ryder, the man waving the madness of everyone, whose fear seemed unstoppable. <br /> <br /> In "Kalifornia", the performance is not uniform. Duchovny's performance is quite flat. Brad Pitt has surprisingly powerful performance, although he sometimes works too hard. Michel Forbes is an excellent artist as an avant-garde artist. But my choice for the best performance is Juliette Lewis. With the sound of her nose and the heavy southern accent, she is amazing as she is an innocent and lively kid like Adel. <br /> <br /> At the end, this movie will make sense to the Twilight Zone. While our tourists entered the Nevada nuclear test site with old houses dilapidated, filled with test bodies. The plot is somewhat disorganized in an unnecessary and miserable ending that is frustrating. <br /> <br /> Overall, however, "Kalifornia" is an entertaining movie thanks to the clever concept. Especially good in The second half of the year, good movies, excellent conversations and great performances by Juliette Lewis
