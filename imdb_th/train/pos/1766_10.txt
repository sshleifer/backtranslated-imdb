I received a free sample ticket last night and didn't know what would happen. The place seems stupid and I think it will be funny, shallow. It's a great story. I laughed so hard I cried in some jokes. This movie is a must see for anyone who has an open mind and a little sense of humor. OK ..... This is not a movie that will go with your grandmother (Jack Palace?) Or small children. Jokes, jokes are rough and sex chat is about graphics as much as you can find anywhere. However, the amazing thing is that this movie is still a lovely love story. My girlfriend and I both like it. Steve Carell is great, but (like The Office), the actors that support this movie actually work. Every character has a flaw. But has depth and preference Everyone pulls the weight and chemistry is perfect. I can't wait to get a DVD. I'm sure it will be there with Office Space for replay and reference lines.
