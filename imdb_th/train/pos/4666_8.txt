It was very tricky for every 60 people who watched a humorous movie quite gentle. But it made me more than I expected The actors were at the first rate and they seemed to have a great time. Ustinov strayed through the movie, muttering jokes under his breath and it was not reasonable. I will buy the movie as soon as it comes out on DVD. The storyline is Ustinov as a misappropriation of assets released from a prison that emits a computer and money embezzling money from an American company with an office in London. The variety is part of the fun. Bob New Hart is his usual successor and Carl Mulden has fun as a high-density executive. The ending is funny and insulting.
