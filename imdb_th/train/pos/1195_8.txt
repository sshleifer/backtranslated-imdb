I saw this movie about twenty years ago in the afternoon. I can clearly remember this movie, especially Robert Taylor's performance. I always thought that Taylor was underestimated as an actor, while most critics viewed him as a stiff and woman. Who likes to watch his movies However, this film proved that he should be an interesting actor. He didn't get enough of this role in his long career. This is his best performance. He believed in a truly bad role. From what I have read, he is a hard-working and easy person in real life and has never fought enough for these chapters. He will do what MGM has to offer. This film proves that he is able to deal with more diverse and difficult roles. The other thing I remember in this movie is the annoying Lloyd Nolan character. Nolan is a great actor. But this character makes me feel bad The last scene of this movie stuck with me over the years. This film is definitely worth watching.
