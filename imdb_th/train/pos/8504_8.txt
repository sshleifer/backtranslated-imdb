You play as B.J. Blazkowicz, a soldier of the US secret service, a strong man who was sent to reveal Nazi secrets and change the tide of World War II. This means everything from the separation from the Nazi dungeons to the destruction of Hitler's war machines and even Fuhrer. <br /> <br /> This game is probably the most influential game of that era. That's because it inspires true passion. There are many games at that time and do more today. But often you get the real one This is one of them, just like Tetris earlier and recently, GTA III in 2002. Yes, Doom is better in every aspect, but the images that are heard all over the world, which leads to the biggest wave of the game, are shot. By BJ Blazkowicz The Space Marine, Duke Nukem, Max Payne, Sam Serious, John Mullins, JC Denton, Agent 47, Gordon Freeman and many people who owe them ID or directly, indirectly But they still do. <br /> <br /> Despite the old-fashioned, old-fashioned graphics, super simple gameplay (this is really a game, the game is now played with "level" experience) and high level. The rectangle, the boundaries of all six episodes, provide a lot of fun. Especially the discovery of secrets with treasures and chaingun in it. <br /> <br /> as well: "Stop!" * Bang! Bang! Bang! * "AARRRGH !!!" Never old - 8/10 <br /> <br /> Voluntarily give PC-13 points for "The profound killing", however, is a great tame thing compared to the current game.
