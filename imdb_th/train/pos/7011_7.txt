First of all, I like this movie. It is a good act for everyone. <br /> <br /> However, I do not understand the opinions I hear from people about the end in surprise. I don't know anything about this movie that will come in, except for some "must-see" suggestions, but I know that the plot goes on in less than ten minutes. (I'm not going to talk about things that I share in order to not destroy movies that are good for others.) Even though I look clear. It is good to see that everything plays to fill the details and inspiration of the characters in the next scene. <br /> <br /> I don't hate when I guess the end of the movie. I hate when the road with the resolution is full of boring scenery. <br /> <br /> Smith's screen personality will be pleasant, even if he plays a problematic character. He has the power and confidence in everything I see. He made Seven Pounds a good work. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson is a strong actor, showing a quirky character. Beauty is in the eyes of the viewer and with Rosario. If you don't find her beautiful, you should think of changing your eyes. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see Woody Harrelson back on the screen. I didn't see him soon, but that may be me. Woody didn't have a huge screen time. But he sold the character to play a great blind piano I think this is a questionable choice for pets and plot. <br /> <br /> Overall, I have to recommend this movie, not about planning. But for a very good performance and for the fact that it tends To cause sadness that we try to avoid
