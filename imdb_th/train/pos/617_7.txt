Hello again from the darkness This will be compared with "Princess Bride" and even though it doesn't measure the classic But it is something that is entertaining and well built in its own way The story is rather strange and never describes the whole wall. But the execution was good, even creating strong suspicions. <br /> <br /> Charlie Cox plays the drama that falls in the wrong girl (Sienna Miller) and agrees to pull the star that falls. Come down to her ... which happened to be played by the amazing Claire Dennes No doubt, what happened to these two things? But the suspicious part came with an evil witch, played by Michelle Pfeiffer and the Prince of the King Peter Peter O'Toole, looking to restore our "star" ruby ​​necklace to wear. There are many bad chases. <br /> <br /> Along the way, you will meet the most strange pirates you will see. Robert Deniro plays the Shakespearean captain - strong inside and we'll talk to Is his woman? The confrontation again involves Ricky Gervais, who is great as a fast and good speaker for a couple of laughs. <br /> <br /> Not a typical chase, age or fantasy movie, but director Matthew Vaughn ("Layer" cake) should receive effort from the audience. Sadly, a bad marketing campaign may prevent money. I guess it will be a huge success in the video.
