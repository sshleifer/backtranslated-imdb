As I said in my opinion about the first part: These two films are better than most science fiction fans. Confessions. <br /> <br /> The situation in the second film is not moving like we don't see. The destruction of Human civilization But after thousands of refugees fled in small space cans that were protected by only one powerful spacecraft. <br /> <br /> But when Battlestar Pegasus appeared, the story began to heat up. Okay. It has a little Mad Max because of what they fight to fuel their spacecraft to travel to a distant world. But it works for me It is an exciting entertainment of science fiction with good actors and special effects. (Although those people often say :-) At least) <br /> <br /> I will love the continuation with Starbuck and the Apollo Board. But we got the second sequel without the character name. That proves that this story has worked before, especially because of the character that has been chosen very well ... <br /> <br /> So thumbs down for the production of the 1980s, but thumbs up for the movie Two stories since 1978
