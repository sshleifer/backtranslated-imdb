I saw this movie for the first time at U.K. In December 1989, when Central TV aired, I still have video tapes, although it deteriorated. (In the past few years, many friends and family members borrowed it and were chilled too!) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I remember having to go home that night, grab the nipples, change the Christmas lights. And see what the ad says is 'Christmas Ghost Story' Although I now remember some scenes that still carry the fur on my neck, standing at the end ... <br /> <br /> I saw some comments about the movie that said it. Not like this and not ... I think those people are frightened on Friday the 13th, and like Ralph and Slam Ralm, which is a laughing matter. This is a 'traditional' ghost story; No big budget actions or special effects ... no swearing, no blood, no free sex scenes, no electric saws or guns, etc ... so refreshing way !!!! It is the atmosphere If you like cool horror movies, write well, work well and have a truly scary atmosphere. This is the movie for you. I like the original horror. Last night I saw Haunting and that was a great movie. Very atmospheric again - and a woman in black The end of the movie is different from the book. But still very good. I recommend it. Try it ... You will * like if you like traditional ghost stories ... so ... turn off the lights, turn on the lights, lock the door, grab a drink ... and enjoy ...:)
