This film belongs to the inventor - Jake Gyllenhaal Underdog, Laura Dern and Chris Cooper. Bring a little performance to tell the story with many standard elements. Good shooting, good editing, good secondary role. <br /> <br /> Some people have announced that this movie is a classic American movie. It's like that and many more I agree with those who say "The movie celebrates the excitement of youthful inspiration." <br /> <br /> This film is a reminder that success may be caused by ordinary roots. <br /> <br />
