My Kasi Lemmings are women that look absolutely good. This movie is a lost gem which is a mockery. "mockumentary" that occurred in the early 90s of Hip Hop when MC Hammer had just begun to fade in for a good night We follow the three members of NWH as they begin their amazing journey of riches and fame. And just like Nickolas Nickleby at the end, they finish their journey not far from the beginning But at least was intelligent and less naive This is one of the best movies that no one has ever heard of. But it is a type of movie that you love or hate so much like "Company Man". Own
