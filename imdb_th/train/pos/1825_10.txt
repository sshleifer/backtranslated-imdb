I used to watch this movie when I was young and I remember that it was one of the first films that I truly liked. It's not action movies or comedy. So in the following years I decided to look again and see if it was a nostalgia or something in that film or not. With my surprise, the movie was held for all my expectations. It's a great movie. The mood in the right amount, funny, some good music (not good, but and that actually explains why I do not remember it is a musical) and in using all my time I was amazed because the latest film from my childhood that I had come back again, did not pass my minimum requirements in a good movie and also this film, which I first saw in the second level. I just died and probably not But the important thing is that it makes me feel and that is why filmmakers create movies. (And of course money) Yes, there are continuous irregularities. Yes, the script has holes But it is not important The movie itself is fun and clever. So do not be deceived by the cynical people who are always looking for bad things in life because nothing is perfect and this movie gets 10, not because it's perfect 10 just because it makes me feel.
