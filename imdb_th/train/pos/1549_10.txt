Have movies and have movies Films are usually not just "desserts" in cinemas, while movies are truly artworks. Fraulein Doktor is definitely in a good position. As most viewers, I am very impressed with the fighting scene. But the pain of describing the main character is what I think is the best quality movie. After doing everything he could to serve the country as the true daughter of Deutschland, all the time that she had to be addicted to morphine, Fraulein was still treated by the German people. The back of the Mercedes-Benz car ordered alone, lonely and sobbing, probably one of the most tragic images But the true "spy" in life is only the emotional pain presented by Richard Burton in Spy Who Came in from Cold. Close to Fraulein Doktor is a movie that has more depth than the audience will recognize. I just hope that the manufacturer will see it on the DVD so that those who have never experienced it can do it and those who have seen it can do it again.
