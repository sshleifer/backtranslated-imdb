Even though there are misfortunes going into the festival circuit here in Austin (SXSW Film), just as we are tired of things like Shakespeare in Love and Elizabeth, but this movie deserves the audience. When looking at the scenes of "The Scottish Play" as an actor called "Macbeth" when creating it to avoid curse, this is a treatment that is sharp, efficient and stylish. With an amazing score and look and listen better than its small budget, it is recommended that this is a world class quiet gem. But totally satisfied
