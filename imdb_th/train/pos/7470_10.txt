I went to see Vanilla Sky, a big, big, big !! .. Tom Cruise, a haughty brother and my girlfriend ... what I can say .. I am delighted with the movie, especially TC's show, I think it's a very moving movie, and it's not what I expected. <br /> <br /> I read the reviews and decided not to watch. I was 'forced' to see it. The strange thing is f Could not tell why, all I can say is that I find it totally involved and could not stop thinking about it the next day. For what I feel about the movie, all I can say is that it is not about people and events that make their lives and small events such as getting into the car can be changed. Everything ...... <br /> <br /> According to critics, it may be the second original movie for Alejandro Amen√°bar, but this is a completely different interpretation of the narcissistic remake for the benefit of Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz <br /> <br /> I can't even write a few sentences and glamor to explain this movie !!!! <br /> <br /> Yes. I know that this is not a careful review. In any way, it's not like that movie.
