There is a story (possibly evidence) about the exchange between Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam. At the beginning, twelve Gilliam monkeys (allegedly) produced a long list. (Think of a plane from the fifth element) and deliver it to Butch Bruce. It is called "what Bruce Willis did when he acted." It ends with a simple message: "Please don't do anything above. In my movie "<br /> <br /> There is a truth about this movie (indeed, of course). Gilliam doesn't have a hand to write. <br /> <br /> I assure you that both factors play a huge role. To create special achievements (If not commercial) that is The Twelve Monkey. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the Twelve Monkeys are what we expect from the Gilliam movie. Gilliam admires his audience incredibly. Although the end of the Twelve Monkeys will not be surprised that no one has ever experienced the first real thing, but Gilliam borrowed heavily from Kafka in the machinery yard. The character's movements were unceasing to their fate. It is this journey and the development of the characters that they experience are uncertain. <br /> <br /> I love the movie Gilliam (especially Brazil), but they all tend to suffer the same weakness. It seems that he has a lot of ideas and enthusiasm until his movie almost ends up in chaos. (Especially Brazil) I still insist that Brazil is the power of Gilliam's journey. But did not deny that the twelve monkeys breathed fresh air in the planning department. The matter and style seem to be combined in a way that has never been seen from the past. Boa <br /> <br /> Regardless of the above rumors, Gilliam managed well. (And unusual) from one bald Bruce is great in this film, like all the actors, especially those who are suitable - and very scary - Brad Pitt. <br /> <br /> For over a decade, the movie This story was launched. When I watched it again, I realized that it wasn't really old. Of course I changed And this makes me watch movies with bright eyes This seems to me to be a suitable tribute to movies that at least partly is about mirror reflection, changing perspectives and one-way journey that is ridiculous all the time we all do. First rate movie 8/10
