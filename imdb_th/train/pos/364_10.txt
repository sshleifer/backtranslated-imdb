The alteration of Steven Spielberg's popular novel Alice Walker was not caused by controversy. When the first black members came out to criticize the treatment of black men while others asked why white people directed the film about black women. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a woman. A black skin named Celie grew up in the American countryside after the turn of the century. She had two children by her abusive father who had been seized from her arms from birth. Her only consolation in her miserable life came from her sister. <br /> <br /> Celie (played in the following years by Whoopie Goldberg, a newcomer) is married to an inappropriate husband. (Danny Glover) Her sister is embarrassed, so she is quickly taken out of Sealy's life. <br /> <br /> The story is always sad when Sealy is hoping that one day she will return. Reunite with her sister and her children for life She met with a variety of characters, including Sophia, a strong wife for her son and a singer, a car that is loud and luscious, who teaches one or two stories about love. <br /> <br / > The direction of Speilberg is above this image, which gives great movie images and great performances. I dare you to watch this movie and not be noticeable! The Color Purple movie can capture the essence of complex stories. While it tends to reduce the lesbian aspect, including African stories, both of which are bright in the book But the movie is still a true theme that makes Alice Walker's voice shine through. <br /> <br /> I can't begin to respond to the arguments surrounding this movie. But to say that this is one of the few things that I can watch again and again, which makes me an indelible mark. <br /> <br />
