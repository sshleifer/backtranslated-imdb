The documentary began in 1986 in New York, where the black dragons and Spain held "balls". That's what they dress up. But they like to strut their stuff in front of the audience and get a vote We know many members and see how they participate and support each other. As one man said to others - "You have three attacks against you - you are black, gay and drag queen." These people are people who are not accepted in society. They can be anyone and whatever they want and be accepted. Then the film was cut into three years later (1989) and you will see how things have changed. (Sad for some people) <br /> <br /> Sounds depressing, but not the people who interview most are really funny and have a lot of humor from their situation. They are well aware of their position in society and accept it with humor - as they should. We find that they all live in "houses" run by various "mothers" and everyone helps each other. The feeling of the community in this film is interesting. <br /> <br /> When the film came out in 1990, it was a conflict - and was very popular. It won many best documentary awards, but never nominated for an Academy Award. Their reason is "Black drag queen and Spain are not institutional objects" that are interesting, right? <br /> <br /> Today, it's still a great movie. It's not like that anymore - NY that they show no longer. The ball remains But not in the spirit that we see here Dragging has become more "acceptable" in society. (Better or worse) and I heard that the house disappeared as well. It's sad. I want to know where these characters are now - I know that 2 people have died from AIDS. But I have no idea about others What happened to the 13-year-old and 15-year-old boy who showed? <br /> <br /> It's also an interesting, funny and sensational documentary. Must see all the way! Of course 10. Where is the DVD ???
