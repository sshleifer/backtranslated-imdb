The cute Danish actress Sonja Richter steals this movie from under everyone's nose, without any success, considering the performance around her. <br /> <br /> Richter plays as Anna, who is People with free thinking Neurotic actress (And possibly suicide) who worked hopelessly, caring for an older father named Walentin (Danish best actress Frits Helmuth, who died at age 77 after the film was created) <br /> < br> SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> Walentin refuses to respond to anyone - he must face Anna, a gifted, strange and mischievous person who brings back the evil demons from the bad Death Penalty <br /> Eric Cl ausen, writer / director / actor, has created a strong film about the hardships of a great business son (Jorgen, played by Clausen), loves his father who never accepted him. The film ends, but Clausen has something important to say about euthanasia, nature and the value of love and concern and the way Anna can not be suspended. A person can change the way Human life Highly recommended The performance of Sonja Richter alone is worth the entrance fee.
