I just watched disc 1 in the 4-disc collection (26 episodes) created in conjunction with UCLA Film & Television Archive (S'More Entertainment, Inc.) until now (other than Part 1). pretty good The DVD box will appear on the title page here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers" has the same charm as when I first saw (5 years old at that time) and Wally Cox was really that. Love this role If you are in a quiet, humorous mood that secretly enters you to slap your head, you will have to take this opportunity to experience the wonderful characters that you may remember from your childhood. Although some gags are somewhat repetitive But most are intelligent and able to perform well ... and even the court is still fun This is a TV drama that lives with my childhood memories.
