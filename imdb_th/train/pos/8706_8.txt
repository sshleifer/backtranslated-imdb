What will happen when the average Joe knows that he has supernatural powers? The evidence may sound familiar? broke? However, the Russian sci-fi action movie is the Sword Sworder, which is far from the standard stock. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a man named Sasha, who is a boy who is disgusted by his friends and family. Because of the supernatural power that he has When he wishes or gets angry, lets the sword stick out from his arm, penetrating his own skin. Wolverinish? Maybe ... but that's not the interesting part of this movie. Disgusted throughout his life and was driven by anger (And the emotions he has) "Our hero" returns to his hometown to change his life or find a reason The only thing he found here was the problem when meeting a new fan of the old flame, causing him to bleed on the floor. This is where revenge and anger come into play. This is the guy you don't want to cross and from this point the mafia and the police are on his tail. He met the girl and fell in love immediately, just like her, and this is what this movie is about. <br /> <br /> The film is very impressive with bold colors and whistling sounds. The This is a central art house, finely filmed with attention to detail in every scene, through scary action scenes, sci-fi. It's a strange grind that cares me a lot in this movie. The director's direction in this genre is refreshing, focusing on Sasha's emotional journey, not action movies. Don't worry, even if the action is there and there are many. However, most of these sequences illustrate the implicit severity of the frightening picture. This is not to say that the action does not appear. These scenes are here and excellent. (Especially the ending, where we see all the power of Sasha's release of despair), the director chooses to indicate the violence in many scenes to focus on the emotional struggle of the characters in the hand This is a tragic love story and refreshing music.
