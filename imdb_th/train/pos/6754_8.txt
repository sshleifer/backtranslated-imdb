Director Otto Preminger reunited with Dana Andrews and his Laura Stars in Gene Tierney in a rough film that is ready to make a loud voice: Where The The Sidewalk. Interesting drama, unexpected projection, intelligent dialogue and pleasing appearance when having excellent camera movements Dana Andrew plays the part of Detective Mark Dixon, part of a gangster and a policeman who has a reputation for being a tough body with a lot of criminals. After one case found Dixon to search for suspects and answers, he got more involved than he wanted. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrew is great in his role - tough and frustrated. Drew Dixon is ready to knock on their heels if they are next to him. He is the perfect anti-hero noir in the movie - he's not so good all the time. But we still take root for him. Gene Tierney works hard in her role as much as being a sweet shoulder. For Dixon, there may not be a role of Tierney. But she is superior to other things that others can do with that role by allowing all members of the listening room with a gentle smile, gentle and blinking. Supporting actors are not too bad - Carl Malden is the most memorable actor, stepping in and giving good support as Thomas. The end of the sidewalk is not Laura, but it is a great noir movie filled with characters, stories and great pictures.
