I have never seen a silent movie until July 24, 2005. I have never seen a movie with Mary Pickford. I've watched thousands of movies. Very little hypnotized for me. I found the Last of the Mohicans and Unforgettable (Ray Liotta) as a hypnotic person, so consider the source as you read. Who is Mary Pickford, who has been praised by many? I don't know what I am. Two hours later, I snapped it out and realized that I watched one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen. She had a role that fits her perfectly. Imagine a movie fan in 1922, without ever seeing anyone beautiful and showing before. You have to meet her over and over again. The setting is perfect for expressive women. She is weak, unable to speak English of the king. But you have to appreciate her It's a movie ... It's time to start my Mary Pickford movie collection!
