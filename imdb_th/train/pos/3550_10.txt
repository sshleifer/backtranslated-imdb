This is what music genre is made of. Humor, talent, romance and action all combined into one. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra is really wonderful. Don't have to say anything again Marlon Brando, though not a singer But did a great job by receiving the Sky Masterson award. The fact that he couldn't sing a song for his character Women in this movie are ok. But men in this movie definitely steal the show. <br /> <br /> It's a true classic that can be admired at all ages. It connects to all audiences and makes you smile and laugh. <br /> <br /> A movie to watch and enjoy!
