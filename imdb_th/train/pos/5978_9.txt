This is the real movie "80's": Back then, they might create more than 100 movies today and that makes them very interesting ... it's a cultural phenomenon that no longer exists. Today may be the same type of person that will make the movie "Video match" is cheap. In the eighties, making cheap porn movies. Porn seems to be selling However, it is above the medium-sized junk movie: it has a good and interesting story, and it makes me think In one scene, you can see the microphone swinging at the top edge of the image. Of course, there are a few small pendants from Ozzy and Gene Simmons, but they do not contribute to the movie "success" much, even if they perform well. The heavy monster "Sammi Curr" looks really scary, especially when he sings. One of the most terrifying monsters I've seen in horror movies I may have his nightmare the next night. Not recommended for movie lovers.
