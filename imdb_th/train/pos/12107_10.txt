I saw this movie as a child about the lifes feature when I lived in New York. It's an eerie movie but not as good as Horror Hotel. I just bought this movie on DVD and it's different from what I remember because on the DVD that I bought there were many scenes in which the actors speak French and / or Italian and No description Then the other actors answered in English in what was said to be kind of strange. In addition, in the DVD box, the names of some actors were different from IMDb. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film was broken Unlike Elsie's character, take off her clothes. Shot in one scene and another scene, Julia tries to force Elizabeth (Barbara Steel) to go out with her by pushing her into the bed and kissing her while Steele opposes. The scene is in the TV version. But has been fixed a lot I wonder what special videos can be combined with the model. Can an ultra-remastered? It seems sad that some of these low budget classics are cut a bit and sold in all edited versions. Where are the main tapes and videos that are not used? <br /> <br /> In addition to the first boredom twenty minutes before Allen is sent to the castle, the rest of the film is quite good. There are not too many special effects. (But Herbert's face after Julia is a good person) The atmosphere is creepy and the exotic and glamorous look of Barbara Steel makes the film better than it should be. I can honestly say that if Barbara Steel was not in this movie, it would be a big center. She made this movie ten!
