Antonioni showed that 'join' when he created this movie He went to work in America under a contract from the most lavish studio (MGM) and he created the most frightening image of American society that I have ever seen. When seeing the first hand of LA, this is the most accurate picture of a city where people are too hot and impersonal. If only Antonioni met Bill Hicks ... <br /> <br /> Burial in the studio is understandable after investment and frustrating returns. It is sad that people do not go to watch this movie anymore because I believe that Antonio has been proven to be correct. Here he predicted the end of the hippie movement / civil rights in American politics. Everyone is paying attention to what is happening in their pockets and expanding their living space in an unfavorable desert. I would love to see the interest in this film, being rearranged and selling extravagant DVDs. <br /> <br /> I ask people to watch Zabriskie points with an open mind and an open mind. We have a unique movie that comments on the turning point in the history of the most powerful country on the planet and we forget it. <br /> <br /> Unexpected gem
