After seeing Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, the actor should not show this idea until he imagined that he could approach Mr. Brett's image of "one of the most interesting characters in the literature". Jeremy Brett IS Sherlock Holmes and In my opinion, there is no other good actor Basil Rathbone. I must admit closely. But still is second One might make the argument that Mr. Rathbone's screenplay is inferior to the top production work like Mr. Bret and I agree. However, when everyone spoke and acted, Jeremy Brett would be the only actor to "become" Sherlock Holmes truly and forever. The book should be closed in this regard and we, the public, go out and enjoy the unique performances of Mr.Brett <br /> <br /> Bill Rogers <br /> <br /> (sonarman65@yahoo.com)
