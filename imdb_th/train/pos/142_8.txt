The second part (Episode 4-8) of the hit series in Denmark is slightly inferior to the first. But there are many laughs and fears as well. This time, Udo Kier plays in two parts, while his demonic and father-like son. The other notable part of this time is Køshshoj, a doctor from Søren Pilmark who faces a horrific revenge of Dr. Helmer and again, the patient, Druse, tries to solve the mystery of the Marple style. Ending with excitement and following the death of actor Ernst Hugo Järegård (Dr. Helmer) and Kirsten Rolffes (Mrs. Drusse). You wonder how they will be able to do episode 3, but I hope Von Trier will give. It is a sad shock. Mortensen Rotne Leffers Dishwasher # 2 Syndrome is dead. After that, look for Stellan Skarsgård in a cameo style ***
