Tess of the Storm Country is a Mary Pickford vehicle that I intend to receive sometimes. Finally I found a copy of the VHS at a reasonable price and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Mary gives her courage and sexy innocence to the wrong woman who wins the rich man's heir. Only this time, the stakes will be higher: illegal murder charges, illegal children (And in the case of misunderstandings) and contemplative suicide. <br /> This story is a true moral story that is a story that she loves to be starring in controversial topics. Not always spelled out clearly Do viewers have to pay attention and receive advice to capture everything that has implications for first viewing? Although everything will be explained more or less in the end. <br /> <br /> About the only negative word I can do is involve Jean Hersholt and the Herbert dog, who is the character of Bel. Nelet seems to weigh about 6-2, 200 pounds (bigger than next to Mary, of course!). He was sent to escape with fear when the 60 pound chocolate lab hit him! Then up to the top (Or perhaps proving the shocking fear of the dog) it managed to pin him to the ground and hurt him so severely that he was still struggling to get up later This is a lovely lab, too. Bed with Frederick (Lloyd Hughes) and hug with Mary! Nonetheless, Mary sprayed boiling water on Ben's face, which caused him to barely be slow! Ok, I've drained Ben and the chocolate lab! Apart from that, the movie is quite impressive and definitely interested in me. Pictford's supporting actors are strong and reliable. This is one of her best movies.
