I like Albert Pyun's "Nemesis" for magical actions and semi-complex scripts. A lot of people complain about the plot "confusion" in the first movie, which may be the cause of "Nemesis 2: Nebula". There is a hint of stone plot that has the same top action to bring Stick> This gave Alex the name of the first hero movie of a large number of superhero groups that were sent in the past to help the future. She was raised by a tribe in Africa. The good part of this movie is the dialogue in African language, without the narration which I like because it makes it look quite genuine. (How often did this type of movie try to do that?) It didn't take long for the evil Cyborg to have to go back in time to find her and try to kill her. <br /> <br /> Don't Understand me wrong, this is nonsense The first thing is great.) There are sub-plans related to the political unrest of Africa, treasure hunting and tribal fighting. The image is very short in the brain, so there is no such thing that has received very good treatment. That image is a fight that pulls out with a chase that makes innocent muscles and robots. It has entertainment value, do not expect the quality or anything of the first movie.
