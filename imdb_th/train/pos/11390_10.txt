The story and music (George Gershwin!) Is great. Like Levant, Guetary, Foch and Kelly have one thing that is missing and that is a good woman. I'm sorry Leslie Karon made me annoyed. However, even though she has a moving attitude along the famous ballet Oh, dazzling red, blue, green and yellow colors. Don't forget the beiges as well;) I just appreciate the difference between Beaux Arts Ball (completely black and white) and the best ballet. <Br /> <br /> So I think what I'm trying to say is: Please, all, see it and enjoy it, because even if it's not the best, it is a miracle. But must not forget that other Gene Kelly musicals with a 20-year-old girl that was cast as a star after that
