Red Rock West is a perfect example of a good movie without a budget at all. What you need is an intelligent script, a good actor and a lot of atmosphere. RRW offers all of this and much more. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage plays the former Marines who have been injured in Lebanon, which comes down to 5. The last dollar after being denied a job in an oil well due to a bad knee He has a role in Red Rock and is misunderstood by the bartender Wayne (JT Walsh, which is not terrible. But still a wicked person) for a killer from Texas Makes it look like a burglary Only when he got there just to check her She offered him to kill Wayne twice. Cage just wants to get the hell out of the city with his free money and let the lovers practice. But many mistakes and failures caused him to come and leave Red Rock. Eventually this led to joining with Lyle from Dallas (Dennis Hopper, who is so proud and sympathetic), a REAL killer from Texas who offered help without knowing that he was planning more complicated. <br /> < br /> RRW has never had a large version. Most viewers find it on video or on cable TV programs. Watching in this way may make it look like a TV movie. But it's bigger than that Slowly flowing, mood swings and desert storms will make everything a great movie in the cinema. But the best thing you can do is watch a DVD on a large HDTV. <br /> <br /> The only weakness of the movie that I can think of is Lara Flynn Boyle's boring girl. afraid Of course I won't fall in love with you. But if you think that Nic Cage's character is in a lesbian fight, you can accept it.
