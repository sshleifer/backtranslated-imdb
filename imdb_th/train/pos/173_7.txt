In fact, Goldie Hawn comes from Washington (Takoma Park, Maryland), but I'm talking about it. This is the type of Mr. Smith going to the Washington movie with some differences. But is the same evidence I taped this movie many years ago because I am very passionate about Goldie Hawn. The story is interesting. But it is very unlikely that some cocktail waiters will get important jobs in the government just because she saved the great life It makes me laugh and makes me angry at the same time. It makes me laugh because of some situations where you find yourself ridiculous. I have to laugh. (The spoiler is possible ahead) It makes me crazy to think that our government will set up an average citizen in the manner she established And her words are over ... beautiful. Unfortunately, there are not many people who dare to do that in real life.
