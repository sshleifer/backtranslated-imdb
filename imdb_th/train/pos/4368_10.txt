This movie is a very exciting romantic movie. I've seen it many times and never bored with it. Everything is true and a good plan. The actors are Liam Neeson, Jessica Lang, Tim Roth and Brian Cox. <br /> <br /> Actually, I like this movie the most. There are many exciting scenes. Watch out for the Bridge Bridge and the latest fencing scene. This is a good and surprising scene. <br /> <br /> Cute songs ... It's really suitable for movies. The setting is amazing.
