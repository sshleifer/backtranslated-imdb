Good ... easy, favorite TV series ever Call me with a clich√©. But includes violence, mafia, sex, gambling, drugs, etc. on the list and you already get points in my book Combine everything with a show that is superior to everything you've seen on a small screen. Add supervision that is suitable for vintage movie theaters and most writings that make you can't imagine. (And a few brains) Performances that are quite difficult to compete with <br /> <br /> Two actors are James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano and Edie Falco as Carmela's wife ... For Gandolfini he is perfect. With his performance The way that words cannot be expressed if you don't see him is Tony. But seeing it now, <br /> <br /> I can keep on getting all the characters to show psychological intelligence, capturing scenes, etc. But you can't stop me, so all I can say. Yes, this is about a specific performance along with Seinfeld that I can watch over and over again from beginning to end and end with even more enjoyment.
