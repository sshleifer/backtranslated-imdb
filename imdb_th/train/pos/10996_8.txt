Who can watch the movie, look at Lucy Liu and don't feel very happy? The girl is amazingly beautiful & a talented actor. That's a mix that is hard to find each day and Jeremy Northam. I hear his name many times. But I never noticed him My advice to Hollywood is: "Use him more." Now, <br /> <br /> Now about the movie: I watched it in changing my tomb. I do not recommend anyone It's quite complicated and mysterious for that. I still do not want to believe that I do not see that the ending is coming. I will not say what caused the hole film waste. Although this kind of speech is rotten enough, <br /> <br /> Now I should vote for me about this movie. I love the dark mystery story. The actors do very well. & I love the director (Natalie) working in the past. But there are risks as well What do you know? I just gave this work with 8 reasons why everyone should see this. Then again, the 1 point deduction makes the space for improvement always.
