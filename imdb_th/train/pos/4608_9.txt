Jackie Chan has been praised by many fans, movies and martial arts as one of the greatest actors ever in the silver screen and Police Story has made his reputation as a successor. The great Bruce Lee, if Enter The Dragon, separates the part called Lee's greatness in the 70s. You can talk about the same story about Police Story and Jackie Chan in the 80s. <br /> <br /> Forget Trilogy Rush Hour or any of his US efforts - a film that shows Chan's excellence, not to mention kicking, starting his status as a famous and talented Kung Fu player as well as a career. His movie A series of successful police films based on the current mainland Hong Kong <br /> <br /> I've seen many of his efforts as well as Rush Hour from the US, Rumble in the Bronx, The Medalian. And The Tuxedo gives the name - and many people honestly compared to the police story In those movies, we saw Jackie's version of 'Stupid', which did not get the opportunity to use his fighting abilities as much as possible without talking about the fight sequence that wasn't as good as the effort, such as Drunken Master, Police Story is the name <br /> <br /> sensational in this movie is the most unique and outstanding in action movies The mall scene is one of the genres and must have faith: the flying glass fragments Chan that was left outside the bus by his walking stick when the madman drove through the city streets. And Chan succeeded in taking advantage of inanimate objects and all types of bracing equipment as a weapon to fight bad people. <br /> <br /> Considering that he is known for assault and destruction Every bone in his body and put himself in danger of Jackie's perseverance in showing his versatility as an acrobat, without relying on anyone. His reputation as a Kung Fu expert Especially when he has a bruise to show So he has proved that he is not a female horse that uses trickery to think of new and clever ways. <br /> <br /> A wise story, nothing to talk about a lot. Lack of storytelling, it consists of end-to end actions and continuous fighting. For the conversation, it's not a big deal - which is the reason why most fans of Jackie's movies and martial arts are interested in action rather than a different story. <br /> <br /> Matrix without wires or CGI or any computer-related trickery What you see is what you get - and what you get from Police Story is the fantastic Jackie Chan epic, full of action and sensational performances. It's a better mile than Rumble In The. Bronx, Rush Hour and other American endeavors. <br /> <br /> Police Story is a great movie and is something I would like to recommend to anyone who is a big fan of Jackie Chan. But people who are not sure what to look at first
