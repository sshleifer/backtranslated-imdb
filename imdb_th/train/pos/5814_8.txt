When these things went down now with MJ, I started listening to his music, watching strange documentaries here and there, watching The Wiz and watching the Moonwalker again. Maybe I wanted to know more about this guy at I thought it was very cool in the last eighty years to make my mind, whether he was guilty or innocent. Moonwalker was a part of the biography, part of a documentary film that I remember going to see at the theater. When the film was first released Some have profound messages about MJ's feelings towards the media and the clear message of the drug is not good. M'kay <br /> <br /> Impressive visually. But of course this is about Michael Jackson, so if you don't like MJ then you will hate this and find it boring. Some people may call MJ as the person who gives consent to create this movie, but MJ and his fans will mostly say that he did it for the fans, which if true to him <br /> <br /> Real features The movie a bit when finally began to be just in 20 minutes or so, except for the criminals sequence. Smooth and Joe Pesci believed that it was all powerful psychotic drugs. Why did he want MJ to die worse than me? Because MJ heard his plans very much. Nah, the character of Joe Pesci, seduced that he wanted others to know that he was a drug dealer and so I didn't know him. Will just hate MJ's songs. <br /> <br /> Many good things in this, such as MJ, become cars and robots and the speed sequence of all demons. In addition, the director must have patience with the saint in the filming of the kiddy Bad scene. Usually the director hates working with a child with a complex dance scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > Bottom line. This movie is for people who like MJ to a certain extent or another. (Which I think is the most part) If not, stay away from it. Try and send useful messages and MJ's best partner in this movie is a woman! Michael Jackson is one of the most talented people in the world. But is he really wrong? Well, with all the attention I have given to this story .... Well, I don't know because people can be different after closing the door. I know this. He's a good person, but stupid or is one of the most sick liars. I hope he is not the latter.
