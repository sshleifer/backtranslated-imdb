Chance is a charming romantic fantasy about a woman (Cybill Shepherd) whose husband (Christopher McDonald) is killed after learning that she is pregnant. Then we saw the husband in heaven giving him the power to know that he was taken too fast and his wife needed him. He said he could return to the world. But unlike himself This movie is a small, predictable story ... the story goes wherever you expect. But it is attractive to powerful actors (Especially the shepherds and downeys) that you can't help with. Fun. Shepherd rarely appears on the screen for better benefits Able to support roles A cute and charming fantasy that will make you passionate.
