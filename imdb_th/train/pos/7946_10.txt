This movie is a true masterpiece. It's true. It is difficult for you to find a warm heart, full of fun, laughter, sadness and with a small drama that will help you stay with your feet. <br /> <br /> True family movie Homeward Bound tells the story of three brave pets who travel across the Rocky Mountains to try to find the owner according to the changes they face and the obstacles they encounter between One of the truly remarkable things about this movie is the ability to give human beings to animals - the voice acting is good. The shadow is an excellent character, old, wise and brave, and watching him trying to save the cheeky life in the river is a powerful moving moment. Chance - Who doesn't love dogs like Chance? The cutest that ever appeared on the big screen And cheeky, very witty for cats - she had me sewn when she mocked the goalkeeper; 'Kitty, this kitty kitty ... not in your fat life' <br /> <br /> There are also many emotional scenes that make out like Sassy is crossing the waterfall. (I'm really scared of you), Shadow falls in the ditch (almost tears). Then the wonderful ending. When all three pets return home ... including the good old shadows! <br /> <br /> Forever favorite - everyone who doesn't like this movie must not like animals. Rent or buy now and it will give you a happy memory that will last forever.
