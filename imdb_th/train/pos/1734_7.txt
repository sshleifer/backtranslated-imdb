I just saw this movie for the first time and I like it. Her dance was very fun. I read somewhere that she was involved in this movie because she knew how to dance. The scenery is excellent as well. Yvonne is a talented and beautiful woman. We laughed stupid kiss scenes. But that's a great thing about old movies! I grew up with her at The Munsters and I enjoyed watching her in her previous movies. They may not be the best in there. But still worth watching your performance and singing I'm slowly buying all her movies and watching them when I get them. I have a large collection of her souvenirs.
