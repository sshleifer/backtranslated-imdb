This is one of my favorites all the time. It's simple and sweet. Sure, it's a romantic romantic comedy. I like movies that are full of good words and this thing has it ... One of my favorites is when Albert Einstein speaks to Ed Walters "You're thinking of what I'm thinking" and Ed says! " In my opinion, a great movie if you can watch it again and again and get the same amount of enjoyment and with this movie you can !! I like Walter M.s a lot to draw Einstein. I think all the characters are really good together and the story goes well. There are many times that I find myself smiling with this movie and talking about what I like while watching! I would like to recommend this movie to everyone who has a heart and is happy with the romantic comedy feeling right now!
