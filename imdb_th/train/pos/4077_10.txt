I saw it back in the early 1990s on UK TV. I didn't like it. But I missed the opportunity to tape it for many years But this movie always stuck with me and I was desperate to see it again. Which is attached to me is the end of the castle, really touching me. It's easy to see But everyone will have their own The best bit to go with them when they see it. The animation is top notch and beautiful to watch. It shows some age. But now it's part of beauty. I'm glad it's coming out. On DVD because it is one of the top 10 movies of all time Buy or rent it, just see it looking best at night, alone, with drinks and food that is accessible so you don't have to stop the film.
