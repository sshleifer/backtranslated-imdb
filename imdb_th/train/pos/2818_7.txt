"Dragonlord" saw that Chan had returned to the role of "Dragon" from "The Young Master". Not many came from the first movie, although his "tiger" brother had no place to see. Not Marshall, his daughter or son, played superbly by standing in the original movie. Dragon has the same master - assuming all other students move to do other things. (The laziness of the dragon in practice shows heavily in this film, so maybe he still is studying!) <br /> <br /> The name is "Young Master In Love". This movie sees the dragon. (At least sixty minutes first) The villagers in the form of silly and hurt. His rival for her love is his friend. (Unsuitable name "Cowboy") played comically by the longtime member Chan Chan Stunt of Mars. We saw the scenes in which their stupid plans come back. It was one of these scenes that we (thank you) met with "dragons" in his head. <br /> <br /> This film is famous for the failure of the box office expectations. In other words, I am confident that the expectations are quite high and I feel that this film has never had a fair judgment based on its advantages. But even when I tried to do this, I still felt that there was a problem with this movie. It seems that it doesn't focus at all. Sometimes it is hustling and I think that the action is too scattered and not as good as other Chan's works at this time. <br /> <br /> The thing that keeps this movie is Ending sequence Like in "The Young Master", there is a fantastic final wheel full of incredibly weary action. You feel the explosion every time. And once again, Chan and the same opponent from "Mr. Young" (is it the same character?) And the time and energy here is excellent Chan's style of using all his last surroundings to help defeat his opponent - not only relying on pure physical abilities - only the barns that they fight are full of intelligent jokes. And improvisation This is the absolute highlight of this film and is one of Chan's incredible careers. <br /> <br /> There's no need to see a prequel before seeing "Dragonlord". Ask more questions than I expected. But I must say that the original movie is a great movie and "Dragonlord", focusing on chasing girls and playing as a team seems to be baffling. Fortunately, the few fighting scenes that it has (Including the amazing chicken shuttle scene) pushed over the line as a movie to watch in this genre
