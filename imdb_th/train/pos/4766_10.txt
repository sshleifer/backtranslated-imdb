It is unusual to see a movie in which a single actor's performance is so good that the person feels that the movie is a little interesting, if not without him. <br /> <br /> Even without direction Distinctly - in fact, there are many scenes that seem to be shot too fast and not careful - a low budget. It seems strange about a man who wants to come to Tantra. The problematic monk and one week, the presence of Pierre Fresnay is so impressive that everyone is shocked from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> I have never seen or can't find Io Jin for A better future, even Paul Scofield, which starred in "A Man for all seasons." <br /> <br /> Actually, the end may be considered ridiculous. If Fresnay doesn't play the transtorned priest who returns to the church Making a crime <br /> "Je suis Maurice Morand, prètre catholique" ("My name is Maurice Morand Catholic ") speaks in the sense that anyone may forget the madness The other impressive thing that this movie has is the only scene in Morand - which, despite being defrocked, is still a priest. Change into the blood of Christ. <br /> <br /> Gerard - someone who wants to return Moran back to the church or replace himself - must drink if he doesn't want to leave in the cabaret. He did so amidst the cheers and applause from people who thought that he drank three-quarters of the grape juice at the same time. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, the conversation between Morand and the garbage collector was amazing. also "Did you bring a man with you?" Asked Morand, who hated himself for what he had just done. "That will be too much work" is a wise answer. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie is not worth the comment. But it is worth seeing because of the strong atmosphere and strange emotions created all the time. <br /> <br /> I think "Le défroqué" is a very strange movie But must be for all viewers to see - if it is a good Catholic, it is mandatory - because it is a very rare jewel in film history. <br /> <br />
