Many people judge it as a fan service movie because many high-level actors star in this movie (Gackt, Hyde and Wang Lee Hom are famous singers in Japan), but don't judge before you watch, that's what I am. Saying Gackt and the team are very serious when creating this movie and they work very hard. It's a good movie that has a compelling story. Many scenes are fun and some people are sad. They do it very well until I can't stop watching it again. <br /> <br /> This story can be written quite well. But I agree that their actions are a bit disappointing. This is a special issue for Hyde because his acting ability is under control and it is strange to hear how to speak another language except his mother tongue (Japanese), but it is understandable because this is the time. <br /> <br /> I think Gackt is trying to show us that someone is weak when they lose the most important person in life when Toshi is killed. When Sho asks Kei to change Yi-Che to be a vampire like him, because he will not let her die when Sho's brother dies. Kei Shoot Son dies and the best scene is when Sho passes ~ even though I say skill. Hyde's still strange But I gave him twice in that scene. <br /> <br /> There was a time when the plot would be too early as they didn't tell the reason why the son had joined. The local mafia and the enemy of Cho, because they are good friends in the past and the son is Cho's brother-in-law. <br /> <br /> No matter what, I love this movie ~ (very ^^) <br /> <br /> This is an action movie with an impressive story.
