Dirty Sanchez is the extreme English version of the Jackass, in which the four boys (Pritchard, Dainton, Joycey and Pancho) go so far to hurt and disgrace. The reason that this performance is better than Jackass is because the most sensational performances are not planned, which makes the reaction more funny. There are 3 performances, which will first follow them around and look at their lives like There are stories about their love life, other jobs, second series, sending children to try different careers. Third, according to their European tour It seems that the children are getting more and more courageous when the list goes on respectively. In my opinion, the third set is the best. But believe me when I say, if you have a stomach for a week, do not watch because you are light to see the blood and puke in every episode.
