This movie is a name that is exactly as described - an attempt to let you buy what the writer offers. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's so much fun to see Toronto 1996, the way I do. Remember all Silly hairstyles, sunglasses, clothes and attitude It didn't change anything. Is a city with beautiful water, safe, cheap and small, which is a great meeting place for foreign movies! In addition, it's fun to see Kenny and Spenny heading to LA and find that it is Toronto again, only for beach lovers, musicians, fortune tellers and many other movies. <br /> <br /> I don't see Pitch as a fun movie. It's not entertainment unless the audience enjoys watching the inspiration of someone who is trampled. I choose to use Pitch to warn that the power and money are really controlled by the studio executives and the production house (and " Success. ") Writers, musicians and actors are still only a moment, even if they have reached a great moment. <br /> <br /> So Kenny and Stenny are trying to sell warnings. For you to buy or But the message is still there.
