I love this movie very much and the audience I saw in Los Angeles After this movie, a lot of people cried and said how much the movie had affected them. I can see why it has been very popular in Sweden. This film is expertly directed and each character is drawn wisely so you know these people and pay attention to them at the end. Music is a song that is natural and is the main song in this film that causes heartbreak. But inspired Will definitely recommend this movie to everyone - even those who do not go to see a movie with the name Deserving an Oscar nomination for sure because the film's deep story is reflected without an excuse in the small town community that has people every day It is a movie that gathers us in this separate world and shows us the potential of the human spirit.
