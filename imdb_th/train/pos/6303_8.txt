When hearing positive comments and seeing examples, I had to watch this movie with William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell showing that it must be good. And it delivered Overall, this movie is not funny like you, but there is one scene that is outstanding and classic in my eyes. At the end of the spoiler they penetrated the wall to go to safety and we saw Rockwell and Washington stared at Jeter. This is as good as the scenes in The Big Lebowski at The Dude. But forget the door to the outside! END SPOILER Go to see this movie, you will not be disappointed.
