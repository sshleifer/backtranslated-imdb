I recorded past ages But there is only a round to watch today I'm sick so there is nothing to see! I'm glad I saw it and I can delete my memories and see me again for the first time. This movie is great! It reminds me of the very fried green tomatoes at The Whistlestop Cafe. <br /> <br /> The story goes back in time and at the end of the movie we see what the connection is. Some people say that this is a movie for children. I disagree - probably done by Disney and many characters are children, but I'm 23 years old and I love it! There was a time when my spine was tingling. The story is different from other movies today, full of adventure. I just ordered a book from amazon. Can't wait!
