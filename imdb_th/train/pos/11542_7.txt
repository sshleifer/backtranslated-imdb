The first time I saw this thing, I didn't laugh too much. At that time I was only fifteen years old and thought that maybe some deep humor might be too old for me to understand at that time. I had the same reaction when I watched for the second time a few months ago, and this time because of Felix's suicide attempt at the beginning of the movie, making it slightly darker. This scene makes some things that Oscar speaks and does with Felix in this film, looks cruelly unnecessarily and the clash of their personality is not as fun as it used to be. If I still do not know this, I will be worried that Oscar's comedy with Felix may push him across the border. As usual, it didn't make me laugh or smile like a television show with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall. Even so, everything was a good movie and it received one of the greatest sitcoms on television. 7 of 10
