Cyborgs are sent to the present and they actually kill Bill & Ted. They have to travel through heaven and hell to help themselves and the future. <br /> <br /> Directed by Peter Hewitt (Tom and Huck, the borrower) Create a sequel that is clever. Funny and more fun than the original. A good Widescreen (1.85: 1) and Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound adjustment. DVDs have dramatic and fun examples behind the scenes feature. The sequel to this film is a box office-like movie, but it is (believe it or not) one of the best sequels ever created. (Depending on your view) George Carlin recouped his role from the manuscript in brief. Pam Grier also appeared in a minor role. It's a fun fantasy comedy movie (**** / *****)
