I just watched this movie for the second time on television. It's cute, warm, sensitive, very romantic. I don't see a better actor able to reveal their movements and gestures to others. - Sybil, Bill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neill, Robert Downey Jr. And especially Mary Stuart Masterson, just to beat himself Masterson may have the toughest and cuteest role. <br /> <br /> This movie is in the veins of both romantic movies, like while you Was sleeping when Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle and "high gimmick" movies like Big, Back to the Future Peggy Sue married I hate to say this because this actor is great and I never change them - but I think it's not as successful as the movie mentioned above because the box office attracts actors. Not as good as Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox and Kathleen Turner at the time of filming. <br /> <br /> It's not a great writing - such as the character's string is not particularly memorable. But it was done for perfection. <br /> <br /> The romantic years are truly evident. The "feelings" of people who fall in love are finely communicated, immortal love and perfection. Of sweeping the feelings of loss, sending. Over and over again, you will find yourself moving. In fact, the movie is comparable to Made in Heaven - romantic ambition. <br /> <br /> See - it's cute.
