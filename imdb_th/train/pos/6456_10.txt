My expectations are quite high for this film. Everyone I know who saw this movie at the cinema told me that everyone who was there passed credit because they were very impressed. My expectations will not be higher than this. There is nothing short of wonderful. Will disappoint me. <br /> <br /> I can be anything. I like to deal with difficult things without having to follow the usual steps that Hollywood movies tend to be. In this film character works through the problems they have for decades. They work through prejudice. They learn to turn. But it doesn't come easily and isn't just singing or two songs It's painful. It took the argument to confront. It feels like real life. <br /> <br /> One scene that really affected me was the scene where Gabriella sang her. Helen Sj√∂holm is one of the singers that I like, her voice is cute and you can tell that she's not just syncing with the previous recording during filming. (Which I often found in other movies) She really sang with her body, spirit. You can feel how Gabriella feels in that scene. If this movie was created in Hollywood, her music would be the right song to the end, and it would make her husband open his eyes and see the errors in his way as well as make Other people in the village are aware of a variety of things or two, but it comes through half way and does not bring any solution to the problem. the More open houses It's beautiful, pure and impressive. But did not solve all her problems miraculously That gives me a real feeling that may be something that happens in real life. The whole movie feels like real life for me. Nothing elaborately wrapped. But everything is happy and happy You rarely find movies that feel real. <br /> <br /> There are some things that bother me. But hey, there's no perfect movie If you haven't already, you should go and see. "Like in heaven" and filled with joy for life, the feeling of hope and the feeling that you experience the movie level almost never reach. You will be sad, hurt, and have ten other emotions and emotions. <br /> <br /> Someone once said that if everyone in the world sings, there will be no more war. When I saw this movie, I might have to agree.
