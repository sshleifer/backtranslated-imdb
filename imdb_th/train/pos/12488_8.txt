I'm not picky about horror movies and I'm happy to watch them quite a lot. That doesn't mean I am happy to see many other people or that I will not criticize them. This movie is creepy and very well done. In fact, I think this movie will make a wonderful double charge with session 9. I started watching it before going to bed and spent about 15 minutes before I knew it was very effective. Too, so I saved the rest in the morning Even while watching in the daytime it was still creepy. However, I cannot guarantee that it will be effective when watching a large group. <br /> <br /> After the death of their daughter, the couple moved to a remote cottage. This deal with death I want to record this death - this is one of the rare movies that doesn't shy away from the death of a child. This is much more important because both couples set the tone as well as explain most of the performances that penetrate the movie. <br /> <br /> The couple didn't do anything The wife is distant from the relationship and her husband is doing what he can to try to bring her back. While some comments have complained about their performances - one states that they act more like father and daughter than husband and wife and that is legitimate. He tried to make her more direction. It is a role that men sometimes use. <br /> <br /> There are many fears in the movie and most are not serious even though there is something wrong. My own story gives a very straightforward feeling for most movies and turns near the end. Although the turn is not ridiculous. But it's not what you expect from things that keep moving. <br /> <br /> The mood and atmosphere are very good for something that seems to be taken in the video.
