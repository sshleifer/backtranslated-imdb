You spend most of the time in a two-hour movie wondering if "What is the story about the lead character?" <br /> <br /> Will Smith as "Ben Thomas", the low key will make you guess 20-25. The last minute is when you discover it. It is very shocking .... but you know that something amazing is going to be revealed. Until that time, Smith played it almost to stalk people. You know that he has a good reason to do that. But it never really has any explanations anymore. So we guess until the end. <br /> <br /> All of it includes opening / closing again with Rosario Dawkins ("Emily Posa") May make some viewers feel frustrated or want to leave this movie ..... but not because the longest segment makes all parts of this puzzle together <br /> <br /> This is a two-hour movie and Not the movie Will Smith, which is a movie Cool action-filled action. In fact, the most shocking thing is to see Smith's sad face throughout this story. It doesn't look like him in many shots. He seemed to lose weight and discomfort. Smith did an excellent job of showing men with a lot of sadness. <br /> <br /> Like a good movie that will always do.
