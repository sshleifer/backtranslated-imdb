I think this movie is a masterpiece. But I have to take at least 4 o 5 times to see it First of all, it describes the face of WW2 that we have never seen in Hollywood movies. In particular, the German military, the army and the Nazi government show that "human" is more. One of the most impressive facts is the mention of the end of the film about the murders that occurred in the forest over the last 20 years Come ... The forest is the place where the last chapter of Berlin Alexanderplatz takes place: that is the forest that Rheinhold kills Mie. Another clue for those who like details is the representation of the door. Fassbinder is obsessed with the change of people every time walking across the door or opening the door. Many doors appear on the screen, open and close. And the characters change according to their personality, actions, etc. whenever they happen Did you notice?
