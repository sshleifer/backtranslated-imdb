The movie "Amazing Mr. Williams" was performed by Melvin Douglas, the director of five films in 1939, one of which was Nineteka and Garbo. His collaborator is Joan Blondell (Maxine), in which ALSO has filmed five movies in that year, three stories that they do together! Douglas is Lt. Williams and he and his colleagues are presented with a corpse and they have to figure out what really happened. The audience will remember his co-worker (actor Clarence Kolb, Donald MacBride, Don Beddoe) Always plays the authority position ... Senator, President, Police Bank Those who are stupid are witty, funny - police often throw jabs together, and even Williams and his girlfriend have to fight verbally. Some jokes - Williams also brought the man they were arrested to date with his girlfriend. There are so many fun things to go through the slow start and wait for something more fun later. Don't want to give out any spoilers, so you'll have to catch it in Turner's classic movie. Director Alexander Hall was mostly a comedian and reportedly engaged in Lucy on some issues.
