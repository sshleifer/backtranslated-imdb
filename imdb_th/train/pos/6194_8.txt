Henry Fool surprised me I didn't expect it to be entertaining and fun as well, or as severe as I did. Faye Grim continues to surprise the story that doesn't seem to want. When the audience watched the first 20 minutes of the movie, but realized that this was one of the sequels of the best indie movies. At least as good as Ginger Snaps Back. If not better, <br /> <br /> I'm a bit disappointed that Jeff Goldblum's part is very small, but I'm glad he is part of this short run. He has confidence and pleasure as a fullbred agent. Also happy is Liam Aiken, who plays Ned Grim, the son of Fay and Henry. <br /> <br /> The film is happy for many reasons. For example, I'm glad to find that Henry is not the loser he looks like. (At the end of the fool) and discovered that he was actually a genius ... well, that's really cute The rhythm of the pen <br /> <br /> I hope they do one third ... like the end of the trilogy. Seems to disappear They should give Nedfalggrim the name and it should be Liam who is looking for his father to check out the wonderful changes in his mother and the sense of genius that is close to himself. Of course, Faye continued to suspend the most important facts from her son about his father. Feel like having to do it. I'll buy it. <br /> <br /> Even if there is more movement. It's more drama and intrigue ... Strange mystery. I'll watch often. <br /> <br /> Rate 8.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend:
