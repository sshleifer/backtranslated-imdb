I think this movie is very fun. I watched this movie with my wife before I had my first child. So I didn't watch it. It's just entertainment for the family and I still enjoy it thoroughly. It seems that many critics point out that this movie is not a shattered film. But no unexpected plot changes If these people are watching this movie, expecting to receive religious experience, then they will be clearly disappointed. This is just a cartoon movie. Nothing more If you want to watch this movie, just sit back and let yourself be entertained. You won't be disappointed. In closing, this is not the best movie that Disney does, but it's fun and I don't understand the bad reputation that has been received
