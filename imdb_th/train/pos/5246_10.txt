This film deserves 10 for drawing beautiful pictures of the world with the experience in the mind of Playboy. While I found that the world was morally disgusting, this film did the best that the storytelling should do, and that is bringing us through experiences that had never happened before. Tim Meow's portrayal of Leon Phelps and the story attracts me into Leon's careless world. I forgot for a while that I was watching a parody of the Playboy world. Here is the cancellation of the movie because of the great success and courage to tell the story from the price of its own success. Understanding that most movie viewers will respond to the story of this film that is set on the surface and reject it. I hesitate to misunderstand them and accept that I love it. I love it not only But for an interesting insight into Playboy's delusional heart, not only But will show only the amazingness of the driver's stupidity In addition, it is a joke.
