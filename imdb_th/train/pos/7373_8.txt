Before the usual comments, my main curiosity about this is not a love song, while having time to work on IMDb 94 minutes. A DVD from Wellspring Media in the United States takes 88 minutes. Any comments about this thing are popular. ! <br /> <br /> Two friends who have a very rough life must travel for adventure. The thing that they wind up in is that only one person accidentally shoots a woman and the two escape by walking into the countryside. Instead of just being a big chase, this film is complicated by Dave and quite innocent, improper and clutching his boom box like a teddy bear. Some viewers may not like the story with Spike characters. Sole But without increasing the frustration of the story, this movie would be too easy. You will notice that the more stable character Heaton means Spike as "the big man", which is contrary to Spike's attitude and "kid out of control" behavior. Frankly, I exacerbated by the actions that The ridiculousness of Spike, especially the spray, can be inhaled. But in a hopeless situation, it is obvious that someone in his mind will choose to escape temporarily, but Heaton is there to monitor things until things go through his head. <br /> <br /> Kenny Glenaan, because Heaton is a miracle, and after a while I stopped wondering. I wanted to take Spike out of jail and continue my friendship because of Glenaan's great performance. Finally, there are many reasons. During their run, which is a good idea for Heaton to leave Spike and try to help himself. I think Heaton feels like a brother who protects Spike and loyalty between the two is hard to break - until things go <br /> <br /> While some movies are real art Add flavor to the story instead of just the image of a man running through the wilderness. Beautiful landscapes, rain, and vast gray skies offer an orange tone that adds to the feeling of a sad situation. The score is also unusual and using the song "This Is Not A Love Song" of Public Image Ltd. and because the name of this movie is quite smart. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is understood that You don't care. This song is not a love song because it focuses on two different personalities that escape from another man who is determined to hunt them. (Played by David Bradley, who is cool and quiet) It's not entertainment with a limited budget for the rest of us who enjoy searching for small and amazing things. It's a worthwhile time and it delivers. Tense moments that cause you to hold your breath. <br /> <br /> I enjoy Movies that came out of Scotland recently with the Dog Soldiers and The Devil's Tattoo movies. I am also slightly grateful for the narration presented on this DVD because the accents are sometimes fast and difficult for some audiences. People like me to understand <br /> <br /> Annoying, dark and stressful, this is not a love song, a sad and lamenting melancholy story. <br /> <br />
