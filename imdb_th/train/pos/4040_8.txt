Creative and meticulous exercise in claustrophobia Japanese thriller that creates a challenge for yourself by installing two rooms. Not completely successful But tense, surprising and effective May find that this movie is quite reminiscent of SAW? Two men stuck in a room and a hole together? But unlike the film that dared to live with the location and keep the hero in the cell throughout the movie It's like watching a lab experiment. Some people may find boring suspicions. But this investigator found that it was a slave The sound and imagination of the movie has been well accepted. This is a good movie to use to show a good home video system. Suitable for late night film festivals when someone is in a paranoid mood. It certainly made me wake up that night.
