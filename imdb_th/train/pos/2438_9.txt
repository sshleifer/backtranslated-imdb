This is an amazing show from Lead Cunningham, Orla Brady and all supporting actors. This film raised not only But relating to the history of Ireland and Ireland only But also many communities around the world and many wedding agencies within those communities With violence and sincerity, the film shows how religion and traditions push the love and passion of the family. The name "Love Divide" cannot capture it better. Although it is true and happened in Ireland on the 50th day of seeing that the lives of both villages eroded and "pogroms" began to remind Russian history Tolerance and prejudice are still too powerful in the world and unfortunately it is hidden in human nature. Like in the movie, the character of Liam Cunningham said "Hate is always under the floor." It is interesting to see the moral choices that people make in this story. The character of a Catholic priest and what happened to him at the end of the story is very meaningful. However, the story gives hope that the love of two people can conquer all things and love makes us stronger. Liam Cunningham's character passed all the changes in the path of being the person he wanted to be. Performing again is considered the ultimate. The story is fast. Ireland's countryside is as beautiful as ever. Highly recommended
