I gave this movie 7 out of 10 because the villains were interesting in their roles and the unknown Batman created an interesting "guessing" game. He appeared in this film at first and periodically throughout the rest. I always thought that the new animated series created justice for the new Robin characters. This movie still maintained a bad tradition. The movie spends too much time with Bruce Wayne and his love affair, which is not bad in a movie if love is unbelievable. It is still a good movie if you are a Batman fan and I would recommend watching it.
