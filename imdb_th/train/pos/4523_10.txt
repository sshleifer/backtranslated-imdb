When I heard that Adrian Pasdar was dragging in this film, my expectations for me to watch this movie were low. The only reason that gave me the opportunity is the beautiful Julie Walters and my friend's advice. <br /> <br /> What I thought would be the "Mrs. Doubtfire", a kind of song that became gentle and funny Is reliable and sympathetic as an ambitious businessman who wants to release his female part with a cross dressing on occasion He sent these needs to the audience in a way that was widely believed. Julie Walters has a beautiful personality as well as the land owner who teaches him to love unconditionally.
