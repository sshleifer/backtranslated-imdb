It came out of the field on the left and actually was not what you expected, but I love that the most memorable movie experience comes from being surprised if you ask me. If you haven't received the secrets of the mysterious "things" that make these siblings strange ... You are in treatment. <br /> <br /> The actors are great. It's clear. Nowhere (Seriously, it's a dark romantic joke until they do - then WOW) and they are great. The overall film is easy to see, editing and the sound is very good quality and the story is twisted out without a clich√©. While none of these aspects make it a blockbuster, but "what the hell" factor ALONE makes it a movie's treasure. <br /> <br /> People who beat this movie don't make sense. It is one of the most often overlooked flicks in the 90s that you never heard or loved so much that you jumped over their names. <br /> <br /> I'm in the latter group.
