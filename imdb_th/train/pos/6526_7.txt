I always like to watch this thing when it appears on television during important times every year. In the 60s, it was Hollywood's epic history around the world, lively, dramatic and full of inaccuracies. But what it was a movie, entertainment and movie that looked good Cecil B. DeMille, at the end of his life, was the producer of this film. In 1938, his son-in-law actor Anthony Quinn, who had the supporting role of Beluche in the movie '38 is the director of his first directorial and Swan song, as he had never directed the movie before. DeMille has compiled a team that has just worked on his 10 commandments to help Quinn pull it out, including Henry Wilcoxon, producer / director, DeMille for a long time. In addition, from the 10 commandments, including Jesse Lasky, film director, Loyalk Griggs, assistant director of Francisco Day, director of unit 2, Arthur Rosson, art director Walter Tyler and Hal Pereira, director Sam Comer and Ray Moyer, designer clothing Edith Head, John Jensen and Ralph Lester, as the costume design team, were nominated for the only Academy Award for The Bucharest. The best actors from the DeMille team are led by Yul Brynner as pirate Jean Lafitte and Charleton Heston as General Andrew Jackson in the future. In addition to casting, Charles Boyer, EG Marshall, Lorne Greene, Claire Bloom and Inger Stevens In just two hours, it will drag at some point. But created it with a wonderful fighting scene. I will give 7.5 out of 10
