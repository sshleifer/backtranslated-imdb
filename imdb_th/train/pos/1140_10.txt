I've been a fan of this movie for many years. Since Teri Hatcher moved to the front, I had to remove the film from the shelf and watch it. Why do people go back in 1991 so they don't see how this movie is more than me? Sally Field and Kevin Kline are great. Although I never watch soap operas in the daytime But this movie killed me every time I watched it The performance is second to none for comedy and writing is very smart. I suggest you look at this thing. If you haven't done it yet, you'll see Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher and Carrie Fisher ... to show a few names ... every great performance.
