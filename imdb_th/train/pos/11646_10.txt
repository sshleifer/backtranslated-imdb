This film, though, is one of the most favorite topics of Mexican producers: the extreme life in our city has a funny way to put on the screen. <br /> <br /> People Directing four Mexicans that are more important than in the past, approaching the history of our city in a variety of literary forms, because it may be funny or satirical, which makes us experience Topics in our country But lectures in a very different way that gives a fresh voice to him. <br /> <br /> With less-known actors But their excellent interpretation of each director reflects the story of the ability that we have been identified anywhere in the world, the ability to laugh, pain and To celebrate the sadness, many people in our country may not be satisfied with this movie. But I think people in other countries may find charm and share the realism of Mexican people.
