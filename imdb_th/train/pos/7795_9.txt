This will be a different review. I used to watch this movie twice on TV and wanted to have a copy because I spoke about Panama City and the beach during the winter, which is my favorite time to be there. It was the first movie I saw by Ashley Judd and she was great and I was happy with everything I saw. Sundance's reaction impressed me as well as director Victor Nunez Is directing and writing many films about Florida This movie speaks to me and I have never seen anything in comparison. The story speaks less than me around. I told you that it will be a different review.
