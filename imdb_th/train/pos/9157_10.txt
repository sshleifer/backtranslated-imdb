Jane Eyre is my favorite novel! When I stumbled upon this film in the late 1990s, I'm happy! This book is the best and most complete version! This model has a little length to sit in one place, but it's worth it. Timothy Dalton is amazing like Rochester. I'm glad they are ordinary actors. (Selah Clark) as Jane and not a charming person I like the set and location For anyone who is a real Jane Eyre fan, this is the version to watch !!! For those who are interested, I just discovered this version from DVD. I have watched my VHS almost cracked and I'm excited to find it on DVD
