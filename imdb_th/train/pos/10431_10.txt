I'm not sure what to say about this movie. Is one of only a few movies that I think is romantic To try to talk about the story or the show or the technical details about this movie must be in the words of Frank Zappa. "Like a dance about architecture" It hits the nail properly on the head in the way that it captures the fleeting moments in life that make us move and run away from us never having experience again. It seems that this movie will be the character of Charlie Coffman in the movie Adaptation that wants to write. The ending was left open and vague. No end. Here is just a mystery. There is no deep life lesson, only two young and intelligent children who are searching for the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic feelings ...... romantic love <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 Look with special women and recommend to strangers ................
