This is an incredible movie. I can't remember the last time I saw a Swedish movie. This is a layer. It's funny. It's sad. Attractive. And most importantly, living in a small Swedish town. It's crushing clich√©s and living deep. It makes you feel not only linked But with the main character But with all the characters Although the story is unique But with a new method The center of the story is the relationship between the three brothers. (On different stage of life) which is not very similar Or at least not knowing how close they are. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons that makes connecting with people in this film easier is an impeccable actor. First of all, I am very pleased with the fact that there is no Swedish actor named 'A-list' in this movie. There are usually a few actors who have the ability to find their way in almost every major production in Sweden. This time, the production company tries to make it true by casting actors who seem to love their careers. they Sophia Helin may be the first Swedish actress since Eva Rose to prove that you do not want words to convey emotions. <br /> <br /> Writing is attractive. The conversation is more convincing and compared to other Swedish films from a few years ago. Come to control everything from the start and if you don't know, you probably won't have a way to guess that this is the first time she wrote and directed a lengthy movie I can't wait for you to continue. <br /> <br /> When you start to see this, you really want to see it.
