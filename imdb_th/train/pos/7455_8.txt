Goldeneye will always go down as one of the most legendary games in the history of VG. But this game, although very different But may be the current Bond champion. <br /> <br /> This game is not a Bond game based on other media. This is a completely new story; Script game which even has its own song! (There will be no commitment. Haha!) The gameplay is great and if you are a Bond fan or movie, you will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Unlike most games. The members of the blog show their own character, which is opposite the creation of the game. Which gives a more cinematic feel With a story that can be bound, you will feel that you are in the game as much as you get lost in the movie. <br /> <br /> Have fun in every aspect from beginning to end. Even after winning the game, there is still a lot to do. With the ranking system and unlockable to achieve the same as many players' missions, this is an outstanding game. Even now it is quite old in video games It is still a good game that you can pick up and play whenever you feel the need to get more engagement in your life. Even now, just thinking about it, I have a theme song stuck in my head. The story starring the great writer <br /> <br /> The story comes to life on the screen as if the actors are the ones in front of you and everyone is as fun as the game. Can do superbly in a true bond Which can be named as excellent, totally wonderful. <br /> <br /> I have to start this game. If you haven't played, you'll miss!
