<br /> <br /> So if not being a poet, I have no way to convey the beauty and simplicity of this documentary. Goldsworthy's easy movement, as he forged the natural beauty in his own work, was charming. Watching him stick together on a web site hanging from a tree for a few minutes while he talks about his work and returns when the camera cuts to a wide angle. Was fascinated by his ease of use and then realized the uselessness when the small breeze shook the entire web. <br /> <br /> The genius of Goldsworthy seems to be unknown. It is in the major changes of nature that his work, even if completed in his own sphere, is complete.
