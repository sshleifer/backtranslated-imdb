Incredible flick from the "Walker, Texas Ranger" team contains the most unbelievable scenes ever in a television movie. In addition, we can predict results from going. However, it is a fun little movie that will accomplish the job: it creates entertainment. That is all that is intended to do and do so. The tactics and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot is not half bad. The performance is also good, which is not surprising, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is not Steven Segal. If you are a fan of the genre (and "Walker, Texas Ranger"), you will definitely love this thing. If not, don't waste time 8/10.
