This is the best and most original performance seen in the year. The more I watch it, the more I love it. Excellent actor, very good writing I like every character However, there are characters that are a favorite for everyone because of the combination of good personality and background as in real life. I believe ABC has damaged the writers, actors and potential audiences of this program. To cancel quickly and not advertise enough or give a real chance to receive the following There are very few items that I watch anymore because most TVs are very bad. This show, in my opinion, was there with what I liked. Gray, anatomy and brothers. In fact, I think the same audience for the brothers will love this show if they even know this. Why do the losers show that there is more time and winning programs with great potential will be discarded immediately? I'm tired of showing reality. I didn't watch them at all. It was very refreshing when there was a new idea for the show and then hired a great actor. This show had many promises. The latest episode is the best episode. But everyone started to participate and make the show come true Please see this item in the ABC video and let ABC know that you want to return this item.
