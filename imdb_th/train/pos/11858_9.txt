This movie is very good. If you have a chance to see it, you should run to see it. Although this movie was almost unrelated to its original since 1932, Pacino did a great job as Tony Montana, who will be around. <br /> <br /> Pacino has this way about he Makes it sound great if you think that Pulp Fiction is good with the oath (If you see it) You should see Scarface to see another angle that the actor can say. (It's quite sweet) <br /> <br /> Although the movie has a lot of action and the plot moves very fast over time without maintaining the correct real-time aspect ratio. But still easy to follow Must make your eyes peel all the time in order not to lose anything Personally, I have found that watching this movie makes three hours seem really easy. It's really wonderful. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the movies that have been well-directed and not directed. Only But only You forgot that this movie was created in the crappy 80s, but it makes you rooted for the bad guys ... "So say good night to the bad guy."
