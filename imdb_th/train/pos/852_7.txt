THE MATADOR is a hit-man lite movie .... If you can say that about hit-man movies, the violence never really appears, but is often used. At first I was scared. I was in the training of another hipster-black-hipster villain comedian in the mid-90s but was pleasantly surprised. Nothing is so exciting in this movie. But everything makes me smile The three leading actors have the best chemical qualities that the big screen offered in the past few years and it seems that they have a great time creating this movie together. The writing is sharp, though sometimes it feels as if the drama has been adapted from playing a stage because of a set of conversation scenes. This is a good movie that I may not remember for too long. But at that time it was a complete happiness Good movie
