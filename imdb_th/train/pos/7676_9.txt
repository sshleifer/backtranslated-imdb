Great! My wife and I joined a long line to see Holly at the Edinburgh Film Festival. After watching the movie, I can understand why it is so long. Holly is an impressive story about an impossible relationship between two people. She is a young girl. He is a weary western. The movie captures all the bones in our body. There are no graphic scenes or anything difficult to watch - it's a surreal story of normality that will shock you. This film was beautifully filmed. We like the scene where Patrick teaches Holly to ride a small motorcycle. The rawness of Thuy Ngoyen (can't believe this is her first performance) and Ron Livingston's performance is with me for a few days Highly recommended
