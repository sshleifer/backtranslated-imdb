The case of being in the right place at the right time Is an interesting movie It's easy to see why Chavez is so popular among his people. He has done all the things he can access. And it is easy to see why Westerners hate him so much He can control the resources in his country and return profits to the people. Mostly poor And easy to see how television stations can broadcast misleading images to be put in the box Like the Iraq war or the war on terror Or what is missing of WMD or how about the core of evil People have to wake up. And receive different views Stop the disadvantages of neo-world Go to see this movie with an open mind. And make your own mind up If so, I suggest you look at Aaron Russo: America: Freedom to Fascism, not the American people who are in trouble.
