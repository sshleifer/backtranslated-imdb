Johnny and June Carter Cache provide funding for this film, which is a presentation of the original story of the gospel. Great music. You will get a real sense of what the world of Jesus looks like. (I've been there already) and June came to be a part of Mary Magdalene with passion. The cash lecture is also good. <br /> <br /> But .... <br /> <br /> 1 The actor who plays Jesus is someone else. 2. No story like Cash makes his music. Faith 3. Because it's not great, I wonder if we will see this thing spread widely again. <br /> <br /> I like to buy CDs. <br /> <br /> Tom Paine Texas, USA
