This is a great movie creation job. It flows at the right moment. The soundtrack fits perfectly and is very pleasant to the ear. Comedy parts are more funny and created by the sad nature of this movie. <br /> <br /> However, despite the many comments about the natural tragedy of the story I enjoy it so much in the way that I've never met for a long time. It can be said that it is excellent and there is no general component of modern movies such as; Sex, violence and special techniques that are not necessary. <br /> <br /> 'Dan In Real Life' Nothing is without evil. It has a full plot that is not wanted and will definitely be destroyed by any additional embellishment at the same time, a theme for adults altogether. It's a work of art, both in and of itself that covers you completely and you need more than it offers. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that give 'Waltons' feelings. complete Long term while they compare the more unusual moments The rose color caused a tragedy, then gave to the beauty that turned darker, etc. The landscape that conveyed the mood of this emotional film creates the perfect balance and keeps the audience in a stable condition like lithium The peaks and troughs are gentle. <br /> <br /> I suggest watching this movie, no matter what you like, throw away any bias, because this is a must see!
