I just discovered IMDb and searched for this movie and I was very impressed with the opinions of everyone who saw this movie when I was 6 years or more in 1967? I saw it before the Jungle Book, so I was an eagle boy for a few hours. Then Mowgli next year I shed tears in the theater when the boy became an eagle and wanted to watch this movie again When we got home, we ate grilled chicken and I received a wish from the bone and guess who I want to be? My father said 'I bet you want to be a halftime' and of course we all know that the desire will break if someone guesses more tears.
