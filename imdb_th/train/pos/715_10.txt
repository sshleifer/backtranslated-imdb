Everyone who sat here and said that the weak link of this movie is Ramones, may say that Amadeus is okay if not for that annoying pianist. Rock and roll high schools are centered on Ramones. The way anyone can see and not get kicked out of Joey Ramone eating the backstage sprouts in an attempt to put him in a noticeable practical condition that is a wet blanket. Father's table - Ms Trogar explodes the white rat Hall patrols ... Classic immediately. Nevermind. Riff Randell <br /> <br /> If you don't like Ramones, you don't know rock and roll and you shouldn't watch the movie ROCK and ROLL High School
