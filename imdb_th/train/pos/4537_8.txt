I watched the movie for the first time on the BBC on July 27, 2005. For me, it was a good interpretation of the Conan Doyle person and I really wondered what Sherlock fans thought about this. I still think it is a movie for these fans, whether they agree or not. As mentioned, you may ask yourself, A.C. Doyle is strong or he questions. However, he is the creator of the famous Holmes. But how is it a semi-biographical biography? Not less that I will bring this modification forward. It's a movie that you have to watch - even if you're not interested in movies or books of Sherlock Holmes - see it. Enjoy yourself.
