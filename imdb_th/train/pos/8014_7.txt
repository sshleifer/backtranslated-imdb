But if you like stupid people, I challenge you to not like this person. In general, the same plot repeats. (This time, New York is not LA). It has a lot of tricks and muppet hi-jinx. Many muppets leave this movie quite quickly while it focuses on Kermy and Miss Piggy. I accidentally enjoy it a lot. Enjoy watching with your children.
