Must see for everyone who loves photography Beautiful and amazing, making you shocking. Saw it twice, one in the cinema and now onto the DVD It holds well on DVD, but on a large screen, this is something else. <br /> <br /> Take my two daughters to see this To see again tonight when she saw it at a video store, it was easy to say that children love nature and especially foxes can tell well. In some ways, it reminds me of bears in telling non-documentary stories. Which works well for children You are not being preached as important. <br /> <br /> But the star of this movie is a movie photographer. Just amazing amazing
