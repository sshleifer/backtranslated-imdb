The only time I watched this movie was when I was 10 years old. I remembered for many years because I couldn't sleep for a week or more after seeing it. It definitely makes me tremble. I went to rest with my aunt in Ft. Work, Texas and I will never forget it. Now, 48 years later, my daughter tried to get this copy so I could look as an adult. There is a lot of research to find out what this movie is. But I always remembered that Barbara Stanwick was in there and finally got the name and criticism. I was very fun but it made me quite shocked! Jaqui
