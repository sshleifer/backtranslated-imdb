This movie has something very amazing. First, it should be based on the true story. In itself, it's amazing that many tornadoes will hit the same city at night in Nebraska. I wonder if the real city name is close to "Blainsworth" (which is the name of the city in the movie) has Ainsworth Nebraska, but there are cities that start with Blains-something. <br /> <br /> It shows a tornado. The slowest movement in recording when seeing the children in the house. On the contrary, the scenes in which the TV is ambiguous are the basis of reality. Before Doppler radar and weather monitoring radio, we were taught that if you change your TV into a specific channel (Not the cable) and adjust the brightness correctly. You can tell that there is a tornado coming in. The problem is that when you will be able to hear it, <br /> <br /> When I know about a tornado in the middle of the west, it makes this movie fun for me. I enjoy it more than the Twister. I mean, let me take a break - there is no way you can do it through and F5 by bonding yourself to the pipe in a good house.
