Jane Austen's Emma is the most entertaining story of the worst times and the creation of this story is the best thing I have ever seen. Kake Beckinsale's Emma cannot be solved. Lettlow (with the help of good screenplay and excellent movie shooting) can bring comedy out effectively. She failed to make Emma a favorite. The Paltrow was not helped by the fact that her hairstyle was just 'wrong' for the part (and I believe that in those days) and she doesn't look good in the Empire dress. On the other hand, Kate Beckinsale easily handles jokes and can show that Knightly (the most romantic of Jane Austen's heroes) actually sees in her. Mark Strong Is a beautiful knight with a handsome look that combines age, courage, compassion and behavior. Emma and Mr Knightly gentlemen are supported by good actors and the production is quite overall. less happy
