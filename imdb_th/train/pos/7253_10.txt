Not sure who called it the anti-war movie. It shows the highest level of war. These are elite soldiers who know what they are doing and are proud of it. Although they are peace lovers, they still enjoy the level of their abilities and defeat their enemies, even if they resist being a popular peacemaker. The movie is slow and there are not many events, and in many ways it is quite believed that war movies continue to follow the current standards. There are no parts of the body that fly like in modern movies. It's cruel in other ways, even if you see killing on a personal level. This is a movie about men's thinking. When you start to watch, you don't want to miss anything. The ideas of men in movies and their interactions are what this movie is not about fighting itself or a big exciting story. This may be called war triller. <br /> <br /> If you have skills in war, if you read or watch programs about SAS and others, you want to watch this movie !!!!! <br /> < br /> Film comparison is The Hill (1965) with Sean Connery, 49th Parallel (1941) with all the actors, The Naked and the Dead (1958) and Cliff Robertson. All are unusual in their way and show war. On a personal level, enjoy!
