This is an excellent Sammo Hung movie. In fact, this is a great action movie of Hong Kong. The story tells the story of a tricycle driver in Macau looking for love and mixing with a fierce pimp. Great performances and characters are all pleasing and clear. The story is relevant and romantic, comedy, and suspicion enough to watch during the fight scene. Sammo Hung proves here that he may be the best fighting posture designer in the business. The action is especially great. The battle with Lau Kar Leung and the final scene of the drama Billy Chow and Sammo Hung is great. Must see for any fan of action.
