I really enjoyed this movie. Sometimes humor is missing. But I enjoy the story moving between drama and seriousness throughout the story. This is the only movie I saw Verdone's performance (the other is 'Un sacco bello') and I can see why the Italians found him boring. But he thinks he plays his role well like a dad. <br /> <br /> One of my drawbacks to this film is that I know it happened in Italy - I was somewhere in the center. Or south But I feel like there is no place This movie may take place in New York, Boston, Melbourne, New Delhi ... I always thought it was important that the movie had to have a place for the audience to participate. (Maybe I'll miss something?) :) If you like Italian movies, I think you will enjoy it, not Fellini or Rossellini, not true or neo-realism. It is a joke that has important moments that May happen to any one of us
