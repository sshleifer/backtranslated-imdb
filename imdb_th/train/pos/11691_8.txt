Great movie when I saw it Have to say that my favorite movie is forever I saw it like in the cinema 8 times and received a DVD. When I grew up and saw it again, I realized that this movie was normal. Comparing to movies that are well known, comedys. What is this? I mean, Rock is a hilarious person in this movie and the interchange with race causes little obstacles which are great. In addition, thinking that this movie is a good way of thinking It's like most of the movies. But it is an impressive little story I like movies as a whole, so I give ... <br /> <br /> Still good for me 7/10
