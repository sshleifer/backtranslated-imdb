I just don't understand the negative comments about this movie. Yes, it's a love story of a typical boy. But it was made with flair and shine that the time passed. Henstridge (talking about winning the lottery of genes!) Was magnetic and charming as always. (Who says the golden age of the cinema is dead?) And Vartan has his own chemistry. Both lead; This movie is the most lively when they share the scene - many! It works very well when you find that you are willing to unite ... <br /> <br /> Ignore negative comments - if you feel a little blue, see this flick, you will feel better. Much If you are happy then you will feel cheerful. <br /> <br /> (PS: I'm 33, a man from the UK and a desperate romance still searching for his princess ...)
