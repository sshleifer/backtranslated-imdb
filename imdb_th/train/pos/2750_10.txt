This is a type of movie that we don't do. That's why people rent movies overseas. It is a great story about how one person, even though he is mentally retarded, can make people find reasons for empty lives. Everyone can learn from Georges. In addition, it shows that people who are mentally challenged experience their lives and show them in a very realistic way (I think) as a classic movie abroad End the bittersweet But it only makes this movie better
