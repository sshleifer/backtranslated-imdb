Watch this movie at the Vancouver Film Festival and think it's a smart, stylish and funny story. <br /> <br /> The actor is ROCK SOLID, a great performance from Carrie Anne Moss, Dylan Baker, Tim Blake Nelson, Billy Connelly and Alexia Fast <br /> <br /> Strange. I found myself thinking about movies for many days after seeing it.> <br /> Writer Dennis Heath, Robert Chomiak and Andrew Currie is in many political lectures - but doesn't hit you over the head. <Br / > <br /> The world they created has depth. And makes sense There is a meat-eating spirit in this movie. <br /> <br /> FIDO guarantees to keep the discontent. <br /> <br /> Love it !!!
