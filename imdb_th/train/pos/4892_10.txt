This is a wonderfully entertaining and entertaining movie that I will never be bored with watching many times. The casting is beautiful in pairing with younger characters. There we are here who appreciate good actors and intelligent story style. For Judy Dench, she is beautiful and is a gift for all kinds of works she shows. I always point out Judi Dench in all of her performances. She is a great actress and is happy to see the changes of her characters. Each person lives up. I am grateful only when I see this remarkable image for most movies that just happened recently. There are good characters, good chapters. Public movies need a hero, not a deviant puppet that lacks intelligence and ability. It's wonderful to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine. I want to see this movie winning a deserved prize. Thank you again for the great entertainment night. I would like to congratulate the writers, directors, producers and everyone who has done well.
