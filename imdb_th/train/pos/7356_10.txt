If you haven't seen Eva Longoria from the TV show "Desperate House Wives", you can't miss it. Eva will be one of the biggest Latina celebrities and you will see her in theaters soon. This is Eva's first film. And she worked very well. She was 24 when she shot it and looked hot For this low-cost movie, it is quite good for the first director who will soon be making the movie "Juarez, Mexico" that is currently playing at many film festivals throughout the United States. In fact, it seems that there may be limited drama from some news. What is worth watching is "Snitch'2" with a higher budget.
