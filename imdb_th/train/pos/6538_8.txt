I really enjoyed this movie. It succeeded in doing something that some movies do now. It values ​​the family while entertaining me. Nancy Drew is the heroine for all generations and is a role model for young women looking for The little girl that I really enjoyed the movie and continued to talk about Nancy as we walked out of the theater. This film has quite a few problems for families and I don't think parents are bored to sit in the cinema. No, it won't win an Academy Award and it doesn't show amazing special effects or even scary horror mysteries. But it entertained me I would like to recommend this movie to everyone who has a girl. (She will love it!) Or book fans You will not be disappointed
