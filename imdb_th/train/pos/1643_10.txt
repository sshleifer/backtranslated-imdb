This is a movie that everyone should receive. If you want to watch a great performance, Mr. Torn and Ms Farrel do a great job. I think they should have it on TV again so that new viewers can enjoy it. A wonderful performance <br /> <br /> It gives a real feeling to what the pioneers have to go through both physically and emotionally. A movie that has never been heard. <br /> <br /> It happened when Ms. Farrel was very young. I always thought that she was a comedian. But this is not a joke and she is great. There is very little dialogue. But that makes it look more real. Mr. Torn, as always, has a wonderful presence and just his breathing has a good feeling. I have to watch movies
