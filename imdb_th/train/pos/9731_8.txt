Sidney Young (Pegg) moved from England to New York to work for Sharpe's popular magazine in hopes of living the life of his dreams. But struggling to make a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> Based on Toby Young's book about survival. American business, this comedy has received a variety of perspectives from criticism. Labeled as funny, inconsistent But with the charm of the actors, the way to lose friends, seems to have escaped from the fish mill out of the pond, making fun with other cultural comedy shows. Pictures can be used with actors and simple stories, but Sharp. We started in the past and then today and are continuing to see that Young has built a reputation for America's leading magazines. <br /> <br /> Pegg (Hot Fuzz) too much for words. Whether it's beating zombies with a cricket bat or showing his closest friends to see the nature of the law that British actors bring to their charm and generosity in every scene. Here when the script is good But far from his own standard, he brings energy to the image and he alone looks worthwhile His comedy show with "Babe 3" could not forgive him as amazing as thrilling dancing. But he pulled it out beautifully. <br /> <br /> Bridges and Anderson did well. For confusing love Megan Fox, who stole the Transformers, reminds everyone that she can perform here with the funny hyperbole of the movie star. The fact that her character Sophie Myles is shown in the picture about Mother Teresa is ridiculous, like the comedy of the characters in the pool. In order to emphasize that point, there is a dog and Pegg rounds in a real Brit style comedy with a little twist. <br /> <br /> Although the British film has an American lifestyle adjustment for the young as he attempt In order to fit and we can see different ways of telling stories, Young wants the right to be dirty compared to American professionals. The combination of modern day tabloid will make this film date very soon, but the idea of ​​taking advantage of movie stars for this edge. <br /> <br /> Weide's first picture is incomplete. Concentrated when the plot becomes too much soap with obvious twists, awkwardness and lots of characters than necessary. Physical comedy may be too much. As a bloopers note on the DVD is some of the best things you can see, which is almost half an hour long. <br /> <br /> This comedy has Simon Pegg in a shining style again and with the group. Sharp storytelling and funny methods
