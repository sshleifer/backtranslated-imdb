Somewhat disgusting about the business with Bela Lugosi, a mad scientist. (Yes, an assistant like Renfield and his mother, a dwarf and yes, a scientist's wife. (Sounds like the movie Greenaway. Actually.) Lugosi gives his wife an injection of death brides (why do they know who?) So that his wife can look beautiful. The brides collapsed at the altar after the bride again bites the dust. The newspaper reporter Just happy to go around for a lap and decide to spy around for the story. She gets a clue. Everything about orchids and Lugosi Heaven knows where the police are. She soon goes out to Bela's hideout on She found the kind of doctor who looks strange that may or may not eeeevil all. It accumulates in a plan called deeply to have a fake wedding to catch a mad scientist. But it seems that scientists have an X-ray vision as he plans her. Oh no! What will happen? I really like. This movie is a delight to be guilty. Lugosi is here. Excellent. His hangers are all very strange. Actually, it's a rather nasty story in some places that makes everyone look the most. Fun little views.
