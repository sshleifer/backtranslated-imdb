Jay Zhou plays the orphan at Kung Fu School. But being a corrupt principal after fighting the gangsters in hiring evil villains He happened to Eric Sang, a fateful magician who saw the potential of cash in youth skills. Basketball is an option for the rich and Tsang to bid for him to join the university team and to promote him in the media. The general success leads to the basketball championship and the offensive rival team really manages by the same evil villain. <br /> <br /> It's just Shaolin football. I guess. But not strange or ridiculous - the plot is quite cute Close to movie conferences, sports and giving all the elements that the crowd expects from the settings You've seen it before But it is never painful to see anymore when done well Fortunately, it's really good here (some people may say 'Surprising' with Chu Yen Ping in the director's chair ... I expect him to have a good 'assistant') - presentation scripts and presentations that are slippery and stylish. Jay Chou is still not showing much. A student But it was his style and when he released a shaky emotion, it would be a good joke. Eric Tsang compensated the character that was larger than the life he had played many times before. (In real life) who gets the most exciting moments in many movies. <br /> <br /> Because this movie revolves around basketball. It is good that the basketball tournament scene is provocatively appropriate. Actors show real skills, including Chou and wire and CGI work that are well done, add elements of exaggerated kung fu skills that make the scene more fun (Assuming you like that) and adjusting the plot / existence of the movie. <br /> <br /> There is only one major battle scene in the movie. But it looks good in style "One to many" Jay Chou seems to be moving a lot and is quite impressive - he is quite strong and fast for the real person and Ching Siu-Tung's choreography makes him look like a true martial arts artist. I hope there will be more But at least it was a long fight. <br /> <br /> The Chinese New Year blockbuster that I hope will come from the trailer and recommend it!
