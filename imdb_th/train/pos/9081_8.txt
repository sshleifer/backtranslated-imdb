If you like Sci-Fi, Monsters and Ancient Legends, you will love this movie !! <br /> <br /> Special effects are the best I've ever seen since Juarassic Park has hit the big screen in many ways. last year Although the show may be slightly less than desired But the story and effects were adequately compensated. <br /> <br /> I hope I can now see this in movies on the cinema screen instead of the big 42 inch TV screen. <Br /> <br /> If you like dynamic action, great images and tastes for myths and legends .... You have to watch this movie !!
