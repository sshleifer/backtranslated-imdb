A damn good movie! One seriously underrated song that children sing in this movie gives pain. But there is hope in the future. Whoopi Goldberg works well here. But the best performance throughout the movie is the actress who took the lead. I hope you will be in the movie more than <br /> <br /> This movie should have a higher score. I give it is 10/10.
