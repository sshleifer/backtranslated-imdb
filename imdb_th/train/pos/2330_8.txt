This show is good. I like a little comedy and its cuteness. Actors, Lee Pace, Ann Friel ... etc. They all performed well in the show. The show started superbly with a basic, funny and illogical concept that brought the dead back in the first series and straightforward as people say. The first episode of the second series was minimal. Well, now and I hate the fact that it will be canceled. Why does ABC not let it end until the end when all the episodes are finished? I want to know what the story is like. I think it should be given an opportunity because there are still many viewers who love it.
