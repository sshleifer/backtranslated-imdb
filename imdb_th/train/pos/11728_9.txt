There are two things I like about Elvira and both of them are bigger than you and she keeps covering them: her wisdom and ability. The movie is the best thing to show that you are funny or how she is interested. Looked like the combination of Mortia Adams and Anna Nicole Smith. She inherited the legacy of a distant relative, only to find that she was a mysterious heir. The comedy in this movie is the best thing about it. But it is more scary and scary Most of them are camp fares with horror movies that can be referenced in many subjects, such as crowds, riots, or escapes. My favorite part is when she uses her excellent endowments to break the chain that makes her trapped in the cemetery. The ending is sweet as if it were written by Bradys, but the Las Vegas action at the end was too big to be a movie of this type.
