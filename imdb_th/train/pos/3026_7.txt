Charles Boyer should be a Spanish and he came to London to buy coal in "Confidential Agent" movie in 1945 starring Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer is Louis Denard and everyone goes out to stop him except Baccarat. His documents were stolen. He was accused of murder. But he was determined to bring coal to the people so that they could fight with the fascists. <br /> <br /> This film has many advantages and is not good. It gives a high rating for the atmosphere and suspense and provides a lot of entertainment. Baccal is incredibly beautiful. Boyer is fascinated with Paxinou. The average is Lorraine. He is slim, Hendrick, pathetic and amazing Seymour. <br /> <br /> Bad: Baccarat should be English and Spanish boy. Uh, not Boyer is a wonderful person in his role despite being stressed wrong. But Bacal is 100% American, not an English noble. Both have no chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is quite a mistake. Her performance does not depend on what it is. She is better in other movies. But she is a very surprising and forgiving woman. <br /> <br /> Paxinou is almost on the top and ugly. Dan Seymour stole the whole movie as a guest of a hotel that studies human nature. It is a good part and his performance is perfect while the direction of other actors is not good. This is the case with no small parts, only small actors. Seymour is not a small actor. <br /> <br /> Worthwhile to see despite the shortcomings.
