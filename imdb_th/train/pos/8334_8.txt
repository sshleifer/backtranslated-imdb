It is a doubly interesting experience. For some reason, the greatest scientific mind of the 20th century was never an important person in the movie. * The closest I can imagine is a movie with Einstein in it, namely CHAMPAIGN FOR CAESAR that (like "deus ex ma-China ") The great man heard the explanations on the radio program to test for Ronald Colman to be proved. Received the correct answer and in the big shot of Albert, one of the top dozens of physicists and scientists who used marijuana drugs, the villain intended to steal their machines. he It is worth noting that in both cases and in IQ, we are facing comedies. Until now, no one tried to make a serious movie about Einstein's life, such as John Huston's efforts to make a FREUD with Montgomery Cliff. I guess it's too difficult to get the world of mathematical equations or the secrets of magnetic field theory. Electricity is an exciting conversation. But three years ago, Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer made a beautiful BEAUTIFUL MIND. Nobody could really try. <br /> <br /> (* After writing this, I remember the humor that YOUNG EINSTEIN experienced. Success with Yahoo Serious ten years ago But that is an exception and a deception) <br >> <br /> Another surprise is that the actor plays the great Albert. It is Walter Matt Sau. This takes away from the movie series he made with Jack Lemmon in the last decade of their career. Matthau is a highly talented and talented actor, both In jokes and drama But usually his cartoon character is a species of "Whiplash Willie" Gingrich from THE FORTUNE COOKIE. They are counselors and gonifs. Later they will shed a criminal offense because we like them more. But they are still dissatisfied But his Albert Einstein is truly sweet as Kotch is more than Willie Clarke. <br /> <br /> He plays Albert as a good old uncle of Al Lbert It seems that Mattau's Einstein will live in Princeton with his granddaughter Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan) and she sees a professor named James Moreland. (Stephen Fry) But Fry's car needs repair and they take it to the car shop that Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) works. Robbins falls in love with Ryan, who is attracted to him - but finds him lacking tools. The way that she admired Albert's good old uncle received help from his three friends (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher and Gene Saks), decided to help Robbins and make him an unknown physics genius. This will open the door of love between him and Ryan. If Ryan is impressed and fried, does not spoil things (as he hoped to do) <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is as sweet as when Matthau and the podium. His drilling Doing the ultimate physics test in which they help the Robbins cheat (by changing the position of the body). Finally, the plot leads to a straightforward lie that the great Robbins have built an atom-powered rocket ship. Which brought national interests in the form of President Eisenhower (Keane Curtis) <br /> <br /> A charming and interesting comedy for Mattu in which he is not a normal hyper. But was silent again
