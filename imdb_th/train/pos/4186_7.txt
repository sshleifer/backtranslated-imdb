I watched this movie yesterday and I have to say that it's the best horror movie that made $ 36,000 that I've seen (Sorry Steckler). This movie is worth finding if you're a zombie fan. This movie is full of spirit and atmosphere. The pictures of some zombies are the best to shoot. The dusty bodies of the webs are creepy, slowly appearing to the victims of screaming. Brrrrrrr. <br /> <br /> Canadian women who like sexy with a sexy accent will make you obsessed with the matter before HORROR Is the head of the dead body This film provides entertainment from beginning to end. I can't ask for more than that. My only complaint is that it is too short.
