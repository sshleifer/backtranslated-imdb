This is a cute and sad little story about cultural differences. Kyoko is a beautiful Japanese woman who fled to California to escape from a failed relationship in Japan. Ken is a Japanese worker who is inspired by rock and roll stars. But a little concrete to offer potential partners Kyoko is married to Ken in order to be able to stay in the United States permanently with the understanding that even if they are together until she receives a "green card", the marriage will be the only name. It soon developed that the parties were not in the same wavelength range or may be in the same "time zone", so the name of the movie As an immigration lawyer I have seen "Preparations" like this live your own life, so I am happy to see that filmmakers develop the amazing possibilities of this situation.
