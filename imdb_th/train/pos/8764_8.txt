Alice (Claire Dennes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) are the best friends of all time and after they graduate, they decide to travel to Thailand. Due to the incident, they met a mysterious young stranger who invited them to go to Hong Kong with him during the weekend. But at the airport, Alice and Darlene were mistaken for a heroine, smuggling drugs and being sent to prison. Now is the time of survival and true friendship. This is a very good movie. I've seen a couple of times and after a while you noticed that they had a small hole in the story. But this movie will still entertain you. Claire Danes works perfectly as usual. She is a great actor. I will give Brokedown Palace 8/10.
