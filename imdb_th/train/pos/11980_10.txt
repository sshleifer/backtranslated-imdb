Full House used to be and still is a great show It is a good show for people of all ages and is a good family show. There are no items that will be liked anymore. Children are very cute and even though it looks magical But still especially good for everyone who looks at it when they are young I like to watch the interview now. Anyone who wants to see what type of actor's interview they are printing on the special DVD should go to the petition site and sign a petition called Full House Reunion on this petition DVD in the hope that the actor may want to do it. Grandma for a full house!
