I like this movie a lot. It has excellent chemical properties between the actors and tells the beautiful universal story of the lost son. My favorite aspect is the way in which the bathhouse is more than the background for the story. As the father told his son about the story of his wife's family in the northern desert of China, water and bathing became a sacred ritual. The water is so low that the shower is simple, with deep depth and meaning. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is very effective. However, there are some moments when it shows sweetness "too" ... cloying around during the park's lecture scene But overall I would like to recommend this movie.
