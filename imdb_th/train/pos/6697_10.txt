I remember watching Sabrina for the first time when it came to TV in the UK on ITV1 when I was 13/14. Now I'm 24 and still love it like when I first watched it. I get a little stuck from my friends who still watch "Kids Show" but I don't care! lol Caroline Rhea as "Hilda" is my favorite character and later Morgan became another favorite character I remember spending a lot of time watching various special events in honor of Sabrina in the Nickeleoden UK TV station. I love Mellissa Joan-Hart. She's good at "Clarrissa Explains All" but it's much better I'm very sad when they decide to finish! I hope to launch soon on DVD here in the UK - I'll be in the first row! Lol x
