I found this item for the first time when I was in Japan for six months last year. I found it on the internet when I was looking for a sub-drama to help me with my Japanese. My host mom warned me to stay away from it because she thought it was strange. But I think it's delightful! Koyuki demonstrates the conflicting character and the spirit of Matsu Chun, making every day my every time I get in! I saw him first in "Hana Yori Dango" but I like him a lot in this story! <br /> <br /> Although the characters are interesting and well developed Throughout the show Their relationship grows. But they are not really Still a fun time for all (even for Fukushima!)
