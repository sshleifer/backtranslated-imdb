It's a good movie! In the end, the picture reveals the unknown side of the rock: the illusion of a well-known rockers reputation is getting older and forgotten, not music. And have good humor Have you ever danced at Bill Haley's Rock all the time? <br /> <br /> However, Still Crazy is probably the best movie about Rock n'roll that I've seen better than Spinal Tap. Because in Still Crazy, people are mature They have different views about rock, about love and life. They want to connect with the crazy young people that they miss so much. In addition to his own story, we see characters with personalities, weaknesses and dreams. Like all of us, <br /> <br /> Spend a happy time watching. (Listen to the great soundtrack!) And finally think about your future. <br /> <br /> Goodbye!
