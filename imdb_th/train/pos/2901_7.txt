Tiempo de Valientes fits well with the action buddy movie But above all, with the selection of excellent actors, a great relationship between the leaderboard and excellent photography San Diego Perita shows as Dr. Silverstein, who was assigned to ride a shotgun with Detective Diaz (Luis Luque), who was assigned to investigate the murder of two hats that seemed to be involved. Diaz was laid off. But he is the best man for the job and must have professional psychiatric assistance in order to be in the position of Silverstein and Diaz. Argentina and some uranium and movies separate them from important points so that Silverstein develops his impressive skills. Peretti and Luque are great together and amusing. I'm about the Terence Hill screen team and Bud Spencer. Although Peretti isn't as handsome as Hill, although almost two hours long, Tiempo de Valientes isn't welcome and Damian Szifron, director and screenwriter has set the sequel. The potential for the charming ending of this film Overall, it is a great action movie and very entertaining, whether you play with the lowest participation or insult your intelligence.
