Not a bad martial arts movie The fight scene is good. Michel Qissi did a great job in directing his first film without Van Damme. The story worked without using too much profanity and blood. The screenwriter Jeanette Francessca is consistent with the story. It would be good to see other things from her in the same category. She likes art and has strong women. It's definitely worth watching. I recommend this movie to lovers of drama and martial arts.
