When seeing the Charley Boorman in the Long Way Round with Ewan McGregor, I was very interested to see how Charley would perform in his shows I think Charlie finds a reasonably cute person and lands a lot. Pleased to see that celebrities fight with their weight and fitness. It also shows their humanity! I don't know much about motorcycles. But this performance impressed me from the beginning. Preparation and organizing for this event seems to be great. The event itself was very dangerous and I was amazed to see why Charlie and others were doing it and how far he could go. I like the tempo of the show and the faster the song. I can't believe that he broke his neck bone. I hope it doesn't end. I can't wait to see the next episode ...
