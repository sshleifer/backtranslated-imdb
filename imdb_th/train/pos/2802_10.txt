As someone who has never played sports before, it seems that it will be difficult for me to enter the football industry. (Or, as we the Americans call mysteriously, football) - align "curving it like Beckham", but I must say that this is a great movie! Anglo-Indian Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and her WASP friend Juliette Paxton (Keira Knightley) love to play football. (Yes, I will say that it is English - and universal - the way) and just love footballer David Beckham, but Jesminder's original Sikh parents do not approve (her mother offered a description of football early in the movie) Okay, maybe it's an ancient idea. But you have to love this movie! And if like me, you go to watch this movie without knowing the meaning of the word "bend" in football ... don't worry, the movie explains (I've never heard of David Beckham before in this movie) and we all know that Keira Knightley has hit it big: a few months after "BILB" came out in America, she starred in "Pirates of the Caribbean : The Curse of the Black Pearl "
