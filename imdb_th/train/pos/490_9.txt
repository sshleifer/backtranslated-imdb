Passion comes in many flavors and exists for many reasons; For some people, it may be nothing more than a force disorder. But for some people it may be a way of survival. The lack of nourishment combined with the inability to negotiate even the simplest necessities in everyday life or the basic social requirements may force even the genius to embrace things that give comfort to privacy. And in the extreme case, the object of satisfaction may become the apparent passion that drives that person until the beginning of the survival method becomes the great driving force of his deposition. High-level intelligence will not guarantee satisfactory solutions, and in reality may make the situation worse. It seems that obsession has no prejudice or satisfaction. Moreover, it didn't work. <br /> <br /> At a resort in Italy in 1920, Alexander Luzhin (John Turturro) was one of many people who gathered to participate in the winner's chess competition. Will be the world champion. Luzhin is the master of the game But he has the risk that chess will stop playing this game for a long time. Rather, it was his passion that one thing discovered in childhood saw him, although all his imperfections in all areas of life and made him able to cope with disenfranchisements Therefore, Luzhin is a genius with Achilles heel, which is a flaw which may only have one person who knows and understands and can also use it for his personal interest in this competition. Valentinov (Stuart Wilson), a former Luzhin's counselor who, after many years, appeared again and made himself known to Luzhin. <br /> <br /> Valentinov is an unfamiliar person. Swimming Life again threatens to dominate him, not only is he facing a formidable opponent in the Turati tournament (Fabio Sartor) with those in the previous match. He always comes out after fourteen. Hour His feelings towards the girl he met at the resort, Natalia (Emily Watson) and even though he was a dark cloud genius, was gathering over him, just pushing Lucin deep into his passionate grace. Of salvation and a curse for life. <br /> <br /> To tell the story of Luzhin, Gorris uses the story backwards to gradually reveal the various elements of his childhood that led to his obsession. In chess quickly And when his background is accepted, it is something that helps the audience to understand clearly who is Lucin and how he got to this point in his life For the scene in his childhood, Gorris gave the surface a dark atmosphere and had a deep sense of foreboding and under the natural surroundings of the resort today. The transition from the past to the present has been well managed and with the speed that Gorris has set to make an impressive presentation. But there is no presentation that works very well She also shows the threat caused by Valentinov's presence, focusing on the drama rather than the suspicion, which ultimately serves to increase the overall impact of the film, causing the tragedy of Luzhin to be unreliable. <br /> <br /> The only element that makes this film very memorable is the impact of John Turturro's performance on this film. Lu Xin work must be absolutely convinced. One moment that is wrong or faking will be disastrous because it will cause the viewer to leave immediately. However, it didn't happen and the film was working because Luzhin Turturro was created with integrity and true truth. He gathered the genius of Luzhin, including his inadequacy, and presented his character in the most respectable and realistic manner. It is a performance that is equivalent to not liking the image of Jeffrey Rush in David Helfgott's story in `Shine 'and when you compare his work with other characters he created from Sid Lidz in` Unstrung Heroes. 'To Pete in `O Where Where is the Art Thou?' To Al Fountain in` Box of Moonlight 'You know that Turturro has an incredible range as an actor and a truly remarkable artist. What is he as Natalia Emily Watson is that? Great as well In a reserved show where she developed and presented her character quite well Although she had to go out quite closely with Luzhin, Watson was able to do it in a truly effective way. The most important thing is because the details she brings to her performance make her have a fast relationship with Lucin who believes and gives credibility to the story. You have to look into Watson's eyes to know that the feelings that she communicates are true. It is a great job from talented and talented actors. <br /> <br /> Supporting actors include Geraldine James (Vera), Christopher Thompson (Stassard), Peter Blythe (Ilya), Orla Brady ( Anna), Mark Tandy (Luzhin's father), Kelly Hunter (Luzhin's mother), Alexander Hunting (Young Luzhin) and Luigi Petrucci (Santucci) are well built and deliver `Luzhin's defense 'is a film that deals with emotions. Presented with compassion, restraint that causes grief and may reflect According inhumanity of man to man. Of course we don't want movies to tell us that there is cruelty in the world. But we have received good service from the media center of the cinema when it reminds us of something that we should not forget because we all have the ability to make positive changes and make a difference in life. Of those around you I give this rating 9/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
