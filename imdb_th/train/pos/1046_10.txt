It may be my favorite movie forever, a story of sacrifice, sacrifice and dedication for good ideals. But it's not preaching or boring It was never old, even though I had seen 15 times in the last 25 years. Paul Lucas' performances made my tears and Betis Davis was one of the few people who truly sympathized with her. As Grandma told the children that "dwarfs dress" more than children, but that makes them look more fun. And the slow awakening of the mother to what happened in the world and under her roof was reliable and shocking If I have a dozen thumbs, they will all "up" for this movie.
