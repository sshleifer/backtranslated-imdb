Mathieu (Jeremie Elkaim), a lonely boy who is lonely during the summer holidays. Meet and fall in love with Cedric (Stephane Rideau, beautiful), quiet and slow. This is a very disappointing movie. On the one hand I felt absorbed and felt both boys. Another story that I feel annoyed - the movies shine all the time from the past to the present without touching or reasoning. It was very confusing and pointless. <br /> <br /> A spoiler in front !!! <br /> <br /> There are also many plot holes. Mathieu at one point do something. As he ended up in the hospital, what was it? - We never told! Then he broke up with Cedric and told others that he was with him. Why? We did not tell. Then he mysteriously linked with another man at the end. Why? No description Obviously, Cedric likes Mathieu and Mathieu, living in the same city. So ... However, it is a praise for movies that you care about a lot of characters if only one thing is explained! <br /> <br /> Elkaim because Mathieu is not good, he is tall, handsome and has a good shape. But he cannot show The idea of ​​his performance is sitting around with a blank look at all the time. On the other hand, Rideau is great. He is very handsome, has a very good shape and is one of the actors. He also has incredible sexual power about him. There is a nude image of a male forehead full of many kisses and a clear sex scene in the movie which is a good story - most movies are embarrassed to show the male-male love scene. This does not help to see that the characters have feelings and How do you feel each other? <br /> <br /> So the movie is disappointing. But it is worth watching, especially the Rideau nude scene - that is, if you like a good-looking young man! <br /> <br />
