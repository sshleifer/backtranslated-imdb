"Birth of the Beatles" for the US television movie, launched in the fall of 1979, is true to the best movies that tell the story of four young men from Liverpool that revolutionized the music and the world. From the perspective of the former Beatle Pete Best, the performances from all the actors are excellent. But especially the performances of Stephen McKenna, like John Lennon and Rod Culbertson in Paul McCartney. The film was produced by the legend of the rock and roll era, Dick Clark. One year earlier, in 1978, produced another TV movie, which showed the time starring "Kurt Rusell" in the lead role about another musical legend "ELVIS". The film is directed by an unknown director. " John Carpenter "other successful film directors like; "Halloween", "Escape From New York" and "The Thing", the same can be said for the director "Birth of the Beatles" Richard Richard Marquand. He went on to other films such as "Star Wars Return of the Jedi "," Eye of the Needle "and" Jagged Edge "in many other films that tell the story of Fab Four, which I know is Back Beat, which has a dramatic performance in 1994. However, critics ignore it and the public. soon During the life of the Birth of the Beatles theater is a charming and simple film that focuses on the beginning of the myths and struggles and tribulations that they passed and ended at the highest point of success when they He arrived in New York and appeared in the Ed Sullivan performance in 1964. I would like to recommend this movie.
