The true fans of the movie will love this genuine movie. <br /> <br /> I disagree with the trolls who rated this movie in one star and called it unrealistic. While I have no background or from the environment of the protagonists, I spent many years working in low-income and working-class neighborhoods and felt that acting was very real and representative of teen behavior. I do not know the basis for the opinions of others that this movie is "unrealistic". The dialog box is excellent. <br /> <br /> Low budget production value doesn't bother me a bit. I feel that natural light enhances the personality of the movie. The focus is on the story and character development, not Hollywood's great story or melodrama. <br /> <br /> I bought from the motivation and reaction of the characters. The show is reliable and impressive for new actors and not actors. <br /> <br /> If your thoughts about a good movie are Transformers or Fast & Furious, skip it if you enjoy the drama. With a good character. Try to see <br /> <br /> (about negative comments as "trolls": click on their name and you will see that there are no other reviews or reviews Only negative)
