This is a classic action from the 80s with Arnold Schwarzenegger in one of his most memorable roles. Located in the police status of the future that the government controls everything, including television networks One of their most popular TV shows is "The Running Man", where criminals who have been hunted and killed for millions of entertainment It was created like a game show in which viewers voted for their favorite "quack", a trained killer who hunted and killed an unfortunate "contestant". Audience members were also rewarded for Correctly predicting who will be killed by anyone And the host has no one to play except Richard Dawson from Family Feud, whose game experience makes him very suitable for this role. When Ben Richards (Arnold) was accused of being a mass murderer, he was forced to play a sadistic game. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of ah. One classic Arnold like him, please go back "before he entered the stage And he mocked the gangster armed with a flamethrower "How is the light?" I can go on. But I don't want to make the movie broken It was a joke! <br /> <br /> Regardless of whether or not it's intended, this movie acts as a parody of the "Reality TV" show. There are many programs that show people the pain and humiliation for The entertainment of the audience and even the court case was relayed to Running Man, showing what would happen if a hit reality television and a frightening image. Anyone can hope that the network will have The same feeling that you do not leave it that far <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a fun movie, and I strongly recommend that 9 out of 10!
