When you are in a depressed or depressed mood, go to see this movie. It shows a lot of beauty and happiness in everyday settings that are simple and encouraging, especially from feminist perspectives and views about humanity. <br /> <br /> When you know both Turkish and Danish Or German to watch movies in all cases Half of the dialogs are in the traditional Danish language, which is synchronized with the German version, and the other half of the Turkish language is Danish or German, respectively. When I watched it in Mannheim, Germany, the reaction of the Turkish-speaking audience proved that there was a lot of humor in the Turkish dialogue, which, unfortunately, mostly escaped me, being just an incomplete performance in the narration This movie is interesting, even if you don't have knowledge of Turkish. <br /> <br /> Approximate, this movie plays a lot in terms of speed and slowness. At first sight, there was a lot of rapid physical movements like lightning, making it a fast and exciting movie. In particular, although this is a kung fu movie But beware of the running scenes that express many emotions But there are scenes that are quite slow and violent as well Above all, the characters will develop slower than you expect in the drama about the coming era. There is still some movement in the characters: See the villain Omar closely, which is a part and the act that I like. <br /> <br /> The difference in speed and stillness is peaceful. Help to visualize the rage - shown at once in the same character at the same time.
