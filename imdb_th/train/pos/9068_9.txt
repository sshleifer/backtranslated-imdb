I think children in this movie are great. I deal with children in that age group and I think their behavior is very reliable. I have a problem with referring to personal parts made by the age of 5 years. I do not think that the comments are necessary and actually reduce my opinion in the movie. Word up and going to be a star I want to see him more on the big screen. I enjoy responding to situations in which he finds himself often. Children in this age group do things without thinking of the consequences. Almost all actors do this throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> I think the message of bullying needs to be reviewed in the movie with this age group. It's a major problem in today's schools. <br /> <br /> The ending is quite unexpected. Billy's idea about whether he wins or does not win the bet is surprising. The way he handles the situation is excellent. Often today, children do not compromise. The actors in this film show that compromise is an important part of life.
