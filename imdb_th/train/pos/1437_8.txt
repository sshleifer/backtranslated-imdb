We often watch movies about unwanted things that happen in politics. But I still recommend "Sala" in the role he was born to play. Al Pacino plays the mayor of New York who has to deal with the shooting of the boy. But it turns out that nothing he does has any impact on this movie. The characters are as brave as we expect from people involved in political scandals. Regardless of whether you trust any politicians, you may have doubts after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I understand that I can't name a specific example of something similar to that of this film. Not an issue If we have the ideal impression of the people at the top, this movie will make those thoughts diminish. Of course, I recommend you to watch, starring John Cusack, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello, Anthony Franciosa and David Paymer.
