This is one of the movies that you happened when you surfed on the Saturday afternoon and you will be drawn to see and end up watching everything. I think it works well and it really makes me feel the character. Although it is a little slow But focused on the relationship between Bonnie and Clyde and their family members But it's not boring We did not see all the robberies that they were too legendary and instead shot a large part when the police were ambushed. I think Tracy Needham, the player Bonnie works well with her character. Changing from a lovely rural girl to a cold-blooded killer is a challenge to portray, and I enjoy her ingenuity that leads to the story. Average, especially when considering it Made for TV movies
