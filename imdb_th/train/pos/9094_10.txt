I saw independent movies when I was in Philadelphia and it was a surprise. I left the theater with a smile on my face. One of the things that makes it so funny is that it depends on the true story - hilarious! It also has a great actor. Mindy Sterling is in there and very good. I love you in Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is great as well. I remember him from the head of the class. I'm tired of the dark movies that have been created ever since. This is fun and light and I can watch with my family and don't be shy. I checked to see when it came out on DVD. I will definitely buy
