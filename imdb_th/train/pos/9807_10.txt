Let the drama "Traders" of Canada. <br /> <br /> Both Season 1 and Season 2 are available in the DVD 2 region in the UK. Considered to be a viewing series again, <br /> <br /> Season 1 is 13 episodes and Season 2 seems to be 10 episodes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it looks like it will end after 2 Seasons <br /> <br /> This series is fun. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you can buy at Amazon.co.uk.
