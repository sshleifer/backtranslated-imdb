The popular radio storyteller Gabriel No one (Robin Williams, scraggy and hypnotic tone) became known and friends with a fourteen-year-old boy from Wisconsin, Pete Logand (Rory Culkin), who wrote the book about Sexual harassment from His parents. In the boot, Pete has AIDS and Gabriel is still forced to do this because Jesse. (Bobby Kannavell, Dee) His partner is a survivor of HIV. <br /> <br /> He also knows the guardian of Pete, a woman named Donna. (Tony Collett is so cool!) And when Gabriel decides that he wants to meet and talk with two of them by himself and go to Wisconsin. Discovered some secrets that he (By nature) not ready to find <br /> <br /> based on the actual events that occurred with Armistead Maupin (who co-wrote the screenplay with Terry Anderson) and directed by Patrick Stetner. This movie moves much faster (90 minutes or maybe longer than a few minutes) More than one might think that this type of movie will work. That is a good thing in order to maintain action and story to be agile and clear. It's not good that it will make the holes in the plot and not sew any open or plot. I do not want to go into any details, unless you are not familiar with Mr. Maupin's work or his personal story. Still, Williams' performance (I like to hear more of his personal lectures), Collette, Cannavale, Culkin and many supporting actors. (The waitress at the Donna frequency restaurant of Collete did a great job. She's there!) It's the ultimate emotion and emotion created here - that is, the coldness, the lonely loneliness of Wisconsin and New York. Great for this It may have an end that is not particularly well tied. But it is also an interesting story enough to stick to it
