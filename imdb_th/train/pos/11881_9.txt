Every great thug movie has no human drama in every chapter. Don't expect the emotional story of guilt, revenge and despair from "Scarface". This is a story of greed, violence, corruption and power. The dark side of the story "American Dream" <br /> <br /> Everyone complains about the "cheesiness" of this movie. There is no point. Superficial characters, magical music and fashion days continue to fuel the criticism of this cruel excess life. Nothing in the life of these characters is important, not at the human level, at least. In fact, this film is a satirical satire, considering all rapper, gangster who was inspired by Tony Montana's life. <br /> <br /> This is not Brian DePalma's strong endeavor. (Especially the memorable ending) but often sinking to be sloppy and misunderstood Fortunately, it has been very strong support from Oliver Stone. (It may be a good treatment for him, considering the coke habit he was playing at that time). The theme is consistent, mainly focused on the life of Tony Montana and the evolution of his character as he is dominated. With greed and power This dialogue is also excellent, easily seen between humor and drama. There are many distinctive lines that have penetrated into popular culture in one form or another. <br /> <br /> Actors help it as it is. One of his performances that was less than before. (Something that is more common than he is today) This is a world that is completely separate from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. Even so, he can watch it here, as always, in a fun way. (And more deliberately) It is difficult to imagine Tony Montana again after watching this movie in one of the most imitated performances The lights are boring and uncomfortable when viewed first. But I came to know that she played a part of a weary little wife Not a special effort But was wrongly judged wrong Supporting players, too, especially Paul Shenar as Alejandro Sosa with tenderness. <br /> <br /> Powerful, sometimes humorous, sometimes shocking and constantly debating. "Scarface" is one of the movies. Of the eight (Things that may be meaningful to you) necessary and accessible gangster flick and pop culture landmarks 9/10
