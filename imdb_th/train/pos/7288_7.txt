This movie is a classic classic for the camp. That's the reason why it's Elvira and MST3000 classic. Everyone knows the story. The scientist makes his girlfriend's head alive in the lasagna pan in his basement while he cruises in the city and tries to find her body by checking local chicks. Eventually he found that the hourglass's body had a chick head with a scar on top. The head that was cut makes friends with the experiment that failed in the cabinet and the cone head came out of the cabinet and tore the "good" remaining arm of the assistant out. (His other one is not right from the previous failure of scientists.) <br /> <br /> The movie made us very scared because the children that my friends would not go into his basement for a time. One year after seeing it As a child, we ranked the scariest movies of all time and this movie is fourth. One of those horrible movies is very good (original version of "The Haunting"). <br /> <br /> I have to rate seven movies with the tremendous value of entertainment offered. Its effects are creepy due to crappy production and strange sexual perspectives when scientists look for bodies. (With a porn soundtrack) makes the hell out of innocent children I can watch this movie tonight and enjoy it while I want to go to the dentist more than see "Chicago" again. <br /> <br /> Seven is the thing that I give the most because of the value. Entertainment. It's lucky. The movie as a movie is a disaster.
