18 directors have the same duty: tell the story of love in Paris By nature, some people are better than others, but all the mosaics are very charming - besides, it won't be boring if they all have the same vision of love. This is how I rank the group. (Which may change in the second look): <br /> <br /> 1 "Quartier Latin" by Gérard Depardieu <br /> <br /> One of the greatest French actors ever Directed in my favorite segment with Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara, always beautiful. <br /> <br /> 2 "Tour Eiffel" by Sylvain Chomet. <br /> <br /> Cute, attractive, attractive. (Thanks to the director of "The Triplets of Belleville") of the little boy whose parents are mute; <br /> <br /> 3 "Tuileries" by Ethan and Joel Coen <br /> The Coen Brothers + Steve Buscemi = Hilarious <br /> <br /> 4 "Parc Monceau" by Alfonso Cuarón ( "Y Tu MamáTambién", "Children of Men"), achievements Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier (funny); <br /> <br /> 5 "Place des Fêtes" by Oliver Schmitz, feat. Seydou Boro and Aissa Maiga (tap); <br /> <br /> 6 "District 14", Alexander Payne's ("Election", "About Schmidt"). The excellent look for the pathetic side of life appears here. The actress who has a lower role than Margo Martindale (Hilary Swank's mother in "Million Dollar Baby") as a middle-aged American woman on vacation. <br /> <br /> 7 "Faubourg Saint -Denis ", Tom Tykwer (" Run Lola Run "), a crazy style in the story of the actress (Natalie Portman) and the blind man (Melchior Beslon) who fell in love <br /> <br /> 8" Père-Lachaise "By Wes Craven, feat. Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell (including Alexander Payne who is curious ... Oscar Wilde!); <br /> <br /> 9" Loin du 16ème "by Walter Salles And Daniela Thomas (smooth story the But impressive from the talented Brazilian director Catalina Sandino Moreno); <br /> <br /> 10 "Quartier des Enfants Rouges" by Olivier Assayas ("Clean") which is a sad story. Maggie Gyllenhaal is always wonderful. <br /> <br /> 11 "Le Marais" by Gus Van Sant, feat. Gaspard Ulliel, Elias McConnell and Marianne faithful (simple but funny); <br /> <br /> 12 "Quartier de la Madeleine" by Vincenzo Natali, Elijah Wood and Olga Kurylenko; <br /> <br /> 13. "Quais de Seine" by Gurinder Chadha; <br /> < br /> 14 "Place des Victoires" by Nobuhiro Suwa Success Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe; <br /> <br /> 15 "Bastille" by Isabel Coixet (the superlative director of "My Life Without Me"), Miranda Richardson, Sergio Castellitto, Javier Cámara and Leonor Watling; <br /> <br /> 16 "Pigalle" by Richard LaGravenese, feat. Bob Hoskins and Fanny Ardant; <br /> <br /> 17 "Montmartre" by and with Bruno Podalydès; <br /> <br /> 18 "Porte de Choisy" by Christopher Doyle and Barbet Schroeder (mostly known as "Barfly", "Reversal of Fortune" and "Single White Female") <br /> <br /> I am three Can group some parts Excellent and average others (or even a little boring) but no one is bad. Overall, I gave "Paris, Je t'Aime" at 8.5 / 10 and suggested what it was: a lovely mosaic about love and other things in the meantime.
