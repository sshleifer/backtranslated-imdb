I used to watch this movie at the cinema before, many years ago and liked it very much. But I still want to watch it again this year to check if it's still good or not, compared to the movies that are released now and I want to say it's the best movie I've ever seen in my life !! <br /> <br /> What you need to know is that you don't miss every minute of this movie. If you don't follow the action perfectly, you will get lost and you won't understand the end. <br /> <br /> In the end is what makes the movie This is great, you can not expect /> <br /> Congratulations <br producers!
