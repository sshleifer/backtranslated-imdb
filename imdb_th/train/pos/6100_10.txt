This is a funny and sexy movie that is not just stupid. But has a great performance It's a type of movie that the characters entertain until you feel like you're connected to everyone in the cinema. I saw it at the Boston Film Festival and I found myself laughing loudly with others often and moving along with some of the more serious movies It's a movie that is unique about two doctors and I don't want anything. But with a powerful scene, including a really funny scene - plus a wonderful dialogue They too If you have the opportunity to see - go - you will not be disappointed. It's worth seeing again. Wood Harris deserves the award.
