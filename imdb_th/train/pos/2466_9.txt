I never noticed that four hours had passed as fast as I saw this movie. This film has restored the power and art of Hamlet, which is always meaningful. Even those famous speeches were made in a new and creative way. And the actor is incredible, Brannagh, the brightest star It is his talent, power and command in the role that sets the movie. Make it a full and complete version, filling many loopholes and helping to see the value of a new tragedy, despite the length of time that anyone expects to see a dark and overcast castle. The only grief came from Hamlet himself, as it should be. Worth your time for four hours.
