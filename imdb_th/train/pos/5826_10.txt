I remember when I first saw this short, I laughed so hard like many other movies that I saw. There was no sound! Alon is a great person who "sings" the opera this time. I was surprised that he didn't consider a professional singer career because he was really good! <br /> <br /> If you notice that this is a shooting near the end of Andrew's career as a stooge, you can tell that he really changed because he lost weight and thinner There are many wrinkles, although he still can pull it out. But it seems that he is fifty-forty This is because he had to suffer from a stroke many times before he ended his career. Can he still pull it out in his last game ?! <br /> <br /> If you don't mind the fact that Alon is very sick now, this is one of their most fun shorts. I know I'm not interested in the fact that Alon has changed because I still think he's great! <br /> <br /> 10/10
