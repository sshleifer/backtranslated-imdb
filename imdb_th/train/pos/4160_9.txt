One word can describe this movie and that's strange. I recorded this movie one day because it was a Japanese animation and it was very old, so I thought it was interesting. This movie is about a young man who travels around the universe to get the metal so he can get revenge. On the way he met a very colorful character and ultimately had to decide whether he needed the body or not. Very strange if you're a fan of animation / science fiction. You might want to try it out.
