Pushing a daisy is a great show like Dead Like Me and Wonderfalls. You can tell that it was created by Bryan Fuller. I can understand that people who do not love cinema, theater, music and others will feel annoyed how This is not a general television program and is too amazing for some people. These people seem to want a tone that is linear and muted to make them happy. This program explodes with colors, winks, old movie scenes, incredible hum and talented performances. There is nothing random about the options made from costumes to leitmotif. The story takes a lot of time to turn. But everything is easily accessible because the conversation is about love, honesty, courage, loss and many other things that we face every day. The only unfortunate thing was the ending of the show and that was hurried because it was canceled. Do not approach this thing as a regular TV program. Think of it as an evening at the theater, then sit down and have fun!
