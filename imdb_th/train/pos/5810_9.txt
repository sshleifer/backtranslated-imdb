Mr Michael Jackson is an artistic phenomenon. His short film is music video is the best. I don't care if I can get the Sci-Fi feature from this man or not. But I was interested in dancing like crazy, screaming, shouting, choreography, crowds and CGI and some animation. There should be some stumbling videos. Everything I'm talking about is here. Stupid plot and "Fair vanity" is not a problem when I see the actions of Michelle Jackson. For me, he will be the best king of music videos (not "King of Pop", which sounds funny, especially for us Russians because "pop" sounds like the Russian word for "la" and MJ is not The King of Goodbye ") I can watch his best music videos. (Which has artistic beauty) and I never bore them. <br /> <br /> My first impression of this movie is "What is this ...?" Some paintings, insecure jumps from one theme to another, no sticky plot lines, some children fooling around, etc.) But when I watched it until the end, I could say that it was great. And Today there is nothing like other shows on TV. What I like here is that it never shows any embarrassing content and children can easily watch it. <br /> <br /> If Michael Jackson doesn't exist, the universe of music videos should be quite bad. Even the best classic videos of other artists still can't get close to the powerful objects of MJ music craze and art quality. He knows how to attract audiences of various ages and he knows how to remain a moral person. <br /> <br /> When I saw the correct DVD with Michael Michael's video, I knew. That should buy Although some clips appear in previous releases, "HIStory I", "HIStory II" and "Moonwalker" are excellent, but only "Moonwalker" is like a movie ("Smooth Criminal", " Paparazzi ") and strange spoofs and twists) <br /> <br /> Being a fan of MJ, I can still give" movies ... unlike any other "that are strong. 9 out of 10 (I've been Hit by "Smooth Criminal" and certainly my Important complaints are as follows: The beginning of the movie may be reduced while the campaign "Anti-primary drugs" should have been "madness and stress that skyrocketed" and should have its own "moonwalking" of course).
