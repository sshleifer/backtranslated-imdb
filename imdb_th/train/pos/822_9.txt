Lucas' saga's latest movie is a spectacular creation. It is often considered an ugly duck of the original trilogy. But I think it is the fourth mark (And is the bottom line, Episode III and V) In fact, I think it's the third best movie in the 6-episode saga. As far as I'm concerned, it's still an immensely entertaining movie. It's not a movie with a beginning, a climax, and an end. The film's mechanism operates with only one goal in mind: bringing the closure to Lucas's universe. With the air of the final moments attached to all that makes the film too sensitive But giving emotional rewards Also, it's very fun. New characters and old characters are introduced, facing unexpected new challenges. C3PO and R2D2 provide a wonderful (as usual) comic relief. Leia and Solo are great romantic partners and look also. Probably a good character in identifying Again, it is the internal conflict of Luke (and Vader). What makes the fairy tale is the backbone. Lucas's aggressive imagination is still very clear, and the theme of the film about loyalty, hope and redemption reflects strongly. I'm glad Lucas left the idea of ​​creating episodes VII, VIII and IX because this film is a great book for a long, fascinating and fascinating fairy tale. Not a perfect movie But fun in the best matinée style
