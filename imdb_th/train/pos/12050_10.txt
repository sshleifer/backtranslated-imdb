Most horror movies are really scary movies. They are the same ol'-same ol the same old pack every minute with cheap excitement (usually being 'splashed') and today they can pack every second. With flashy effects One of the goals of a really good horror flick is to suppress the unbelief of the audience. For example, I saw both mummies movies recently and almost dizzying watching ridiculous special effects every second. May cost millions of dollars per second to create those movies, and my unbelievable feeling has never been suppressed at all. It's increasing. <br /> <br /> The brilliance can make it even more scary. <br /> <br /> I saw 'The Woman in Black' for the first time in the A&E channel. After turning over 987, the normal TV channel was terrible. I stopped watching it. This film has a feeling of producing 'Masterpiece Theater'. That's good for me. I always like TV and British movies. <br /> <br /> Most viewers will find that this is too slow. But slow pacing helps to be credible There are a few special techniques that make viewers think that this movie is set in the real world, making us feel more uneasy. Makeup and costumes for ghosts are easy and reliable. Hollywood will make her look like a demon from hell with a sparkling eye claw. Hollywood will overkill and turn this idea into a normal one. <br /> <br /> This woman appears only five times. Only in most movies is where she appeared in the distance and even what created horror. If you appear too often, it may cause upset. However, this movie was made very well through most of the movies that we led to the feeling that she was there all the time. But couldn't see the scene where she 'visited' Arthur Kidd late at night and we saw her a little too close to being a horrible masterpiece. <br /> <br /> This is just a special movie that I think should be one of The best movie A horror movie that I created. I have a copy of 'The Haunting', 'The Changling' and one billion. I didn't see anything wonderful 'The Woman in Black' even though I was still looking. This movie was well built so even those with the most suspicion (like me), the moment I almost thought of seconds about being without ghosts. I am joking with people that I am afraid from time to time that she may be standing in the middle of the road or that I see her staring through my window, etc. Maybe she is in a crowd at the mall stared at me and her. The appearance of hate This is how a really good horror movie should be. Like LaFanu's novel, The Woman in Black gradually pulls you in and wraps around your neck and before you realize she's squeezing your life away from you and it's too late. <br /> <br /> Things The nearest i Must be criticized as something that has been created for a small screen ... and it's a terrible shame that this is a print job I just paid more than $ 40 for the second copy of this movie. It is a big reward in my collection. Now I'm searching for a better horror movie, not just But gives fun But also has drama features as well
