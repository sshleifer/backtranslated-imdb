Tigerland pursued the lives of a group of men who were recently enlisted in an army called to join the fighting in Vietnam in 1971. <br /> <br /> At this point, America knows that they are fighting to fight the loss. Lost We passed a 16mm mobile documentary film in the lives of many enlisted men in the 'Tigerland' training camp in Louisiana. <br /> <br /> This film is a story of character education. With no real plot The character Roland Bose, a heretic But a wise man who wants to escape from the camp We were brought in many characters in the unit waiting for the story to unravel. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this is a great story about Vietnam and it's important about the army in general .. The performance is great. And very memorable In addition, the director used the movie and style very well, making it look like an old movie you saw about Vietnam. It was great to see that this film shows that combat and all the problems are important to the struggle in this battle. The specific scenes that Boz walked away from the training mission that the instructor showed. How to use the radio is a torture device, just summarizing everything about the war. In summary ... and it is useless. <br /> <br /> Great movie, not just about Nam. That posture But also about people who have to make decisions that are morally correct by 'Stay in the army' <br /> <br /> Rating 9 of 10
