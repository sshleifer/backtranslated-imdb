I love this movie But can't get anything in this movie that doesn't like Those who do not like this movie must be Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert, but I can't believe that it is Mr. Carrey behind all makeup. And I am confident that most actors and actors in the movie have created movies before And with a new face in the movie Taylor Momsen, the player Cindy Lou Who when the debut of the Grinch (Jim Carrey) comes out of the hiding place. And make fun with whos in Whoville Sicne. We know what love Christmas. While Grinch doesn't like Christmas And also make fun of Cindy Lu Noi (Taylor Momsen), the daughter of the post office of the city. (Bill Irwin) The film, directed by Ron Howard and the voice of the narrator, will be made by Anthony Hopkins and Jeffrey Thompson (Muppets From Space) chosen as mayor of Vivol Who doesn't like talking about Grinch near Christmas time?
