If it is an adventure and adventure you want in a movie, you should be advised to look elsewhere. On the other hand, if it's a lazy day and you want to make a good movie with that emotion, take a look at "The Straight Story" <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth demonstrates the appealing and gentle performance Alvin Gentleman, in the true story of Alvin's journey with a lawn mower, rode across three states to see his estranged brother, who had a heart beat. <br /> <br /> Ten In this role Winding roads make friends with strangers and suggest memorable family-related advice on the way. The story moves slowly like a lawn mower. In any way, managed to allow the audience to wait for Alvin's next life lesson to present <br /> <br /> stretching out on the sofa, relaxing and enjoying. Is the only way to watch this movie, very good, which scores 7/10 in my book
