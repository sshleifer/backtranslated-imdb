This is probably the best documentary I have seen in a very long time. Jonny Kennedy is and remains a beautiful, miserable inspiration. Not only is he the survivor of one of the most painful diseases. But he still uses his beauty to show the world that there is life after death and never gives up to reach people and spread his love Watching the minute, his long life is struggling with heart. Listening to his clever observations and seeing his lovable gestures were warm. And when he saw him smiling, could not explain I feel happy to experience this giant. Please, if you have the opportunity to watch this movie - try to think of yourself lucky to meet Jonny Kennedy.
