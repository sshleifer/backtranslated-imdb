The first time I saw this half-life came when a black and white TV in a small Samoa village and thought it was hilarious. Now when I see it a second time later, I don't find it hilarious. I didn't find anything hilarious anymore. But this is a witty and light comedy that moves quickly without interruption and I enjoy it. <br /> <br /> It's 1945 and Fred MacMurray is dying 4F to enter. To one of the armed forces He stroked the lamp in the garbage plant he had managed and had Jeanie appear to give him a few wishes (Ho, right? But even though the introduction is no more than a very lively imagination) MacMurray said. With Mara that he wanted to be in the Poof army and he was marching along with Washington's soldiers in the warm and inviting USC, where June Haver and Joan Leslie wore lace, lace or whatever and Alfred Washington sent MacMurray to spy on the enemy-coated red Hessians who spoke German, not Brits. Hessians were trapped in Bierstube and sang a very amusing drinking song that praised the virtues of Vaterland, "where white wine is a winier. / And the Rhine / Rhine River and the Bratwurst River are yellow and yellow hair is yellow / Frauleins are jucier / and the goose's steps are Goosier "like that. The characters are excellent and the Sig R umann is the best. Otto Preminger is a suspicious and frightening general Hessian. "You know, Heidelberg has a total of 241 to 1, but you are not afraid." <br /> <br /> I can't imagine going on too long. But all of them are quite funny and are lyrics When he hoped that he would be in the Navy, MacMurray contested Columbus and his imagination was presented in a great opera style. "Did you know that sailing west means / is a very expensive investment / and you think who gives it to / but Queen Isabel Queen" when they see the world New. Someone said that it looks good. "I don't care what it is" mumbling with Columbus. "But that place will be called Columbus." <br /> <br /> However, eventually everything was stretched out. Somewhat drunk and McMurray surfed with the Marines and the right women. <br /> <br /> I made it sound too cute. Maybe. But it's cute. Children will enjoy the smoke and magic and the love story that is repetitive. Adults will be kicked out of the more challenging elements of the story (who is Hessians?) Unless they are college graduates, in which case they may want to stick with legerdemain and say "Wow!
