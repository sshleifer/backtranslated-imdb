PERHAPS in an attempt to find "Another hot property" for the adaptation. Fleischer reverted back to a highly successful raid in the world of Newspaper Comic Strip by producing POPEYE THE SAILOR in 1933 (Fleischer Studios / Paramount). Will be part of the BETTY BOOP series, but Mrs. B. appears briefly short-lived, leaving the rest as a pilot episode for the upcoming series of full-blown <br /> <br /> now is General knowledge, gruff, squinty eyes, sailor b rawlin 'may become the most successful cartoon series ever; Longer and farther than Fletcher and their studio for a long time, until today <br /> <br /> Reverting to a new king for a chance to try again, no doubt why the trial Henry Comic Strip in BETTY, BOOP Outing; The objective is the pursuit of another set. The reasoning is reasonable. Henry is the most popular feature on the line. Hearst Papers products appear as both daily and on the color day. PUCK comics cartoons every week. You know, "These people are stupid people!" Remember? How Schultz? To watch the little cartoon 'bald' bald little Comic Strip 'and comedy on his screen, both solo and in conjunction with Miss Betty; We were surprised to see how well the character managed. The story and director Dave Fleischer create a comic-like situation and an ideal joke for the little Henry character. These quiet, short articles are especially important for animated movies. Faithful to printed pages While most of Henry's features are made in the form of 4-color 'mime'. <br /> <br /> In the BETTY comics with Henry: THE LUNING LIVING American (Fleischer Studios / Paramount Pictures Corporation, 1935) In the cartoon, we see what it is; In general, as a situation-based exercise has been punctuated with a regular array of rapid fire, Dave Fleischer's gags like a machine gun In short, Henry saw a puppy in the window of Betty Boop's pet shop. It was the first love Henry tried to buy a small puppy dog ​​with the only money he had to put a coin in. His bag He was founded by Miss Boop. That would be $ 2.00 in the money era to buy. The tears appeared as a small man left horribly. <br /> <br /> But the forgiveness was on the horizon soon, while Betty asked the boy to think of the store while she left the express business. In return, Betty promised him that he would repay the small dog. Of course, they have a deal and Betty. <br /> <br /> The work of cleaning cages and feeding animals is an opportunity for Fleischer crews to shoot all new gags. This story contains Henry's bald bird seed and pushed broom. (But not all at once. Schultz!) Henry's enthusiasm for feeding birds in the birds by sowing his head soon leads to the abandonment of birds. Leaving the shop to the open road during the big break. <br /> <br /> BETTY came back to this point and showed her frustrations and anger and Henry's temporary protection. All bets were closed. No doggie for Henry. He started off; dejectedly; But soon convinced the owner to shoot him again to fix things. His head was covered with doves, dealing with all the tiny hairy creatures, bringing them back to the pet shop. Happily leaves little; But this time he had a cute little puppy. <br /> <br /> Unintentionally, this is a winning set. We have the energy that is full of the concern of the boys, Betty's kindness and the mood of the situation and the suspicious results of the situation. 'The boy and his dog' Max and Dave Flisscher make us a masterpiece of a little masterpiece of true comedy. <br /> <br /> We were very surprised that there was no Henry series followed Judging from the treatment of faithful, honest characters, it can sometimes be sustained. In any way, joining this team is the best way to try Betty Boop's picture, although the first time that POPEYE THE SAILOR (Fleischer / Paramount, 1933) is the most successful (and almost nonexistent). Betty Boop is there, except for the hijack as a hula hula dancer); The HENRY Short is better than both. Here are the features of "BETTY BOOP" and KING LITTLE KING and BETTY BOOP and LIMTLE JIMMY in the year 1936. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
