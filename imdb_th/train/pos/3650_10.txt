Sometimes Lady Luck smiled at me. At first I made and mimicked the VHS tape of this great TV presentation. I was heartbroken when I realized that because I couldn't get a copy anywhere, <br /> <br /> Recently I applied for a digital cable membership and while searching for the upcoming movie Surprised is the scheduled broadcast of the movie. However, this time I made a copy of it on the DVD, so there is no chance to make a mistake. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to look again after eight years. When I first saw There is a little story presented in this story when I contact "Pandora's Clock" for the first time, along with reading books on public radio. I just adapted to the broadcast station while traveling home for lunch and from the first episode I was addicted. Each day I wait with the expectation of reading the next chapter. <br /> <br /> When I learned a few months later that the book was going to be aired on TV as a movie, I was sure to clear it. The schedule for that event <br /> <br /> First of all, I want to say that this movie is very true for this book, which is contrary to what other critics say. That is a rare achievement for television movies. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I agree with others about casting. I can't imagine being a better choice for Captain Holland than Richard Dean Anderson. Indeed, this movie may have problems and burns without having the right actors for this important role. Anderson had never been better and it was a shame that we didn't see him more. In fact, every member of the group of actors has done a great job. <br /> <br /> My only complaint with the movie - and this book is the interjection of Air-to-air missiles and pilot rods and firing down planes that are afraid Basically we are talking about less than 36 hours in preparation and implementation of plans like this and people, which are not realistic for all players involved. It is not true that the airline was only slightly affected by having the first aircraft, then the two engines exploded. <br /> <br /> The meat on the side of me was happy with the building that was suspected. The foreign government is presented in the same movie as our own. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to watch this movie
