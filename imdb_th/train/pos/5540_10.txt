At first, this movie looked so bad that I almost fell into a trance. The first time I saw it was like a nightmare, a boring universe. But I gave a second chance, then again, and so on ... finally I caught this movie because it was a slow, dreamy rhythm, wonderful nature set, soft autumn bathing and Especially the musical score made from progressive rock in the 70s and the melodious folk song Derek Lamb (The Troubadour). You should notice the music about the red-brown wood, silver trout and The girl was lost in the air, ... hear the middle and near the end of the movie. Allowing us to appreciate the natural charm of Elizabeth Suzuki. If the film was made by director "Drama" Bergman, Lars Von Triers or Jean-Luc Goddard, critics would roll on the floor as if it were true. It's a masterpiece of the universe. I think this movie is better than any one million times better than any story. Of the movie in the cinema of Fellini sh # Â¤ @ t!
