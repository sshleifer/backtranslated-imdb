I saw this video for the first time 15 years ago. I think it's great and I still do it. I am a former English teacher. (High school and college) and love romantic English poetry, so Coleridge gave me a high rating. Anything that may deviate from the beauty of the poem or the power of the story will not be voted on by my excellence. In this case, everything works well to attract viewers, especially high school students. This is a good example for a generation who grew up on TV. In addition, Michael Redgrave's voice also adds to the genuine feeling and authority of it. Ok, so there is no big budget for the project. So it's not Star Wars and there is no CGI in there, but who can cancel the Gustav Dor√© illustrations that are part of the presentation? The above comments, which are only four lines that prohibit videos from being part of the trash, are unjustified, unjustified and without recognition. I am a friend of the manufacturer But that's not my reason for this comment. Rather, I will protect the art that I think is worth at all levels. It is perfect to bring Coleridge's poetry to students in a way that awakens them to appreciate it.
