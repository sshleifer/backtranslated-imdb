"Inspiring" tales about "the victory of the human spirit" is often a dislike for me. The most surprising thing about the MEN of Honor is how much I am happy despite myself. The film is predictable and cliched as it has been, but it has been used to get many credits to perform in exhilarating performances by both parties It was a perfect role for Cuba, Gooding Jr., who had excellent control here. We expect a lot from De Niro and he doesn't disappoint. He created a picture like a joke. Director George Tillman Jr. set out to flick the old style and win the prize.
