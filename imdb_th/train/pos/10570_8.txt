It's hard to say that things came out on the charm and power of James Cagney or the opening of the three great people of Busby Berkeley who opened up closely. I always give it to Footlight Parade, one of the earliest and fastest fun musicals of the thirties. Although this film is clearly Cagney's, Joan Blondell also adds to the outstanding story. <br /> <br /> What about the story? It's about Chester Kent (Cagney), the creator of the musical, and now he has stopped doing business. He started making Prologues. There was live music on the stage before the movie began. He got the idea to do bigger and more things, move them around the country. He is a fireball and thought, and he needs all the ideas he can induce to produce these things relentlessly. But competitors are spying on him and stealing his ideas. Nan Prescott (Blondell), a clever secretary who loves him. But he was too busy to notice Office girl wearing black round glasses (Ruby Keeler) wants to dance His wife turned out that she had not divorced him. The blonde gold digger is setting her hook in him; His partner is cheating on him ... Gosh, what will I do next? All of this may sound like a sub story. But everything happened quickly. Cagney rebounded, stepped on his feet, flicked his finger, barked, and occasionally until the last time he sang and danced. Or two, just to show that it's finished. <br /> <br /> Instead of "Let's show", we have "We have to create three shows in three days, so lock the door and start practicing." These three Prologues Will consist of 40 chorines, amazing effects and will mean a promise filled with forty Kent agencies in the deluxe cinema ... Apollo cinema circuit! Fatigue, threat, foot pain, but everyone who doesn't charge in a stingy suit (including Ann Sothern and Dorothy Lamour; You can see Sothern quickly, but Lamour is more common.) Go out to dance the heart. <br /> <br /> Then the curtain goes up to each prologue presented in a separate movie theater. The same night, with the owner of the Apollo circuit, that night he will record. Chester's skin? <br /> <br /> The first thing to do is "Honeymoon Hotel" with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler with a 9-minute production, which has many healthy possibilities, including the bride and groom. (Some people may marry) Bedroom and bed And the door with the sign "Do not disturb" <br /> Then go to the next theater and 11 minutes of "By a Waterfall" that may cause Warner Brothers accountants to worry about bankruptcy. This amount is too much - swimming, dozens of girls, trees, large grotto springs, with a giant pool slider - you never thought of depression. Berkeley pulled out all his tricks - the form, human form, legs and arms, doing all kinds of precision things - and he did it in the water with a lot of underwater photography that looked up. Girls are definitely games They smile with water in their eyes and still make their mark. All things must be very difficult and incredible. Ruby Keeler, which has a few shots of water, is the only one who is a little careful. <br /> <br /> And finally, the final scene of Smash ... 11 Cagney's minute to dance and sing with Keeler to "Lil Shanghai" with all types of bar girls and their customers unusual in the competition. There Cagney and Keeler dance on the dance bar on the fight table. Cagney has what looks like fifty. Or sixty marching marines A thin hupping to throw and catch a rifle that was then ... this is true ... the man in the form of Franklin Roosevelt, and the Eagles Club. This may be the only Hollywood musical drama ever to focus on Roosevelt, a large federal agency and a sexy Chinese prostitute. <br /> <br /> That is entertainment. It's great! <br /> <br /> Of course, Chester's prologue gets a big contract and Nan gets Chester. This movie is full of ancient ideas that make us smile. Ruby Keeler is so much loved as she tries to squeeze a dab with her arms that you want to help her. Joan Blondell makes us forget about the women. Many Hollywood that may be more beautiful But with less flair and personality However, this film is owned by Cagney, who grabbed and shook and Berkeley, a guy that was never too much.
