While the stories of children who have problems facing boxing for self-respect and anger management are almost new. But the story was revived when the protagonist was a girl instead of a boy. <br /> <br /> Diana had problems at school. She couldn't stay away from fighting. At her father's house she put her down continuously. Her brother practiced boxing at the gym and one day when she picked him up she decided that she wanted to practice. <br /> <br /> It would be easy to call this movie. "Rocky with a girl" I guess, but that's not all about. The story has benefited greatly from the main characters who are more girls than boys. In this way, you can handle more problems at once. First of all, her problems were not accepted because she was not a girl and when she came to the boxing gym because she was a woman. It is also a story about how the purpose can change someone's life. Good things will make you grow. I do not want this to sound like a pretense because this movie doesn't feel like pretense. But what I say is true. <br /> <br /> Michelle Rodriguez is a good leader. It was really a shame that she was stuck in the "tough girl" that was printed now because that's not what she was involved in "Girlfight". Of course, she was a female boxer. But it is a more sensitive time that makes you shine. <br /> <br /> So maybe this is your average underdog with a twist. But it raises the barriers of Rodriguez's performance. I rate this 7/10.
