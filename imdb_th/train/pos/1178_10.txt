This may be the second best PPV in WWE this year after Wrestlemania. It's a great surprise! John Cena has a great match in his upset. Chris Jericho Jeff Hardy still maintains his IC title in a short sloppy match with Willam Regal Bubba & Spike Dudley winning a fierce match over Benoit & Guerrero Jamie Noble has a good match with Kidman, which surprised me a lot. Booker T defeated the Big Show in the match. Not at one point, Booker T gave the Clippers a kick to send the Big Show and sent him to the table. In the stupid decision by WWE Christian and Lance Storm, the envious American anti-defender Hogan and Edge, with the help of Test and Jericho RVD and Brock, had a night filled with excellent points and RVD had to maintain the steam position. So he was happy that he still owns Triple H, signing with Eric Bischoff and Raw, which has no meaning at all. And in the main event, Rock became the first WWE 7 world champion to win both Kurt Angle & Undertaker in three matches Overall, this should be the second best PPV in WWE in 2002! 7/10
