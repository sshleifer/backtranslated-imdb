First of all, I have to say that I made a mistake in watching the election movies respectively. I said unfortunately because after seeing the first 2 elections, the election seemed to be quite disappointing. Both movies are epic villains with similar shapes. And while the election is a fun movie ... it's not as good as the next one. <br /> <br /> At the first election, we will show you the competition for the president. Big D and Lock After debating the scene of "Uncle's" who should have the position of their president (Almost unanimous) decided that Lok (Simon Jam) would be the controller of the Triads team. Sufficient to say that this didn't go well with Big Dee. (Tony Leung Kaaf), a rival and in a bid to influence the revolution, Big D kidnapped two uncles in order to relocate the Election Commission. This has a bad effect and all three heads enter the war. Lok is determined to be the president. But it will not be formal until he can recover "Dragon Head Baton", which is the representative of the power of the chairman of the President Whistle (Chung Wang). The current person has hidden a blackjack somewhere in mainland China and the competition begins at Will see who can recover first. <br /> <br /> Most movies are devoted to reviving Baton. While the leaders who want to search, they have to dodge the police and opponents that lead to So In scenes that stand in the election, which is associated with the name Jet (Nick Cheung), and manly men a lot worse. Nick Cheung's presence is a little to say ... I wonder if this has influenced the director Johhnie To, in some way, during the second election as he sent the character of Jet very much. <br /> <br /> While Nick Cheung shows stealing scenes, I must not fail because the other actors in the election movie have a great set of actors with good performances. Both delicate and Simon Yam and has the effect of one's own and the famous film also benefits from HK heavyweights actor Louis Koo, Tony Leung Ka Fai and Suet Lam has been little appreciation. There is no weak link in the show and anyone can easily believe that they are watching the real gangsters. <br /> <br /> Although the performance is great. But one of the most impressive things about the election is Johnnie To's eyes. For the camera, there are some truly striking shots in the movie, and it is not to say that he knows exactly how to frame his shot. Viewers will be treated to new camera sets and camera angles. All this makes the election above all else a good-looking movie. <br /> <br /> Most of my problems with movies are caused by the number of characters involved in the election. It's hard to follow because this movie is full of characters that are not part of the story. While the sequel chose to focus on two candidates, the first election offered an overall election process with uncle, uncle and subordinates and police officers. Maybe this movie might work better if it takes longer to devote time to the inner workings of Triad, or if director Johnnie To helps to reduce the necessary elements and explain more. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line - All of this is an amazingly cruel movie, with great actors, great directions, and fast paced fists. It's more complicated than you think.
