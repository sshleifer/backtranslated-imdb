This is a movie that feels good and nothing more. And for this it is fun to watch Of course, it is a political issue. But what? I'm sure she doesn't try to do it. 'Good night and good luck' here. Don't try to do anything else but ... fare. <br /> <br /> And so much fun. <br /> <br /> Do you remember what 1984 was like? We are very complex as the media as we see it or not. I am often different. At this point, Goldie knows that this thing is very fun and she goes ahead and does it. <br /> <br /> Just like her lightest fare: Protocol, Going down, Ban, Pak, Benjamin, personally. It seems like ancient times, First Wives Club and remake of Out-of-Towners, Goldie knows what she's doing ... She plays every role for the camp that you can go out. ! Goldie knows herself very well and she knows she's doing really well. <br /> <br /> She always makes me laugh cheerfully and innocent. I love her in Laugh-In and everything she has ever come in. She never tried to be anything other than who she was ... and that was a boiling, giggling girl on the side of the house that was very beautiful and smiling. And laughter that always makes me love and reminds me that life is short and you are just getting lighter because before you know ... you are old and wrinkled and suffering from inevitable illnesses in life If it arrives late, <br /> <br /> I thank Goldie for what she is: a cute comedian.
