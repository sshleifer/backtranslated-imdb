I think it's a good movie. I think it is a very romantic movie through the scene and at the scene; I think it's not intended to be sensual. (Sensuality is a result, not an objective); I think it's very natural. I think it's human. I think it's interesting I think the actors never made me think ... the weak action (not Sean Connory & co) and not the movie that they blockbuster like movie ... normal ppl that can act ... me Thought that this movie was intended I think it makes me feel things (or feel it again :)); I think I don't have a purpose. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy it ... I know.
