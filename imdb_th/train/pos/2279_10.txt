Previously, the perfect "Slaughterhouse Five" was the best. But the adjustment of the screen of "Mother Night" is very true for books and preserving humor, mystery and tragedy. Fortunately, it's not a Hollywood style or a crazy movie "Breakfast of Champions". Another great thing about this movie is that you don't have to be familiar with the books that follow. (As I think you do for the fifth slaughterhouse) That may be the truth of Breakfast of Champions as well, but they do a terrible job with you better than just reading and not watching movies! Nick Nolte works well in this movie.
