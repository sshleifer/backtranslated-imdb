As a surreal lover (In art and movies) I am pleased to discover this film in IFC. It is definitely a goalkeeper. Most reviews tell general plot. (Not all right) so I won't bother to bore anyone too It is important that the alternative world concept arises from Ana's upcoming illness and the way she manages to connect with others after "Alone" and ultimately with her family, which I believe at least is still difficult. It can be called a horror movie because it has horrible scenes. But is a fantasy (with a little hint about "the arrival of age" only because Ana is a teenager before adolescence "Hate children") I advise people to fully appreciate their imagination.
