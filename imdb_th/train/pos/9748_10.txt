I saw this movie when it came out when I was 17 years old and was a classic rock (still) ... <br /> <br /> I never liked opera before because I hate soprano sounds. But he changed everything He is cute in the movie and is very noisy. <br /> <br /> I heard CNN that he died tonight at the house of pancreatic cancer. br /> I hope to buy this If I can find it, watch it and have fun. * Smile * Maybe I should go straight to Amazon.com and see before it is sold out.
