Petter Mattei's "Love in the Time of Money" movie is a remarkable movie. Mr. Mattei gives a clear picture of human relationships with us. This is a movie that seems to tell us what money, power and success do to people in different situations that we find. <br /> <br /> This is a change in the drama of Arthur Schnitz. About the same theme, the director transferred the action to the present day in New York, where these characters converge and connect. Each connected in one direction or another to the next person But it seems that no one knows the previous contact point In style, the film has a luxurious look with a level We are taken to see how these people live and the world in which they live in their own habitat. <br /> <br /> The only thing we get from all these spirits in the picture. Is a different stage of loneliness The big city is not the best place where human relationships find that sincere practice is one thing that is the case of most people we find. <br /> <br /> The performance is good under Take care of Mattei, Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier and other talented actors, making these characters alive. <br /> <br /> We hope Mattei will be lucky and await anxiously following the event.
