Musings: pure happiness from beginning to end Not a laughing riot But more subtle and delicate humor It's a great scene for actors and characters, including Reginald Denny, Nestor Paiva, Ian Wolfe, Harry Shannon and Jason Robards Sr .. Cary Grant is seeing a new house at that point. The young carpenter, played by Tarzan Alex Barker, asked him if he wanted "lallies to be mad" or something like that only the carpenter would know. Give permission, don't want to appear stupid, reply in confirmation That Barker sang to his friends "The boy agrees. He wants 'em rabbeted. So .... YANK' EM OUT!" Seconds later, you will hear the ripping and tearing of about 20 giant nails that are pulled out of the board. Can do is a moan. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is the day. You never saw that many carpenters worked in single-family homes and places like that in Connecticut of all places. It could cost a few million dollars. <br /> <br /> A classic movie that is a treasure. Really
