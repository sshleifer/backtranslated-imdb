When you watch this movie, you will begin to realize that assets that are less useful than Dudley Moore will be. There should be a lot of movies like this in our archive. <br /> <br /> He already has talent before he goes to Hollywood, both as a comedian and a musician. But mostly he remembers being his partner with Peter Cook on television and in the British film, one or two indifferent. Perhaps the best of these is 'Bedazzled'. <br /> <br /> He is often crushed by Cook, who is jealous and rude, causing their relationships to break and make Moore realize the true potential. In America, 'Arthur' is the result. <br /> <br /> This is a truly great movie. Moore's comedy as a drunkard can not be denied. This script is very suitable for his style with fun conversations. There is something in England about him that I was really surprised that he found American taste appeal. Tommy Cooper, an anarchist comedian, after the same fashion tended to draw an empty image. It was Moore's innocent vulnerability. <br /> <br /> Liza Minelli and John Guilgud tend to play the opposite of him. In particular, John Guilgud gave his sarcastic and acerbic authority which is a remarkable treasure. He stole the scenes he presented and earned his Oscar regularly. Correct me if i'm wrong But he never played other cartoon roles. <br /> <br /> There is a follow-up movie called 'Arthur 2 - On The Rocks'. It has never been the highest level of fun ever. But it is still quite good. Guilgud has received a cameo appearance from the beginning and as a ghost it is darker and has an interesting soul search. It will be disappointing if you look at 'Arthur' first. <br /> <br /> Hollywood seems to lose interest in the cuddly Dudley after these two outings. Eventually he returned to England again, causing depression and dying. <br /> <br /> But 'Arthur' is an example of what might happen. We can only imagine other great movies that he should do. <br /> <br /> Dudley is sad.
