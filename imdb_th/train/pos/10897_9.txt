What do you expect from the movie 'Surviving Christmas' and present it as 'Festive fun', something like Ghandi or English patients There are many things that I like about this movie. It's funny. It's very handsome and it can be written perfectly. I came to the movie as Kaplan / Elfort's girlfriend, but it was suspicious when I read the plot. It sounds ridiculous. But this film is not like that because Affleck (as Drew Latham) performed his role perfectly for one minute, like an adult, an adult child who knew he had received everything other than things. He wants In fact, we saw Latham grow up in this movie when he found the problem of someone he was jealous of and realized that their life was not good. He saw that his own lot was not bad. <br /> <br / > This movie has a scene that is weak or weaker than any other comedies I've seen. The comedian is more difficult than any other drama, whether it is work or not, and the writer of the comedian will correct it every time. In particular, I like the drama that the family uses to read the script written by La Tampa Happiness is in the reaction of Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) and Brian Valco's comments (Josh Zuckerman). It is Tom Valco's dilemma that needs to bite his tongue, wear a ridiculous hat or sing to the Christmas tree to receive money. Rewards that make movies move together. <br /> <br /> Additions Alicia's daughter (Christina Applegate) came into the story, offering a delightful romantic perspective and why not try to watch the Christmas movie. Sure, it's repetitive and planned; He is rich and handsome. She is beautiful and single and inevitably and makes her fall in love in the snow and find herself facing each other well! One thing I would like is to use festival music to increase the atmosphere. But i can't complain I got what i wanted
