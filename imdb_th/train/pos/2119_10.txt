"The Shop Around the Corner" is one of the great movies from director Ernst Lubitsch. In addition to the talents of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, it is filled with great actors such as Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart. They are actors. The drama in Hollywood is no longer sad. In fact, the movie itself is the type of movie that Hollywood is no longer created (the creator of "You Be Got Mail" claims that their movie is a remake, but that is not just an exaggeration of self-praise). You have a love in the romantic comedies of the 1940s. You will find "shop around the corner" in order not to lack anything magical. Good for repeat viewing. Have fun!
