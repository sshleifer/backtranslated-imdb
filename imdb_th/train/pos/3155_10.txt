I hope "Performances in the 70s" will come back on television again. It's the greatest item of all time !!! They should do the episode between other episodes, but of course it will cause confusion. But I hope it will come back and make more episodes Please come back again ... The performance is absolutely hilarious. You can't laugh if you don't see the episode. There is a really funny part in every episode, and including the performance is much better when Hyde and Jackie go out together. That's the best episode. "The 70 shows are the best." .... It will be and will be the best show of all time. It was very sad when the performance ended. They should create a new episode.
