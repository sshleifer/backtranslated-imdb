This is a movie about life, triumph over misery and the magic of the human spirit. I challenged anyone not to tears at the end of the movie. This is more than a drama that is torn, is a drama that is engaging and thought-provoking with great performances from all actors, especially Luke and Denzel Washington 7 years ago. I'm surprised that Luke is still. The virtual audience and Washington have directed another movie. However, in addition to slow accumulation, the story of the trials and tribulations of foster children and the way it affects him in adulthood is a type of movie that stays with you long after you see it. As with many fox images, this is more than just a sleeper and does not receive the deserved praise. Finally, the scene in which Antwone met his mother, summarizing the film for me, there are many ways that can be done and it may be all schmaltzy or it may be unrealistic. But Washington made the sound correctly. His mother never spoke. Words and can shed tears, while antowne simply asks why Her overwhelming guilt caused her to be unable to say anything. What would she say to protect herself? One of the most moving movie scenes I've ever seen
