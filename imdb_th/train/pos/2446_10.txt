From the beginning of the show, Carmen was there. She is one of the best characters. Why are they getting rid of her! The performance is not the same as before. It's worse That is like South Park without Kyle or Child's Play without Chucky! It's wrong! The granddaughter who replaced her is just uh! Scary. She doesn't match the story. She is one of the main characters and the niece cannot replace her. She is a great actor. Better way than granddaughter Make her come back or you will lose the audience's TON.
