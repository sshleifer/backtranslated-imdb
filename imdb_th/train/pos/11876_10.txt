Do you know that when people watch Brian DePalma's film today, I'm sure there are criticisms about the date. In addition, about violence When I watched this movie on the VHS when I was 20 years old, I thought it was too harsh and brave as well. But I didn't get 'it'. <br /> <br /> A couple of decades have passed and how do I know that I don't get in this movie !! This is a remake of a great movie made in the 30's / 40's. How do you develop the classics better? You can't, but you tell the story that happened in the eyes of "New Immigrants" During the most coveted decade of the 80s, DePalma, Stone and the gang presented a good, ambitious, disturbing and darned movie. <br /> <br /> Yes .... Dis Spruce is dying and New Wave / Punk is taking over. But these immigrants from Cuba have to do New homes in Florida can't tell the difference. It's exciting. It's what they want. But how to get ???? For these immigrants, there is only one way to get it in Florida, where they .. with a lot of money and to get money, you have to spend more time running the drug kingdom. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino, I'm great. As Tony Montana, "A small train that can be done" is a great way to make your lead character look in America: fight, kill and steal. Lying and deceiving - "Money, women and power" <br /> <br /> That's what Tony sees as an American dream. <br /> <br /> He wants it. He wants. Who will live and in his circle, seeing nothing wrong with the way he goes to get it Tony Montana's English command is saturated with the words "f", but what do you expect Emily to post graduate for him and his colleagues? See how they come to America, what they know, what they touch. This is how Tony and his team choose to "Fully in America." It's about power. Tony Montana will do anything to get it .. It is violence, lies, theft, fraud and theft. Glory <br /> <br /> Part of the film that embodied in the 1980s for me was Launder Tony's crew brought the drug money to the bank. Is Tony and his crew interested? At the club he used to drink? Nope. Money is money and with money, you get the power. Tony is still alive from the swine. He and his beautiful blonde American trophy that he married played well by Michelle Pfieffer. <br /> <br /> After Tony Montana has more power. He was full of suspicion. He was addicted. He was paranoid. He was surrounded by those who wanted to bring him to bloodshed. His wife's wife's drug addicted blonde, 80s, that he found Is boring His kingdom because ... he was going down and he was horribly violent. But I ask again what you expect. <br /> <br /> This is the 1980s movie that is a quintessential story that tells you that you are misunderstood about the American dream ... obsession. It was too intense, so blood .. but it caused chaos in the house. Cuba was not thrown out of Cuba that landed in Florida in the 1980s, which was like Tony Montana. Let me take a break. But showing how pathetic the 1980s were by emphasizing greed and money is the only measure in the United States to "be a man" and have the power to use the tools in these poor characters and their lives. He in America <br /> <br makes you wonder - what has you learned from today?
