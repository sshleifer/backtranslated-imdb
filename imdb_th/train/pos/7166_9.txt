Holstein's novel was forced to me in the academic program. I don't think I want fiction for kids. In addition, another book I was forced to read for the class was terrible. But to my surprise, I absolutely love the hole. It is one of the most complete novels I've ever read. I think it has a rare quality which makes it interesting for children, teenagers, teenagers and adults. I think everyone reading it will walk out to be a better person. While I can't say that for this movie, I'm happy to say that they make it mostly correct. I don't think movie viewers will walk away happily. But they will definitely be entertained without the side effects of being a fool when they sit It is wise and well told. I think it's moving too fast. The novel takes more time to develop characters. And the incident came quickly so they didn't have too much time to register The love of race in the past gives more ancient and repetitive feelings to novels. And the ending which is linked to every loose topic seems very ridiculous It's the same in the novel. But there is a ridiculous feeling that does not exist in the movie It works much better. I don't like many pop songs. I hope Disney won't feel the need to sell the soundtrack. The characters are great, from young children to pro. Jon Voight is great. Not sure why we want Catwoman and Fonze 9/10.
