It was a true sight and I was lucky enough to see it in the cinema when it debuted and was one of my oldest childhood memories. When seeing it again recently, I have to say that this movie has improved over time. Great scenes, great performances and singing - this is a special care that is hard to love. <br /> <br /> By the way, when I saw this movie again tonight, I was surprised with Height and femininity Mark Lester's singing for this movie According to IMD, his singing was dubbed by women and this will be the cause of his voice.
