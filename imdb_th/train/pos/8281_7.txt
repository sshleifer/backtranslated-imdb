From the first scene, I'm really excited. "I can say that it will be great!" I think. The performance is very good. I feel as if I was left with the lives of these people. The music is not stable as well. The plot begins with a sudden event and then floats forward. (Who will feel) to a certain destiny? Can't return. The work is slow. But personally, I like that, as long as the tension is calm and not lost before it is ready to be paid out. <br /> <br /> So everything will be better and Then the fireworks start and before you know that the credit is spinning "what? !!!" is all that I and my movie companion can say. If you understand the director's intention, the end is blunt. (For those who have already watched movies, see interesting and hilarious interviews with Larry Fessenden at filmcritic.com), but I can't help but say Not being pulled out quite accurately. <br /> <br /> This thing may be solved with material for ten minutes before reaching the climax. In any case, it's too bad. Ten minutes may make a difference in the world. (But for those of you who do not write or make movies, you should know that creating the arc of a story with the right rhythm is a big pain in the butt and of course I don't make any criticism from the podium!) < br /> <br /> Wendigo felt like I was a masterpiece that had been left before it was finished. But Hay, I will use a blunt masterpiece any day more than a dog product that is over-compensated for too much digital results. (Like the most horror movies today) <br /> <br /> One other comment. Some scenes of monsters make me confused whether I should be afraid or laughing. I don't know how to explain it. But with Monty Python clearly felt about this monster in the form "Monster" is more loud than his Although this may sound terrible criticism for horror movies - I don't know, but it works for me in some aspects. I will never look at the deer the same way again! :)
