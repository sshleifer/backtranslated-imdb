After completely sticking to Six Feet Under, I don't think there will be another program that will approach as good as this. I'm wrong! Missing is spelling !! I like this program a lot and can't close it. The liveliness of the characters, the complexity of the plot, the beautiful settings are amazing. I am completely and completely enamored. I do not know how the creators do. But each character touches me deeply I feel their happiness and pain, everything goes down to my core !!! I don't have cable, so I rented a series on Netflix. When I put it on, I watched the entire episode at once and felt sad when it ended I can't wait for the next disc to come to my house. This is probably the best TV program I've ever seen !!!
