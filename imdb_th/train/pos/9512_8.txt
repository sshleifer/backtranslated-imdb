This is a movie that makes you want to see again. Especially I like the way it ends. I didn't see the end to come. But when the law was not blown out for the first time, one suspect would come back again. <br /> <br /> The story is interesting and may be more psychological, but I understand the story that must be captured The audience and the operation is necessary for that matter. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that Michael Jr. might seem unmoved like his brother and mother. But I can appreciate playing the scenes that can't give us the attention there because it has a bigger story to tell. <br /> <br /> Some people complain about Hank as a gangster. I believe that is unfair. If his character is more difficult, he would not be interested if his son pulled the trigger or not. <br /> <br /> Eight stars for this story. Although released in 2002, I just saw it for the first time yesterday on DVD.
