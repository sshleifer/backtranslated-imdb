This is a slow moving story. No response. No wonder No surprises immediately If you can't stand watching movies about two people who just talk and walk about stories that develop slowly to the end and romantic love stories - don't waste time and money. <br /> <br / > On the other hand, if you enter a conversation, tell a story that is courageous, think of ideas and find true love in living things, then this is your movie. I suggest you watch this movie when you are most alert because the music rhythm and the overall tone of the movie makes you feel disfigured. It's truly wonderful. I mean, actually, <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawk and Julie Dale were both annoyed with their attitude. But fortunately, the chemistry between the two makes the show natural, warm and gentle. They act and feel each other at first, making you feel like an intruder. <br /> <br /> In their conversations, there are many excellent reviews that will stimulate your thoughts and conversations with you. Your partner I think it's too deep and too diverse for a little character. But I may evaluate their intelligence too low Even so, it didn't destroy this movie. <br /> <br /> The overall story is very simple, which I think will make the movie charming and eventually it has power. <br /> > Bottom of the line: The movie stream is slow. The conversation is interesting. The story is built in a gentle, systematic and genuine manner. The collection until the end is satisfying and at the end of the award
