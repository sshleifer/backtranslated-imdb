Undying is a very good game that brings new elements to use in the weary form of the first gun shooting game. It tells the story of Patrick Galloway, a magician and a formidable fighter who was called by his friends in Ireland to investigate strange phenomena. The game is based in Ireland after the First World War. So do not expect to find weapons such as chainguns or rocket launchers. All weapons in the game can be considered old. But the real fun in the game is the spells and systems used. Our heroes are left-handed, so he can use both hands at the same time: he casts a spell with his right arm and uses his gun to the left, so you can shoot and cast Spells at the same time that you understand, fun and Is also the identity of this game! The graphics are excellent and they can work very well using moderate power. P. Cool and atmospheric level design. Most games revolve around the Covenant mansion and mansion, but there are many other places waiting for you to discover while you're working. Thanks to the ability of Clyve Barker, this game has a great story and plot. (Very rare thing for the first athlete) and I said before, the atmosphere was fantastic and scary. But not great But the game has two main drawbacks. First, it is quite linear, so when your mission speaks like going to that room, every door in the house will be locked separately, leading to your mission room, which may save time but limit your freedom of exploration. The second truth, all weapons are ancient, may not attract most fps players who are familiar with high-tech weapons. As far as difficulty is concerned, the game is very well balanced. For the most part, it is difficult to moderate. But sometimes it's more difficult But not too frustratingly difficult Total immortality is a great game. One of the best frames per second, of course.
