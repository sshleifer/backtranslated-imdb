Good stories and great animations. The influence of Frazetta and Bakshi is clear and that's a good thing. Everyone who enjoys the Conan the Barbarian or the Dungeons and Dragons game should enjoy it. The battle between good and evil is clear, although sometimes our hero is neutral. Most often in fantasy movies, Elves often show that they have white skin and blonde hair and goblins and ghosts have dark skin and hair Anyone who is familiar with the work of Frazetta, Bakshi or even Tolkien knows that they are not racist. Everyone who likes fantasy movies should like this movie. It is not for young children due to violence and sexual innuendo. The casting is very good and the scene and music are number one. I hope someone will put this gem on the DVD soon. I consider myself lucky to have a VHS copy in good condition.
