When seeing A Perfect Spy mini series at one time, we couldn't do anything except the hat-hat - a pure masterpiece that compared to Le Carr√© minis. About Smiley has different features. <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> In the minis about Smiley, it is Alex Guiness as Smiley, the stealing actor - other actors who support him. He can speak. <br /> <br /> Here it is. Both sets and important stories The best actor who played by Peter Egan at the end did not have any charm. <br /> <br /> Egan just played with a man named Magnus Pym who was lying by a crooked person and told people. What they like to listen to is everyone's favorite, both small and large. The only person who seems to understand his inner self is Alex, his Czech custodian. <br /> <br /> There has never been a mechanism behind the spy and / or a traitor being said better! After following his life as a child, we understand what it is that makes him a traitor. His ability to lie and disguise everything is what made him become 'The perfect spy' while the Czech caretakers call him <br /> <br /> And by following his life, we fully understand that returning to a narrow and straightforward path How difficult it is when you divert attention. He trampled, even though he never got anything from it, except for promotion by his MI5 spy. Everyone is happy as long as the flow of fake information continues! <br /> <br /> Magnus's father plays miraculously by Ray McAnally, a bad impostor who dreams of a plan to trick people out of their money in a year. Later, it was his son who had to bail him out, but according to the example that his father and uncle had designated as a guardian when his father went to jail and his mother was sent to Magnus Hospital. Soon learned that lying was The way that survived without telling the truth At first he worked a little too hard. But learning to tell the correctness quickly and firmly, not changing the story from time to time, that he told people who wanted to hear about him and his father. Weigang was created with the help of Magnus, a network of non-existent contributors who provided counterfeit information to British MI5 for many years and many years, just as England did. German spies working in the United Kingdom before and during the war - they are still sending false information to Das Vaterland after their officers have been changed to be liquidated or replaced by MI5 men. <br /> <br /> The boy who played with Magnus at a young age couldn't do miraculously, and most were more charming than the older ones, insulting and insulting and tired, played by Eagan. But you can buy the difference easily, which is the way we change throughout life, from enthusiasm to sorrow or indifference. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth the money!
