This movie is very fun. Actors make this movie really far I will explain that it is a favorite of the new princess bride wedding ceremony that should stand against the test of time. You will see a different side from Robert DeNiro in this movie! (Worth only visiting!) All elements range from adventure to romance and comedy that are well placed. <br /> <br /> People of all ages will enjoy it. (My parents can do it!) Good special effects may be scary for kids. Good day movies. Good for escape. <br /> <br /> Deserve to be A. (Hopefully doing well at the box office)
