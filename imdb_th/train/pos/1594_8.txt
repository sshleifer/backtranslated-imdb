What I like about you is one of the series that you have to watch. But not sure if you will see a cool start and it sucks you into the series for fun. Part two in season 2-3 is more boring. They come and go in whatever you want. What happens to many series is that they do not end up with something special because the second part of the series usually goes down in the drain. This part is quite done. The third part is the part that will Spoil and destroy the whole set But it's not the end. Now, it's perfect for the series. It's perfect. In fact, I'm angry with these people in Val's life. In fact, I wanted to finish with Jeff at the end, but after that they changed to choose to Bring Vic into the series after almost 3 seasons without him and that is the greatest surprise and the thing that makes this series top. <br /> <br /> Watch this series. Many times It is not expected that the second part will be good. But the third part did what he wanted and made the series a worthwhile part of everything. I'm happy to say that I'm happy and happy with the series and now I'm going to see two women, a woman and a pizza shop. When I saw the whole set, I would come back ...
