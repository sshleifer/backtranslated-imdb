I saw "A Christmas Carol" for the first time when it first appeared on television. Actually, I expected to see this movie when advertising and it was more than I expected. Now I bought the DVD and plan to watch it every year except "It's A Wonderful Life". I consider "A Christmas Carol", one of the best Christmas movies ever. Excellent George C. Scott and lead actor Roger Rees surrounded him! Scott once again proved that he was one of the best actors of our generation. Scott has an artistic ability and acting ability to play any role and makes characters unique to himself. Someone can remember that both Patton and Scrooge Scott is very easy. That direction is great with the costumes and music scenes that make the movie feel special in time, place and age. You will just love this movie and will put it in your favorites to watch during the holiday season.
