I used to watch this movie when I traveled in Brazil. I find it difficult to understand the culture and society of Brazil because there are regional and high level differences. Seeing this movie in Sao Paulo is a revelation. It shows some things in everyday life of many Brazilians. On the other side, sometimes it is a little too real. And that is the only negative opinion I have in this movie Sometimes it's too much, too much sex, too much murder, and too much cynicism for a movie. The director can shoot a few things that are more delicate. It will make the movie more effective. <br /> <br /> Although I like this movie The characters are complex and like real people. Not an American actress and actress with many cosmetics. But people that are ugly and beautiful at the same time That makes the movie realistic even when the story is unbelievable.
