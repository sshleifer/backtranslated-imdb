Many years ago I followed the soap on the TV. So I wanted to know about this movie and I was very rewarded when I found it. It is a marvelous spoof of soap with jealousy, insecurity of normal actors and all kinds of cute excesses But more than anything - amazing actors and incredible scripts Does someone get those top performers to play in such ridiculous movies? And how does this small movie make writers write the perfect script? I never heard anyone talking about this movie or even accepting to hear it. But it's fantastic and I suggest watching Sometimes I will throw it while cleaning the house and end up sitting on the sofa, watching, laughing and enjoying all the wonderful things. Many people are happy with everyone who does it.
