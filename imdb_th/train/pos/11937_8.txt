That was the case for Angels in the Outfield last night on TV and I believe I haven't watched this movie since the second year in high school and now I'm in college for the 4th year. Many shortcomings, it's just a touch that you can't help. But sit down, watch and enjoy yourself It is also hilarious. Danny Glover's rant is above the highest level until you can't help laughing loudly in most times. It added to the movie and I'm sure it's what the director wants. You really feel the characters in the movie, even if the development is not the best, must see, I recommend <br /> <br /> 8/10
