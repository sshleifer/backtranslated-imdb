What can I tell about it? It's another Hollywood horror movie with a very high budget (80 million dollars). It's not scary. It gives a few excitement and skeletons in fireplace Special techniques and nothing more. Catherine Zeta Jones is beautiful as ever. Lily Taylor is also a great actor. The architecture of the Hill House is amazing. These monuments, statues, furniture ... delicious. I don't like the end because it's so wonderful. Check this and create your own opinion. I gave this picture 7 out of 10.
