This is an amazing movie, both the energy that comes from flamenco dancing, the attraction and from the unique way that filmmakers blend the story of creating a scene with the life of the prepared character. Spelling is the only word I can use to describe the experience. This is not 'Bizet's Carmen'. According to any normal standard, this is not a standard movie. Every exquisite eye every step of the song is lovingly combined until you can't take your eyes off the screen. You don't have to love opera or flamenco (I'm not) to be caught being intoxicated in this movie. Subtle and straightforward; Loud and still; One of them, if not the best movie, because it doesn't have much.
