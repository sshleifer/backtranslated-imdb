I absolutely love this movie I bought it as soon as I could find a copy. This movie has a lot of emotions and real feelings. I can really sympathize with the characters. Every time I watch the ending will make me cry. I can identify Busy Phillip's character, and how do I feel if it happens to me the same thing? <br /> <br /> I think every high school should show this movie. Do the same thing I recommend this movie to everyone and everyone. Especially those affected by the shooting of schools <br /> <br /> It's one of the greatest movies of all time.
