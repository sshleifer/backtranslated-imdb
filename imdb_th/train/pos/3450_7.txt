Never heard of this before until I saw a rental DVD that I had wondered before. There are many movies in the past that have good band actors who can't do anything that is a bad screenplay and Some cases seem to care. <br /> <br /> If you just watch it, there is no reason not to release this movie. The stories that are most liked in this category may seem a little forced sometimes. But there seems to be a lot of realism here as well, which gives momentum to carry. I was surprised at the work that Justin Timberlake did well with this important role. Okay. He's not an Oscar. But he will learn with each role and he shows many promises for the future here Dylan McDermott played well in his unexpected offensive role and was a selection of crops in this film. <br /> <br /> Finally, just leave it. Go You will not be disappointed. You will not be bored. Actually, I think you will be more happy with the end result.
