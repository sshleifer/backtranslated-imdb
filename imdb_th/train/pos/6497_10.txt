I have to see this thing dozens of times over the years. I was about fifteen when I saw it for the first time in B&W on a local PBS station. <br /> <br /> I bought a DVD set for the kids to watch and make them watch it. They do not teach school history and this is the most important event of the 20th century. It expands their critical thinking. <br /> <br /> Neutral, with all participants explaining in words. Of them what they do and why it details what led to war. <br /> Buy for your children along with Alistair Cooke's America. See with them and make them understand. You will be very glad you did.
