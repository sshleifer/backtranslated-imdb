Holly discusses rampant sexual exploitation issues around the world (2 million children are trafficked every year) and is sensitive and unmanageable - something that Priority Films team has achieved. Highly American actor Ron Livington starred in this film, along with new actor Thuy Nguyen, Vietnamese actress Holly who played and brought together a screen that was common for people in the famous k11 red light district in Cambodia. Even though it handles heavy topics But the movie still has a moment of laughter and hope as we get to know the characters closely, causing the two hours of the movie to be difficult to see. I'm glad that this movie brought the world's attention to the problem. Prostitution of children must be stopped and this is a very good first step. It's great and every movie must see.
