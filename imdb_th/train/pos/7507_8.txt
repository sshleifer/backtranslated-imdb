Hello again from the darkness Mary Heron is a collection of movies that give an overview of their era. "I Shot Andy Warhol" previously and "American Psycho" are best when commenting on the social quirkiness. At that time, though, "The Notorious Bettie Page" was clear about Ms. Page, but it was the highest point behind the curtain in the world of strange photography in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Movie This story is fun. Both from the perspective of the story and the technical aspects of how to shoot and gather B&W movies and photos with tiny pigments capture the time and color in Miami Beach through the photos of Bunny Yeager. <br /> <br /> <br /> A strong supporting actor with David Strathairn (live From Edward R, his role as Murrow) Chris Bauer (as Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor, the star of the film is Gretchen Mol, who is gifted and amazing Jason Alexander directed "Just Look" in 2000. She was a very passionate person in 2000. Here, she is a famous Bettie Page. Her smile is cute and her body is flawless. She seems to be happy with this role and helps us understand that the next woman from Tennessee will become the queen of the pin-up world. <br /> <br /> As expected, the soundtrack From that era, great. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two famous actors. Although the film tells a story about history in this industry But the third film, the final, remained flat to protect the magic of pure movies. But the magic of Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page makes this film a fun story to watch and another story that will give the HBO show endlessly in the near future. Now there will be someone, please change Mols to become a star as she should be?
