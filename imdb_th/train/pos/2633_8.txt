I must be honest, I expect the failure is not good because it sounds like they tried to milk the original movie to receive money. But that's not the case of funny movies. (Sometimes strange) this I like the way they tell the story of Timon and Pumba, the story with Simba and he has trouble sleeping as a joke Bubble bubble, and when Pamba left the bubble, it stopped. It's fun, harmless, suitable for children and adults. I think this movie will last for a while because it is quite good for videos and DVDs. While this movie looks strange and there are various traces to the end, it can be used 8 out of 10
