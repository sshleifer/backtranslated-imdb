Hitchcock is of the opinion that viewers are not interested in what makes the protagonists in danger. Only that they are in danger and need to escape. <br /> <br /> This film proves that Hitchcock is 100% wrong. Police believe Jean Simmons is a criminal offender. Trevor Howard decided their best action was to run to it. And the body of the movie, with our charming couple, dodge and open trains, buses and coaches - jump over rocks at the top of the waterfall - quarrel on the roof of the harbor Well - but I can't get out of my heart that it's not all necessary. They should live for a long time. <br /> <br /> In other words, MacGuffin is not strong enough.
