ZP is deeply involved with the dreams of youths represented by the hippie movement. College debates at the beginning of the film indicate the cultural situation that gave birth to such movements. The explosion that Daria imagined led to the collapse of the entire social structure, and therefore the development of the big changes that society faced, and finally the death of Mark, predicted the end point A saw for Motion The movie will be easier to understand if we go back in life in the 60's and 70's. 'Young people are the driving force for a deeper exploration for change. One of the most important changes to be made is to take sex out of the closet and I think the scene in the desert doesn't represent fun. But the sexual relationship that men and women are truly free will show in situations with hips No one is hiding from I watched a scene where couples would throw sand to each other and admire the beautiful way that A shows the impossibility to hide the basic human instincts. Oppression is a way to 'control' social eruptions at that time and that is how police use to stop students. This society suffers from hipocresy and clear when students access weapons that cross all fake controls. The conversation between the police and the college professor who was imprisoned for no reason showed that part of the society was interested in the feelings of the teenager and completely ignored. The flight presentation is a more accurate symbol for freedom. Plane theft refers to Mark's internal desires, but (back or back or back (Sekun)) shows the difficulty of getting out of bonds. These have said that A represents the death of dreams from these problems, winning games. In my view, the movie will be remembered.
