Godard once said that the way to criticize movies is to create and may be the strongest movie that can be created about Ralph Bakshi in the story of Tolkien's art. The Lord of the Rings, created by Peter Jackson Past finishes for me, not even all masterpieces. But they have enough space for each book to breathe in all postmodern techniques that go beyond traditional storytelling to give them good entertainment. <br /> <br /> But as a person That didn't read the book, now I ended up watching both versions of live action (Although some animations with large visual effects methods) and animation live by the framework) related to the basic story alone, does not make integrity with the complete book And with the version of Bakshi, it is hardly fair because what we see is not a complete picture, not a Jackson that has Robbed of Return of the Climax of the climax of the story and the other two parts became a rush. I also liked it more for what it did within the boundaries. <br /> <br /> Even though it was disappointing, disappointed. <br /> <br /> The interesting thing was that after watching the movie Jackson first - which I felt a little regret that I might respond to this thing differently. Younger than and before five years ago - is the basic element of the story, never confused with everything needed to tell the story of the friendship of the ring is quite complete and if there is anything great and great The epic in Tolkien's book will be clear in this section. The actors playing in the hobbits and other heroes are sufficient for most or less, with some outstanding parts. (John Hertford, Aragon and William Squire as Gandalf) <br /> <br /> The lack of special qualities makes the appearance a little more for those who Have never seen other movies or read books and cannot be used with context But there are always some interesting levels for the characters, and here there is more outdated feeling amidst the larger aura of it. This is not a movie adaptation of Disney's many gardens, and all of this is Bakshi movies with his underground animation roots colliding with the legendary world of Middle Earth. <br /> <br /> And what Bakshi and the animation team brought This film is a movie that ends with giving what appears on the screen in all forms of abbreviations, strikes or interesting appeals. In addition to the fact that the movie has not been completed or is the story, the film's theme is an experiment to see if there is something that can be rotated entirely The results bring about what appears to be retro. But at that time it was a rude and crazy inspiration for the filmmakers. Would it be better if there were more traditional drawing animations? In part, yes, it becomes a little obvious, as in the case of Bakshi's American Pop, where the main characters move in a slightly shaky manner, like some comic books that do in a different way. There is still a lot that I admire about what I do. <br /> <br /> For example, Orcs I find it really amazing. They may be the best part of the mix of animation on live action, especially in the absence of combat imagery. (That is really a hit or miss part because there is no continuation from the good and bad rotoscoping) and Chiaroscuro comes with a big shape on the horse. It's creepy in a good way. And backgrounds, while still too rough and sometimes too beautiful, with a combination of color and explosion It's almost something for an art movie as much as a bean ring. <br /> <br /> So how do I introduce this movie to the Lord of the Rings? I don't know what to say. Of course, it is a good smile over Tolkien's other animated films that I've seen the Hobbit. (And I still do not see ROTK animation) and there are real art works. In addition, there are arrogant conversations. The Two Towers group rushed together with the most interesting characters that Gollum was reduced to two. Scenes in every scene And seeing something like this just ended <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the book that thinks about this, I will say it's worth the opportunity, even if it's a chance for you to watch for four. Ten minutes and deciding whether or not to stop it or not. For the story that is appropriate for Bakshi's other movies, I saw that it was an ambitious and uncertain achievement that Lynch's Dune. There is an obligation to draw a black line that looks like Mordor in the sand between those who hate my shirt.
