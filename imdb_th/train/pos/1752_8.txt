Sex spoiler? It is one of the most fundamental parts of human life. Yet, have we never been too serious about it? People always want more, even those who receive it on a daily basis, and if you are unlucky, it may affect the change of life (creation) that may occur. The ironic people claim that all of us started having sex at a young age. (Even though Victoria was married and had children in early adolescence), so it would have to be more difficult for those who reached the celibacy. In the movie, leading the first big story of Steve Darel, he played the 40-year-old man without managing it. Treating us in countless sexual and gender-related incidents, not to mention vulgarity, rather than the "Eurotrash" episode. The general plot of the film and the principles it sounds are not funny. It is surprising, therefore, for all the inappropriate and failed jokes, there are many people who come to mark and let the audience be hysterical. <br /> <br /> Andy Stitzer (Carell) is a person. Good with good work and pleasant mood Although at the same time he was blatantly too serious and after being invited to play poker as a fifth member needed, Andy's friends discovered his secret at the age of 40. Andy remained pure. Now for many reasons But most of the three poor men (Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen and Romany Malco) all give Andy advice with the same goal in mind. To bring him out of misery and place him. <br /> <br /> One of the few good things about "Anchorman". It's just a matter of time before Steve Carell will be his leader. He was impressed with "The Virgin, 40 years old". He did not disappoint. Carell was a revelator when he gradually increased his confidence in following the advice of helping <br /> <br /> Carell was not alone. Showing his Rudd, Rogen, Malco and Catherine Keener due to Love is a wonderful thing. Rudd is a personal favorite as a lover of David who has fallen in love many times and shared the best scenes with Rogen while both argued about homosexuality. <br /> < br /> The biggest surprise of this movie is not the way Many jokes enter the mark. But actually it's a smart way to turn the text on its head. Obviously designed to conserve America, the whole tone of the film evolved from conquest of sex to safe sex and abstinence. Virgins do not want sex to complete their lives. They need confidence and true love. The message that is worth the sermon and the tremendous improvement for what you expect to see at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> It's strange to see comedy movies that are funny and good but low. And low, behold, "Virgin 40 years old" is just that Send a meaningful message and you are a leading comedian. Surprising happiness
