With my surprise, I like 'Spacecamp'. I remember when I saw it about 13 years ago and recently I was hired again. I am very impressed Obviously, the special effects in today's space movies such as Armageddon and Deep Impact are superior to SpaceCamp. However, this film has eighty-story stories that you can recite in the next line before hearing. But that's what I like about it - they haven't done this movie anymore, so it's a refreshing change. It is interesting to see Kelly Preston, Leaf Phoenix and Lea Thomson in the first role with Tom Skerrit and Kate Capshaw to add content to the plot of the light & soft love robot named Jinx. Unfortunately, there are more emotions than some main characters. This film is almost inspiring in its own way and it's interesting to know that it was filmed at NASA Spacecamp in Alabama (I think).
