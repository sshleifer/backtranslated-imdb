I enjoy movies like this for their souls without pun intended. It was a good and clean movie about a baseball team that fell in love. The boyfriend wanted them to win because the dead father said that it was the only way he would come back to him. Shining in two ways: comedian Danny Glover and Joseph Gordon-Levitt Young and Al Herald, the heavenly news anchor. It's a movie that is full of energy. It makes you smile and relate to you in real sports. <br /> <br /> In my hand, one thing that makes me psychotic is a sports movie that makes you a true fan of the team. There is nothing wrong with that. I just found it strange that I should go out of the movie, thinking that the angel is a strong and cool team when my base loyalty, like it is with the Toronto Blue Jays. It's really interesting. If it's just a movie about the underdog team, it's okay.
