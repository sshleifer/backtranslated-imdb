The only word that summed up this movie was very strange. It is a gentle romp through the concept of existentialism (in more ways than one) and slightly crazy. I will not call it a movie that is big and memorable, and it doesn't seem as impressive as the first movie director of the "Cube", but it's a delight to watch on Sunday morning. Actors from those who have been honored to be annoying sometimes But I believe that is the way to write Doing as a serious movie, it may be great or maybe going into a slight pretense, such as "Matrix", found "head", found "human nature" <br /> <br /> 6.8 out of ten
