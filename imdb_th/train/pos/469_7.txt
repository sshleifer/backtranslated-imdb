The story is quite interesting. But the characters are quite flat and sometimes too intense in their thoughts / behaviors More than necessary In addition, I think there is something wrong with casting. John Turtro is not pleased with me playing semi-autistic chess, not talking about Italian players Motivation is not very specific as well. <br /> <br />
