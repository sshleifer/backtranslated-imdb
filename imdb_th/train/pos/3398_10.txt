I saw Soylent Green back in 1973, when it was first released and maybe an additional eight times over the years about TV or video. It was one of my favorite sci-fi movies and / or charts. <br /> <br /> Recently, the Egyptian theater in LA has twelve films in Charlton Heston dating back. I flew out of the state to see six movies over a period of two days. Soylent Green looked good on a large Egyptian screen with a complete new print. From editing, opening up to the scene, returning home to a great ending, this great movie. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston is a cop who lives in dogs that eat dogs in the dog world. With low natural resources The whole world used to be and Eddie Robinson as a person who remembered the past very well. <br /> <br /> Their chemistry together is great. The film still looks much better in the 35 mm print. Great. Fleisher knows how to fill screens and theaters, write songs that are used and everything about it. This film has a lot of power in the cold and possible perspective in the future. Just thinking about how the population of the world grows, the rainforest disappeared, the resources lost, the impact of the greenhouse began to worsen since 1973. I just wondered why the film was not played in theaters over the years. The reputation should be better. <br /> <br /> Speaking of fame often speaks as Charlton Heston is not a great actor. See him in El-Cid, Soylent Green, The Warlord, The Omega Man, Will Penny and Major Dundee are backward. I believe he is one of our best actors. Of course, he has created many great movies and for those interested, you know what they are. <br /> <br />
