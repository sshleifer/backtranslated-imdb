Recently I rented this document, remembering that I heard this from IMDb.com and was amazed by the evidence. I know very little about these bands. But I remember having heard "Not if you are the last junkie on earth" by Dandy Warhols many years ago and enjoy it. That said, this is my view on the document: <br /> <br /> One of the things that I discovered amazing about this film is that there is no need to have previous knowledge of both of these bands. Ondi Timoner doesn't waste time attracting viewers and getting acquainted with people in this film. I became a part of both Anton and Courtney's life, including the related bands The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols. I think that's part of what makes this document very good and what makes Ondi Timoner do it High level documentary <br /> <br /> I love how to tell the story of these bands as well. What you see most is the band's tour. Both bands began to play in small places and tried to make it in the music industry. Throughout the film, each band is determined to remain unique and uncontrolled by the norm. However, this is what makes both bands similar and makes a great view about how the two feathers can walk in different directions. <br /> <br /> In general. You don't need special love for documentaries or both. The appreciation of music can help. But music itself uses the relationship between love / hate between The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols.
