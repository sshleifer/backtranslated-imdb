Yes, some people say that this movie is a waste of money. But I'm a dead man, a dragon / a world-class action movie fan / sacred holy shit. <br /> <br /> But if you take it from My position, this movie has the best action scenes that are interesting. But it is such a movie that everything is broken at the right time or when the evil triumphs, something falls down to help them at the right time Although there are funny lines and gangs throughout the movie that surprised me <br /> <br /> 3D graphics are quite good. I mean, this kind of movie, 3D effect is great !!!! The big battle that appears in the movie trailer depends on what the movie has. The battle between good and the last evil is that I must say that it should be a little longer and better. But still quite good I mean, if you don't want to watch this movie in the cinema, at least it's a DVDer ... Overall <br /> <br /> I like this movie. But the plot is fast and compatible Fit with fierce
