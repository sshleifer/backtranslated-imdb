For the Hupla, respect and acceptance of this film from the history of Kung Fu, it still lacks clarity on two important aspects: action scenes and fighting scenes. But I must say that the story seems to be the best and the most original I have ever seen in the five Deadly Venoms martial arts movies. Without a doubt, there is no need to see just the movies that you can watch again and again; But I must say that after watching it, you feel that it will be better. It makes you want something you want more. The creator of Chang Cheh created a beautiful storyline to be a potential teacher. But did not follow up with the actions we needed more The fighting style in the movie captures the audience (Centipede, Snake, Scorpion, Lizard, Toad) and shows. But the battle is obviously short The toad and snake patterns are especially interesting and more likely to be displayed. In fact, the toad was killed in the middle of the movie. Interesting enough for this film, if there is no continuous action or fight that will lead to the development of a great plot, this is one of the few kung fu movies that you are interested in and focus on the results. The film has dark tones and rocks and you will be drawn into the atmosphere. Scary weapons and torture tactics are used in movies and add to the feel of the movie. To start the movie and introduce the producer Poison Clan Chang Cheh, take us to a dirty dungeon. The final scene is very good. But it doesn't look good and you expect more Although this movie is one of the best and most fun Shaw Brothers. My overall impression of this movie will end with this: the style that the fighters use to show us only and do not show details. The sad thing is that the director has products for things that are not at their fingertips. Touched. I was left wondering how to get to this movie is still one of the best 8 out of 10 levels.
