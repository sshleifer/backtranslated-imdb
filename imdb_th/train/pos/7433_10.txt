My mother took me to watch this movie when it came out in Christmas 1976. I like it a lot. Now I love it. I know that everyone enjoys doing Barbra's hair in this game, but I think she looks good and sounds good! ... and I seem to remember the number of women who imitated at the time! In addition, the bath scene between Streisand and Kristoferson is very sexy! The music is also great. This is the strongest Babs that you are the best!
