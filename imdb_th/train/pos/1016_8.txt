I will get this wonderful series otherwise. Full score 10 if Claudia Black doesn't continue there! Her combination as 'Vela' is ridiculous. Bring the series into my assessment. In taking her at the same time, including Ben Browder, to replace the RDA is a mistake. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we just turned from losing 'Jack' and Do not want this wonderful thing The series became a new episode of 'Farscape'. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the movie "Stargate" and when the series was announced for the first time, I booked that it would live with the movie. this story But after that At first I had to admit that I was hooked. I always look forward to new episodes.
