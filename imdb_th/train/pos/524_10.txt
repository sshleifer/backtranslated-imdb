I saw this movie many years ago on television late at night. Back to that time, the name of "Stairway to Heaven", even as a young boy, I still remember the impressive story and the visual impact of the court's trial. (Those who see it know what I'm talking about) Imagine like this! The perfect combination of romance, drama, humor and imagination. This film is there, with the greatest classic ever: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind. Ranked very high by IMDB voters and voters with more than 51% to score 10 out of 10; More than 84% rated 8 or higher out of 10. I was surprised that it was not on the list of 250 top movies until I knew there were very few people who saw / rated this movie. Unfortunately, I hope. This movie will be released on DVD for Region 1 (North America), so 1) I can buy it and 2) others find this hidden treasure.
