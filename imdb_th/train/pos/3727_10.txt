Tigerland is one of the best movies I have seen and in my opinion it is more than a full metal film jacket in a similar manner. Bozz plays very well by Farrell and is the character in your heart. Long after the movie ended The ending was cut by Schumacher by singing a melodious chorus and the slow voices of the soldiers preparing to leave the film.
