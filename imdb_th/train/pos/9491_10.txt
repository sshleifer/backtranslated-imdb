Henri Verneuil's films may not be as famous as Parallax View, 3 Days of the Condor or JFK, but it is not worse and sometimes better than these classic agents. The action took place in the Western state of the wear, where the president was killed. After several years of investigation, the special government committee decided that the president had been killed by a single gunman. But a man - Attorney Walney, played by Yves Montand - thinks there is something that needs to be investigated further, so the movie begins. This film is not related to certain theories. But it gathers the entire relationship structure between the government and society in today's world. Such movies can only be created in 1970, but will never lose reality. Moreover, it is still a little scary that Oracle has a precision of 10 out of 10.
