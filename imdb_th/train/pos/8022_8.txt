Jim Henson's Muppets have been my favorite since childhood. This movie makes me feel like a kid again. Muppets. Come back with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their friends. The location is that they try to go on Broadway in the theatrical performance. Music in other places than New York City You will see a cameo picture from New York City Mayor Ed Koch. However, this movie will be 25 years old and I hope that the children today will learn to appreciate the muppets of the merryness. The problem with acting is Kermit disappeared and the gang must find him in New York City. It is worthwhile to watch children and even adults who appreciate it like themselves.
