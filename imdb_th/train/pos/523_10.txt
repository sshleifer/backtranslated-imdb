Why is this movie not the best in 250 stories? This film is still surprisingly fresh after 56 years of production, but it can happen after W.W.II because of the perception of death. People are more aware that life can be stopped at unexpected times. And after what life I liked this scene at the end with the judgment and all the people gathered together. The judge was indifferent (Abraham Sofaer - General English judge), Doctor Reeves (Roger Livesey) defending Peter Carter (David Niven) and June (Kim Hunter) with American prosecutor Abraham Farlan (Raymond Massey I -there is the reason why It's an American style -) It's all imagination! Michael Powell writes, directs, and produces amazing movies that are true "tour-de-force". The text of this movie is clear: in the legal universe is the most important. But in this world there is nothing but love between humans. The way to tell this beautiful story is more interesting than a Hollywood movie that can be created.
