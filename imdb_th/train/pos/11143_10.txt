Saw that this was an innocent punk when it was first released If I smell the baby when I leave the theater, try not to let anyone see it. So when I saw it again in the year '07, I knew what to expect again and the sobs were ready and prepared for the desired time. Fortunately, this time I was at home. <br /> <br /> What I don't remember from my youthful viewing - or perhaps not observing because it's the technical intelligence of the movie. this Using backward events that tell many stories without using conversations Camera work that seems to put the audience together with the characters in the scene Think of the gap when Joe crosses the road to a restaurant, a camera, a rear camera, a woman and a child sitting on the front bench in front of the road frame. <br /> <br /> Own stories and characters - scary, sad and devoid Mercy It is a very impressive story that gets close attention to human drama like this to most of our people. Then again, Joe & Ratso may be any of us. Must be '70 when I see it. I remember when leaving the theater, I was forced to search for a friend's company. Many years later, I'm glad I wasn't alone tonight. This is one of the great movies.
