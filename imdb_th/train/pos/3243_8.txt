Can you remember the start date of pay-per-view? I do and I almost remember the number you have to call to rent movies on t.v. As a child, we always want to rent Playboy. But this means calling someone from PPV and asking to rent it. Then you will be thrilled to do it and watching your soft four-hour axis without shit angles. The reason I talk about this is because this movie is the same as ppv and I remember almost every scene that is in the additions. I have been kicked in the last few years to get all the great movies I use to watch as a child and this is one of them. It's about when it's hard to close. A star starring trying to do a perfect bank. But nothing went wrong There are many bank spoofers that are good and this person must fall in that category. It has enough action and laughter to keep it. Check if you dare!
