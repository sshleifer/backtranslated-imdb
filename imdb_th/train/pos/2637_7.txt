This is a direct video movie, so go without saying that it won't be a rival to the first Lion King. But that is a very good story. <br /> <br /> My kids like this but received. They love everything that is cartoon. The big shock is * I * like it too. It laughs out loud in some parts (even a funny * fart). There is a creative idea that is quite bound to the first movie and even the jokes you have to do. Will be older to understand (But without being a risqu√© like in Shrek ["Do you think he compensates something?"]) <br /> <br /> Special note about a fart joke. I was surprised to find that there was no The joke is just the sound of the bathroom. (In fact, there is almost no sound / picture at all. The reference is quite subtle). They have setup / punchline / etc and almost tastes good. I want my children to think that there is more humor than going to the bathroom and this movie is okay. <br /> <br /> What else is there? Music is as good as creativity, not like in the first movie or second story. But fun for children. There is no painful painful moment which is a blessing for me. A little action, but nothing too scary (NIMH's secret makes the nightmares of my children not sure that G's rating That is suitable for that person ...) <br /> <br /> All in all Movies for children of all ages, one of them is 100% safe to let them watch. (I tried not too sensitive But I have to jump up and turn off the TV between a few movies that are suitable for children less than expected) - but you are safe to leave the room during this time I will say that stick around anyway you may find that you enjoy it too :)
