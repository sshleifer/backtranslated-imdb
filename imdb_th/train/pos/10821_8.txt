I also saw this when it was launched in 56 years and received attention since then with the final scene. If this is the answer to 'High Noon', it will be an appropriate and appropriate response. The idea that while this line is heading "The city comes together" is a message that is stronger than the desolate personal courage of 'High Noon' in this theme. 'Concho' is the precursor of one of my all-time favorites 'Magnificent Seven'. Ra and Conrad gave impressive and reliable performances, especially Sinatra's transition from brother to child who was persecuted as a city liberator. I hope that at some point, every friend and family that I love me in this movie will have the opportunity to experience it on their own.
