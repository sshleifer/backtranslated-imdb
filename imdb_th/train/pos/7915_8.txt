This is "thinking through time" through computer animation, which is the work of more than 300 artists created in the late 80s and launched in 1990. This is a cutting-edge thing for today. I think it's good and interesting in hot spots. <br /> <br /> Most of the short scenes are not reasonable, just develop into other styles, but it's fun to watch. This is all about the image, not any matter. There are strange sequences in which strange creatures that dance will go along with the birds they hear. All are computer animations that are new. At that time, even the word "computer animation" was not well known. <br /> <br /> It's just an opportunity to show this new technology in things. That resembles a short cartoon without words, just pictures with electronic music Stoner will have to really love this thing. <br /> <br /> It is a very fascinating story. 40 minutes of "eye candy" and "head candy" from CG effects today. Affecting loss But I think you will be entertained by this
