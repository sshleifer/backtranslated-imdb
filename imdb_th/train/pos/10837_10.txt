As a rocker of age, this film discusses Heep and Quo - my favorite band, 2 people - but with great actors (everyone) - and a wonderful story - I love this creative genius. I can't recommend more - and Mick Jones has increased. (Foreign actors and main songwriters, along with the greatest rock singer ever - Lou Gramm) - I have watched this great event more than 10 times. Jimmy Nail - Every talent penetrated. Pores - then Astrid .... and Karen ..... The old rocker will ask for more !! 10/10 - Great blood <br /> <br /> Ala Stare, Perth, Western Australia, originally from Windsor, England
