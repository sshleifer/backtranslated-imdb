This film deals with Irish riots in the 1920s and the life of a man, especially after he told friends about his head's favor and the consequences. Watching the movie, I feel that you can play and have a little update done again, and it's sad to still fit in a contemporary event. But the rebuilding will not be as good as it should be A spectacular performance by Victor McLaglen (which he deserves Oscar) and the best actor, including the most famous actors, if not all actors with Brogues in Hollywood. Known to start out with very good movies that should be worth watching. Highly recommended
