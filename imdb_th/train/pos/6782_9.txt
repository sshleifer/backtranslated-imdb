Ronald Coleman plays the famous Broadway actor who has already lost his mind and identity. After playing for many years, he cannot remember who he is - who is his role and who is himself. And the more serious he started to see and hear his play, even in normal everyday life Therefore, since he is playing in "Othello", he begins to show envy and suspicion as well as the character's name. Eventually it led him to the depths of insanity and murder. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie many years ago and liked it. I just saw it again and loved it. Maybe my enthusiasm may be because I have always liked Ronald Colman and this is a big victory for him - and earned him the best male lead. And when watching the competition that year (Gregory Peck for GENTLEMAN, John Garfield for BODY and SOUL, William Powell for LIFE with FATHER and Michael Redgrave for becoming BECOMES ELECTRA) I think Colman is a very good choice. His usual comfort zone and more demanding duties Half of their criticism However, this movie isn't really about Shakespeare and it doesn't matter if you don't like Shakespeare. I'm not a big fan of Shakespeare. But was surprised by the small play that Coleman issued a new law - although as I said, this is not really a movie about Shakespeare. But it was a wonderful image of the actor who lost his mind and blended his stage role with reality May be any drama Cute movie script - with the sound of Film Noir. Fortunately, the performance was also great because Coleman received excellent support from Signe Hasso, Shelly Winters and Edmond O'Brien (who was especially good - He played his role correctly) and considering the great George Cukor being directed, it is not surprising that it was a great movie from beginning to end.
