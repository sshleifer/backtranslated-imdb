I love Monte Carlo and enjoy this movie thoroughly. I think everyone is very good. I am not familiar with Richard Lewis. I think he makes his character (Julian Peters) a funny and attractive person. Sean is also very good, because the girl who was rejected was denied with a gold heart. George Hamilton is a charming and perfect Italian man. John Kandy has a day in the field, like the kind-hearted James Belushi is hysterical as a whole jerk. Cybill Shepard gives a wonderful performance as a neglected housewife. A delightful actor series Many abilities, many clever scripts, and beautiful places Just good, come pick me up for a boring day Especially in winter when traveling to Europe is not at your horizon
