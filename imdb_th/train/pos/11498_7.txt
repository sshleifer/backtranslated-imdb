"Kolchak: the Night Stalker" is a frenetic entertainment television series, which is repeated forty times in the fight against humans with supernatural powers. (And sometimes as aliens) This movie was very popular with the story of the character Kolchak. This drama quickly died in the mid-1970s due to low ratings. But it still continues to maintain strong ideology today But the average modern audience can dig Kolchak and his weekly clash with the Undead? <br /> <br /> That's a very difficult question to answer fairly. The detractors in this series tend to argue that they are formulated and outdated. On the other hand, fans insist that it is written wisely, well done and sometimes truly scary and I? I have both feet in the camp. I enjoy watching all 20 Kolchak episodes on DVD recently. But I can clearly see that the series has major drawbacks. <br /> <br /> I will answer Kolchak's question as a "formula" novel. Now I think we can all agree that the TV program. Most of them have formulas - almost every episode of Columbo that unfolds in the same style. Repeating doesn't have to be a bad thing in itself. In fact, critics have long accepted that audiences often enjoy and seek entertainment repeatedly. However, Kolchak's problem is that the formula is too strict - it's too repetitive, even the most generous standard. <br /> <br / > In almost every episode, Kolchak investigates the murder and thinks it is a commitment. By some monsters He tried to publish a story about a monster that spoke. But his editor Vincenzo always blocked him in the area where Kolchak did not have enough evidence to support his claim that the supernatural forces were working and alas, Kolchak was also intercepted by the police. So in the end, Kolchak did an independent research on this monster to find a way to kill it ... then kill it. If there is no ritual or reward or write a big story about it, <br /> <br /> You can See that the strict formulas that were used before are boring? I am very surprised by Vincenzo - if Kolchak always speaks crazy about monsters and Vincenzo never believes ... Well, why Vincenzo didn't shoot Kolchak or make him? That is what the normal boss will do. But the series avoids this realism and likes to let Vincenzo and Kolchak be comedic opponents. As a result, their scenes are deeply unbelievable together - even if they are quite funny. <br /> <br /> Kolchak's best episode manages to jump over the limitations of this formula. Will be because they have Some unexpected twists These selected episodes are good enough that I think they are mostly immune to the general criticism of the series. Some of my favorites include: <br /> <br /> Horror in height - memorable episodes for filth, creativity and social awareness. Kolchak's dialog box has unusual and unusual edges. Although it is closely tied to the Kolchak formula, the script (written by veteran Hammer Studios Jimmy Sangster) has amazing knowledge and it penetrates deep into the monster's backstory. <br /> <br /> Demon platform - The possible inspiration for the movie "Omen" is now outstanding for me because the villain - Tom Skerritt, who is very young - tempts Kolchak to make a promise to Satan that is full of goodies. (And so it reveals a lot about the character of the reporter) <br /> <br /> Firefall - now seems to have a bad reputation among the fans, but I enjoy it because it has herring The good reds and the creepy monsters are really almost impossible to pass. <br /> <br /> Although I have said three times now to compliment, I will say that most stories are fun at least. For my money, there are only two turkeys in 20 runs: Primal Scream, which is about a monkey man running rampant in Chicago and a guard who is the most stupid make-up animal in the history of entertainment taken. Do (and this assessment comes from Doctor Who and Godzilla for life!) <br /> <br /> From the balance, this is a good series, maybe a little bit repeated, but there are some parts of greatness. Even during the weaker episodes of the wonderful Darren McGavin performance like Kolchak, filled with fear, a tiring world and endless fun. He easily carried the series in the way Sarah Sarah Michelle never dealt with "Buffy". McGavin is one of the great characters and this series is worth watching him alone.
