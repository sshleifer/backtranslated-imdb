The 74th Academy Award is great. Whoopi's work as EmCee is funny and very light. Personally, I love her last act, which composes a cold opinion because of the abusive language and disgusting jokes. But it's okay The audience seems to like it. Halle Berry, Denzel Washington, Ron Howard, Woody Allen and Sidney Poitier make this a television Oscar to remember. <br /> <br />
