Yes, I remember! Many years ago I watched it. Such stories are all surreal, but very good! What everyone who grants and reviews the movie should take into consideration is that the relevant movie has a purpose. It is the same as the "first child", which follows a similar pattern. Some movies - like this here - just aiming at nonsense and jokes. Such movies cannot score too much from the critic's point of view. Of course, these movies lack quality, lacking complicated stories and often lacking first-class performances. I don't have this movie in my forever favorites. But I still think it's funny. There are many fun sequences. Brian Bonsall is a genius actor.
