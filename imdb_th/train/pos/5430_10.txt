Among the British imperialist films, such as Four Feathers, Charge of the Light Brigade. For example, this movie stands out as a cream of crops. It reflects the moment "The sun never fell in the British Empire" received more than that. I will not explain the reason because many others show a lot of reasons for making this movie better. I visited Alabama Hill and took pictures through which the British passed and it remained the same, not changed by time and invasion by humans and the army. And even though I knew that it was coming to see Din lying dead on a stretcher and when these lines were read, <br /> <br /> "Yes, Din! Din! Din! You movie Lazarushian <br /> <br /> Gunga Din! Even though I expected your belt and flanked you, <br /> <br /> by Gawd of Livin that makes you <br /> <br /> You are better than me. > I am still 54 years old and over. There are gloomy eyes and anyone who says they are not liars. The range of inner emotions is a mark of great movies. As well as the ending of another great movie about Mice and Men
