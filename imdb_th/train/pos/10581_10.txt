The opium nest is a dirty little boy (actually a dwarf). A lot of prostitutes have a fracas at a hotel for sexual pretense. Nigga sex, a little baby boy with a split, a gangster fell down the stairs. Bars with Asian, African and Angleseans perform equally well. Does this sound like playing a movie at a local department store? This is the scene from the 1933 musical drama. <br /> <br /> The first half of "Footlight Parade" is preparing for the music festival that takes the second half of the movie. Chester Kent (Cagney) is about to lose work. And losing his wife, which was the result of a live stage drama talk His producers took him to see John Wayne's popular conversation in "The Big Trail". Before performing each flick, the dance number was presented as an introduction. Shorts, news rolls, publications, and cartoons later will serve the purpose. Kent has the idea that Shane, the prologue, will be the way to salvation for the diminishing live music business. Ken is the person who has the idea of ​​choreographer Busby Berkeley. Is it possible that Cagney's character is imitated by Berkeley? May be. <br /> <br /> In preparation for the opening scene, Kent knows that his thoughts are stolen by an opponent. He exposes the traitor to shoot him, then does not know that he has a new leak that is planted in the form of a dazzling deceiver. His assistant Nans Prescott (Joan Blondell - will soon be Mrs. Dick Powell) has a hot spot for Kent and is determined to reveal the temptation of the deceiver. A new singer from Arkansas College appeared in the form of Scotty Blain (Dick Powell), who discovered the truth and paired up with Bea Thorn (Ruby Keeler), the three plays that were presented, which could not be presented on the film's stage. Any day is fresh and fun today like seventy years ago. "Honeymoon hotel", "waterfall" and "Shanghai Lil." <br /> <br /> The special note is the music and dance of James Cagney, as well as Fred Astaire and Bill "Bojangles" Robinson. Cagney's dance That looks natural and doesn't understand even when the hour enters practice to make each step correct Not as good as a singer. As Astaire, Cagney's singing, like Astaire, sounds natural, unlike the songs that were popular at that time. It's amazing that one person has the same ability and variety as James Cagney. <br /> <br /> Most critics like the group "Shanghai Lil" more than the other two. Nonetheless, the kaleidoscope of "By a Waterfall" is amazing. The way in which Berkeley was able to shoot underwater ballet and creating a snake chain of humans must be difficult because never repeated. Taking close-up shots that are cleverly blended with distant angles is something that shouldn't be missed. The sharp black-and-white photography is more artistic than it used to be. If filmed in color, <br /> <br /> Although not aware of society as well as "gold digging in 1933" "Footlight Parade" stands. On its own as one of the most amazing musicals
