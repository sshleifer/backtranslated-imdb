Tom Cat, Jerry Mouse and Spike The Dog (here called Butch, the third name, his second name is 'Killer') decided to sign a peace treaty to love everyone It's strange and quite strange to see them as close friends. Everyone like this and their friends also think. But in the end, thanks to steaks that don't agree, everything comes back to normal and everything is as it should be. This short is one of two of the three new DVD Spotlight that will be edited and I don't know why this one. This cartoon can be found on one DVD disc in the DVD Spotlight collection of "Tom & Jerry" <br /> <br /> My grade: B
