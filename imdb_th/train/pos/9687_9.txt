Parrot speaks not a hugely imaginative idea for a new movie. But Polly changed his mind into a warm and heartwarming movie that would make everyone in the family happy. It manages to bridge the gap between the trash that is sensitive and the brutal cruelty between Marie and Paulie's separation and all the events in the movie lead to a very satisfying emotional conclusion. Animal training works well - everyone will be affected when Polly spreads his wings and flies for the first time. Polly is a great character and should have been more successful, although this movie is not the highlight of 1998. Unlike Saving Private Ryan, this half time will be a fun time and one that you will memorize Polly's story is a sad, moving, fun and interesting story. From the first moment he meets his former owner, you will enjoy following him and watching him learn about friendship and reality. Don't be afraid to miss if you have any heart or emotions. 9/10
