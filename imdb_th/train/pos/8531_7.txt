Although the plot is quite awkward at times, and VERY rushes in at the end, as if the director has timed out and wants to rush and finish the story. Cable TV type <br /> <br /> However, the actress who plays Mariana Klaviano is very good! I hope to see you more in the land movie. The song is also well made, making everything possible cool from dah-DUH-dah-DUH (think "JAWS") creates musical tensions. <br /> <br /> want to watch "while Children Sleep" again, but if I do it will focus Klaveno's show with talent
