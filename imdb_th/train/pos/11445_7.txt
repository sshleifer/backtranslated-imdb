A new way to enjoy the work of Goldsworthy Rivers and Tides helps fans see his work. Watch Goldsworthy create his piece, one developed admiration for every stone, leaf and thorn that he used. And how currents inspire and affect his work Even though I am happy, this film covers the parts of Goldsworthy (no snowballs). I feel it's a bit long. The filmmakers performed a great role in bringing Goldsworthy to life and creating a beautiful movie that was a pleasure to watch.
