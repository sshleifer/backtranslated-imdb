This movie is about human relationships. Charming, funny and well written, with meaningful messages. It seems that Morgan Freeman is definitely fun. Paz Vega's great song is a beautiful and intelligent woman. I really enjoyed her performance. Women like her are a great motivation to learn Spanish. From the time that Morgan Freeman met with Paz Vega, the lovely viewpoint occurred in a journey that was closer to two strangers who learned to pay attention to where their lives were 10 or less Of fun in life If you enjoy this movie, please see The Pursuit of Happiness with Will Smith and his son. That is not an action movie or a nude comedy. It's all about human relationships.
