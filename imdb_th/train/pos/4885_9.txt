Possible spoilers: The pendant that appears at the end. <br /> <br /> Not many people see many good and memorable actors. (Almost all actresses are precise) in one movie Although only a few leaves appear for each pendant, it is a gem. The English people make jokes and live in real life better than every IMO, so it's not surprising that most actors are British. <br /> <br /> Music is great. No doubt that it must be dubbed (Leslie Caron * Really playing bass? Maybe - who knows?) But Clio Lane is not a distortion of himself - the sound of her warm internal organs> <br /> As a musician, age is not quite old and uncertain in that class. Is a movie that encourages as well - great movies for everyone who suspects that they have passed through their careers or Whatever profession it may be And of course, is a great celebration of life on stage. <br /> <br /> I missed a little launch. But temporarily 9/10 - and of course it makes us want to see everything
