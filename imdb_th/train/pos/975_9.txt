Also known as Big Spook War. The Great Yokai War is an attempt by Miike in the family movie and works well as well. The problem is that I can't imagine how many parents want their children to watch this movie. The best children's movies are scary movies or have an interesting picture about Neverending Story and Return to Oz when thinking of spring, but in the case of the Great Yokai War Miike it may take too long. In fact, in the film screening, I was the one who introduced the movie that reiterated to the two families that it might not be appropriate. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the young hero of the piece introducing himself and explaining. About his current family problems, the short period of this violence was severely broken when the cow gave birth to a calf with a human face, who screamed that something terrible was about to come before falling down. Like a nasty thing, it is possible Respect for some strange Quato. <br /> <br /> Follow the incredible advice for Kato Baddie, the master and his evil woman Agi. The story returned to normal for a moment. But soon the logic will flow down and the young men and groups of Miyazaki refuse to take the evil magicians out. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is quite basic and surprising to some. Once the movie was selected, the pair didn't seem to be at all in the movie that regularly destroyed the ancient idea. But was helped by the terrifying vision of the magic world This is the movie Miyazaki that became an action movie, even though it is a film that is more fierce and fierce than the general Miyazaki movie. <br /> <br /> This film is happy to see the design. Of colorful yokai And actually works while the evil robots, while not showing the best CGI in the world, are real and dangerous to them which makes them a clearer threat than you expected. <Br /> <br /> Consistent great performers, they just make the characters look completely natural, which is commendable when you consider that most are in makeup or rubber kits. Even Agi with wood Whether it's a ridiculous bee seen due to excellent performances from Kuriyami surprisingly /> <br /> While the film <br This story has many elements that make it into the realm of family movies; Cute creatures, young heroes, evil villains, bad feelings and adventures and lack of violence There are elements that make you wonder if Miike should direct this movie. <br /> <br /> The robot army is a terrifying thing in everyday life that has been provoked by monsters like the T-101. sans and chainsaw saws. These beasts rip the characters in pieces, suck creatures into the bloody mouth and kidnap children from their homes by swiping them from under the parents' nose before <br /> <br /> The creation of living creatures is difficult for the mind. The heroic Yokai boy is fed into a large furnace filled with hatred that destroys the corrosive conditions. Yokai's flesh and forcing their angry spirits to occupy the metal. If children think Anakin is intoxicated, wait until they see a large hedgehog that is burnt to death in the tank. For one minute before it becomes an abomination of a motorcycle. In addition, there is a separation of limbs in one case, hands jerking in front of the camera, dropping blood, proper sexual energy (Agi wears a suit designed specifically for service fans and seems to be sleeping with Kato as inspiration while At The Princess of the River does not wear anything, and makes her thighs unraveled by many young girls in the scene) and the general humor that goes over the heads of those who this technological miracle seems to be designed for. <br /> The spoiler, an example of this, is at Yokai. Just pay attention to the final battle when they think it's a great party. The subsequent battle of the festival will have more than everything with beer. There is also a scene in which Agi bashing the tart of a cute furry animal that seems to be designed to attract a crowd of boring people with too many Pok√©mon. <br /> <br /> End Spoilers at the end Of the Great Yokai War, Miike's strongest movie, while it lacks some charm of speaking Gozu or Ichi. It is just pushing the audience to the streets of general insanity. In fact, this is easily the most criticized movie of Miike, which he captures the wonders of the story. <br /> <br /> Worth the look for flash. Gogo
