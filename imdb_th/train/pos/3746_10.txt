I love this movie / Synopsis Jason Steele is great! My favorite part is French music and in the open position when the paddle soldiers shout "SPOONS!" I quit every time. I would like to introduce this film to the fans of Knox Klaymation and other fans of Jason Steele. His style of animation is very traditional. Take a moment to observe the background thoroughly. His humor is hilarious and it's not something you've heard before. Like Max, an unusual shaped paddle with a sound and light system in his head that has a colorful beam and a happy song every time he talks about a miserable life. This is an excellent animation to watch anywhere, anytime.
