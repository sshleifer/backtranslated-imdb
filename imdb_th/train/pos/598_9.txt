This is a fun fact. I am a kid in a movie that is in the crib :) Now I'm 19 years old. My parents took me to try. In that part, we lived in Texas at that time. I only made $ 80. My parents said that I would cry when I should be happy and be happy when I should cry. I fainted all the strange and funny truth. I think .. and no, I'm not a child actor. I live in San Antonio, work at Greenville. I graduated here in Texas. But I live in Maryland most of my life This movie is a great movie. But has a good concept I have seen it many times in my short 19 years.
