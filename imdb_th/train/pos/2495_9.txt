A strange, witty and wonderful family image! Writer Andrew Marshall wrote occasional funny and scary things! Yes, don't be fooled by 2point4 songs for children and cheerful characters. The show has a dark side and sometimes is quite cold. And that's a very good thing about acting, not just a simple sitcom that every character is a 2D cartoon device (the case of my family), but the characters are completely rounded to show human emotions. Occasional dark times, such as Bill, were haunted by a curse and Ben woke up in a strange village as two examples of performances that transformed into surreal images. Of course, the show is also incredibly funny and guaranteed to make you smile. It is a real shame that Eureka Video has stopped releasing gold for this comedy on DVD. Veoh.com is your last hope of avoiding the various stores.
