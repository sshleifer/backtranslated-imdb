This film is a delightful and comfortable image on both sides of the scene. "Crazy Boy" that combines with New York art, music and performance art (with a pendant by Miss Bunny). "That Girl" For our unaffected millennium, <br /> <br /> The conversation is fast and funny and Parker Posey's expenses deserve - if not at least educational institutions - field Sports "The Wave" of glorious <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie is placed on Miss Posey's very stylish heels and she is the perfect actor As with many of her performances, it may not be very deep, often referring to herself and being good. She is a talented comedian, an amazing actor, and this movie, she wears it on her shoulders like a leopard wrap, etiquette, and doesn't let it fall on the floor. <br /> <br /> Mary is fashionable. Superficial party That is not above stealing the designer's clothes from a friend's wardrobe or doing with someone else's boyfriend At a deeper level, this is the story of a girl and her friends who don't care about every word, including others. And the learning process that is necessary for life The more appropriate performance from her will deepen the relationship between the two ... but ... Hey ... This is a joke. The surprisingly profound role that made this film a vision and a global vision is the boyfriend who sold Flafell. We should all be so lucky ... Is he one with Mary? Or who fled? <br /> <br /> I rate this thing as 8 because it's not a good time in movie history. It's not classic and it's not great art. (All of this is deeper and more perfect to watch again) as well as "desperate to find Susan". It represents something that is really about its time But may not be related to time Even so, it has everything that the movie needs for entertainment and is worth watching many times for clothes alone!
