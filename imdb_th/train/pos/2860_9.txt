It ran from 1959-1973, rather than the longevity that has been mentioned for this series. It also helped to escape from the change of fashion and taste from the psychedelic 50s of the 50s and still remain popular in the 70s. <br /> <br /> I remembered it over and over It is a successful combination of all elements from stories, actors and productions that make it stand out. Lorne Green has a character that determines his character from this series. It's interesting across generations. Every member of the family can enjoy this. It has a moral balance with violence, humor with seriousness. The cartoon series was created from what happened from its effects. The shame is that this series is no longer repeated and many people will not know the importance of it.
