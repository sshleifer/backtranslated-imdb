I saw this movie in 1959 when I was 11 years old at the theater, driving with my family. <br /> <br /> At that time I thought it was very funny. Of what makes this amazing movie so happy! I saw it again this morning, "Turner South". While I watched it, I felt fully shaken! "The Mating Game" is a classic game that is unique in the era. If you are too young to experience a charming moment in the history of making this movie, I feel very sorry for you. There is no way you can watch movies like this and understand how they can do it. (Even today) will deliver a delightful piece of heaven to "The old timer" like me. <br /> <br /> I must say that I respect that younger people refrain from commenting on movies such as "The Mating Game". This is created for the previous generation of your current group of people. And as such, these movies speak a different language than you understand. <br /> <br /> In other words ?? If you do not understand the problem that this film is doing, please do not make yourself embarrassed by what you comment ?? Frankly ?? Not reasonable
