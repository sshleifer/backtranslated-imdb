One of the few best movies of all time The transition from black and white to the color for Heaven and Earth Sequences is a great director. <br /> <br /> The plot is very smart. A complete movie makes you full of human emotions. Is a war movie Not discriminate I have to watch this movie more than any other time and I never get bored. It is a movie that makes you question the death and your own beliefs about what will happen after our death.
