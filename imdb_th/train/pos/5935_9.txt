After seeing the terrifying, horrifying Batman, I knew I had to see this thing as soon as I heard about it. <br /> <br /> Press the play button to preview. I think I'm scary. From what far seems like a bad Wannabe film producer tries to bring new depth to the existing character. But instead of being greeted with a wonderful example for a sad movie that doesn't exist because I like to watch the movie even though it only takes 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> FINEST'S WORLD'S FINEST'S FOR BATMAN: DEAD END AND Then some <br /> <br /> I hope to get the next chapter!
