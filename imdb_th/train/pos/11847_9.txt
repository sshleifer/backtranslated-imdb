Of course, the horse is a good animal. The depiction of their beautiful wild horses and their elegance is never so great in the animation. <br /> <br /> The animation is amazing. The beautiful animation is the backbone of the beauty that the horse uses to flick. More so, when the forest has a variety of landscapes, jump over cliffs and brave waters. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also impressive. Great instrumental music helps you admire movies. <br /> <br /> "They say that the story of the West is written from the saddle." Um? The story of a good horse, of course, was written from the western saddles. <br /> <br /> All in this film is the most clear and the best. It's one of the best animated movies I have. Looks to be a very good choice for a lonely night. 9/10
