Firstly, I have heard great things about this film, not least in the retro / vintage scenes and stockings lovers who love Bettie Page for sure and it doesn't disappoint. Take a clean, black-and-white photo with the added colors for the important scene. This film gives the feeling of Bettie Page's childhood and career. <br /> <br /> There are many things I don't know about the face. First, there was a gang rape later, with her first attempt to develop a acting career, and then the first glamor pictures with a camera club full of men who didn't get enough of her. Irving, despite having slaves and amulets, finds people who are pleasant and friendly. If the manufacturer of modern pornography is only so, the better pornography may be the result! Most of this film is not a criticism, gratitude to the evil of pornography. But is an attempt to show the environment that existed in the 1950s for manufacturers of fetish and nude pictures of women. This environment is very oppressive, perhaps a good way because it means that there is no effect. 'Saturation' that we have today when talking about pornography It seems to be much less severe. The face found someone who enjoyed her work and didn't seem to deteriorate by it. In many of her photos, she was bound and gagged. (And trying to talk) swinging a whip with exuberance, so the photographer is excited about her photography With the hardcore things that we have now, <br /> <br /> The face never became an actor and instead left her feeling guilty when she was in her thirties for 'Jesus Christ'. In God and Jesus never disappeared, even when bound and gagged, she also insisted that she received the 'gift' from God to do 'this thing'. When watching this movie, I had more knowledge about the page and also Another fear, faith, morals, and her behavior. She is one of the types compared to the identi-kit that we have today and someone who can say that
