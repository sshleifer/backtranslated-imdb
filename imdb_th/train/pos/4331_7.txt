Murder in Mesopotamia I always thought that Poirot's book was always better because it looked creepy and had a wise ending. There is no doubt that television adaptation is visually striking with captivating photographs and music scores that haunt David Suchet are always flawless like Hercule Poirot. The battle of Poirot and the mosquitoes in the middle of the night and Hugh Fraser is as good as the naive Captain Hastings. The rest of the actors in a good show But be careful not to obscure both sides, which is dangerous in Christie's modification. Some episodes are creepy, which is a horrible story like Five Little Pigs when I am more fun now. What makes it creepy, especially music, is when Louise Leidner sees a terrifying face through the window. About adaptation, it is quite honest with the book But I would say that there are three things I don't like. The main problem is spacing. It is quite slow and there are very few scenes that occur. I do not like the fact that they made Joseph Mercado a murderer. In this book, I saw him as a rather self-conscious character. But the intervention of the idea of ​​making him a murderer and under development made him a less attractive character. But I'm glad that they didn't miss his addiction Assassin) The other thing that is not very impressive is that I feel that it may be more than this. Effective if adaptation is in Amy Leatheran's view, as in the book Amy seems to be less sensitive to adaptation. Overall, despite the misrepresentation of the writer's name, I like Murder in Mesopotamia 7/10. Bethany Cox
