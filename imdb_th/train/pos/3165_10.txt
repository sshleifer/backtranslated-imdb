This is one of the most fun and greatest sitcoms to watch national television. It's unfortunate that the show is not in a great sitcom that is real. The actors do a great job and the first to six seasons are performing at the top spot. Although the seventh season is not very good compared to the last six years. But it was still funny. Season 8 was a real problem that was kicked without Topher grace or Ashton Kutcher. The performance was broken down. Not too many other actors are not great if there are 2 main characters left, such as Danny Masterson, Wilder Valderamma Kurtwood Smith, Debra Jo Rupp, Mila Kunis and Laura Prepon (Don Stark and Tommy Pak Too good) shows that it has the same effect And the merger of Randy (Josh Meyers) did not help as well because he was not well received by the fans. I believe that if the performance ended last year, it will definitely go down in history. As one of the sitcoms, the 8th season is a little boring. But the ending was great. I will miss the show. I just wish I would wake up one day to see that the program returned to the 80th show with the same actor because I would miss the hell.
