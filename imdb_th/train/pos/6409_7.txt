I never heard about Brashear before watching this. This is the story of him and the person who trained him to help him become the first African-American American diver. The story of strength The story is well written and well developed. This is what looks like a typical underdog and not too surprising. It's quite Hollywood too. But hey, I don't really know men. Maybe it's really close to what happened. However, it makes the work complete with dramatic scenes and misery along the way, and this is an inspiration for everyone who has heard the word "No, you can't" talk about lifelong dreams. The performance was great. DeNiro and Gooding Jr. both sparked whenever they were on the screen. Rapaport was great as well. The characters are well written, reliable and consistent. This is a good fix and has a good movie. The production value is high and this is a rather convincing job to transport us back to the 50s. This is the only film I have seen by directors and writers. Increase Have a moderate level of language, otherwise there will be no offensive content I recommend this to everyone who finds it interesting and / or fans of those who created it. 7/10
