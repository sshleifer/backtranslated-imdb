In the sequel to the great adventure of Bill and Ted, Bill and Ted is threatened by the future because Chuck De Nomolos sends two evil robots disguised as Bill and Ted to the world to kill Bill. Will change the future. <br /> <br /> In a great funny match, Winter and Reeves are great to deliver delicious humor to the audience in this sequel to entertainment. Although the lack of clarity at first, the deceptive journey still has excellent poems and dialogue from leading partners, not to mention the hilarious performances by William Sadler, who brings humor to the deeps See one of the best moments in this movie. But one of the great techniques used in the classification of movies. <br /> <br /> Despite being full of humor But this movie has more interesting movies With more serious bets and more risky situations, <br /> This makes the movie a great dimension and another lovely feature. The creator also expanded the scope of the fantasy genre and using realism with hell and heaven as a symbol and presented heavily in the plot. The fantasy genre is another point that takes a miraculous time travel machine, even though it is confusing with the use of time and objects and situations that have been placed before it happens today, as can be seen from the last couple of scenes. <br /> See the first time I hate this sequel. But the second time is the real happiness when I admire the gags and stories and even though the jokes and the plot are not as strong as their ancestors. Deceptive travel has a feeling of good motivation, comedy and a plot that is stable enough to make a good family movie.
