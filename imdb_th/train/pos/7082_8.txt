First of all, we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor. But if you spend a lot of time in his movies, you will see that the characters have these moments that they too. His character in this film is far more than everyone will ... The story begins in the future (not far away), where a man was sent in the past to find the source of the virus that swept humans. Big off the earth It seems that the story is approaching SF. But I think it's closer to the drama because of the slow pace of the story About that. Movies tend to be faster and slower at some point and develop until the end is more than the beginning. But when you see this movie, you have to be aware of the rhythm of the story that is constant and reveal facts that do not speed up. It is the same speed that flows gently and is quite good. But that doesn't mean that the ending won't make you stressed. As far as direction, it is the sheriff. Such movies are easily destroyed by poor governance. But this movie is much better So if you are ready to watch sci-fi movies or action, you will miss B. There should be more movies.
