This is an honest effort to create a passionate love story. The clear inspiration behind the successful TV series "Bewitched", this lovely sweet romance is an immortal treasure. The comparison is clear. Jimmy Stewart plays unlucky, but not indefatigable "straight". Kim Novak plays a seductive blonde witch who captures him through the use of love spells. But when the spell was destroyed by a strong witch, she was satisfied with the duty of managing her shop and felt comfortable with the fact that pyewacket, dear, you would know my aunt from "Murder by Death". Fun and impressive. Experience the amazing flair and feel good. Worth watching.
