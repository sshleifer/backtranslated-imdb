This is the only long documentary film about the world of bridges. I found that the first 10 minutes were a bit slow. But after that, this movie is perfect to explain the professional bridge players and how they go. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes are very funny. This movie <br /> <br /> Some sets are really beautiful. Unfortunately, this movie is black and white - I can only imagine what color they look like. The way in which the media shows the image is extremely funny. There is no way on the world bridge that will be like that. <br /> <br /> Watch it as soon as possible and tell friends about it.
