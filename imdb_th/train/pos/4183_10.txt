I've been watching this movie for a long time. But found it amazing and to this day, it never stops to surprise me. <br /> <br /> A great movie that describes the story of an Australian commando trying to sink Japanese ships in the Singapore port during the height of the WW2 <br /> <br /> These commandos are caught in a normal outfit and are considered spy by Japanese arrestors. But there is something that has not been explored much in the WW2 Hollywood movie that I have seen. <br /> <br /> The close and friendly relationship developed between the arrester and the arrested person. They began to respect each other while the captain of the captured Australian soldier became the best friend with the Japanese prison guard. This is the most wonderful part of this film and it pulls your heart out. <br /> <br /> Soon one day while the two friends are talking, the Aussie captain knows that another prisoner is trying. And Proceeding for the sinking of the Jap vessel in the Singapore port. <br /> <br /> He said that it was his team and not some of the people who sank the ship to find his Japanese friends. He must remain silent because it may lead to his entire group of executions. But the captain still insisted on confessing to the Japanese authorities. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the Japanese authorities sentenced them to death in the most polite way according to their rules. This is the highest honor given to the warriors that were taken in Japan. <br /> <br /> This is the most wonderful part of this film that the Aussie soldiers are waiting for the near death and uncertainty. Of friendly Japanese staff Still not ready to believe why his Aussie friend had confessed. <br /> <br /> I won't give up the ending here. But it is more painful than imagining and can easily cause tears to flow. <br /> <br /> All of these are movies that have an excellent low rating that may not be recognized as worthy.
