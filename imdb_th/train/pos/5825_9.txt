Most Stoogephiles consider this to be the shortest Stooges bar and they are right. Alonso was screaming in a drag set while "Senorita Cucaracha" and Moe and Larry were in the top form as "Senor Mucho" and "Senor Gusto", respectively. Full - Actually, she is a trained opera singer - and it's great. Gino Corrado, the great hilarious hilarious Italian singer who is threatened by the Stooges in a social party. True jokes, good direction and strong editing make the stooges top out a lot. The more amazing thing is that Alon has a serious health problem at that time and in the shorts he did during this time, you can see that he is clearly ill. His time went out, he spoke very slowly and stopped and had trouble traveling. Fortunately, his health was on the rise when he made this movie and it was shown. Stooge's classic comedy and enjoying the non-Stooge fans (I have a girlfriend who can't stand the Stooges but she laughs here). Must watch.
