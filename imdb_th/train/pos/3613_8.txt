When "Girlfight" came out, the review was appreciated. But I didn't see I finally saw it when it was released in the video and understood the glowing opinions. <br /> <br /> This film opened in a middle school slum. We received a quick introduction to students. Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez) She had a bad expression on her face and any ideas about Diana that we might have received from the show soon will be confirmed. When she gets in the fight When Diana encountered this problem, we found her father, who was aggressive in his style. Obviously, we can't blame Diana completely for her attitude. <br /> <br /> But then the movie really picked up because the new idea grew up in Diana's heart: punch is the way to dodge. Escape the terrible existence Her brother started boxing. But most of her father did not approve Only Diana can decide what to do. <br /> <br /> Only the first few minutes that I am in a non-Hollywood movie confirm that even before they Going to the boxing scene, you feel like you are bashing your face to see the ugly life that Diana lives. And finally, when they arrived, the main subject of this film was not going back. <br /> <br /> All I definitely recommend this movie. I will admit that using boxing is a way of showing people who are trying to make something of their own in theaters for many years ("Rocky", "Million Dollar Baby"). But I still think They do It's a great job here. In fact, this may really lead to the top spot. Unfortunately, Michelle Rodriguez lost himself in the Hollywood movie after this story.
