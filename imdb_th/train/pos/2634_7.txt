Lion King 1 1/2 is a fun and interesting sequel. Do not expect the production value of theatrical performances. But expecting to have the highest quality directly with the video release. <br /> <br /> It was set as Timon and Pumba. Start watching the original Lion King in a dark movie theater. And switch tracks immediately and start telling their own stories This is often done with the disruption of comedy. For example, during a particularly stressful time, shopping in the house appears and crazy, realizing that he is sitting on the remote. These little moments make the movie look superficially and whether you find Whether they are fun or not will depend on your humor If you care, especially the movie that warns the audience deliberately watching more movies, may not be your cup of tea. <br /> <br /> Animation is the best thing they invest in Disney. DTV and is almost merged with traditional materials The latest independent materials use many original art styles. That sound ability is good even though I can't think of the Marge Simpson. Every time I hear Julie Kavner <br /> <br /> many jokes in this movie will be well accepted by the audience. Being more presented with the familiarity of the strange habits of old friends rather than the annoying ones. <br /> <br /> The song makes me realize that I'm happy and think of music that combines Disney's features The 'Dig A Tunnel' toe-opening feature is well designed and hilarious. Timon and Pumba use the opening sequence of the Lion King and introducing them to heaven is also fun. The only problem is the response of the 'Dig A Tunnel' at the end of the film, switching lyrics and songs from the high-level losers. <br /> <br /> A good story and a new mix. The plot elements are almost perfect, although the last bit during the chase of the dog will slightly increase the credibility of the story. The new story doesn't seem to be able to deal with a good time to burn or make a good mood and do better when it comes to comedy. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's worth buying. If you like all the bonus features that come with 2 disc sets in general, go now. For pennies who are still willing to invest in a good flick, wait until they drop four dollars or more and go to rent immediately. <br /> <br /> Damion Crowley
