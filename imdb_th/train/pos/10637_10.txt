Harem Suare is the best movie I saw in 2000. Bravo Ferzan Ozpetek Harem Suare filmed and presented an amazingly fascinating picture, a bold movie with a romance in racial play which was banned in Hollywood Women of all shapes, sizes and colors fill the film. Cut from the outside world, women entertain each other by telling stories about planning, competition and envy within their groups.
