It ran for 8 seasons, but it was the first time in early 1959 and last in the fall of 1965, shorter than the 2-7 season. Chief CBS William Paley canceled Rawhide's production after watching the first show. Of the 8th season in September 1965, because he did not like the series by Eric Fleming as Gil Favor, which from the 7th season, the last episode aired in November 1965, Lonely 1966, CBS aired January 4, 1966<br /> <br /> I'm always wondering why Rawhide didn't change the color because it was last season? The biggest west of the 1960s has been painted in 1965. CBS aired in the fall over the years for their sitcoms. But Westerners like Gunsmoke and Rawhide are still black and white. Gunsmoke is the last westerner. (And the network series, the last moment to change color) on September 17, 1966 for the Snap Snap Decision episode
