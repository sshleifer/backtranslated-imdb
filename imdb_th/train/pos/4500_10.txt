On the way he fell in love with Anna, a 20 year old woman and the wife of Richard Crane, his new head. Despite warnings from his new colleagues, Owen still gets Anna to herself as far as sabotaging Anna and Richard's cheating marriage. This drama is a romantic drama with a lot of humor and quick flair. Best Actor: Green of "The Student Prince" and "Touching Evil" that hit the screen as Owen, witty and warm Good with Green; Kitchen from "To Play The King" is a legitimate threat as Richard, which this cartoon has countless times and underestimated his expertise.
