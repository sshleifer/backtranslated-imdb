what's your name? If the name is Jerry, Bruckheimer expects it to be filled with action. <br /> <br /> In the latest film of the producer of Bruckheimer Gone in 60 Seconds, it's about naming systems. With the characters, nicknames like Kip, Sway and The Sphinx and cars that are suitable for names like Diane, Sue and Eleanor that are difficult to understand. br /> Not a profound chapter But it was a great vehicle for action as Nicolas Cage as Memphis Raines, along with Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall, from the retirement of a stolen car to save his brother's life by stealing 50 cars Exotic in one night The film was rebuilt in 1974. This film may not be defined in the same cult status. But it is fun. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, it's an action movie that won't let you watch the show. Although full of stars But none of the great performers, including the very weak performances, by one of my actors and lovers, Giovanni Ribisi, even Jolie, who won her Oscar recently Just an interesting love that lasts a long time. <br /> <br /> A set of beautiful cars and chase cars that they are involved in creating great movies. I think so This film is a pleasure to watch and even if one of the scenes takes you into the realm of unbelief But that action didn't stop Just be careful of other riders who struggle to get the pole position while you leave the cinema. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 out of 5
