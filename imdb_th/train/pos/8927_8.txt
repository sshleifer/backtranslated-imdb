Claire Denise revisits the father's theme that is estranged again. Men who follow their own happiness do not care about family emotions. But while Nietzsche and Boni from the previous film live in the narrow world of Marseille in The Intruder, take us from far away along the French-Swiss border, halfway around the world to Korea and Tahiti This film began again in the middle of the year with Louis in his sixties, dealing with a heart that was sick while trying to maintain a high level of body. We learn that Louise is not a stranger for violence because his cabin is a place for frequent smuggling of artillery and occurs. Louis slept with a large knife under the pillow with a rifle nearby. Denise didn't have to take any action and we had to build our understanding of Louis from his daily activities and a few people. The people he contacted along the border, including Sidney's son (Grégoire Colin, almost did not remember with long hair and A handful of mustaches) that denies him as a "madman": acting as a dedicated father of two, with many short scenes, which, while seemingly unrelated, impress Louis and his surroundings. The work of Ms Godard camera is exciting here. The parable of control is the transplant of Louis's heart that he went to Korea and then to Tahiti to find another son, not found, and Louis's new heart rejects him, just as Sydney denied the old man. We are familiar with the short scenes in Denise's film, which are inexplicable: Nénette astride Boni feeding with a spoon. Drive by shooting Boni's father, and then a short portrait of Boni with gunshot wounds to the head; The image of Louis in the corpse with the remains of the transplant scars But the body of Sydney The meaning of the last two things is denial, whether true or imaginary, with the father killing things that cannot be identified in the son.
