I went to watch a movie with two of my friends and chose this movie from the hat without knowing what to expect. And it became a fun and laughing experience! It's a great movie that has unexpected stories, good conversations and crazy humor. Obviously, all the characters were made in the style of "Alan Ford" (Italian satirical cartoon) but that didn't bother me. In fact, this type of loser makes the movie a novel and interesting story. Sam Rockwell played a very good and reliable role. Willian Macy as well. Clooney was almost unrecognizable and excellent. But the real star is Guzman. He plays a role in his life in this movie! The scene in which his character Cosimo dies in the movie is a very funny story that makes me suffocate and almost die with him! Recommended for fans "Alan Ford" Everyone!
