A favorite audience at many film festivals and not difficult to see why. Director Yang Zhang, with the help of the great work of three main actors, Xu Zhu as a teacher, Liu; Chuan Xin Pu as the oldest son of Ming; And especially Wu Jiang, as an irresistible and cute little son like Er Ming, spins a story that will make the heart warmest. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a man taking a shower. In the auto booth in Beijing, he put money in the door openings, took off the clothes and put some parts on the conveyor to clean, walked into the shower and cleaned with a brush and water and soap. With the news that he was a car wash is the future speaking symbolic and historic bathhouse as we shall see in the next scene is history. China, agriculture is finding a way to the Chinese industry. <br /> <br /> Pollution? Cultural Revolution hanging over? Blues industry? There is no way. What we have here is the celebration of the people and the kindness and love each other is a celebration of goodness in the human heart. But I wonder how the Chinese government looks at this movie. On the other hand, it clearly presents a pleasant view of China and people. Is a serious matter without criticizing the current regime But there is little feeling that the good old ways are going to be replaced by something that may not be good I think Yang Zhang has the wisdom to let it go as he should. Tell a story about the old man at the bathhouse where they were massaged and fondled as they told the storytelling high and remember the good old days that they could relax and play Chinese chess and cricket battles. on stage The wise old man and his assistant are his sons, who may be retarded or become autistic. But he works with pleasure and has a spirit of fun and goodwill. <br /> <br /> Back in the scene, the eldest son. Daiming, who is well-groomed and quiet He was uneasy about what he saw as a complicated behavior of his father and brother. He is a representative of modern China with tie and briefcase, mobile phone and his education. He returned just because he thought that his father was dying. When he saw that this was not true, he kept the bag and set it back to his wife and career. But when the crisis arose and during this crisis, Daming saw the value of life with people as the center of his father and brother's life. <br /> <br /> So Yang Zhang therefore reconciles the old people. And new and doing so in a charming manner that I will not object, especially since his style is tidy and shown carefully One of the great things he did that I missed in most movies was how he made subplots in a larger story so that they were corrected before the picture ended. A bathhouse that sings "O mio solely" in the bathhouse. When the water runs down, he makes Er Ming's happiness find that he can't sing in public because of the fear on the stage. Near the end of the movie, he loses horror on stage and sings with the help that was inspired by Er Ming and the regular bathhouse that lost his wife because ... he tells the story to Liu. Listen before he confesses the real reason. But Liu understands and again before the film ends. The husband and wife are reconciled. <br /> <br /> Making a movie "Ending happily" This is unusual in movies, art and international films that some happy ending adults have planned to shame not just the creators, but also the audience. And some people are clearly sympathetic that the audience is offended However, the audience is happy here. <br /> <br /> Watch this, especially for Wu Jiang's comedy that is warm to overcome any obstacles that his character may have.
