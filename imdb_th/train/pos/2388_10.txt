I love Doodlebops. My son watched them for over a year. We went to see the Doodlebops concert last year and one concert yesterday. (Connecticut) He loves them. Doodlebops don't teach letters or numbers, but who is interested? Are you serious TV should not teach your children about numbers or letters. Parents should receive more. Doodlebops can actually sing. Deedee has a beautiful voice and in a concert you can tell that the three people have a good singing voice. Imagine them dancing, jumping around and still singing. They are gifted. Children love them. I also enjoy watching programs. This show is the best TV program for kids and rock bands for kids. How amazing is it? Why do people say Chad (Rooney) is gay? Where do you hear No matter whether he is or not, he's great! Leave him alone It's not like him or someone else who is promoting homosexuality for our children!
