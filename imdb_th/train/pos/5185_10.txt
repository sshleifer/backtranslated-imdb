I watched this movie better than 100-200 times and I like it every time I watch it. Yes, it may seem repetitive. But it's funny and very fun The camp shown in the movie is the actual camp I attended for 7 years and shows that this camp is a great place to spend the summer. Everyone who has been to the camp wants to go to the camp or send the children to the camp should watch this movie because it will bring wonderful memories back to you and your children.
