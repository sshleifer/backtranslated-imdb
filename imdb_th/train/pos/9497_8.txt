Absolutely great trash .... This one has everything: nudity, great fighting scenes, explosive action, etc. It also shows Belinda Mayne as excellent as Ingrid - not Olga as he is. Other critics point out Later in the movie (You have to watch it to see what I mean) <br /> <br /> I won't bother going into this story because it's too long and not very interesting. The relationship between Ingrid and her brother Bo (Robert Jinty) is an interesting story - see the scene of stealing towels to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes are quite good at once. The effect that looks like they were made by the team that made the City of the Walking Dead (such as blood, strange colors flowing out of the neck wound). <br /> <br /> I would suggest fans of Low budget trash to check If they can track the copy - it's quite rare and I have never seen anyone bothering to release it again, so it will become a rarer all in the last few years. <br /> <br /> Next me ' d recommend to use only for the wonderful nude scenes of Belinda Mayne! That girl is a fox!
