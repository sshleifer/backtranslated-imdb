Even though i'm still young But The Beatles is definitely a band that I like! I never had the opportunity to listen to their music while it was published. But loved them since I remember <br /> <br /> It's a movie that is worth trying once I can see why it was not shown in theaters. But it is a great movie that will be put on TV I flicked and watched my TV guide and happened to see the film. There were not many details except 'John Lennon and Paul McCartney who met after The Beatles. Jared Harris Stars' I never heard about him. (He played John) or Aiden Quinn, Paul player. However, they certainly insulted the actors. <br /> <br /> This movie has a slow start. But when it developed, I could see how well Quinn was. As a big fan, I know what Lennon and McCartney really are. The script is great and Harris received the accent and personality of Lennon's pronunciation! Quinn plays McCartney quite well. But sometimes emphasizes his Irish accent Make-up artists make them look good. <br /> <br /> This PARAGRAPH may be counted as a * spoiler *: <br /> <br /> as I said earlier. Developing soon and becoming an emotional movie I found a bit in the park to waste all time and no habits for both musicians. For Lennon's rude line in Italian restaurants, it is not necessary. The ending was very painful and made my tears whenever I watched it. <br /> <br /> It's quite different from other biographical films I've seen. And those characters never did well, like. 'Backbeat' <br /> <br /> In summary, I would say that if you are a fan of the Beatles or John Lennon or Paul McCartney, you might be surprised. At just 95 minutes, it is worthwhile to wait for the movie to develop. <br /> <br /> If anyone knows that the 1976 meeting was true, please send it to 'Comment page' for this movie I Must be very interested
