I watched this at Christmas. I don't know why. But it reminds me of Christmas, so I watch it. So we have <br /> <br /> Arthur is a movie that I watch all the time with a big stupid smile on my face and it is a combination of Show special, great jolly music and a witty and glamorous movie script that causes it. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore creates an ugly character very easily. (Spoiled, angry, rich, lazy, drunk, feeling sorry for himself) but turning him into the one you love Inside, almost surrendering to his world, John Gielgud received all the juicy lines and polished it out with pleasure. <br /> <br /> I can see Arthur over and over again and it makes me feel good. Take a look if you need a lift, it's a lovely film.
