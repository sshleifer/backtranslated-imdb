The film has a scene that came back to me in the most bizarre moment - a violent scene with Mukherjee. Tell Meladez that there are people he speaks with. The young woman's witness was pushed out the window at Turn around - the way she talks about him by the name --- in the Greek accent "Mr Muckerji" - and when Boyer discovers that she has just poisoned and slapped her head before she died. --- It's delightful! "A fool - a fool - all my life" ... etc. etc. - You get the point .. I have to buy this one. I love Dan Seymour's acting - he often plays the sultan or the foreign police chief who is plump and appears in Casablanca and many great pictures.
