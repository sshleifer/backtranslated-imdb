I know that many people don't like this movie. But i think it's cute I can't say much. But this movie is a movie that feels good. I guess The music is beautiful, the costumes are beautiful, the sound is beautiful, and there are many funny genres in the movie, especially when Briggitta learns about what to do and not socialize. If you like theater, I will say that you like this song!
