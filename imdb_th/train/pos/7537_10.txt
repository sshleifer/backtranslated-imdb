Contrary to what those who hate Christianity, Club 700 gives the true answer as well as inspiration. It also gives credible news, logical opinions and perspectives that are different from what ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS think are the best. Unlike other programs that give opinions about society and the beliefs behind the 700 Club, helping people who need such as feeding the hungry with Operation Blessing, providing medical assistance to those who live in Poor communities and give hope For those who need hope It's not ugly at all. If the 700 Club gets you offensive, I suggest you use the remote control and change the channel on your TV. I do the same thing when I find CNN headlines or that item I find bias or inappropriate. What I found to be offensive is the way the ABC family inserted the disclaimer that the 700 Club view does not reflect the opinions of the ABC family.
