Patchwork about 911, 11 stories from 11 directors from 11 countries. Sometimes it is funny, sometimes boring. (The first example) Sometimes speaking to Americans that "We have died more than you and you support the murderer." Sometimes it's really weird. (But very symbolic and interesting) I love Claude Lelouch (the personal life of a lover in New York, showing that "our daily" issues are not important), Shoei Imamura (the most wacky, general war) and Idrissa Ouedraogo (funny Generally optimistic about Africans, despite the daily misery) and Youssef Chahine (Egyptian intellectuals, peaceful and professional, have moral problems to accept US policy towards Arabic) I am very happy to see that It shows us (or are they? I'm still a Belgian But living in Texas for 12 years) still interested in other cultures and able to question the past and present actions of our government as well as our democracy
