This movie is very funny. I want to own this thing for my vintage collection in the 1970s. The movie must see the list again. I know that this character, they are the people I met in many periods last year Unfortunately, this thing has never been put on a DVD or VHS. Foxx is always a funny joke. Pearl Bailey is a great pair as a witty and humble wife. A man whose secret is not sure if he will have a future if it is possible or not. Ms. Dobson was slow with a little heart and conscience, love, sexual desire, the strange family relationship of this movie, qualified to come back again, funny situations with a mix of events that should be And should find a way to remake. I think the casting of Seinfeld plays Dennis Dugan, two Seinfeld's earmarks that lead me back to Norman. He is the closest that is impossible, of course, that it is impossible to pretend to be a prostitute and unfaithful friend. This movie is a good guide for taxi drivers, reminds me of the time when Kramer listened to the advice of his caddy over his lawyer (from Seinfeld). The scissor dropped the fun with fun. It was screaming. Bring me back.
