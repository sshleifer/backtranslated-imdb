Reminiscent of the great west of the 1940s, such as "The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre" (1948) "Red Rock West" is a story about conscience, greed and betrayal. Michael (Nicholas Cage ) Is a faithful young man from the state of Texas who finds work and money. He finds both, but not the way he expects. <br /> <br /> The script consists of a surprise. Great movie filming, intelligent movie editing and Western mood swings that add tension and suspense. The expansion of the country on a large sky is a great place. And the performances range from good to excellent, with great performances from Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh. Dwight Yoakam's specially recorded country / western music makes the film the final scene. Strong <br /> <br /> Properly labeled as neoir "Red Rock West" makes me feel like something else too. The plot is full of amazing coincidences and periods that are not so likely that others may think that the screenplay is flawed. Normally I will agree. However, in this case, when combined with the atmosphere that is full of emotions and the fact that the small town of Red Rock seems to be empty in everyday life, in general, coincidences and improbable times to introduce matters beyond "noirish" ... Surreal is almost a fate that deliberately interferes with an improbable event to force Michael to catch himself. From this point of view, coincidence is not a script flaw. They are the plot points needed in the horrifying story of a young man who must confront his own demon ... disguised as another character. <br /> <br /> All we want in that place. This is Rod Serling in the poem explaining. His clear voice is always clear: ... A young man is searching for himself, stopping in a small town that has been abandoned almost a thousand miles from another place. It was his last stop on a journey to ... The Twilight Zone
