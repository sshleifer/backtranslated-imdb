Daniel Day Lewis from My Left Foot gives us one of the best performances ever made by an actor. He is smart like Christy Brown, a man with a cerebral palsy who learns to write and draw with his left foot. Oscar that deserves good for him, and Brenda Friger, who plays as his beloved mother, Hugh O'Conner, is great because Christy Brown and Ray McAnally are great like father Good value for watching outstanding performances.
