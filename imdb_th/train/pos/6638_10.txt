The thing that attracts the attention of this ancient movie is that you will see the true animations of life. Over 100 years ago, there were many people leaving the factory. They were all dead and no one knew the importance. Of the invention they had walked before from a distance I was shocked to read. One critic called this film boring as a home video today and at least another person stated that it was the first film that made a mistake. (It was the first film made at a rate of 16 frames per second, more than 46 frames per second) <br /> <br /> Of course, what you see is that a lot of people get out of the building and pass before the movie Travel home from work But this is something that is curious for dozens of reasons, not at least Which is the first film created by the Lumi√®re brothers, which may have a greater impact on the development of cinemas than any other person or group in history
