When I was young, my parents had this movie for me. I like it a lot and I watch it over and over again. Even when I was in the 3rd grade, I still watched occasionally. Recently, I watched again for nostalgia and although this program was not intended for my age group. (I'm in the late teens) I still find it fun and educational. This show teaches good lessons about imagination and good compatibility with others. Partly I find it quite fun. In addition, this show has no bad content, so you can let the children be alone on this list and don't worry about them choosing a bad language or whatever. I will recommend this
