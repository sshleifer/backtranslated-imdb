It's about con artists Peter Ustinoff, who infiltrated a British company, Texza-Con, or something like that, posing as a computer expert and security expert. He secretly learned to hack into the computer while garnering admiration from his leader, Karl Malden, a rival opponent in the office. Bob Newhart and Maggie Smith's love for his beloved secretary <br /> <br /> Some of the details of the business are quite dark from the eyes that do not focus on business. But they were convinced enough and I had a general idea. Ustinov, the founder of Peter, founded a fake business in Paris, Rome and Stuttgart and used Texa-Conn computers to send all kinds of money to this establishment. Of course, foreign companies are nothing more than themselves. Ustinov and that address are the attic rooms of abandoned artists in Paris, a barber shop in Rome and a bakery in the area. Western Germany He visited them to collect the checks he sent himself. <br /> <br /> I don't think I would like it for the first few minutes because it looks rather slow. I expect something with a faster rhythm and more anger along the lines of "The Pink Panther" or "The Lavender Hill Gang", but this film penetrates into your goodness while you appreciate the humor. Amused in the plot, style and dialogue. <br /> <br /> It may be a good idea to give too much rewards. A relatively fragile porch But this is an example of something more noticeable. <br /> <br /> Ustinov reached the Secretary-General Smith: "Let me have the property of these companies." Smith: "Assets? What are they? "Ustinov:" Little female donkey "Now nothing happens from the exchange. There is a fast cut and no lag for any laughter, which is appropriate because one person's reaction would be a smile rather than a laugh. <br /> <br /> Ustinov searched for a dirty attic in Paris. It is covered with spider webs. The bricks were all over and the paintings of the original owners were left behind. The landlord does not speak English and Ustinov does not know French. Ustinov pointed to a painting that looks like a child of a nude woman and chuckles "Ah, fye-tal fam, right?" The owner laughed as well. "Vous le prenez pour une anee?" Ustinov: "Oh - ANNIE. That's her name!" The lessor: "Ui?" Ustinov: "Entente cordiale!" (Mes amis, if I made a sex offense, je m ' excuse.) Bob Newhart as Willard Gnatpole (!) has hots for Maggie Smith and should drive home But told her that he was using "Scenic route" has a sequence of traffic lights immediately guided. "Warning". "Lay-By." "Give way." "Returns." End with "STOP / CHILDREN" that is needed. There is another editing when Ustinov's plan is about to be discovered by the committee - the roof blurred the police car farewell from Mac. Ends with the sign: PRISON, Wormwood Scrubs <br /> <br /> May be another I still can't beat Malden as the chief announcer. "I have never suffered a decision" and then swallowed a handful of pills and washed it out with a glass of water. <br /> <br /> The performance is good without reason. It's the best role of Bob New Hart, for example. Not that he has a lot and that his range is not limited, but he is perfect in this part. Laurie Johnson's musical score clearly has a lot of effort. She seems to have written a short concerto for flute. Ustinov's passion is that his music and foreign establishments have false names such as Claude Debussy and Giacconino Rossini, the fake president of Stuttgart. Schmidt and he are the ones that are unusual. Maggi Smith is beautiful, sexy, middle class and turns out to be not as stupid as you think. <br /> <br /> Have fun in your own quiet way, but don't expect Will be Wood fire cartoon
