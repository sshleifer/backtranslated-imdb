I was really surprised that the film didn't get a higher score in IMDB. It was one of the movies that anyone could easily find, but for couples, the joke "Moonstruck" was really in class It's a setting and an ethnic charm is something that people seem to be allowed. The selection of a single actor makes it a perfect movie. Some movies in the 1980s were as good as "Moonstruck" and it was also funny. **** From *****
