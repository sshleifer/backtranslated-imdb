Hollywood North is a parody of Canadian film history when the Canadian government offers a substantial tax reduction for movies produced in Canada. Most of them are treated as tax evaders or are an economical way to create American movies. For example, Porky comes out of it. Anyway, Matthew Modine plays a novice director who wants to adapt a novel that Canadian Like However, to get the money, he needed an American star. He had a loose cannon and learned that he had to compromise until the point that the film was no longer similar to the existing book. Play well in Canada But may not be able to understand other than the Great White North. Americans will think that we are biting ourselves But will really miss the point where we are sarcastic. For Canadians 8/10 for the rest of the world 5/10
