This is the first time of the Guinea Pig series and is one of the more embarrassing movies from the collection. <br /> <br /> It took a long time for me to be the manager. This famous movie group I bought a set of Guinea pig boxes and decided to see the collection according to the release date. So I pulled this sucker and sat down. <br /> <br /> From what I've read on the internet and being aware of the content involved in this film, I expect to test my nerves to the fullest. This story ends in the wrong. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on a group of men who kidnapped women and began to torment her with the hope of discovering the breaking point of humans and humans. <br /> <br /> Looks like a flick, sick, right? Wrong. The movie failed to scare. It may be because I have been sensitive over the years to the horror of horror. But I think it's safe to say that something really scary can sit through this thing easily. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, most people who do not know about this type of movie are Overwhelming and disgusting the image seen on the screen Although it didn't scare me But this movie has a violent scene and a fairly intense graphic Including tearing the nails, the intestines were thrown at unconscious women and through the eyes Of this film for its novelty But I suggest that for newcomers to this type of movie you should go to this movie.
