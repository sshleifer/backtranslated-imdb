I saw Jack Frost at 4: 00 at the nearest store and I thought it looked quite good for a budget movie so I bought it and I thought it was good. For beginners, this movie is about a killer snowman, so it's a laughing story and a funny way to compare with the snowman on the cover. <br /> <br /> The performance is ok and The lines that Jack Frost said made me laugh. "I'm just you, ax, smoke" and "The world's most snow cone". How funny and camping is it? The story in the beginning is quite funny and stupid. "Jack Swift, Jack speaks fast. Jack swings his eyes with a candle." If you're looking for a B-Movie horror movie that is full of playing, try Jack Frost. 10/10
