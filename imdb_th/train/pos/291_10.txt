Zombie Chronicles is not an amazing thing, it is clearly not an award-winning movie. But it's the B movie directed by Brad Sykes, who directed Camp Blood, which is another low budget. The performance is not as good as the movie that is made at the cheapest price. But that's what makes it more entertaining. Makeup for zombies is cool and effective, especially with the budget and blood. It's great and terrible from Crypt, because we received two stories about confrontation with zombies in the forest. Fun stories. And making you guess, especially the first story. Zombie Chronicles are better than cheap zombies. If you love B-low movies, budget or zombie flicks Then take a look at the Zombie Chronicles.
