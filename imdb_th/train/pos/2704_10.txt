I am disappointed if it is no surprise that this film has been admired again. Billy Zane proves that he is more than just a cute boy in Hollywood in a quiet performance that combines slap and pity Calling this movie as silent is a wrong thing because there are many songs and sounds. It is crazy and full of stupid creativity that eventually Edwood began to appreciate. See the list of actors and realize that everyone is shining. No one was there just to show their faces. I believe that all of them are in the movie to show appreciation to Wood and the wide physical performances and do not see much today. <br /> <br /> But today, critics try to guess what will happen up That will become more popular than they show appreciation for any beauty for movies and IWUETDID does not have a visible target group It is made up of love, mostly for the script of Wood. Even after his death, modern social parasites still dealt with him vigorously again and made the world less classic. This is a movie that is highly entertaining and is a truly experimental movie that should have at least a real life on DVD.
