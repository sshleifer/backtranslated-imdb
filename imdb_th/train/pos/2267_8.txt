I haven't read any novels or anything else by Kurt Vonnegut but now I intend to start. This will catch you from the first frame and will not release until the final credit starts rolling. Take you in places you don't expect Spacing is a hotspot, nothing takes too long, and this is the perfect job to adjust the balance between unexpected twists. It is well told and thought out. I never watched movies that I felt I could compare this with It's intense and exciting as well as funny and sad. The show is excellent. Nolte shines. The husband once again proves that he doesn't have to laugh and Lee and Arkin are spelling. I can really go ... There are no roles that are less effective than the protagonist's performances. Editing and movies have magic and all the pictures are excellent, with a memorable and amazing pair. I will go to see another movie directed by Keith Gordon and two other stories related to this story through the author of the book. There is a scene of sex and disturbing and insecure content in this story. I recommend this to anyone who can appreciate it. It's not satisfactory. 8/10
