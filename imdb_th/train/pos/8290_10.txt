This is just one example of Gene Wilder's complete genius. He wrote and performed in this wonderful mystery. No one can do better than this. Clear suspense I hope Mr. Wilder will impress us with these things again. I'm happy with everything I've seen Mr. Wilder before, but I don't know if he's really good until I see "Murder in a Small Town" and the following things. He has a real understanding of what the audience wants and how to present in his writing and of course, in his excellent performance. His wise intelligence came through in spades. I would like to recommend this movie to anyone who likes the mystery work and / or the movie work of Gene Wilder. His star just lit up and lit up.
