Is a funeral. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, apart from Judy, I won't let it be 8 because this material has been done over and over again: a good combination of reputation. Soldiers, theater groups, singers, bands <br /> <br /> But this movie never stops cheap thoughts and when you think it will go in another direction. In the case of flowers sent by admirers to Judi <br /> <br /> The band members are interesting groups and ride over clich√©s too. One in prison, one found a religion, Al Khi and one had sunk into dementia, but joie de vivre discovered by Judi, which was sparked by the interest of her granddaughter, brought us in and made us look.
