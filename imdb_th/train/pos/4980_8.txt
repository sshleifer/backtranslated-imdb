While browsing the internet to see previous sales prices, I found these comments. Why are they so serious? It's just movies and not pornography. I received this short film from my parents 30 years ago and am very pleased with it. I show it to my friends and they like it too. I am honored to be the owner of Shirley's 1932 8mm black and white silent film before she became popular or well-known. After reading other comments, I agree that this movie is "Lively" big story! I hope it will last longer. It seems that I must be the only one who owns one of these manuscripts for sale at least, so I wonder how much it is
