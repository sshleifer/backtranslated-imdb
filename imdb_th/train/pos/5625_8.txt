Marjorie is interesting (Farrah Fawcett) lives with fear after being a lone biker. She shook violently with the fact that her attacker knew her address. As expected, Joe (James Russo), an intruder, arrives in Marjorie's house and forces her to face an embarrassing fear. Bruises and blood Marjorie manages to attack her by knocking out the living light from the jerk and makes him helpless with a spray on Hog's eyes and neck. Bind and abuse himself. Joe tries to explain himself With Marjorie's roommate (Diana Skarvid and Al Free Wood Cards) When they get home Almost with the meaning of mercy But it didn't come from Marjorie Should she continue to punish herself? Violence, sexual abuse and bad language make it a level. R Fawcett fled from a bad chapter to make her career stain forever. Would like to admire the director Robert M. Young
