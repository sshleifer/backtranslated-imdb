About the time when Gunga Din published on DVD, I can't tell precisely how many times I watched this movie. But I never get bored. The actors worked very well together. Victor Mclaglen (Sgt McChesney), Cary Grant (Sgt Cutter) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr (Sgt Ballentine) are superior teams. <br /> <br /> I can't beat the exploits. In india Your first glimpse at Sergeant Major is when you see them participating in the fight with other soldiers in the treasure map called The three sergeants were sent to find out what had happened to the communication lines and they entered the mostly deserted city - or so they thought <br /> <br /> They were involved in the necessary repairs. And soon "residents" are hiding Shortly after they were attacked by a mad group and fled back to the base, <br /> <br /> Later they were sent to another mission, which gave Sgt Cutter the opportunity to hunt for gold. Din Daeng They found a golden temple and were imprisoned by the evil Kali supporters. Din was sent to retrieve the aid and the cutter would be arrested.

The evil people watched and were about to surprise him with an injury from the ground, climbing up on the gold dome and blowing his trumpets, which prompted the British to alert the ambush. In doing this, Din was shot dead. <br /> <br /> The soldiers attacked the demons and beat them shortly. At the end, Din was honored as an honorary corporal in the British army.
