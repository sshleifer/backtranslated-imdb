OK, so I don't watch horror movies too much - and the reason is movies like 'Dark Remains'. I caught this on a DVD full of surprising features and it made me stupid. In fact, I think that the missing DVD is the only thing that is new pants. <br /> <br /> However, the next day I told someone about it when I knew I saw Actually, only 10% of it. The rest of the time, I'll watch pizza on the coffee table - nervously at my girlfriend. I'll catch me. If I really close my eyes a few times I dare to watch the screen, I jump so hard that I decided not to look again. <br /> <br / > Making movies is stable and the situation of the characters is really interesting. The simplicity of this movie is what caught my jump button - it's just a forest, a cabin and an abandoned prison - and a lot of darkness. The most surprising for me is the fact that although this is not a multi-million dollar production But the makeup effect looks real! Obviously this is a movie created by people who have a passion for making movies. Sound and music design takes advantage of my surround sound system like many Hollywood movies that have never been done. I noticed online that this movie won LA Shriekfest - a great success, and I guess this festival saw the talent of the filmmakers - and maybe this movie is more than I can. <Br /> Turn on the sound, turn off the lights and if you want your girlfriend - order pizza.
