Not since Spongebob Squarepants, I have seen even bigger cartoons on TV. The color is excellent. The sound is not likely to be better. The characters are very good cartoons. Hopefully Nickolodean will continue to develop this cartoon. Hopefully the DVD season will come out soon !!! I love cartoons like this and I hope people will refine to see this great cartoon. It's very difficult to find a season DVD, so if someone finds a store that sells it, please let us know. Catscratch products are only available in the Nick Shop. It's a great lookin shirt, but very expensive !!! If you love Spongebob; And who can't you love Catscratch too!
