Hard B movie <br /> <br /> I like Jake Weber. His understated delivery is a revival at the time of the show above. I like the relationship between father and son. I like the dynamics of the Wendi family. It looks stupid, but it is a representation of dead toys and deer. It's a combination, right? This is a psychological story, not Freddy slash em up. Flick. Instant satisfaction. Watch it and ponder about your kids and what this movie might say to you and you're fine. <br /> <br /> Work well.
