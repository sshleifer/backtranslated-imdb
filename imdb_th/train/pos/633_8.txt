Stardust Another Guarded Review (first written on June 15, 2007) <br /> <br /> The marketing mechanism has just begun for this. (No sites yet? In fact, I didn't like that. When I was posted, I thought it was another code name and was really worried that it was a Transformers, which is one of the movies that I want to watch when not working, so I enjoy it 100% like a movie watcher. It turns out that it's not a Transformers, and I get to know how to go back when it was 'Neil Gaiman'. What is it about? In short, it is the story of Gaiman about boys and fallen stars. Moreover, and I will provide the plot information, which is (a) breach of contract and (b) waste your fun. If you want to know what it's really about, buy a book, rumor, have it What is worth And for this it is absolutely possible This screening is 'special' in that it not only But including film critics But still attending (They rarely have mixed screening) and sci-fi / local fantasy. So you know the prospective audience, right? I mean, by this crowd and the name of Stardust, I know what to expect. <br /> <br /> How much is it? <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a story written by Famous authors in comic books But it is not the Lord of the Rings It is not even the Lord of the Rings, another one. (Ahem Eragon) It is more intimate than anything else. <br /> <br /> But like Lord of the Rings, it's a good human being who sells strange features. Of course, it's a romantic matter. But with humor that splashes And that humor is a type of genre that is not slapstick. Shrekism is a line of comedy rather than a joke. Before I start making this movie, <br /> <br /> The performance is at least good. It's hard to say more for fantasy movies. But I believe that there is a great role in the performance. Michelle Pfieffer is not a sad person. She plays as a villain and she works. Nothing special. Although Rupert Everett is a real jerk That is the great villain Peter O'Toole. Peter frickin 'O'Toole - which is a miracle. Ricky Gervais is handsome and shows perfectly. Robert De Niro seems to have too much fun for the majority. When he wants to deliver the product he does And Charlie Cox (who?) As the lead character is a great surprise from a man I have never heard before. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes Clare Danes Larsen, I always have various opinions with her. She is a wonderful person and then she seems to miss the mark. In this regard, she is a past And she is truly the star of this film Of course, her accent stumbled here and there. And yes, she's not as good as she can when Cox isn't in the scene. However ... look for yourself. <br /> <br /> Special effects are disabled. And also important The best airship - Sorry, Potter The direction is light and flowing beautifully. Movies may be better. But not everyone in New Zealand The other thing is that the braces <br /> <br /> and now is finished ... <br /> <br /> ... Writing Oh, writing! Neil Khun Devil is difficult for the weather today to do original things and in the beginning you start to wonder. Kingdom of the dying king, the boys go out to prove their own worth. Witch, mission (or three) - what's new? But the story of Gaiman makes you familiar with the familiar surface only to undermine the whole story of the boy and his heart. And even if you are wondering how it will come out, you begin to wonder in the third scene and - if you are me - find yourself drawn into the confrontation with the most erotic and hopeful climax the best In the end, you will find this story. This movie is something every fairy tale should be. But everything is not often <br /> <br /> (I hope I will talk about Septimus vs Tristan, but I will not destroy it for you. For those who read the book, please be assured that it is cheap. Must have) <br /> <br /> The person I spoke with later had the same impression as me. Great movies for all ages to enjoy and {WITHHELD} new for this generation. The gap is fulfilled after the film's wide release, because you might expect it. You will know when you walk away. I sincerely hope that Stardust will not get lost in the tent poles. Even though it is like that But we are happy to push everyone I know. <br /> <br /> --- <br /> <br /> I forgot to add {WITHHELD} to me a few years ago but ... "Great movie for all ages to enjoy and the new PRINCESS BRIDE for this generation." <br /> <br /> May be a relatively high rating. But I am still confident that this year's theme will have the same "Oh, I love this movie" respond to this thing because now there is a princess bride.
