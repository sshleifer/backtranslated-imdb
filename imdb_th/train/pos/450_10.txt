I have a bias towards the film that depicts the rich picture of Italy - in my opinion, the most romantic country in the world. Unfortunately, the movie is rather short, unusual, so it was a period of time and was slightly scattered in the film. However, a wonderful story is made for it. All four women began to work on the holidays that were absolutely necessary along with the problems in their hearts. Throughout the movie, they realized the problem and started to fix it. They believe that San Salvatore, the castle that they live in, affects the charming people. "It's a sink of love," Lottie Wilkins said. You can see their gradual changes from discontent to abundance while the seaside of Italy uses their magic. <br /> <br /> All their problems and solutions are reasonable Best Actress The background music seems to be suitable for the romantic places of Italy. In summary, the movie is 10/10 for me.
