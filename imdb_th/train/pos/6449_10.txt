I was brought by a friend and wondered about Swedish movies with subtitles. Anyway, I enjoy the beautiful movies every minute. Unnecessary cruelty that human beings can show confidently without having to have much pictures, even if animal lovers have to close their eyes for a few seconds. In the first 10 minutes, the original story of humility and cruelty Hope compared to the tragedy is conveyed from a satisfactory angle by using the spectrum of characters with flaws and natural properties. I like that the film dealt with many aspects of hypocrisy in relation to prejudice, discrimination and hypocrisy. The exact jewel of the movie that I will encourage everyone to listen to.
