Seven Pounds, Will Smith, played as Ben Thomas, an IRS tax collecting agent with hidden motives for meeting with taxpayers. Thomas causes seven people to die while driving, talking on the phone and watching movies, trying to try to compensate for a crime that could not be forgiven him honestly. <br /> <br /> The story has Brick-like resolution Green house window What you see is what happens - even the Titanic ending is more surprising compared to Seven Pounds. No twists at all, no confusion or doubt about what happened. <br /> <br /> Normally I like Will Smith when in the full Bad Boys mode, this guy is his best person when Play the gun driver Ford GT and say "Aw Hell Nah" whenever he tries to do it seriously. It will come as a pathetic effort in trying to get an Oscar for. The main reason I didn't get Looking forward to watching the movie, although here he will speak very little. There are many jokes. But they are really subtle. It's a performance that Will Smith has never seen before, and for one reason, he's a wonderful and ridiculous person. Should be nominated for a grand prize. <br /> <br / > The supporting actors are also great - Rosario Dawson looks at the door of death, both movies and Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper are doing as well as other bit players. <br /> <br /> Overall It's a disgusting person - but it's not Throw a clich√© violin and sentimental, so you have no choice other than to cry. There were a couple of times that even my hard heart was almost broken. You will be hard pressed to not find one in a situation that is not related to your own life which makes it look more real. <br /> <br /> I'll give 8/10. Will Smith's performances move towards acting by Without the despair of seeking happiness and coming from something better for it
