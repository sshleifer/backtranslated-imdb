Dog Bite Dog is not everyone's. But i enjoy it a lot Filled with slapping, stabbing and firing guns (But don't worry or be a very scary leader) It can be best explained as being a serious play across Hong Kong and Cambodia. Edison Cheng plays as a Cambodian killer in the city to kill a lawyer. Despite being dirty from his travels But he almost sat at a large table in an expensive restaurant If this sounds unbelievable for you, you should avoid this film. It serves as my cue to suppress unbelief and I enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Wai (Sam Lee), a frustrated young policeman who likes to hit people around. As much as he likes to smoke, Wai walks a fine line at the internal affairs department to investigate him and his father, the legendary Good Cop policeman, in a coma in accordance with the drug deal that goes south) <br /> <br /> There was a car crash with a lot of killing. And the strange and awkward love stories here are all played in almost all comic books I wonder if humor is intentional. (No one uses a huge concrete baton without looking at extravagant nonsense) but the nature beyond the limits loses many of my audience members. There are at least three points that this movie might end up and in the 109th minute, it may benefit from this brutal revision or deleting a storytelling title. (The thing that is gentle is working well, so I will go out. Interaction with the three dads) <br /> <br /> I tend to pass (high), but if only because of the ending? I rarely hear a lot of people laughing loudly as it should be a painful time. This is one that will be seen with a group of friends who love nonsense.
