Still Crazy is compared to the Spinal Tap because both are comedy about the R&R group that has been cleared. In fact, this similarity ended because Still Crazy wrote and performed much better while the Spinal Tap script worsened from The humorous first 10 minutes of time that went into the wonders that made Beavis and Butthead complicated in comparison. Still Crazy is a formula, but the character's liking and quality. The unexpectedly some of the musical numbers, I managed to compensate for the anticipated introduction of the film. Those who expect the Spinal Tap's friction will be disappointing by the nature of the movie. But I used Still Crazy's frenzy in the failed Spinal Tap movie but failed.
