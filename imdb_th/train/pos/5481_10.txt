For me, this is a wake-up call and realizes that everything we see, hear, read and think about almost everything depends on what the media enters us. This is a classic example of a high-level physician trying to control the mass through controlled information. It is also a great example that people who have a constitution that they buy free will not be dominated by this media control or the wrong information that is trying to do again. Many people, in fact, will outweigh the needs of a few people. It is also a light that can be seen that in a country without a religious civil war, democracy is not difficult to implement.
