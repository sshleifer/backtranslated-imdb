Once upon a time in life meant that once was a hoodlum, a hoodlum always, and no one enters or leaves the 'life'. Free hood in the neighborhood in New York sells drugs and runs a scam because they don't. Can be done in a legal world, probably because they have a criminal record or addiction or because they are lazy This simple story has a couple of twists about the most nasty characters, managed to draw sympathy from the audience for the main players because of loyalty and mutual sympathy. The film was written, produced and directed by Lawrence Fishburne, which was shown as 20/20 Mike (all hoodlums have a nickname) and based on his plays, "Riff Raff". Like playing from beginning to end, especially in the longest scene that three major players went out to decide who will be trusted Often the dialogue is much faster than on the stage, and I think this is the biggest flaw in the movie. When combined in a retrospective movie, a poem from the road, the rabbits sort of intense iambic and bring to the world where the film is revealed The poem makes it difficult to expel these people, the extremists who murdered, cheated and betrayed each other, unworthy of our interests or our humble. The worrisome thing about this movie is its realism. But shows how these people live But they have to suffer for the same reason as all of us One person is too stupid, another junkie, and the last person suffers from a conscience while the audience suspects or laughs at the feelings of the executioner who calls him to hang in the gallows.
