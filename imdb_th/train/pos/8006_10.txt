This is a great game! Okay, maybe it doesn't have some features that it should have, but Digital Anvil still has a good game. There are some similarities with Elite (you can trade, pick up weapons and transport items from ships that have been destroyed to the mission). However, this game has a mission with heavy scripts. It's a great mission. Different control systems using the mouse! Basically, you will fly a spacecraft around the system and find a way! The game has a fairly good graphics, although it was created in 2003. It should work well on a PC that is politely specified. The story has a great performance from John Rhys Davies, George Takei, Jennifer Hale (she appears in every computer game), next to stories that get better and better as they happen There is even a competition where you and your opponent must race your spaceship around the field. (It involves getting you through the ring) This part takes time to overcome. It adds variety to the game. Some have a little bit of strength here and overall you can beat this game. Such games have mod mods that are active on the internet. Select the modifier to expand the game. I haven't played mods yet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the sequel to this story has been canceled.
