This movie is worthy to see visually beautiful and animated performances only. But there are also interesting cultural narratives about alienation Women and actors (Both brought together the supporting role of the homo-toot actor). Both were relegated to recurring roles in China. This makes an improbable relationship between a very old street performer and a young girl who is stronger than a native culture. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have with this movie is the trend. Soundtrack The mood is not needed by the actors. <br /> <br /> A new choice for a satisfying summer action movie.
