This is not a movie that you watch for entertainment, at least most people I know would not like it. <br /> <br /> It's a cruel image to both the body and the mind that happened in the war. It is especially possible because you "read your mind", something that is common in books and rarely in movies. But did very well in this piece I'll put it next to "Quiet all on the Western Front" and "Die Br√ºcke" in terms of creating a lasting impression A copy of it shows that it is quite difficult - which is a shame.
