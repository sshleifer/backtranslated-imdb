"If I sit down, I won't stand up again." That's what my mother (One of the names) spoke to his son when he told her to rest (She is a widow) He means rest is what women of his age and in her situation have to do: rest in peace to neglect themselves. But she is not in the mood to "rest" yet. In addition, she also has a daughter who blamed her for every disaster in her life ... Suddenly the revelation occurred: sex and passion in the form The muscle carpenter is 30 years younger than her (Daniel Craig, the brand new James Bond) when she "thinks no one will touch her again". It's a story that makes you ponder many things, especially in 60 things women should do with her life when her husband died. It seems that we didn't develop that way. I mean, no one is surprised when Sean Connery has a love story in the movie with Catherine Zeta Jones ... But what do you think if it's something else? Old woman, young man ... No, you are not ready, right? <br /> <br /> This movie has the tone of the person who is close throughout the length, except for 2 or 3 scenes where the tone is divided into clear dialogue and improper The rude touch and the way the son and daughter find their mother's love (very nonsense - you'll know what I mean when you look -) is the only inconsistent element in the "mother". <Br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
