An excellent movie that shows the current flow in the lives of non-racially diverse people in the Pacific Northwest. Solid governance and writing, along with good performances, especially the performances of Kwamitha and Dan Stowe Interestingly, this film was created in the same year as the highly successful "Crash" written and directed by Paul Hagis. The rhythm of the action may not be as exciting as in Los Angeles and the characters may be more familiar than each other in "Beyond that", but the character's personal relationship is flawed and happy. The story resonates with any of those in "Crash" for viewers who like "Crash". This is a movie that must be watched. In addition, fans of Jim Jarmusch and John Cassavetes will like this movie.
