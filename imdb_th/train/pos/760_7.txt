I have not seen this movie since the late 1980s and decided to accept the VHS version of this movie. The plot is very slow and the actors almost watch the robot in this breakdance flick. Hip-hop / freestyle music and dance scenes are what makes this movie really special. Breakdancing dance is better in the movie " Breakin "" But I have to say that "Breakin '1 & 2" brings a lot of energy and excitement to the screen. It is a movie that I will keep in my library. But it's not a movie that I can watch over and over again once in a blue moon
