I just got a chance to watch "The Waterdance" and liked it so much. I didn't really understand why it was called because there was no real dance, except maybe for dancing at a strip club near the end We were introduced to the main characters throughout the movie, whether in the hospital. The story shows the love between a young man with a healthy body and a woman who is a very sweet story. But you don't watch movies like this. I didn't "get stuck in the time warp". I didn't say that everything in the 80s and early 90s was better today. But I think the film industry is getting worse and we can learn from old movies by old movies. I mean Anything from 1920-1998
