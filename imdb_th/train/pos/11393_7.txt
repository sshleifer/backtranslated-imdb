Uggh! I'm not really impressed with this movie, but I have to admit that it is technically well built. It received 7 for very high production costs. But for entertainment, it's quite bad In fact, I think this movie is one of the most exaggerated movies in the 50s. It won the Academy Award for Best Film. But this movie is sometimes boring with dance and dancing and dancing a lot. That is because, unlike some musicals that have the appropriate number of songs with strong stories and performances (such as MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS), this movie is almost all singing and dancing. In fact, this film has the longest songs and dances in history, and if you don't get into this movie, it will make you bored quickly. Give me more stories! The result is too much production numbers and weak stories. This movie is like a stable meringue - it's just a long-term dissatisfaction. <br /> <br /> Think ... This is the movie that Beat "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "A Place in the Sun" for the best picture! And to make matters worse, "The African Queen" and "Ace in the Hole" were not nominated in this category! The surprising thing for me is "Ace in the Hole" disappeared from the best writing of this film - even though "An American in Paris" hardly ever has anything to say about and most of it is driven by Dance and music
