This is a very entertaining movie. Some reviews that I have read in this forum are written by people who think that this movie is a serious effort for the drama. It didn't do that .... It was a fun movie that was shown as a cheek. Clearly, all actors have fun while entertaining us. The fight sequence is lively, agile and above all free. What is called "Green Death" used in those few times, not while I read one critique of "scary". Two critics criticized the battle of martial arts between the doctor and the sea near the end of the Hey Hey movie. Down ... Again, I am reminded of this and this is a fun movie. Each step of this "battle" has explanations added to the fun side. The actor did not try to imitate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. This is not a movie about martial arts. Ron Ely looks good in this movie and is the perfect choice for playing Doc. Another good touch is the fate characteristic. The last of the "bad guys" (sea) is managed. I promise you that if you don't try to make this movie seriously and watch it for entertainment, you will spend the most 100 minutes of fun.
