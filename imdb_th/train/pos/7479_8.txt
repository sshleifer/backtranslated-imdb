"Sweetness is never sweet without sour." This message is the main theme of the movie in my opinion. Tom Cruise plays the young man who gives everything in his life. He received many things to get in. This story is filled with excitement in this great movie with a great twist. This movie will make you participate in the plot and can't stop to stop the bathroom. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that makes you retreat and look at your life. You can't appreciate the better things in life (sweetness), such as love, until you experience the badness (sour). The theme will take you to "Open your eyes." <br /> <br /> The only complaint is that this film has been twisted at the very point and is hard to understand. I think the end is perfect. I suggest you look and see for yourself.
