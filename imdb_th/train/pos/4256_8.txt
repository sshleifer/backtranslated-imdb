It's a delightful movie! Very warm, no one can fall in love with the characters of Gigi. He is a cute boy and grows into a sensitive artist. All movies revolve around him. Did he live in a wonderful world? Living the whole life ?? Curiosity and expectations There was a brother who tried to steal his reputation. But still in the shadows throughout his life Father is a very original Italian and mother. I want my father to reunite with my mother in the final scene Then let them cry and laugh I hope that at least there is something that is exchanged about the brother. It seems that his personality will be completely abandoned. Passion and enthusiasm? That is the key to life And looking through the camera ?? Focus on small details and taste the delicate details of life.
