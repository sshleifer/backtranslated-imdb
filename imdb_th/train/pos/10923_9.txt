This movie is really good. The plot, which works like a puzzle, forces the viewer to think and guess what will happen next. Such tips bring many surprises and make the audience wait to solve the mystery. The fighting scene is very good. There are many different fighting styles. (Although one of the themes doesn't look true for me But it's just my opinion) to watch and it's an interesting show The only thing that is annoying is that the actors look. Quite too weak (At least for me) Hong Kong is a good kung fu movie, especially in the 70's and 80's, so "Five Venoms" (or other versions) is a great option
