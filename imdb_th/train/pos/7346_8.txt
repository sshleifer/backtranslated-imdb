When I saw this animation for the first time (I might be 15 years old) I'm really impressed! It has a completely different style compared to Japanese animation and I like it more. All the impressions of this film look scary and darker ... Different colors ... Colorful characters do not say much, this conversation is not long and boring, and that (like in Ghost in the Shell) with pictures Dark, the view of the monster and the magical feeling. It looks like one of those ancient Scandinavians. A story full of violence and terrifying creators, enchanted forests and deep caves that inhabited by dragons, traps, orks ... and one mysterious hero who stopped evil ...
