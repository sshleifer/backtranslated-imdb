In Fox Noir's twentieth-century film, this metropolis is a labyrinth of despair that hunters and hunters will survive by living together. The image of a city that is less humble than a human being in the symbol of a cold political expression. <br /> <br /> The prostitute has grabbed her purse to the subway. It has a microfilm and a communist spy ring will go as far as possible. A double parallel investigation appeared as both a spy and a policeman. Hunt for valuable information. <br /> <br /> The pickpocket against the hero Skip McCoy plays with disgusting confidence by Richard Widmark. He knows that the police must be Moral and humble, therefore he mocked them: "Continue," he said to Captain Dan Tiger (Murvyn Vye), "Hit the cost, throw me in. You did it before." The world is free This police is just another gang on the street, just like Candy. The hooker bribes Lightning Louie to be a leader, so the police are busy with the supply of pigeon feces. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that When Widmark created this film, he was in middle age. The 39-year-old star, who is ending his contract with Fox, shows upstart across McCoy with the brutality of a teenager. Today, it may not be acceptable for a romantic lead actor to punch his love, interested in unconsciousness, and revive her by drinking beer in front of her. But with the moment that it shows the toughness - and Candy after all. Br> <br /> Jean Peters shines like Candy. Here, in the middle of her five-year movie reputation, she is beautiful and charming like a prostitute with a golden heart. She is the victim of a martyr story for her beauty as much as anything else. She has a good meaning. But there are people who are constantly mocked - Joey, Skip and the police. <br /> <br /> The true star of the film is New York. City panoramas and subway stations snidering present the awkward escape of the city as an organism. Like a worm in decayed cheese, human numbers run along the passage of the city, elevators, subway revolving doors, sidewalks - even the dumb waiter serves as a conduit for the flow of damaged humanity. People cling to any niche that provides security. Moe has her dirty motel room across his tasteful cottage on the Hudson River. While the characters are moving and interacting, they are surrounded by bridges or lattice architecture of the beams or divided by a hanging winch. The personality of the city is always elegant. The corners and wooden beams of the docks are the resonance of the road plan, steel grating and index card storage cabinets in the room. Team organizers mimic the Manhattan skyline. When Joey's exit from the metro was excluded, it was as if the steel ligaments in the city were holding him. <br /> <br /> The surprising proportion of this film was taken very close. Characters push the plot as they should, and the closeup will be used to add characters. When crossing questions, Candy Closeup will capture sexual energy between them. The beauty of Jean Peter Stirling is drawn with the light in the focus that is soft and delicate. The device is also used to increase tension. Order of opening the purse without dialogue: The drama relies on intimacy for a powerful effect. <br /> <br /> Sniper and sniper on the Snoopy movie maker Mo ( Telmar Matters) Make a living as a reporter and her place in the hierarchy is acceptable even to her victims. When crossing, observe "You have to eat". He repeats the prayer. Like the New Yorkers who 'sheep', sheep, lambs or lumber, underworld trade in information. <br /> <br /> And even pigeons, feces, are still better than Joey and his communist friends. Joey's on the bed of Moe is the symbol of the most basic moral code violation. Joey is over. Pee Mo will not trade with Joey, even to save her life: "... even in a crumbling business. We have to draw a line somewhere. "<br /> <br />" Pickup "was created in the depths of the Cold War. Richard Nixon had just been elected as a candidate for the Republican Vice President. Lilikan gave his name to Alger Hiss, who revealed his - fake and communist microfilm. McCarthy's show experiment is true every day. We saw the police in the anti-movie. "The betrayer who gave Stalin the blast." <br /> <br /> New York can be seen as a giant support that deceives human scams and murders. Containers for leitmotif styles throughout the film Mo holds the trademark box of the relationship and the purse of a small film container dessert as a mechanism of plot. Crossed his only treasure in the submerged crate, a symbol of his secret road wisdom The coffin of the moving Hudson ship is another cargo ship that has been moved around a merciless city. <br /> <br /> This film is a masterpiece. Candy shows above skulking across the rickety of the hut, showing her moral glory. When placing the gun on the table, the intense view makes it look bigger than sweets - violence is beginning to sympathize the dwarves. The couple was overshadowed by the shadow of Stevens's hook, warning us that their love was not pure or absolute. But depends on the horrific change of the city Communism is a shadow on the wall or unfolds the puff of cigarette smoke. He is like a lonely cat amidst the rubbish - the demon hunter of the night. Pictures from the camera under the bonnet of the cab inside the newspaper arch and through the hospital bed continue to strengthen us by realizing that we are all stuck in the city area. We are the mulching material of civilization.
