This is my type of movie I was amazed by the surprising nightmares and the film was like that. But it is a dark comedy While I see most of the horror / thriller movies, there are others who may see it as a black comedy. <br /> <br /> But no matter how The ending made me careful. But what is going to end! It makes the audience have to think a lot. <br /> <br /> A powerful performance, a complex plot, and an excellent script detail filled with fear and humor. Personally, I think I will have to look again many times to get and understand all the subtleties inside. But it is a movie that will make it happy and not boring to do
