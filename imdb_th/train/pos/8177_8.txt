I was surprised that no one thought of doing a movie like this before. Horror is often the most effective when using real life offensive as a theme and no one (except Steve Martin in The Little Shop of Horrors) likes to go to the dentist. Tortured teeth before (See the example of Marathan Man) But this caused fear in the suburbs. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the dentist Dr. Alan Firestone (Corbin Bernensen), who came down to madness, now our beloved doctor doesn't play with a full deck to start. But was driven by the jealousy and overwhelming abnormalities that he began to cause catastrophes to those around The mental state of the doctor is circling close to what we see in the character of Michel Douglas in Falling Down, but with horror. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Stewart Stuart Gordon. And Brian Yuzna, the good flow. The highlight that played as a cop was Ken Foree, who had been welcoming. <br /> <br /> Now, I believe that this movie will not work if there are no great performances from Corbin Bernsen Previously, he had just seen him in the LA Law. Out of his show <br /> <br /> The Dentist 2 sequel is worth watching. <br /> <br> <br> TTKK's Bottomline - a fun movie that has some scenes that will make you cringe with the purpose of a wonderful performance from Bernsen.
