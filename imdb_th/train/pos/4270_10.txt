Ko to tamo peva is the best comedy movie of all time Believe me, I see many movies and comedies. But tell me that it will make you smile every time you watch But the truth is that the humor in this comedy is special. And the former Republic of Yugoslavia, everyone knows very well !!! So I think the rest of the audience (For example: in Europe) can not enjoy it much Because the narrative destroys the hole But at least they should try !!!! Yes, it's ridiculous! This is the best flick in Serbian history and the world doesn't understand! :-) If you have the opportunity to see this thing, don't explode. OK!
