Tel Marter stole the image I just watched it again I couldn't help but be in my last scene. She didn't get an Oscar. That's why you shouldn't believe too much in the Oscars. Richard Widmark never had a better part and was a perfect actor as a 3-D man with flaws. Jean Peters is great as a strong girl in her best roles forever and Richard Kiley must be a very good person. Why do I have to hate him like that? Yes, it delivers heavy patriotism. But without you, there will be no movie See their faces! The top three stars do not need much script. I want to see them doing this movie without discussion. If you've seen Ray Milland and Rita Gam in "The Thief", you probably know what I mean. When I was a child in 1956 on my first trip to NYC, I made the Bronx uncle drove us to South Street to find number 66. That's when I knew that Hollywood wasn't reliable. But I met the river <br /> <br /> I didn't tell much about it because I hated to know what would happen before I saw it myself. If you have seen it, there is no need to be clarified. Maybe people who are reading these reviews haven't seen "Pickup On South Street". You will like it; Don't go to 66 South Street in New York City.
