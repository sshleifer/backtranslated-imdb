When a small hobbit named Frodo Baggins inherited the magic ring from his uncle, Gandalf explores and discovers that this ring is an ancient invention of the evil Dark Lord. If the ring ends with his hand, he will regenerate and destroy Middle Earth. Frodo and his faithful friend set out to destroy the ring with the warrior band. This is a modification adapted from a classic novel because it covers only the first half of the story. Regardless of whether this is a great and amazing animated movie, <br /> <br /> The animation is made with great rotoscope, which can be transmitted through live action scenes. Ralph Bakshi works well with the low budget he receives. The film also has an excellent musical score by Leonard Rosenman that fits every scene. There is a small plot with scripts, but there must be excuses. Considering the original agreement is to make the trilogy reflect this book as two movies, a lot must be crammed for the first time. My biggest catch is that some of the designs of the Samwise characters are a bit too stupid, while other hobbits perform completely normal. Other characters are well written for the screen and the cast can do it. Very good. I am glad that Legolas is more useful to this plot. Orsc rotoscoped is funny than scary, while the ringwraiths are horrifying and horrifying. Person Significant evil Saruman name ARU thanks to the writer. Overall, I think there is more money and better writers will do this fairly. But there are some things that are fascinating about it. Ralph Bakshi takes courageous attempts to alter the screens of these classic stories. This movie suffered a lot from being overshadowed by live action movies. But it is also a great movie for animators of all ages
