I don't know what this movie is about. I look at the video store and after watching it, I enjoy it. A few minor flicks from director Bernard Rose (Candyman, Immortal Beloved), stories and great characters as Glenne Healdy's boyfriend. The only exception for this film is the ending. However, it has rent.
