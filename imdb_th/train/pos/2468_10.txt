I went to see a small village because I was in between jobs. I thought 4 hours would be good. I am a fan of Branagh; Die again. Henry 5, I was completely overwhelmed by the filming of the movie that the film caught. Like other comments, 4 hours passed quickly. Branagh didn't play Hamlet. He was Hamlet. He was born for this. When I watched this movie, I tried to find mistakes all the time. I looked at the fool and didn't notice them. The way he can move the camera in and out of the hall with all the mirrors is a mystery for me. This film was filmed in 70 million. It's a shame that Columbia didn't launch a wide-screen version on the VHS. I own a DVD player and I will accept this from Titanic every day. So Columbia, if you listen to this movie, should watch! And I don't know what happened to Oscar This should be the best image sweepers, the best male actors, the best direction, the best movies. What movies are they watching? I felt sorry for Branagh at the Oscars when he made a tribute to Shakespeare on the screen. They should pay tribute to Branagh to bring us one of the greatest movies.
