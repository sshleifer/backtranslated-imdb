I like to watch this movie very much because of all the horrifying scenes about raptors. I like raptors because it's scary. My favorite part is the piece that the raptors look behind the pillar because it reminds me of the scene from Friday, the 13th movie, with women who eat bananas. <br /> <br /> I like to watch so much. Computer graphics seem a little fake. But it's okay because when you go into the movie, you hardly notice what has happened and I think it's a good end, even though I don't understand what happened to me. First look at the couple, I thought of it over time and that was an important part. Another important part is how scary dinosaurs are. If you watch it for the first time, <br /> <br /> This is the best movie.
