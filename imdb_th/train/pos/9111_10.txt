"Capit√£es de Abril" is very good. The story is not a documentary about the 1974 revolution in Portugal, but it makes us understand what it is. The novel of the story didn't get much attention. But not causing the movie to lose Captain Salgueiro Maia's brave action is not an exaggeration and the movie is a tribute to his actions. Captain Salgueiro Maia remains one of the greatest heroes of the revolution on 25 April. <br /> <br /> Every actor is very good. Lisbon looks as beautiful as ever. Don't miss out! I like this movie a lot.
