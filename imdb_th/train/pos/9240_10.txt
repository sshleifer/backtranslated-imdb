Found this flick in the videostore. It costs $ 2 to buy this movie. Really terrible! Colonel called the person who will be the hero here, if the cover can be trusted, must be in his eighth and hardly able to walk. However, he can shoot the most stupid ninja in the world. Then the story fell out of the colonel, which made him feel that the old man could not do anything worthwhile to say. At this point, eighty-eight men who look scary take possession of the story I lost hundreds of times. But didn't care because this movie is terrible, it's really fun to watch Trash that doesn't have the same budget as an actor who doesn't deserve that name. Try it out!
