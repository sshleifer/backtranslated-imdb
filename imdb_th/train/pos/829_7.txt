I will admit that I think this movie is not good. But soon I changed my mind This movie makes you guess which direction is going. Pierce Broson is a great person in his role as an assassin who is burnt and asks a man he met at a Mexican bar for Help Greg Kinner is a frightening person, as he plays a gentle man from Denver who starts an innocent conversation with Pierce at a Mexican bar. This movie will make you laugh while Pierce delivers one of the hilarious. (Mostly about sex) <br /> <br /> Imagination in this movie is very good, especially in the bullfighting scene and when Pierce sees himself when trying His last job
