I am 11 years old. I found that I lived 0.48 miles from the Uncle House. Uncle House is located in Westway Dr, Deer Park, TX. I don't know the house number. But you can go and see Now I am 21 and I enjoy watching this movie. The Spencer band is no longer theirs. Pasadena ISD wants to build their school. I drove to the house last week. The house still looks good. My father and uncle go to the street in the house and watch the actors come and leave the house trying to make a movie. That John crossed the railroad, they gave rise to 225. When I heard about John loesing his son, I started thinking when he made a cowboy in the city. He was 26 or 25 at the time
