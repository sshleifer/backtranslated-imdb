I do not understand, not a critic. I do not evaluate the quality of the show, which I believe is good. My confusion lies in the content. No one is sensitive to the fact that these two unfaithful women show disloyalty to men who fight and blood to guarantee the freedom of their families and countries. There should not be a preface to let us know if men make their homeland and if so, what is their "unfaithful" infidelity that affects their infidelity? While these women are sleeping with loneliness, do they think that their husbands are being shot in the face of death or loss of organs every day? They don't miss your husband! Own only Forgive me except when they want their husband to die
