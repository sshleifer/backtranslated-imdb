This is the true character and the drama-driven story at the most embarrassing level of what we see on TV at mo <br /> <br /> I'm impressed from the beginning. Don't be delayed if not your Sci fi nut (like me ...). This can happen on Earth. The fact that it exists in another galaxy just makes the show more interesting. No spacecraft or laser guns (no). Until now I have seen s01 e04 and I was surprised and wondered what will happen next because there are many possibilities. <br /> <br /> Actors have a particularly strong role with pasion Eric stoltz. <br /> <br /> This performance is really lonely. It doesn't matter if you watch BSG or not. In fact, it's very different. I have read some negative comments from sci fi geeks. It is expected that this drama will be less and more aliens and ray guns. But I will say that I do not care. <br /> <br /> This is a good starting point for acting. Help them hope that they will not be able to do after 1 or 2 seasons as they showed today.
