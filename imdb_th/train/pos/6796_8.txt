Zodiac Killer (2005) is an interesting film from the German director Ulli Lommel. He led the producer and co-star in this latest production. He not only managed to create interesting movies at a cheap price. But he reached a new low when Herr Lommel worked as a footage from almost all his movie catalogs. I have seen movie clips from Boogeyman I and II, War Birds, Tenderness of the Wolf, Brain Waves and Cocaine Cowboys (even Andy Warhol made a cameo from the film's grave). Although he uses a lot of old videos, but he Works well (And I may add creatively) <br /> <br /> This film follows a young man who copied the original zodiac killer. He also corresponds with the writer (Ulli Lommel), who originally wrote about a serial killer in the late sixties and early seventies. The writer's friend (David Hess) helps him try and find this zodiac thinker. Can this killer stop? Will the writer combine two and two together and restore his old glory? Is David Hess still a man? You will have to search for yourself and see the zodiac killer. <br /> <br /> This film is not about the original zodiac killer. I also heard people complaining about this film that was shot in the video. What about the director's art style? The director's school demonstrates the fact that it was taken in the video. My only complaint is the use of stock images from Herr Lommel's previous story (but I understand why "wink" "wink"). Don't believe advertising. Street level horror As well as the denial of responsibility in the initial state, the film does not praise the murder. You have to like that message. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for Ulli Lommel fans.
