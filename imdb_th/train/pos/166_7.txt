This is the first film that Joe Ancawaw and Clark Gables created together, and they will do many more things. Crawford is a rich woman whose father was washed out of the stock market competition and nothing left for her and her brother. They had never worked before and William Bakewell, the younger brother, got a job with Gable, a gangster and Bakewell thought it would be an easy task. But quickly entered the head Crawford became a newspaper reporter. But wanted to work on a big deal. They were massacres where many gable men were killed and Crawford testified to the whole story. It's a good movie But not the best movie
