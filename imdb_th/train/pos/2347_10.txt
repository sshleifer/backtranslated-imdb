I have been a fan of Pushing Dais since the first time. It's a wonderful idea and Brian Fuller has the most amazing idea for this show. <br /> <br /> It's unbelievable that the TV must have a creative program. It is a great relief to see performances that are not the same as the rest, which if you compare it to newer shows like Scrubs and House, you will see similarities and boring moments Seeing a show that is close to one's own body
