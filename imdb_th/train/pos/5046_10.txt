There is garbage in the cable channel, the movie that I hit with this jewel. From the beginning to the end, it made me stick and deserved the highest score. <br /> <br /> The father of two sons heard a message from "God" to kill the person he said was 'demon'. <br /> <br /> When the credit is open, shows that the director is one of the actors that is often a warning of a bad movie. It is the opposite here, because the drama does not stop from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> And there is no moment in the movie when this film doesn't fully enchant because there are no essentials or sub-necessities. The transformation and script is first class. <br /> <br /> All the actors give a very convincing performance, especially the great young actors. <br /> <br /> This movie is good, at least like Of 'Silence of the Lambs'
