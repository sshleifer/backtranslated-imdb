The opportunity to meet between the salesman and the killer changed their lives both. This is a strange movie that can be used, which is an impressive effort for director Shepard in a role without courage that is a far way from James Bond. Under the stress of his work But unable to connect with anyone who can help him cope. Kinnear is as good as a good friend salesman with the emptiness of his life. Davis is a good man as Kinnear's flirting wife. Most of the time, this movie character education is rewarding because it feels fresh and unpredictable. The darkest comedy movie.
