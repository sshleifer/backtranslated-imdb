The performances by Om Puri, Smita Patil and Sadashiv Amrapurkar and all the chemistry came out beautifully, along with the simple methods of telling stories and directions by Govind Nihlani. > I didn't watch this movie again. It is one piece, each piece fits in the plot. You can't impress the movie. <br /> <br /> Amrish Puri comes out as a bossy husband and 'baap' of Om Puri Om Puri is a young man caught between responsibility and not Can fight the system. Sadhashiv is Rama Shetty, giving the right touch to the movie with a smiling villain The first meeting of Anand Velankar and Rama Shetty at Sadhashiv's place was amazing. Smita Patil didn't have a major role. But her part did not distract from the main plot. <br /> <br /> And to add Kafi Inamdar, all of this has a role as a police officer who has made a deal with the system and its work Say the right thing in the right place and know how to protect yourself from problems. In addition, he is Om Puri's 'sage' and helps him whenever he has a problem. <br /> <br /> Not only movies But focused on the problems that the police tried to do his duty only The side of cruelty in police custody Om Puri collects despair and a strong desire to liberate this extraordinary performance in Ardh Satya. <br /> <br /> To all Indian movie fans
