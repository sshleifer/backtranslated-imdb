This movie is the best movie I have ever seen as a LDS. I would like to recommend this movie because you can understand the life of Joseph Smith more even though this movie is not created with Famous actor But it is an incredible movie and a life change that everyone can enjoy I saw this movie with my family and I can testify that all of us change their minds. This film helps people fully understand that life is a hardship for the prophets and the difficulties they face. After I watched this movie, there was no dry eye in the entire room. Everyone was impressed with what they saw and I didn't like the same since I saw it. I recommend this movie for everyone.
