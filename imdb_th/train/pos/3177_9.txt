Adam Jones has great humor. There is nothing I don't like about this movie. Cross Eyed is beautifully shot. Adam works great, not just But develop the main character But including the characters as well. <br /> <br /> Cross Eyed gives hope to every cheap movie. You don't have to spend a lot of time creating things that are worth watching. There is something like for everyone. If you have an awesome roommate If you ever choose Duke in high school If you have parked anywhere in the city If you have all sorts of humor, you will love this movie. This is the type of movie that will stay for a long time and end up resurfacing again when Adam creates a name for himself. I hope to get Adam's future project.
