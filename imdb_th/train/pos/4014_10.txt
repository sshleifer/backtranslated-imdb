Spoiler for everyone who is lucky enough to watch this movie. (So ​​don't really spoiler) Watch this movie when it's released and still remember a part of it. It is located in a small town in the west or the rest of that city. It is similar to a ghost town that has few inhabitants. Among them, the couple, whose wife is especially evil She let her man die at the end of this movie and leave town. But must cross the desert We never knew what would happen to her. But before she left, her dead man shot her and deliberately did not hit her instead of tap water. She didn't know that soon she would be very thirsty. Mark Damon killed two villains in a funny mansion. But that's another story that I don't remember too well. The remaining impression of this film is that it was one of the first times I saw a really wicked woman in a movie that pretended to be anything But being evil - can't compare to witches in 'Snowwhite'
