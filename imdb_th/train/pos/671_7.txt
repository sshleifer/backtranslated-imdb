I remember seeing this when it was released in theaters in Palo Alto and didn't expect much. I mean - Australian movies? But eventually came to me. This is the scene. Richard Chamberlain was sitting cross-legged on the floor of an apartment in Sydney facing the senior Australian named Charlie Chamberlain. < br /> <br /> Chamberlain: "You went out of your house tonight?" and Charlie responded aggressively that "Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? You are a fish. Are you a snake? Are you a man? Who are you? Who are you? It was a dramatic scene, shot closely by the handsome face of Chamberlain, full of screen, opposite the face with a black beard, Charlie's wide nose. <br /> <br /> Two men Not much different and This film is the story of Chamberlain accidentally stumbling upon his mysterious insults in the mystery of Charlie's unspeakable and unspeakable world. <br /> <br /> I don't think. That I will continue to do this It's about the sandbar. But I must say that anyone who does research on Australian traditional belief systems should receive A plus. They have everything here, from the point of the bone to the time of dreams, to a parallel universe where dreams come true. It is a very creepy movie without many musical or special effects. Charly's world began to encroach on Chamberlain's dream for totally unclear reasons. <br /> <br /> If There is a problem with that script. Nothing truly clear. Chamberlain, who seems to have a special connection with the natives, died in the last wave? Do the natives? All Sydney? Basic evidence is also difficult to accept, even though it has been said that this is a fantasy. The natives were invested with the psychic power that the Americans gave to the American Indians, while the truth is that the fairy tale is a myth and while one may be more complicated or satisfying - elegant and beautiful. - The legend is still Trying to stay above ordinary, demanding, and sometimes disappointing physical existence. The mystery of Charlie makes believe that the miracle of Moses in Cecil B. DeMille is "The Ten Commandments" But they are brothers and sisters under the skin. <br /> <br /> But I don't care about that. As this film is quite good and is very important to mark the celebrity of Peter Weyer and the Australian film industry. This is the first time this film has received an overwhelming response from this film, some of which are scary, such as "Mad Max" and some deep and dramatic stories like "Lantana". Looks like Nicholas Roe when pregnant with fear of being too weak. Try "Picnic at Hanging Rock" as an example of creating a truly chilling movie without causing blood. drop
