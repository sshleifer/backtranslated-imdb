Intense performances, great villains and unexpected actions. <br /> <br /> Some people may not want to watch this movie because it takes 85 minutes and is 88% of this movie. Aboard Do not worry that they will pull it out very well with intelligent conversations. <br /> <br /> The PG-13 movie looks like a new story for director Wes Craven, but of course he has a moderate intensity. As far as he can in this thriller, <br /> <br /> This is the strongest point of this film. This movie needs a good actor to deliver dialogue and excitement. If they don't have those actors, this movie will be lost and boring.
