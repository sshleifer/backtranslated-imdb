It is hard to imagine that this film is based on the true story and the way Christie managed to achieve that miracle. Exciting. Daniel Day-Lewis is a hard chameleon to imagine his efforts in creating characters. Disabled Watching him on the screen is a shocking and amazing experience. <br /> <br /> The film doesn't look pessimistic as I thought before. The story is bright and interesting. Cristi is not blasphemous. But his life is full of color and joy, even though we can recognize the loneliness and pain in his eyes. <br /> <br /> One of the important factors of Christie's success is Supported by his mother Which seems to be more impressive, and the actress who doesn't know Brenda Friger deserves an Oscar for this role. This young middle-aged woman uses everything to make Christie's dream. Realistic Very lucky for Christie and Hugh O'Connor. It's great like Christie, who is young. Christie's love story is very well done. Christie needs love and nothing can make him eligible to love Dr.'s passion. Eileen Cole (played by Fiona Shaw, I was very impressed with her role in the Harry Potter series. Aunty's aunt. In this role, it's beyond my thinking. But anyway, any woman who has her own child ...) is a paranoid and aggressive person. I have compassion for him. Love is a double-edged sword. Happiness and pain beside others Jim Sheridan's works are all good. (In America, boxers and others) except GET RICH or DIE Trying 'God knows why he chose to bring that shit! A career that is not pure for him. It's a shame!
