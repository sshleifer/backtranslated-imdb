I watched Lion King more that all my friends put together. Having a sister .. You know how it is. By now, I remember both the plot and the line after the Lion King 2 came out. I was ok. Well, let me see ... The second one is obviously weaker ... Then I saw an advertisement for Lion king 1 and 1/2 .... After watching 1 1/2 I was like wow All my expectations (For repetition) is destroyed. The plot is truly cute and original, allowing you to stick to the seat all the time. I noticed that the cartoons were filled with many funny moments that ROFlmao would use 100% here. <br /> <br /> I suggest watching cartoons.
