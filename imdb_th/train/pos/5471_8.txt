In the year 1933, the film had a lot of wounds from this film because it was the most content and the fact that Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck) would do everything to gain great wealth and power. Lily's father forced his daughter into prostitution at the age of 14, and she grew up in a steel mill in a city with very poor people and her father ran wildly, bringing all kinds of male characters. . As the story progresses, Lily meets a man after a man and eventually finds a man who has everything and is the Playboy bank president. It's a good story. John Wayne saw this very young age. With production and Jimmy didn't go to the first base with Lily even for lunch The very young George Brent (Coutland Trenholm) performed with Barbara Stanwick and both performed great. This is a great movie from 1933, produced by Darryl F. Zanuck and was held in guilt for many years and has just been shown on the silver screen. This movie is rather soft compared to what we watch on the Hollywood movie screen today, but in 1933 it was so naughty to watch this kind of movie.
