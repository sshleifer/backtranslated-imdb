Film about the cruelty of this world I find it liberated because of the only truth that is possible. There is also a bit funny. Some extraordinary performances, see Maria Hofstätter, such as The director tried to explain the most realistic life possible and succeeded. Sex scenes are clear and not fake, rather than hard-core movies. Although I hardly understood the sentence But I found that the vision of the movie in the original language with more rewarding narration because of the dubbed half of the actor's excellent work The voice of the character played by Maria Hofstätter is hard to copy, especially by dubber. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie.
