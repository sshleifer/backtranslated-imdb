This film has both excellent adult actors along with young actors who are going to be screened for a long time if they are fair. Supervision and editing are excellent. I might find a book adapted from it. It must be great (I like it), Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight and Tim Blake Nelson. It's a blast to watch! Henry Winkler and Nathan Davis didn't see enough. But fun when they are on the screen. Children at the camp shouldn't be better than this. (As I say, I like it!)
