I saw the description of the movie on TCM and let it work because I like both Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith. So I was very surprised to find that I liked this movie very much and found it. That it is quite special Of course, it's a serious day. But is a precious time to watch the delicate humor in life and way of life for almost forty years ago Now the only problem is trying to find it on DVD so that I can watch more often. I also received the attention of Smith and Ustinov as a lead actor and from Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and the appearance of a cameo by Robert Morley and Cesar Romero.
