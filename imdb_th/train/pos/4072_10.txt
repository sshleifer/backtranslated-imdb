The name Hayao Miyazaki became famous by Spitied Away. However, what is often overlooked is the director's first film effort. Who remembers Spielberg directing the duel or George Lucas directing THX 1138. I remember seeing a piece of this movie - of course, in the late 80s in the late 80s and what was stuck. Being with me is the beauty of design and animation. So when I found a copy in a well-known store for Â£ 9, I couldn't resist it, but bought it. The strange thing was the last 45 minutes of the movie didn't correspond to my memories. (Memory is like that joke) <br /> <br /> Watching this movie now with the knowledge gained from the artist's portfolio, like Jean 'Moebius' Giraud, some of the art. Is I can assume that the influence here only. <br /> <br /> When Pazu catches a falling girl (Sheeta), his adventures begin to really - the quest for Laputa - a reference to Jonathan Swift's overlooked part. Gulliver with a good reference to Jules Verne. It is a good basic movie with a bad chase, with the last part with a hero at Laputa. <br /> <br /> This is the strongest part in memory. My - 'Pastoral' on the ecological side Laputa's back to nature - many robots covered with moss beneath giant trees. This is my opinion. The highlight of the movie - the view of Laputa's surface compared to the underground motor vehicle. <br /> <br /> Although this is the polarity of this film - to show that even technology. Can't beat nature - the last robot that takes care of the garden and the animals. The ending of the Silent Running movie is almost the same. <br /> <br /> It's incredibly stylish. I won't say 'slippery' - beautiful and free. Venom and there are many details in the airship building and Design and appearance of everything. <br /> <br /> Myazaki is a true expert of this type of Japanese anime. Buy this movie and collect it.
