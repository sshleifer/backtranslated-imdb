It is a strange feeling to sit alone in a theater with parents and children. I feel that instead of being a movie ticket, I should have been a member of NAMBLA. <br /> <br /> From Thomas Rockwell's esteemed book How to Eat Worm Worm Fry started like a children's story: moving to New city New children, fifth grade students, Billy Forrester, used to be popular. But must start again Finding friends is not easy, especially when the only chance is Poindexter Adam or Erica, which is a giant 4 1/2 feet tall. <br /> <br /> The more complicated thing is that Joe the bully faces the freckles and His sleeveless shirt is awesome. He makes it hostile to children with Death Ring: Jack crackers that are rumored to kill you if you punch it. But not immediately Not the ring of death. Unleash the poison that killed you on the eighth level. <br /> <br /> Joe and his evil core welcome Billy by stealing a number of worms into his thermos. When discovering that Billy played it cold, swore that he had eaten worms all the time. Then he threw them to Joe's face. Ewww! To win them, Billy is reluctant to bet that he can eat 10 worms. Stir boil in hot sauce, squeeze and spread on a peanut butter sandwich. Each meal has been dubbed "Radioactive Slime Delight", which, in the end, children use their dreams to create small creatures. <br /> <br /> If you ever meet me You know That I laughed uncontrollably I felt like creeping in the toddler, wailing that "Dick's fool" hurt him, but Worm Worm was amazingly disgusting. Like the Farrelly Brothers movie, which ranks G, it is both miserable and delightful. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Bob Dolman is also a wise storyteller. In order to raise money, worms must be used at 19.00 hrs. In addition, Billy keeps the dark secrets: He has a special light-sensitive stomach. <br /> <br /> Dolman also has a view. enthusiastic He uses the insecurity of a child and tends to exaggerate the mundane problems. <br /> <br /> If you make this movie too much in the way that children do, you'll see that it's about war Independent and hateful fighters use the haired boys as hostages in a proxy war to learn valuable lessons in unity. International leaders can learn one or two stories about global peace keeping from Fried Worms. <br /> <br /> At the end of this movie, I feel comfortable when the two mothers behind me look. Each other in a mess and agree, "That's a great movie". Great. Now I don't have to register myself in a legitimate database.
