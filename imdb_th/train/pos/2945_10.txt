I watched this movie a couple of times in the 90s and almost split my side every time laughing. I love Eddie Murphy as an actor. But this stand-up is something else. He's very funny. Even though this group will find hilarious. It must look and even better if you have a man or a woman joining to drink. Michael Jackson's removal is like him. If you close your eyes, you believe he is singing. What he describes is true to life and you have to have serious humor if you think this is not a joke. My local video store is no longer storing this video. But I wanted to copy to show my husband and boy when they were old enough to appreciate humor. However, it is strongly recommended that you enjoy.
