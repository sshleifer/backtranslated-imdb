I sat with my children when we watched this movie. We all found it to be a very entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> When Billy goes to a new school, the fifth level bully begins a story with him and this is what leads to eating worms. > <br /> Bet and Billy has a lot of time to eat 10 worms or something else. From this point, the bully and his friends try to find a nasty way to cook, fry or bake the worm to try and make Billy sick so that he will lose the bet. <br /> <br /> Billy is still strong and Eat His methods became more and more popular from everyone, even to fellow bullies. <br /> <br /> I won't tell you whether he wins the bet or not ... You have to look to find out. Answer Would think that if you like a good family movie, you will like this movie. <br /> <br /> PS let me add that this movie is not only for children, I have every daughter and they like it very much.
