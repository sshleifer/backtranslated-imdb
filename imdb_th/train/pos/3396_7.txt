Very interesting. The big twist is not as big as they expected and it's very old. But it makes my brain work It made me think about a world that doesn't have vegetation or livestock and makes me appreciate the world that I live in a lot. Charlton Heston performed well as well as all the supporting characters and it was a very realistic movie that was surprising. It has no direction in time and settings, and many backgrounds require more explanation. But it is also a good movie and surprisingly smart The main fault I found was that I didn't want the film to end when I did. I wanted to see what happened next. <br /> <br /> 7/10
