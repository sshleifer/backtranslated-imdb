This is a movie for those who believe that cinema is the seventh art, not entertainment business. Lars von Trier creates the noir atmosphere of the war after Germany's war You are obsessed with your dreams and you will only let go at the end credits. The plot needs to come second. But it is also exciting that there are difficult issues that are just wonderful.
