Oh wow. I saw this film at the Irish International Film Fleadh in Manhattan on March 12, 2000. Both were in attendance and were ready for the next question. What is the movie GORGEOUS! Although located in Ireland amid the antagonism of Catholics and Protestants But the story can happen anywhere between two groups that hate each other. The horror of how people can act quickly when they get the opportunity to vent their hatred and anger is beautifully woven with a love story that moves with humor and fun. If this was not picked up in the United States, it would be the most unfortunate thing. <br /> <br /> For the stars and the sponsored players ... First rate they call Orla Brady Irish Meryl Streep I heard It was my opinion that she was better than Meryl Streep. They should call Meryl the American Orla Brady! And the solid and powerful portrayal of Liam Cunningham of a simple and private man that was sucked into that great political war. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie
