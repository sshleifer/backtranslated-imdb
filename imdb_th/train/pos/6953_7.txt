This is one of the movies that create samples better than full length documentaries. The concept was great and very different. Unique humor. I just felt that there was a chance of missing "punch" in this movie. Many lines and gags have been left for too long without a definite end and do not make me laugh. Wilson, Wilson, Farris & Thurman is great Up to turn her character into more screen time. 7 out of 10 For me, there are more DVDs for rent. In addition, I am looking for music videos that give a good feeling at the end of the credits. Something that has become a trademark of these romantic comedy movies. La la Something About Mary. This COULD is a much better movie with more music. It feels like being packed into a movie theater.
