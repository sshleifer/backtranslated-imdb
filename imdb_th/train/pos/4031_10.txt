I have been a Hindi movie since the age of 4, but in my life I have never watched movies that were moving and impacted, especially in Hindi movies. Over the years I stopped watching contemporary Hindi movies and returned to classics (Teesri Kasam, Mere Huzoor, Madhumati, Mother India, Sholay and others) but this movie changed everything. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. I found that not only But will only move But also found a good education for those who are the first Indian women to grow in America It helps me to understand my own family history, which is always an abstraction for me, but to "see" it to feel and understand. This movie helped me to see many things, especially when considering the current world events. I never thought that the movie would change the way I thought of it like this ... It was a great plot, a great performance and a flawless direction.
