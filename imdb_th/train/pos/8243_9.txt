In the 1950s, there was an outbreak of the Undead (caused by the 'Space-Dust') that had been mystified by the use of a special electronic collar. Tim had a young boy, Timmy, found his friend Fido (Billy Connelly). <br /> <br /> Fido quickly became a father instead of Timmy. True father could not show enough love for his son. (Or a hot wife running by (When he was forced to shoot his own father who tried to eat him!) Timmy ran into the annoying point. When his neck shirt roted in the blink of an eye and he attacked and killed the elderly neighbor When Fido's official route caused problems for the local bullies and his mother built a bond with their home's help, could Timmy be able to find his new friend? <br /> <br /> Fido, which brings freshness to Fido's new movie, is a comedy that provides thorough and compelling entertainment that should attract everyone with a small, distorted humor. Bringing Romero zombie-verse and moving to a small town in the 1950s of America is a genius and the result is one of the most original movies to handle all the 'reanimated Dead' themes that I have seen. > <Connelly's Fido is a zombie in a movie theater that is worthy of being included in the Undead Movie Hall of Fame, along with the Day Of The Dead's Bub and Return Of The Living Dead's Tarman; Not often I feel sympathetic to the walking dead. But the Big Yin performance is really good. In fact, I found myself rooted in a large blue pus bag! The rest of the actors gave an admirable performance, with K'Sun Ray (as Timmy) and Ms.Moss deserving of special mention. ?? Ray, because for a one-year-old, he is especially confident and Moss because she is so delicious <br /> <br /> This is a zombie movie, the third story that I watched this week. (Another movie is Planet Terror that is quite disappointing and Flight Of The Living Dead is fun) and surprised me. It's still the best Director Andrew Kerry gave fans of the genre a traditional treasure and a talent that will be viewed in the future. <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb
