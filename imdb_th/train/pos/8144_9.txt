When seeing both "scared of black hats" and "this is the spinal cord" I can honestly say that while similar, both movies must look real There are many times in "fear" that will cause you to have hysteria. It is not surprising that both movies have the following cult. "Fear" will be released on DVD soon. Rent it if you want. But the only way to fully enjoy this movie is to have it for yourself.
