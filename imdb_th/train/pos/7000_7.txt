When I first saw the name, I had already reduced the importance of this film - it doesn't clearly refer to the British currency, so it must be Shakespearian And about a pound of meat - get them or give them. Will Smith is a great actor, so the serial killer came out. It may be just about the men who gave them, so it must be wrong. I do things by myself by looking at it and knowing the story before I watch, because the beauty of the collection is part of the background of the main character that has been drip-fed to let the audience know him. Who is and Why do he do what he does? <br /> <br /> Guilt is very difficult to do because it feels uncomfortable and sad, which is not evidence of support when you hope to ride a roller coaster-you. Knew that it would be unpleasant I will not say that this movie is delighted with suicide. It presents the most extreme form of sacrifice - suffering. <br /> <br /> It's full of symbols everywhere, a sign that tells the story that the writing was thought thoroughly in detail. Excellent and driving at Various meanings and reflecting nature The most striking theme that struck me was that he was not only But gave the heart to the woman he loved both emotionally and metaphorically But still giving it to her body as the greatest gift he can do, intended to die, but his plan is prevented by falling in love - a complex second act Absolutely expert. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's very slow, but I'm not sure if it's better or not in a smaller time frame. I did not feel as much stress and chaos in his interior as I could. But maybe that was just me who destroyed it by myself first Although all of this is a film that is deeply and originally moving, which is a powerful and incredible tragedy that deserves the reward that will inevitably be earned.
