I've seen many great movies, but 'In Cold Blood' stands alone in the class by itself. It's great in every department. The fact that it has a few large stars to help push it to the top as you focus on their characters and stories rather than the name of the marquee Blake and Wilson turned to the protagonist of the killer. The fact that most movies are filmed in real locations where crime is occurring, even in the home, additional chills will increase. Black and white photography makes your mood darker and the photograph is beautiful. There are many movies that work out well. But if I can only vote one to the top of the list, it may be "In Cold Blood"
