After watching the movie last night, I was left with the feeling of despair that the organization had to try to deal with the problems in this film. The size of prostitution seems so big that it is difficult to see how it can be overcome without major changes in the government of Cambodia. <br /> <br /> However, when reviewing <br /> <br /> Although it is a movie that has sadness and uneasy relationships, this is a very interesting movie and I can say it fun. This film was well resolved for the work time and the performance of Thuy Nguyen was great. I still feel that Ron Livingston is very difficult to play. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to have more insight into why Patrick felt he had to help Holly. But sometimes the reason is as simple as him Explain the character of Chris Penn. I won't explain here - go to the movies. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie, thought-provoking with clear intent. I hope that it will be open enough to reach the right audience and receive additional support for the K-11 project.
