Just watching TV in the sky, missed the first half hour. I wonder if it's true or not, so look to the end. At the end, there was no conclusion about what would happen to everyone. It reminds me of speed. But at the end of the day I don't think it will be released at the cinema because we see the following error. The error we saw was that they removed the front hood and then there were two cars with police cars in front, trying to slow down when the bonnet returned. It put me on the edge of my seat, especially when I thought that the boy would hit the bridge and of course when the bridge was not reduced then it was like that I am afraid that I will shed tears, so it's not bad !!!!
