The old message says "If you think you have a problem, go to the hospital" that has been updated in the past year. "If you think you have a problem watching TV talk shows ... especially Jerry Springer!" This movie is one of the worst movies. It's great! That's why I gave seven correctly, but not good. It's a great way to waste 95 minutes, just like the daily talk show advertised as "One hour in your life, you will never get back!" All familiar themes are here ... Husband / girlfriend unfaithful, the most ferocious audience on television, women who blink Jerry and others. Watching Molly Hagan, who normally plays as a sweet character ("Seinfeld" and "Herman's Head"). Trailer - Garbage mother and Ja Pressly ("My name is Earl") while her daughter is not Equal value showing sexual favors for men The people they come in contact men (including the director of the team) has been presented as the quintessential lunkheads who deserve what they get. I don't want to spoil or reveal everything. But movies play like daily performances Here in Phoenix will be shown back for two hours every morning and after that, everything else seems to be pale. Again, I gave this movie seven stories ... It's good but not good. Jerry Springer takes only one hour in the least amount.
