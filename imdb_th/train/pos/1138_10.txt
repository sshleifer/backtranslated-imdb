When I was a child of 8 years old, I often watch movies and television that I shouldn't do, and this is one of them. <br /> <br /> It's one of my favorite movies, and it must be a movie. The most fun I've ever seen in my life. The performance is great. They don't create comedies like this anymore. (Funny movies and make you laugh without the need for excretion or some body fluids that cause vomiting as in the Judd Apatow movie starring non-actors like Seth Rogen, barf) <br /> <br / > This film is a classic movie that has actors that can perform and deserve all the awards.
