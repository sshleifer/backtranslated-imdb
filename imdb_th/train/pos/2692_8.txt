I really enjoyed watching this movie. It has a good direction by Bigas Luna, known already in Spain. And it is precisely in Spain that this film takes place in Catalu√±a to be more precise. <br /> <br /> Luna explores the story of obesity again. In this case, a boy is a milk woman. . There are some psychological concepts in this subject, such as complexes, the rejection that the eldest son feels with the birth of his brother. In this film is what led to the increase of a boy who suddenly saw all his mother's milk to a newly born son. So he started trying to find a breast that could feed him. He found that there were women recently and from this movie, <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of life in the story than the story by the male to capture the moment. Of course! And some symbols (This film deserves a serious analysis about almost everything that happens because it usually means something ...) The general scenery environment from the region includes the surreal behavior of characters, symbols and Nicola Piovani's unclear soundtrack leads us to another dimension, not in parallel with the real world for a time ... worthwhile to live in this world worth watching. Even though we may eventually get tired and awhile and get bored with excessive obesity, which may be beyond the scope ... <br /> <br> I like the protagonist's performance ... 8 / 10
