I really like The 60's (I'm waiting for "80s"). It's interesting to see a four-hour capsule that is unique for that era. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems of this film is imbalance Jersey This film is a family image. According to the promotion I saw for the NBC movie, this story is about two families struggling with problems in America in the 1960s. Now I may miss something. But I think we have learned more about the white family than the African American family. <br /> <br /> I think the 60 actually uses the song to describe the scene better than any conversation from Actor's mouth (Which is all very capable) This will appear at the end of the first part (About two hours) of the mini-series <br /> <br /> Very good movies!
