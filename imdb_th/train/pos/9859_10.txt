Ice Age is not only an animation of the year (In my eyes) but also the best animated movie I have ever seen And that is the rest of Sub Zero Heroes. <br /> <br /> The animation is great. Your heart really goes out to the characters in this movie. They have good conversations and are well developed. It's hard to tell which one is stealing pictures. <br /> <br /> I have experience traveling with laughter, tears and surprises. Nothing is forced or done. Emotions are genuine, especially in the second half. The last film that had a profound impact on me was Anastasia in 1997, the same as Fox Production and before that it was the land before time. Entertainment for all audiences, not just mockers. 10/10 <br /> <br />
