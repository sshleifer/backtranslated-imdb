I grew up with H.R. Pufnstuff and Jack Wild, who are very talented and now my daughter admires Jack Wild fans as well. This movie is what the movie should be: fun and fun. This film is not limited to children. Many conversations are directed to adults and the performances of Witchiepoo are something you shouldn't miss. The songs in this movie are suitable for Jack Wild and Mama Cass. And as a Jack Wild fan, I will not miss the opportunity to watch him dance or hear him sing. Knowing the difficult life that Jack has done now makes this movie even more wonderful, especially when he sings the song "If I Can". It makes me stop loving and admiring him to make a wonderful childhood memory. Great to me, which I am now forwarding to my children. Let everyone go to Living Island with friendship and fun! And preserve Jack Wild's memory by sending Pufnstuff to others
