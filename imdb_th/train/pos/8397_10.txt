This film received one of the ten votes I received! Thank you guys for making a movie that is worth watching. You show the world that you still can write, direct, create and show in black movies without having a negative attitude. The poem is also great, wearing a hat for poets and musicians. <br /> <br /> I watched it last night when I fell in love with my love again. I will add it to my movie collection today and recommend it to my friends and family. <br /> <br /> Please continue to produce quality, don't worry about quantity .... < br /> Thank you again and good wishes and blessings to you!
