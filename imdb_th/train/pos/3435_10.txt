This movie is an amazingly simple task. Fun from the beginning to the end. It's sad. But raised himself at the same time Performances from Miranda Otto (Oh, she deserves more recognition!) And George Del Hoya is almost beautiful and painful to watch because of the torture of two souls. The actors supporting the work of the Dead Letter Office are great in them as well as Alice's ex-boyfriend that I can't help but feel a little sorry. There is one scene that I can watch over and over again (and I have!) It's a shame that this kind of movie is not accepted, so it takes them to the public eye so that people can enjoy it more. I cried. I laughed and sighed. I would like to recommend this movie to everyone.
