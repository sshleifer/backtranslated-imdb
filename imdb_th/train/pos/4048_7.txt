Rohmer strayed from the typical image of a French middle class to tell the drama about the hardships of a noble woman during the French Revolution. The more interesting thing about "La Anglaise ..." (apart from the story itself) is the beauty that Rohmer received. The images that are digitally decorated make them look like Baroque images. At certain times, you can't really say that watching movies or pictures in the Louvre. Every shot is like an artwork. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> ---------------- <br /> <br /> -------------- - <br /> <br /> ------------ <br /> <br /> - ------------------
