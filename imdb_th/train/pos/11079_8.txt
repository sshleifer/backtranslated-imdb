I enjoy watching movies that make you think and not just enter answers to their audience. "Revolver" is one of these movies and even though many inspectors have identified it as difficult to follow with concentration. Slightly and with an open mind that I received for the first time. Indeed, it does not compare with other people's minds, such as "The Usual Suspects" or "Memento". /> <br /> Tickling one thing <br I liked about this movie was the beauty of it. Every scene, every corner of the camera seems to have been missed for a long time. If you see, you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> So, to summarize ... look with an open mind and you may enjoy it. If there isn't, nobody will say "Revolver" for everyone and that is my 2 cents.
