The jokes are clear, repetitive, and the characters are walking the characters - but I can't stop laughing at his highly entertaining movies. No matter how many times I see it, I still get kicked out of this game and I highly recommend it for those who love spiritual entertainment. It has many cited moments and the best jokes I have seen to this day. If you have a bad week and want to laugh at this rental while traveling home on Friday night to start a good weekend.
