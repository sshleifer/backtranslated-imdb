When I first saw this film on the cable, it immediately became one of my favorite movies. I am a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The film depicts the correct image of the South and the racist attitude. Most of the attitudes came from Soll, an old farm owner who used prisoners as labor. Soll was what caused the movement. His clown gave us insights in the way that the South came back. He will be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. His attitude towards the little boy who came to work for him and the prisoner was less. While he had a racist perspective, he grew up to trust some prisoners with all black skin. The two most trusted prisoners include Jackson (Melvin Winkler) and Ben (James Earl Jones). The dialogue between Ben and Seoul is the best chapter in the movie. They have the chemistry. Indeed, both James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler, but in the same great performance as Hass <br /> <br /> This movie is probably more famous. However, it is on DVD and worth the money. <br /> <br /> Rayvyn
