I just saw The Saint Strikes Back for the first time and found it quite good. This was the first time that George Sanders was a saint, which he replaced Louis Hayward. <br /> <br /> This time the Saints were sent to San Francisco to investigate. Shoot at the nightclub They help the daughter of the bandit. <br /> <br /> Working with Sanders on the show is Wendy Barry and Jonathan Hale. <br /> <br> Not bad with movies. Saint worthwhile to see. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 stars out of 5
