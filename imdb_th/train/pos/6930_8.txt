This is something new and exotic in the Western style, most of which is original because of the story that revolves around the 1873 Winchester rifle that is unique and superior and everyone who has been posed in one spot or another. One corner of the movie> <br /> Most of the movies are very entertaining to watch. But not without a true western as well The movie was made in the western style of the 40/50 movie style, so those who like this type should not be closed because of the rather strange location. <br /> <br /> Because the rifle is actually a main plot device. The film will help the story track many characters throughout the movie, which everyone is certainly connected to, and the story eventually makes the circle full. This movie is probably a rather messy story because the story often leaps from one dangerous event to another, with the characters involved all the time. It's quite amazing how they would put Wyatt Ear. But it wasn't really criticized at all I like movies and stories, it's original and movies seem to move from one event to another. It gives a little sense of adventure and entertainment. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that looks good too. I like the settings that this film uses and it seems quite amazing that this is actually the first western film of director Anthony Mann. Luckily, he will head west more later, which is often James Stewart star in the main line <br /> <br /> It's a very interesting option for choosing James Stewart as the main leader. He is one of the most polite and gentle-looking actors, so choosing him to be a strong marksman seems to be a strange thing, but Stuart believes surprisingly as a tough man and shows. Seeing that he has various abilities and abilities as an actor he is true. <br /> <br /> There are also other astounding actors in the movie that are not Frequently connected to this type Shelley Winter plays the lead actress and later the well-known actor Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis appear in a small role. <br /> < br /> True Westerners with lots of activities and entertainment. <br /> /> 8/10
