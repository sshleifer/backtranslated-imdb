I've seen Maslin Beach twice - both free TV in Brisbane. I will not go into saying that it is good, bad or otherwise good and truly comprehensive. <br /> <br /> I'll say it's Australian. Only in Australia, we will have a movie about relationships among people who spend the day like birthdays and to watch on free commercial television. <br /> <br /> I have friends from the US who are Surprised continuously with what we put on our free TV compared to her home country, sex and CIty and Huff are just examples. <br /> <br /> Although our government is trying to turn us into It's the 51st state of the United States. It's good to know that at least some things are still true Aussie.
