My scalp is still clever from the burning coal when I swear that I love this movie, bringing charcoal; I will walk across them as well to say again that I love "Bend it like Beckham." True, the confession has a lot. It's a weekly movie. The screenplay is on the numbers by coloring. The director's opinion shows that the beauty of this movie can be found among the white skin. <br /> <br /> The genius of this film is not in the eyes of Sidfield doctors: Clear things Construction model It is in both the surface and what is possessed under the deep layer. But not in the top layer of the soil that the inspector often seems to scratch Powerful, sometimes semi-clad female bodies not only show But kicking the shit out of football, doing better to make the strength and maneuverability of women better than Lara Croft or Zhang Ziyi. These things are real (except Keira Knightley) whose work should not look good and kick Butt later They are a unit that is beautiful in their movements and decisions. And in my book, the lead actor Parminder Nagra is one of the most beautiful creatures that has ever been on the screen ?? Not only because she can claim the use of "shining" adjectives, but because of her acting with intelligence, honesty and not a bookworm that is fully interesting, <br /> <br /> The result is a movie that Women enjoy As if they were making a deal with the devil As Chadha's "Bride and Injustice", a relationship among women who are sweltering with a chemical that can not penetrate into the stodgy, neat, sweet valley of high genre "close friends" or "sisters". To deny the flirting of this film with lesbians "Bend it like Beckham" There is an electric current that cannot be reduced to a different simple love / triangle homosexuality The correct nature of happiness is in the end a bit of mystery ?? And it is more charming for it. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, I said it was hilarious?
