This is a great episode, one of the best of both seasons. The horror is right for change, with stories that go in the direction that is above the average of the average MOH. If there is that A man's wife was burned to death in the car wreck that he was driving. His airbag didn't work. She was too burnt to remember. (Excellent makeup btw) and not given the opportunity to live without a full skin transplant But even in a coma, she still died. But was brought back with modern technology and when she died a moment, her ghost appeared as a vengeful spirit Of course, of course killing, and sometimes with blood-filled killings and the sexiest scenes. What are you asking for? You might ask? Not so much because this child has everything and a satirical ending that should be smiling for most viewers facing. I like the direction of Rob Schmidt (Wrong Turn) as well. He has a special ability in horror. A wonderful episode. This is exactly what I'm going to buy.
