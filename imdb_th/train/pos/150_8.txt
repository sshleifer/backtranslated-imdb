The latest film from Spanish director Agusti Villaronga is the study that children who experience violence and loneliness in their remote communities develop into young people with problems that require mental tools to deal with Mentally weak Regardless of these tools, it is a religion based on frantic levels, caring for others, or simply putting a picture of a man while engaging a male prostitute. Villaronga created a successful examination of these evil effects on teenagers Three people living in Spain under French The three witnesses expressed two annoying deaths or their friends before they were teenagers and later buried the emotions they felt with the weak remains until they met again at the hospital for Those TB patients <br /> The appearance of the text in the cinema often has a wealth of sight as you would expect from a Spanish writer and is a work reminiscent of the work of tea mates. Spain's Pedro Alberto Navarro Komodo themed on sexual desire, male homosexuals and homosexuality. The difference between the two directors is that Banyonga supports the supernatural sound that is created with horrific realism and against the use of Almodovar's statics. Youthful and violent minds and scenes that are disturbed by sexual nature I suggest watching this movie because there are elements that will remain with the audience for a long time after watching.
