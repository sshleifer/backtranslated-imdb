Since September of last year, I borrowed four to six movies each week from the Harold Washington library, which has an impressive DVD set (HWL is a circulating library: three-quarters of the movie comes out on time!). I am very excited to see David Lynch's short film yesterday. I know a little about the animated series. I chose Dumland. I came here to report that for David Lynch fans, watching the eight episodes spent a good half hour. <br /> <br /> The most amazing feature of these short pieces is the soundtrack. Each episode has its own rhythm. Respiratory system and digestive system make noise. Outrageous sounds emphasize the accent of stopping. 'Pause Physical violence affects the chirping of birds and the buzzing socket brushed along the edge. Many other elements fill the orchestra. The motion of the rough animation is always synced with the sound. But the soundtrack made me become Lynch's main interest in creating and publishing this work. In any way, these eight shorts are a unique Lynchian rhythm. <br /> <br /> That said the strange, ugly, profound, dumb and funny situation as hell. And there is enough space in them to ponder how human beings are ridiculous I can't say that I will see the collection again. But for those who like the movement that is the Inland Empire Dumbland set is equal to half an hour of your time
