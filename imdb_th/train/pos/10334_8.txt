Never watched this movie until recently in TCM and found this story about Poland and a small town that had to suffer with Nazi occupation in local cities as well as other European cities such as Norway. The first place ended and people in this city still suffer from lost soldiers and injuries that the war had always created. Alexander Knox, (Wilhelm Gimm) "Gorky Park" came back from Make a war with the missing leg and be a former school teacher in the city. He was raised by the Germans and was not happy with the Polish people and they did not accept him as well. As the Hitler party began to gain power, Wilhelm Grimm wanted to be a Nazi to return and punish this small Polish city for treating him, which is in his mind. Marsha Hunt, ( Marja Pacierkowski), "Chloe's Prayer", played a prominent role as a woman who lost her husband and had a romantic involvement with the Whilhelm. Gimm has many events and true truths about how Nazi destroyed. Cor The kitchen and living of the people, all of them. The car is shown in this picture with the Jews heading to the Nazi fuel storage room. If you haven't seen this movie and like this, give it to you. This movie landed very much for the 1944 movie and the stories you won't forget too soon.
