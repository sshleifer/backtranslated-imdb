I found this movie hilarious. Disguised in other popular movies at that time is the most fun movie I've ever seen in this type of film. Give it a try. If you see a movie that this film is funny and you get humor, you should enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> I (and others who watch movies with me) feel the most fun part of the movie. (This is not a spoiler, because I will not tell you what actually happened). It is a scene with "waxing things" from the MIB when they discover the device for the first time and don't know what it is doing .. And then again in the movie ... you will understand when you get there. <br /> <br /> My complaints about the movie Ie I never found it on a DVD to buy a copy
