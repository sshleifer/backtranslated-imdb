I've watched this movie only about 25 years ago, and to this day I've always told people that it's probably the best movie I've ever seen. Considering that there was no verbal dialogue and only a dialogue that thought that I found the film to be indulging and I found myself holding my breath to make a sound I would like to recommend this movie very much. I hope it will be available on DVD.
