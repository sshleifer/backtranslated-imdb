My girlfriend and I both enjoyed this movie a lot. The audience was purged from the modern life in old Japan, while at the same time being exposed to a very current form. The characters are realistic and detailed. It has an unpredictable ending and a story that is very refreshing. The story is made from a mini plot in the life of a geisha living together in a poor urban area. I would like to recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in love or real life in old Japan. <br /> <br />
