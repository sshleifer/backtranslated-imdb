You can survive the Christmas season. I think the version of the TV is slightly modified. I like Ben Afleck. He plays the role of Drew Johnson, who is less mature than a family that is willing to pay a stranger completely. Reno Hara, as a parent and Christina Applegate, is Lisa Valco, daughter of Drew, isolated during the holidays because he doesn't have his own family. So he rented a family in the suburbs of Chica. At the price of one million dollars, Bill Macy, which I remember best when played Arthur's husband, Maude Arthur, was hired to play as Duda, a grandfather. When all the situations fail, the truth may Painful, the Valcos household is breaking down from the situation. Drew, Drew's rich girlfriend and her parents have visited surprisingly. You can't buy what you want! The performances and the writing are normal. But the leading actor pulled it to the final scene
