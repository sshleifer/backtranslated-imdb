Citizen X tells the story of Andrei Chikatilo, The Ripper of Rostov, which killed 52 people in 8 years, mostly women and children. It shows how the investigation was thwarted by the Soviet bureaucracy, how difficult it was to investigate the crime. It worked so well that nobody touched it. In the beginning, it may be a bit slow. But actually you will grab you as the story unfolds I can say that next to "The Lamb's Silence" This is the best movie about the serial killer I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's very hard to say which actor's performance is dominant in others This film, Stephen Rea, is great as a forensic expert who specializes in investigations. Donald Sutherland's performance was another leader and was the only one in the Russian government who was willing to help him. And what to say about Jeffrey Dumann playing the serial killer? Dungmann creates a character that inspires empathy, empathy, and hatred. Yes, he is a monster. But he was a sad, oppressed and mocked man by his wife, his boss, his co-workers ... He was tortured, embarrassed and vile For everyone interested in the well-built docu drama, which actors are still more important than special techniques It deserves at least 9/10, probably more if you ask me.
