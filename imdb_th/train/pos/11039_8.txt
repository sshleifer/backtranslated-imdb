This is what I call a good horror. With the mystery / supernatural, this great cheap French movie has received attention from the first scene. This proves that you do not need to have barbaric FX or many movies to create powerful horror movies. <br /> <br /> The circus story will have 4 friends in jail. When the movie creates tension for the final scene of the drama Most of the actions we see through Carrere's eyes, who have just been in prison and have become familiar with 3 other inmates. <br /> <br /> I won't say much because this movie deserves Will see more widely There is a slight flaw: FX is not that good. But they are used effectively The plot allows the mystery to open and things become confused at the end, but Malefique redeemed himself when it ended. <br /> <br /> I think he's a very good movie. 8 / 10
