I really took the time to admire the John Carpenter's Halloween. As a child, I remembered that I enjoyed the sequel, especially The Return of Michael Myers, which I still think is the best part of Halloween. But I think the first one is too slow and takes too much time to reach that point. I watched it a couple of times recently and I know I'm wrong now. Today I truly understand this movie. Its meaning is the whole feeling of this horror masterpiece. It's not about blood and blood. It's not about empty chicks and jokes. It's about the worst night in Laurie Strode's short life. It's about the night that his crazy brother returns home to do what he started 15 years ago. This movie is probably scary and I Thought that it was very successful It is one of the first slasher movies which is a horror sub-genre that I always loved. Halloween has a dark atmosphere, melodious songs and talented young actors like Jamie Lee Curtis in her first role. Do I want to talk again? Anyone who has never seen a horror fan should do their homework now. Highly recommended!
