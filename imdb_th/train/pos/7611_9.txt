"I looked into this island and what I saw was beautiful." Announced one of the main characters in the award-winning ABC television program "Lost". From an unknown plane crash in the island But will be a "lost" act that follows a large group of characters that come into conflict with each other and ultimately when they struggle with a new lifestyle and mutual dependence The situation is more complicated when it is clear that this is not an ordinary island either - and they may not be alone. <br /> <br /> My first fear after hearing the concept of this series is to New lack Stories that they can tell us after a period of time But this proved to be unfounded The lecture progresses naturally, conversations are witty, memorable characters, and excellent execution. This island is a character all by itself and in order to understand this opinion, you will have to watch the series on your own, which will show only its originality and greatness. <br /> <br /> At the moment At this writing The criticism has only the first two seasons that are aired and filled with strong episodes. My only criticism is that the second season seems to be halfway down. But fortunately, I came back to have an admirable shape at the end. <br /> <br /> If I can introduce one TV drama Now it will be like this for sure. If you like thrills, adventures, stories with characters, characters and teams that are very strong, beautiful places and islands that look more spiritual than nature, "lost" is right for you. Just make sure you start at the beginning.
