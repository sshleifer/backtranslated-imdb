When Sabrina came into our screen for the first time, I was about 12 years old, so I spent time as a teenager watching all sorts of young witches with strange signs. <br /> <br /> It's one of the My favorites are always sitcoms, 'Bewitched', sixties, but this time the characters look more cool. I always like Sabrina because she's smart. She is also friendly and easy to make her enjoy watching. The characters at the beginning were great. Harvey, Jenny, Libby, the testers, Salem and Mr. Pool (Private extremism, the shame he had left earlier) Hilda and Zelda, her aunt, began to agree. But it turned out to be annoying. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kraft, too, when he approached Saab's secret discovery What I love about the first three series is the original idea, the discovery of family secrets and learning new spells. But when it continues, it can be more predictable. There are many characters coming in and out, such as Valerie, Dreama and Brad, and then they decide to do Sabrina at the college which destroys it for me. <br /> <br /> Sabrina starts to absorb herself at college. No books, no spells, no aunt lives with her and Roxie, Miles and Morgan are annoying. <br /> <br /> The last series is boring and I watch what happens at the end. The absence of Hilda and Zelda seems to be a mistake, and Miles is gone. The final episode made me feel much better (spoiler) after Sabrina ended with Harvey on her wedding day to stun Aaron, Aaron. Great! Overall, it's a great program if you forget the last two or three series that reminds me of many magical teen programs.
