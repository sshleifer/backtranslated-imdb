I don't see this movie in the cinema. I confess to prejudice against Vinnie Barbarino, who is John Travolta, to create a movie. I remember the Oscar broadcast that year, with Travolta looking very sad when he didn't win. When did he dare with the "real" actors in the run? I'm sorry John, you should win. After watching this movie many years ago, I fell in love with movies, both Bud, Sister, Uncle Bob, Wes, doing everything miraculously. I also confess that I will not pass when I surf channels. I have to stop and watch Over the years, I learned to do most conversations, dancing with my thumb on my waist. The only disappointing thing for me was directing the soundtrack from Urban Cowboy. "Looking for love" was the movie's set, but Urban Cowboy was made full of classics that DIDN didn't make it into music. It should be a duo CD ........
