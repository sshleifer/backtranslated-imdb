No garbage - nowhere near waste. Not genuine or That is the last thing that can be said to be "2.4 Kids". Amazing? not sure! Although it is an unusual BBC series, but it is funny, hilarious and witty. I like Belinda Lang and John Pickard very much, which I believe preformed amazingly. And other actors are like that ... a relatively young age I hope they will make this kind of comedy more (And show them here in Israel) thank you very much!
