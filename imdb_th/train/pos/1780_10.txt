My mother and I are traveling home from traveling to the northeast. (Most of Massachusetts) when we decided to take a break to attend a film festival in Boston. Now I don't know much about movies, so I think this may be a little education. The first movie we saw was the movie, THE ROMEO DIVISION. Now I don't know about you. But I think it's great! I come from Texas and where I came from, we don't see too much animation. This is a surprise. My mother insisted that it was too severe. But said that I didn't know much about what she said But this is a great picture I was shocked by the excellent fighting sequence. I am also a big fan when good people win, so I'm excited when Romeo women kill all the bad guys. This is the true meaning. I'm not sure how to launch the video. But if you have a chance, you should try I think you will be amazed at the clever words, but it's quite harsh and has many swearing words, so you may not want your child to see it. It is more than for adults.
