Horror movies with the least budget easily, forever I saw this movie for the first time when I was about nine years old and I must say that it scared me of hell. I am now growing up But I saw this movie for what it was ... intelligent work Everyone, or at least everyone who has a taste, has dreamed of seeing a snowman going to kill people even if they don't accept it. I have found something truly scary about the snowman, so naturally for a horror junkie like myself, this movie is a dream come true. Some people say that this movie is stupid or ridiculous ... it's a movie about a snowman, a serial killer. What do you expect? Everyone who graded this movie was too low to sit and laugh laughing about cheap torpedoes and blood. I love this movie for what it is funny and until the film industry will rise up and make a horror horror movie about a killer snowman. (Which seems to be impossible, unfortunately) I will keep this awesome indie movie close to my heart.
