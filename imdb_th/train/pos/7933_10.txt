A good time working with Quiroz Brothers and all the actors in this project as "Guy on the Bench". I was surprised that they succeeded in capturing all the identifiable characteristics of the horror movie "B". That truly hopefully I will have the opportunity to work with the Pumpkin Patch Pictures team again in the future. I moved to Detroit after it was completed and has been accepted in public many times since its launch. On one occasion, actually in a video store and that girl was near to being unconscious. It's quite funny and that was the time when my first real sign was signed when I signed her receipt. One day I asked the girl at Blockbuster whether this movie was rented often or not, and she confirmed by searching on the computer. While there is more renting than Ring2, which is a new model at that time ... the title attracts immediate attention in the market in more cities. She also noticed many times that the movie was not returned from the customer, causing me to believe that this movie is just a good person, do not want to return .... Be careful ZoMbIeS when in the skirt because they will ya! Jaysun Barr (Guy on the Bench-2005)
