My family and I have watched this movie frequently over the years. It's clean, pure, heartbroken and heartwarming. Demonstrating the sympathy between the two families in two thousand miles apart, and with the most strange coincidence, it was almost as if the hand of God had to intervene. Desi, a frightening little girl doing A wonderful duty to show her role, and for me, she is the Priam choice for the introduction. The downside of this sweet story of man. Children of all ages will tear away from watching it and have fun and will bring a family that looks with a smile and a good feeling.
