Rupert Friend opened the show as Prince Albert, which raised the "The Young Victoria" to an unexpected level. He was fantastic, as we know that Queen Victoria was in the dark. Midnight and depression after the death of Prince Albert and looking into the eyes of friends I understand This film does not lead us to his death. But it was an event that might have caused him to lose his life Act of love I believe it or I should say that he I believe in what he feels is true. Nothing or anyone approaching the subtlety and depth of the character of the friend Emily Blunt is good, but I don't believe for a moment. She is Victoria. There is no real sense of timing. It may not be her fault. But her prince deserves the crown
