Okay, I know that this is not a good image of India. But the overall theme of the movie is not Indian. It is Shakti, the power of the warlords and the power of the mother. The relationship between Nandini and her husband and son swallow you in warmth. If so, things are very wrong. The interaction between Nandini and her father-in-law - the power of their unusual relationship - and the life that changed by it is the strength of this movie. Shah Rukh Khan's performance seems to be just a hijack compared to The despair of Karisma Kapoor is easy to be caught up in love, violence and redemption in this movie and finds himself sighing with relief and sadness at the point. Maximum The soundtrack is strong, reliable and well done.
