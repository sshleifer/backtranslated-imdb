This is one of my favorite sports movies. Dennis Quaid is moving and persuading the man to give up his dream of being a baseball pitcher when his arms give up. As a high school coach, he challenged his players to win the division championship by telling them that he would try baseball if they do, they win (partly because of the practice of everything they do. With a coach who can throw 90 miles per hour) and he keeps negotiating - and signing! <br /> <br /> If you've tried something new and gruesome as an adult, Jim Morris's story will resonate with you. It's moving and inspiring, and human relationships are real. <br /> <br /> Inspiration is not the only reason I rent this car. Dennis Quaid is seriously serious at this time, and a baseball movie with a good looking man changing diapers is my idea of ​​heaven. Ladies, if you feel the way I do, look here.
