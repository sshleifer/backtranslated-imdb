I have read many comments on this website which reviews The Blob as a wonderful story. This film has been punished for weak performances and weak special effects. What you expect from a group of people who have only experience in producing a low budget Christian Valley pants. Let me tell too many important critics that this movie has never been serious about the whole thing. The truth should be seen from the mismatched music along with the silly lyrics played during the launch. For what it should be, this movie is excellent. I have seen some of the recent ultra-low budget efforts. The Blair Witch project is one of them that has no entertainment value or clever idea behind their plot. BWP is a pure stool on the way back. Together, Blob has a good idea, has a good script and thoroughly entertaining. The scene in which the old man crossed the meteorite and emerged as a truly eerie and terrifying mass of sticks. The scene in the doctor's office with a slow-moving Blob under the blanket on Gurney while it eats the old man is a horror masterpiece in the cinema. The bottom line is that I love this movie. I challenge everyone there to get $ 120,000.00 more, increase the value of the dollar today and make movies anywhere close to entertainment and or as successful as Blob. It can't be done. Time! <br /> <br /> Thank you for taking the time to read this review.
