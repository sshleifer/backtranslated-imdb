This is a very good thing for TV movies. It shows the problems in the suburbs around the 1970s and the sort of neighbors certainly don't want to have a cycle. The worst and worst part of this movie is when a punk teen kills a family dog. Teens do everything to create annoyance and annoy this poor family. But the boys! In retaliation after lack of help from the police, that is He stood up for them and protected his home and family. A very good actor .. I might add <br /> <br /> I watched this thing on TV when I was like 8 or 9. I never saw it again on TV and wanted Is absolutely good! It is a type of movie that can be caught on a night on a weekday and can not stop watching or a movie on weekends. Is the type that they no longer show. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing!
