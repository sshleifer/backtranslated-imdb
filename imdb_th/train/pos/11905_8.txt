William Castle has a reputation for being a formidable fan as a director of Class B in the 1950s and 60s. His tricks, cost reduction techniques and his unique vision are legendary. Not surprisingly, someone (Jeffrey Schwarz, who made many documentaries) will eventually spend the time devoting a documentary to his greatness: "Spine Tingler: The William Castle Story" <br /> <br /> I have A general understanding of who Castle was and had seen his films some years ago I don't know anything about his personal life, his goals and ambitions. This movie makes humans really flesh and makes me appreciate the dedication that he has for craftsmanship, filmmaking, and participation in horror genres. This film shows that Castle is Alfred Hitchcock's rival, which Hitch is a highly respected artist, while Castle is a cheerful barker who has earned a religious reputation. But not respect He is an icon for every second level director, which is no wonder that John Waters stands out here. (Joe Dante and Stewart Gordon also play an important role as well) <br /> <br /> His tricks are what drives his reputation and the documentary takes a lot of pain in explaining them. Important for those who are too young to remember the 3-D basics of "13 Ghosts" (see separate reviews). The buzzer in the seat for "The Tingler" (see separate reviews). Guaranteed refund for "Homicidal". ... watching these movies outside the theater We can judge them for their content. (Which I personally still enjoy), but we can't fully appreciate what the audience feels. <br /> <br /> The focus of this film is when Castle starts from the cult director. After purchasing the right to "Rosemary Baby". He is in a special place for negotiating the film release. Hoping to receive orders, he was excluded from the builders to make way for the new Roman Polanski director While disappointed for the first time, this proved to be one of the best opportunities in his life - a movie that was hugely successful and a job he was good at. Who can better control Polanski's bag, a wild artist better than an expensive castle? This is his great achievement. But sadly, this film connects Polanski over the castle. <br /> <br /> The rest of his year was played out and we received personal reflection from his daughter and granddaughter. Everyone on the board seems to have nothing but praise for men. Somewhere between one or two of his way upset But you will never know how to come from this movie And I found that - this is a celebration of Bill Castle's life, not "E! True Hollywood Story". Fans of the genre will do well to receive a copy of this work. <br /> <br /> I personally recommend to Collect William Castle, not only this But there are still eight movies of Castle. special feature Even this documentary comes with a narration, so you can hear that Schwarz was personally affected by the castle and gave the castle's daughter Terry a reflection of her experiences with various movies and remakes. It's almost a whole new movie.
