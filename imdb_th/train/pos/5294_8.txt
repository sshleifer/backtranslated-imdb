"Pecker" proves that Waters has no intention of changing his tastes of old age. There are many things that have changed since Waters began making movies in the 1960s. But 40 years later, he still does what he wants to do. Over the years, the movie budget of Waters has increased dramatically. This is one of his latest productions. But I was surprised to see that Waters still has a "trailer park". Edward Furlong plays Pecker, a boy who is passionate about photography. He lives happily in Baltimore with his friends and family. But the glans attract the attention of New York art agents (Lili Taylor, who has always watched) and his life has changed from the worst Again, the water makes fun of art, fame and the opposite sex. It's not one of his best movies. But there are some big belly laughs here ("Memama" has the best line in the movie!) It's clever and funny all the time and there is a "strange" feeling that I have loved in Warters movies.
