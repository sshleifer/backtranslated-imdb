This movie is witty, full of looks and tangible. And now you can often see Jean Harlow (or any actress in this era) making another woman punch fast in the jaw (twice). <br /> <br /> After Harlow's ruby Was sent to reformers after mixing with Edward Hall of Gables (He was smiling But cute, smiling, crooked) her situation became more complicated when she discovered that She is pregnant and she is confident that this rake has abandoned her. But in fact, her love made him reform, and he came to meet her, despite the fact that he was arrested and from the ministry's help. <br /> <br /> The wonderful relationship Harlow shared with the prisoners. Her story is second to her electric chemistry and Gables, who is her most important leader. Her cynical character is perfectly matched for Gibe's gentle speech. I don't like it. <br /> <br /> "You know, you're not a bad person if you're not the next person. "Ruby said badly to her rival Gypsy. "If you will approach me, I will have to open a new window!" <br /> <br /> No value !!!
