Many reviews on this page mention that this movie is a bit dark for children that depend on children. This is not a movie for children 2-6 years old. It focuses on 8 years and older crowds. I saw this movie when I was 10 years old. I like it very much. At a time when most animated movies are too young for my tastes This film deals with more serious problems, so there is little emotional impact. In the characters, this movie can die and be sent to HELL! This gives a slightly more emotional weight to the scenes in which the characters are risking their lives. Good people are not always sweet and perfect. (Like other cartoons) They have "real" motives such as revenge and greed. But with compassion and friendship Shows that things are not always black and white. <br /> <br /> Great movie
