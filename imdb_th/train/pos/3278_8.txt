This is a great psychological drama written and performed well. Not really a horror flick, so those looking for something like The Ring or The Grudge will be disappointed. The thing that really surprised me about this movie is the intelligence and attention to detail in the story and the efforts to harmonize within. I also appreciate the absence of Dr. Phil Psychobabble or New Age revisionism, the filmmaker recently told the story, told the story well and let the audience think about it. The scattered dreams reminded the wonderful and powerful Wyeth image. <br /> <br /> A good example of how to make a good movie on a small budget without having a big studio. Directed a big name, a clever twist plot.
