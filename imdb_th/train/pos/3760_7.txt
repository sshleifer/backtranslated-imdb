May not receive awards for educational institutions and is acceptable. It's great. But it's so fun! Nothing makes me smile like Bill and Ted. Lovely, optimistic and hilarious. Bill and Ted are a great way to relax. <br /> <br /> Even though I like great adventures Death is a very funny thing and Bill and Ted is more loved. People are sad about me about loving this movie. But only really pretentious moviegoers say that it is not entertainment at all If you like this, you may be a Wayne World fan. Dude Where's My Car and Dumb and Dumber accept it even though they are foolish. But makes you smile and flip your pendant box So watch them just to kick and giggle !!
