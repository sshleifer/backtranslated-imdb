For beginners, I don't know about this program for a year or more because of the internet. I've never seen it on TV before in my country and many people don't know about this program. It's a shame because this is the original and smartest animation I've seen for many years. <br /> <br /> I don't give out 10 points, but this is the only item that deserves 10 points. Although at first it may seem like a typical cartoon But please remember that this is not a show for children. When the complete story unfolds, you will realize that this is a really profound story with a spiritual message. This part of the spirit story is based on a spirit animal, an ancient Indian belief that has been preserved for many years. This makes the show more traditional that you can't find often on the show. <br /> <br /> The overall design is very different. Sometimes it looks a little like laying eggs in terms of designs that are grueling, and sometimes using more cartoon methods. I believe David Feiss, who created and directed Cow and Chicken, is lively in the segments of List with Performances that occur in many matters, such as reality, suicide, soul, life, then this is something you shouldn't miss. When you start watching, you may look to the end. One little fact may be that acting uses less material from cartoons. But not too annoying The only question remains where is the DVD!
