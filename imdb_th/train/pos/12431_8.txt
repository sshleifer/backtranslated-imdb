Okay, actually, I saw an example of this movie and thought to myself what was the producer thinking? Hutton, Jolie and DUCHOVNY, the only famous actor, can compete with the natural power of Jolie on the screen? But surprisingly, both have chemical properties that demonstrate serious concern without having to kiss Even David's humor is well matched with Jolie's spark and fire. For Hutton, he played a lot of psychopaths compared to David's life-threatening situation. Overall, I was very impressed with the writing and character development. I gave 8 stars.
