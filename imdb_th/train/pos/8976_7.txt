Star Lift is an interesting and interesting song for all the musical actors that the studio is currently selling during World War II. When you have stars such as Gary Cooper, James Cagney, Doris Day, Gordon MacRae and Randolph Scott etc. in movies and with people like Gershwin Brothers, Cole Porter, Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn, it's easy to shoot. And the plot is not on the path. <br /> <br /> The things that are related to the two air forces are Dick Wesson and Ron Hagerthy. Try to find the Warner Brothers starlet Janice Rule, which uses a true mechanism. Both came from Youngstown, Ohio and Hagerthy's father was Rule's dentist, including half of the city. This project works well as Louella Parsons soon brings them into the list in her column. Yes, Louella is also in the movie. She must like Warner Brothers or Jack Warner to respond to her more than any other studio leader because she still uses this studio to publish her Hollywood Hotel radio that day. <Br <br /> <br /> Yet Ruth Roman's real-life endeavor was played by himself, for her studios and others to appear in the air base for soldiers and women who went to Korea. Some of the names that I talk about and others sing and perform on shows at the Travis Air Force Base, where the film was filmed a lot. <br /> <br /> One special number was shot for the talents of Phil. Harris sings / tells the story of Ballad Look Out Stranger, I'm A Texas Ranger. Helped and helped by Virginia Gibson, Frank Lovejoy and Gary Cooper. Yes, Cooper looks like he has a lot of time to joke pictures of He <br /> <br /> This is The oldest thing when you say they don't make them like this anymore Because you do not have a studio system that has all these capabilities under the contract That is one thing about the death of the old studio system that we can mourn.
