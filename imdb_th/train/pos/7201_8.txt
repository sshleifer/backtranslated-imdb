A very good drama movie about a playwright trying to think that his head is above the water after all the ideas Can't say much about this movie without telling the story. I can say that a little bit is the way it looks like you are watching an image. Everyone has their own agenda. A little surprise at the end - after all the other surprises are well written with good performances by everyone.
