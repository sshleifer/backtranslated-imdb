When I was told of this film, I thought it would flick another chick. I was wrong. This film sent a powerful message about judging others. I am very impressed Everyone I met, I introduced this movie. No one came back and said it was bad. Busy did a very good job with her role in this film. I don't know much about her acting career. But wow, they made her pull out from the end of this film. Excellent. <br /> <br /> At first it was quite slow. But after she went to the hospital .... wow the movie picked up again I do not know why this movie was not mentioned in the film world. My desire is to make this film to be released again and more ads ... because it will send a powerful message in just half an hour.
