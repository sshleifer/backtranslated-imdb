Last night I was happy to watch this beautiful movie by adding great questions and answers to the director after watching. I wonder if the first reviewer never lost a parent or someone who was very close to them in death. I have a lot of losses and this movie speaks to me. One of the main issues is how we do not deal with questions / problems / stories with the people we love until it's too late. They are incompetent or die before they happen Talk to your loved ones, listen and record stories. Tell your loved ones to fix differences. I love the message without errors. I love the description of the director of the relationship of two daughters - as one of the six siblings. His history as a cinematographer came with loud and clear sound - a beautiful movie! The casting is outstanding - movies that should not be missed!
