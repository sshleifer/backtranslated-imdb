I have to agree with most other posts. Is it funny? Drama? For me, it leaned a little amusing. I should be a great movie without comedy and it was horribly planned. Jamie runs into Julio and what is his name? In New York, how many times have you run into someone you know in downtown Cleveland? Robert Pastorelli will dig Yankee Stadium to hide gold Again funny or drama? But it still provides entertainment, especially on Sunday morning I enjoy Kimberly Elise's performance. She is a beautiful actress and seems to take her skill seriously. She is a young actress who is about to work.
