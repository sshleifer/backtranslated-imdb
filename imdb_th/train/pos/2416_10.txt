Yes, it's an idiotic movie, so if you're looking for an Oscar show, forget about it ...... but if you like John Kandy's humor, you have to watch it. We lost John Candy before he created a great comedy brand and he did better in a single movie: planes, trains and cars. (With Steve Martin) The great support by Eugene Levy may be his best performance as Sal DiPasquale, the hottest performance by Richard Libertini, Alley Mills & Pat Hingle. The film is vague and does not print if you are a fan of John Candy or Eugene Levi.
