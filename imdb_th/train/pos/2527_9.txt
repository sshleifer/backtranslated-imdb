This is what I call "pre sci fi; sci fi" movies. It's not better than Lugosi / Karloff in the incredibly good "mood" movie. These two true artists are as good as possible. The story <br /> <br /> Carlos works brilliantly as a scientist who sees himself in vain pride. And scientific competition I caught up with the idea of ​​watching a man while he drowned in the three concepts mentioned earlier. I felt sad and at the same time fascinated with the two stars as they did it. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of animation that asks to be rebuilt. This time brought Harrison Ford into Carl's division and possibly Kebuffer Sutherland in the role of Bela Lagos. It may be possible to do it almost as well. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best things that Hollywood EVER created, as I said. No way.
