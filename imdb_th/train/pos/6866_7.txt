************** Possible spoiler ********** There is only one reason I have watched this movie and that is because I have Very interested in Richard Belzer (I don't know much about humor). There are some funny parts like Barbie and Ken Spook and the dealers and the presidential skit. Mind you sometimes it's obscene (Brave, I say rough) is sometimes funny But it might be better It may be that if they spend more time with humor and spend less time removing women clothes Some games make you want to gag and flatter others. Play makes you laugh and think wrong enough. Sadly, this movie is out of date. If you are very passionate about Richard Belzer (worth it), it's worth it to try and watch the chevy chase.
