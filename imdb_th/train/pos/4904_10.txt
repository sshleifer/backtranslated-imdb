There is charm in every aspect. This film is perfect if you are in the mood to feel good. If you love jazz, it must be viewed. If you enjoy seeing the cute characters that make you smile, you can bring tears to you and swing like no tomorrow. This movie is for you. If you are looking for art that is deep, intensive and hard to dissect and analyze, maybe you are stuck with something by Darren Aronofsky (in other words - DJjohn's reviewer lighter, you don't know if it's a good time when You see!) My only complaint is that the movie is too short. I guess I will have to watch many times to get my fill.
