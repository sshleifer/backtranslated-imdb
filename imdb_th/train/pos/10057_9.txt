Last night I went to bed with my girlfriend and while she was brushing my teeth, I turned the slot until I found the Chinese movie. This story is called the King of the Mask. At first I thought it would be a kung fu movie, so I started watching it and it immediately caught me and I had to finish it. <br /> <br /> The little girl in this movie is adorble. Excellent because it is a little boy Perhaps the truth is in Chinese, so English is dubbed to make me difficult to tell ... but she seems to be the perfect character. I felt very bad for her as she tried to please her. "The boss" But everything was rotten. Haha. Although she brought her nephew again But he was able to pass on his art ... It turns out that the child was kidnapped, so he was arrested and lived for 5 days. Haha ... No matter what she touched in trying to act well. With her grandfather just turning back the lights. <br /> <br /> Finally he saw how much love was in her. Which is a delightful story after an accident in the movie <br /> <br /> Of course, it's a gem and is completely original. <br /> <br /> Scott
