This is a valid adaptation. But not as good as the TV version The actors are generally okay, but I found Jeremy Northam quite wet like Mr Knightley, especially when compared to Mark Strong in the TV version of Gwyneth Paltrow. It's normal and her English accent is quite good. But again, I like Kate Beckinsale's Emma. There is great support from Toni Collette, Juliet Stephenson and Sophy Thompson. <br /> <br /> Scripts are often played too much for laughs. Books are funny. But with very funny gags And Frank Churchill's subplot is almost completely gone. <br /> <br /> My biggest criticism is the scenery. Far too lush England has never been like this before. Looks like a box of chocolates, but only Americans can make it like this. <br /> <br /> Despite these criticisms But I like this movie a lot.
