"Kalifornia" is a good odyssey of fear and fear, which tells the two lovers who drive across the country to California to share gas bills: a pair of losers (Lewis & Pitt) and two artists. People (Duchovny & Forbes) Pitt "Nail" his character, which is the focus of this predictable thriller. A good look for those who are flix psychoanalysts.
