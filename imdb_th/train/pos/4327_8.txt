I like this presentation - I have read the Bleak House and I know it is very difficult to present the entire book as it should be and even others like Little Dorrit - I have to admit that they perform well. So much I love Diana Rigg and I will see Lady Dedlock's pain, even through the arrogance of the aristocracy that is expected. I'm sorry, I think you are the best Lady Dedlock ... I'm not sure who can make Jarndyce better, but I'm okay with Elliott. It's not easy to present these long Dickens books - Oliver Twist is easier - this is a long time and if you ignore all legal situations, it can be boring or boring. I think this presentation is fun enough to not be boring. I fell in love with Small Speed ​​- it's fun. There are always children - Joe will destroy your heart here ... I think we should be given the opportunity to judge ourselves. <br /> <br /> I Having said that, I love acting. Maybe if I read the book again, like I did after watching a movie, then maybe I have more importance in the meantime - I think it's a good presentation.
