This film describes the life of someone who grew up in the worst situation. But unlike many people that he grew up to be a respectable person What's more, this is true. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher is very innocent and he is attacked like this just because he is not white. Antwone Fisher is married to the same woman for ten years and He never fooled women, coke, cigars, weeds, alcohol or anything that was popular in the place where he grew up. <br /> <br /> There is not much to say about this movie. It's great. The only score I can give is 10/10.
