Being a big fan of romantic comedy and for this reason, when seeing a lot of these movies, it is difficult to make me unique. For that matter, it is equally rare that I open my mouth to breathe through laughter. In many scenes, the love story is a little bit on the ground. But I can say that it may be the best thing because this romantic comedy focuses on "jokes" and in any case, it extends the credibility a little. I like rom. Big to do The four scientists gave the most fun time, not only But in this movie But in any movie I've seen for a long time I hesitated for a short time before choosing "10" above "9" because I believe that too many people would use it without choosing a page, so the highest score loses some impact. I am also a big fan of Meg Ryan, which can help, but this is one of the few things I have seen that I said she has been overshadowed. She and Tim Robbins are starring as actors. But for me playing the second violin and the comedy of failed intellectuals Laughing movies out loud, authentic.
