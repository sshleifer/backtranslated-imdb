I was drawn to the DAN IN REAL LIFE from the excellent reviews and thirst in the well-written Dramedy. Thank you Peter Hedges and because when Steve Carell starred in the movie, you know that the audience will meet LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE. Very entertaining and rewarding performances. In real life, give that promise. <br /> <br /> This film is true for many families around the world who lost their members and still live by finding things that will return them. Before losing with Steve Carell and Juliette Binoche, the greatness of their relationship was superbly done and wrote that their scenes were real for their characters and travels. Actors, sets and stories make DAN IN REAL LIFE one of the memories when we head to the holidays ahead.
