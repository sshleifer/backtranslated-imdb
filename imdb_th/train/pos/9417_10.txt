The unbelievable and subtle "Man in the White Suit" is another song that has fresh air in the movie format from Studio A Link. While I suspect that some modern audiences may find it vague at first. But I doubt that many people will not be fascinated by the expert's methods. The story and characters will be broadcasted during the projection period. Alex Guinness once again gave a good character in the movie, perhaps not as intelligent as Edan was inspired by "Kind Hearts and Coronets" from 1949. This time, he played more than eight characters. Find the right sound and expression. In addition to Guinness's delicate performances, the remaining actors are effective. Among the main players, Cecil Parker and Ernest Teager, stand out. Thesiger is ridiculously attractive as a weak, great business. But influential while Parker is trusted as the owner of a sawmill and an inefficient father Joan Greenwood's father, one of the best comedians in her film. Glorious and glamorous in all aspects and diction, she is quite noble in this film, which has a slight difference with similar strangeness. The scene in which she seems to be tempted to be tempted by him being expertly played by a pair that is both painful and amusing ... <br /> <br /> The style that is managed very effectively without morality is easy. The complexity of the relationship between science, business and labor has been thoroughly and thoroughly examined. This movie was helped by Alexander McCain in every movie. Erotic photography, sound effects and appropriate music Detailed satisfying movies with Guinness and Greenwood. <br /> <br /> Points: - **** 1/2 / *****
