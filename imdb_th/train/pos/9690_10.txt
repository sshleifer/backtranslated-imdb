Polly is a cute, cool, fun and very happy person. I went to watch this movie, hoping to watch a typical "family" movie, one of which, within a short time, I would find that I was unconscious and drooling on the floor. My frame of mind immediately changed when I was quickly dominated by the usefulness of movies. It is difficult for you to find a family movie that is detailed and able to honor "wholesome". Most of it is written and produced purely to attract young family members who will drag the unlucky seniors into the mind. Intoxicated for 65 minutes from the eyes and jokes too. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes. The plot tells the story of a young girl (Marie) and her best friend Polly Parrot. Users unbelievable to talk and chat with her frequently. Father Jerk of Marie finds an unbelievable thing and thinks Polly will harm the mental health of a 4-year-old daughter and tear it apart quickly. We follow Paulie's adventures (and misadventures) while He tried to reunite with his beloved owner to find many memorable characters along the way. Oh yes, Polly can talk (smart) and has a cool New Jersey accent. The plot is thick and fun all the time, making me attracted. Polly is the best family movie I have ever met and is truly happy. Get a copy and sit down and enjoy a real family movie with the whole family. Don't sleep. I promise.
