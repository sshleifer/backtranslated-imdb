"The Godfather", "Citizen Kane", "Star Wars", "Goodfellas" There is nothing above mentioned compared to the complex meaning of "The Sopranos". Each character and every character has layers along the layers that are available. Completely complete and three-dimensional absolute integrity We really care about Tony Soprano, despite the fact that in the best example of evil, he is evil. The protagonist soprano is the most intriguing, intricate and fascinating thing ever created at this point in history. If you are in the mood to be challenged openly as an audience and will change your feelings towards entertainment forever. See "The Sopranos". I challenge anyone to sit down and watch the first episode of Season 1 and not Want to continue Each season is excellent in its own way. DVDs are important to anyone's collection. **** From all 4 items
