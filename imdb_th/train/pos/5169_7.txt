I saw the last five or ten minutes of this film in 1998 or 1999. One night when I surfed the channel before going to bed and liked what I saw. Since then, I started looking for horrible TV shows, flipping through the DVD / VHS shelves at the store, but didn't find a copy until recently when I found some internet stores selling it. Then, as a global procrastination, I haven't ordered Finally, I found a DVD in the circuit city of Portland, or a few weeks ago. Then it took about a month after returning home before sitting down and watching it. <br /> <br /> So what do I think about this movie? D. Not as good as I remember and hope But still worth the $ 9.99 that made me pay After watching all the movies for the first time, I rated 7/10 with the potential to become 8/10. I have to be less sleepy and have a better sound system to avoid going back to the conversation.
