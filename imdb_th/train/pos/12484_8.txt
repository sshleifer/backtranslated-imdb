This movie makes me scared! I have to admit that I spend most of the time watching movies through my hands. But what I saw was really scary. I screamed out loud two or three times during the show. <br /> <br /> Making my favorite movie is audio and photography. The sound is particularly good and the settings are really fantastic. I read somewhere that it was a strange husband and wife that created it. For some reason that makes this a strange thing for me. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy jumping and jitters of scary movies for you! Great and suspicious movie for rent with many friends who like to watch movies, curl up on the couch, scream like a little girl!
