May be the most accurate Stephen King adjustment It is not surprising since King himself wrote the screenplay. The story takes place in the Creed family, which moved into a beautiful main house. One of the other residents is Jud, a lovely old man who knows something about the area. One is the highway that runs through their front yard. Another path is the way to Sematary, a pet whose children have been buried for decades by the highway. Soon, the church of Elk Reed's cat was found dead. Fortunately, this happened while the family, except Louis (father), went to thank God. The judge used Louis to go to another burial ground next to Sematary Pete, where the church was buried. Later, Louis received a welcome from the church. He came back and seemed to chew his way out of the bag he had buried. Maybe he was buried either. Maybe not. There is nothing more that I can say without breaking the story. <br /> <br /> All modifications The king that I have seen is the most horrible. The character is real and the situation is normal. Mary Lambert worked great in directing the trial. Suspense is kept quite high throughout the movie because part of the plot development that Gage is killed will be stuck in your heart forever. Of course we have a conclusion. Easy to consider what will happen But Lambert draws something truly terrifying and sometimes interrupts the moment. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a good movie and has a great adaptation. If you enjoy fear and don't mind being haunted by annoying images sometimes, "Pet Sematary" is just what you are looking for. Non-horror fans will want to avoid this problem.
