If you are a purist, do not waste time - otherwise try wearing a hat and enjoy the adventure. I like the version of Stewart Granger / Deborah Kerr - I've seen dozens of times. But this movie is good, everything is different I will not tell the details about the difference because it will cause the movie to lose. There is also a pleasure to see Alison Dudy again. (I'm a big fan of Indiana Jones), Patrick Swayze is as good as Quartermen and the supporting actors are great I found that the quality of the actors supporting one of the Hallmark Production trademarks and the film is no exception. The movie was excellent and the score was perfect. If you are looking for entertainment, you will not be disappointed.
