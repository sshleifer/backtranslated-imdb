This movie is considered racist. But worth it to study and enjoy The first pass, the natural inclination is to focus on Erbe & Dad. They have things that are relaxed and peaceful. What is happening to her at home? She is about to graduate from high school and he retires and kicks back. Come and wait for inspiration to do something. The second time you know that the sister's husband was broken by her friend in the blue bar. He received it. It is something that needs to be done today and important moments through as if they were talking about the weather. In the same scene, the sister blues are really torn songs if you are slightly sensitive and like music like that. Her performance feels like the end of the story. Blues story with good people who are "people with color" in their composition in the rainforest of South Carolina. At the same time, all white people in the movie lead to what appears to be a meaningless life that is shallow, suitable for creating babies only. It's wonderful as long as you remember it as a novel.
