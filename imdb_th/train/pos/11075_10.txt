After reading the reviews for this film, I began to understand it with great doubt in my heart that it would actually be good. However, this is one of the best movies I've seen for a long time. Most of the comments I have read say that the complex plot makes it too difficult to follow. And while some parts baffled you, the end points tied so many loose ends that you felt like kicking yourself because you missed a lot. (In fact, it's quite dark) and it's much smarter as you see parts. Of scenes from different perspectives (And in one of the best scenes of the movie, Jason Statham spends five minutes lifting up with himself) Only Statham, which provides excellent performances as a leader and Ray Lila, who spends most of the time in the film Providing excellent performance at least If you have the time and time to think about movies and even watch again, you will start to see all the symbols and instructions placed in the movie. I think it's great and Guy Ritchie is a great director in his game.
