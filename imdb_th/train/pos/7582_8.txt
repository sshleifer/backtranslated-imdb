Shintaro Katsu is well known in the movie Zat√¥ichi again in the third and final movie of Kenji Mizumi. (Known as "Lone Wolf and Cub") directed by Hanzo 'The Razor' Itami 's fairy tale, rape of' ghosts' and the exposure of the shadows at Hanzo's' plot ', Hanzo's plot is quite old and repetitive What was once a novel in the first film was no longer possible. Fortunately, this film is better. Thank you for having more humor. I'm just glad they chose to stop at the trilogy. (I'm looking for you Lucas) <br /> <br /> My grades: B <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Merely Trailers for 3 Hanzo the Razor movies <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Aoi Nakajima frees both nipples. Mako Midori just left her.
