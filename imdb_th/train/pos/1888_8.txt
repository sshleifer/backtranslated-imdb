"If I want to raise children, I will call the nurse." <br /> <br /> "Are you not enough?" ... "More than enough" <br /> <br /> "You get me choo- choo "<br /> <br />" If I start to die, please take off (the cowboy hat) from my head. That's not the way I want to remember. "<br /> <br /> The movie is amazing and charming. Profound, often with references from movies that are charming and profound Dudley Moore is a charming, charming and wealthy person. Sir John Gielgud is a charming and loving nobleman ... and not good. Both have relationships that are not father / father and son, which determines which man Arthur is Will he follow his heart and soul or just his wealth? For over twenty-five years I have returned to this film with fun and fun and happiness. It's a movie that will go back in time and time again and remember the shortest things in life. <br /> <br /> Judge Miller
