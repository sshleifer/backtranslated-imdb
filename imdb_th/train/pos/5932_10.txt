Stephen King's best movie with IT, although this movie is more fun than scary. <br /> <br /> This person gets everything. <br /> <br /> - Great actor with Alice Krige and Brian Krause and the clown pendant from King <br /> <br /> - Horror movie in the story. <br /> <br /> - The use of great music, especially "Sleepwalk" of Santo & Johnny, especially <br /> <br /> The favorite character in the general king scene The village is nowhere. <br /> <br /> Lots of humor. You can't get a good fear here because it's fun and superior. <br /> <br /> - Old make-up effects are very good as they don't do anymore! <br /> <br /> Rating 4,5: I don't really understand. The last time the horror movie was equally fun with this story?
