I have seen this movie in the Sky Cinema recently .. I have to admit that it is a very good western person with 2 big names .. On one side there is Charlton Heston playing Samuel Berry. In another story .. James Coburn, who plays Zach Provo, a villain who seeks revenge on Burgade, regardless of the price ..! <br /> <br /> The good thing about this movie is that There are really good characters. Most actors played really well .. especially James Coburn that I found him really meaningful in this movie .. But that's how .. Christopher Mitchum that I've seen everywhere in other movies. .. Playing Hal Brickman .. I feel that his character is left in the cold. But he managed to get himself back to join the team with Burgade to get rid of Provo's troops. <br /> <br /> It's all a great movie .. very good to watch .. Excellent score from Jerry Goldsmith .. <br /> <br /> A wonderful piece of western characters ..! 8 out of 10
