Betis Davis turned out to be a fun evening as Mildred Rogers in this film in 1934. It seems that this movie is old in 2003. No doubt why watching movies and fans of Bette Davis, but may not get as much attention as it should be for general movie viewers. It was shocking for me to see that Davis was still in this position. Actors turned to perform in general and meaningful and interesting stories. Leslie Howard is a great actor like Philip Carey, a medical student with a club. This is a movie that has a strong message about those who we choose to love and reason. However, "Of Human Bondage" does not seem to have a serious impact on me mentally or emotionally. I feel slightly indifferent and separated from Movie after watching I have an instinct that this may be the reaction that the director is about to do. You are the referee! <br /> <br />
