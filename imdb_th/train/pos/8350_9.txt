As with that movie, we will always follow what is unbelievable if engaging with the characters' adventures, leading to 2 people, but while C + J avoids having sex for the journey back to childhood. This couple is very happy in their festivities, even though it is a point of exploration. homoeroticism Most of the sex that they have received from partners who are not satisfied or unwilling, and despite the behavior that is not deeply used by the PC, everyone has a smile. Like C + G, they still have a pure heart. Naive against the strict middle class quota As others have commented, I don't want to know these 2 and it's a little miracle that their journey brings the most funny scenes and very little tragedy. The reason it makes me lost But has a sweet taste in the mouth I dare say that there is But only French people can escape with such a movie And that is part of their genius
