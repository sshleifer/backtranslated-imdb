I remember watching this movie with my friend when we were 4 years old, but the strange thing was I never watched it after that. The day before, I received a babysitter and my cousin never saw. All Dogs Go To Heaven So we rented both movies and watched them together today and he really loved these movies. Many memories come back to watch this movie again, and I have to admit that I cried even a little. I am 22 years old and the ending still came to me. All Dogs Go To Heaven is one of the most impressive animated movies. And I was honestly shocked by this rating at 5.8. I think this movie will bring good memories back to others as well. I agree that animation is normal. But the story is charming and fun. <br /> <br /> Charlie is a gambling dog that has been killed by a dog. But when Charlie wants to take revenge on him, return to the world with a clock that can't stop or that is the end of his life again. When he and his best friend search for Carface and spy on him, they find that Carface gets all his money. He has an orphan, a small girl who speaks to animals and knows who will win the race. Charlie takes the girl, Ann-Marie, and makes a fake contract to receive the money. But he learned that maybe he should have Ann-Marie be the first before he came back to him with revenge. Carface <br /> <br /> Every dog, Go To Heaven, is a complete family movie. It's not Disney, but this is an excellent family movie to watch. No need to mention that it's so cute and impressive. I know it's ridiculous and some people call me crazy. But this movie for me when I was a kid made me believe that the dog had a soul. How will they not? They are just love and I think I will cry again. However, I would like to recommend this movie to everyone. It's a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 7/10
