This is your cheerful and colorful MGM music since the early 1950s, and of course it will be a better song than you should watch. <br /> <br /> Film directed by expert Vincente Minnelli and star Gene Kelly. The pair both made a few films in those days, in which the movie is probably the movie they are well known. <br /> <br /> Actually, the movie managed to win an Academy Award for the picture. The most throughout the year, which means that it hit movies like "A Place in the Sun", "A Streetcar Named Desire", "The African Queen", "Quo Vadis", "The Blue Veil", "Death of a Salesman" In that year, absolute success But at the same time giving too much credit for a pleasant, bright and fun movie. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, you will definitely be entertained. Thanks to movies with beautiful colors and many good characters in this movie. The musical numbers are also good, which is not surprising if you have people such as Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly at work. <br /> <br /> But really can't have everything told in the movie. Is this done in half an hour or less? I mean, we already know what the movie is about. But it can be extended for as long as possible Not that it makes the movie drag in any part. It just makes it too long. Movies can be done with fewer musical numbers in it. <br /> <br /> One of the better MGM musicals that doesn't have any flaws. <br /> <br /> 8/10
