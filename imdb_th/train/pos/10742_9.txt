Movies difficult to comment on, you say it is not good? It's not like that But it's hard to say that it's good What is it? It is interesting to watch. It's as close as you can get to the destruction without being there. It is a photo of a tsunami that comes near the coast of Thailand that makes life. You know that you want to turn your back, but you have to see. <br /> <br /> Naudet brothers manage their opinions very well. The tragedy of a situation with a view about what is happening in other countries, not panders or insulting the fact that cellulose is necessary for the audience to understand or understand what has happened. <br /> <br /> You can't. Change history and you shouldn't want this movie to be a testament to Humanity in the darkest time
