Great and precise movies ... McGovern spent a lot of effort in researching and documenting his writings. He is not afraid to tell the truth, even though it may write criticism and comments that are not satisfactory from some people who like clean and sweet stories. <br /> <br /> Again, McGovern brings Christopher. Eccleston came in with a high profile role while he was playing in Hillsborough. I found the film to be accurate, good work and well presented as well as Hillsborough and I applauded McGovern for Not written His benign Very well done and my hat is closed for writers, actors, teams, builders. Great movie!
