Is an animated movie I have a dear friend who is in her sixties and over the past 15 years has told me that people do not see you anymore and she wishes to be friends. In my late 40s I began to see what she had been complaining about. You will not be young, beautiful, or can be touched anymore. In May, saying "... this lump ..." How did your body change and we were told that it was no longer beautiful. I love when you start to change what you wear ... a colorful scarf ... not a furious wife anymore. <br /> <br /> It's a sad and wonderful picture at the same time. Sadly, in May, who betrayed her daughter, trusting ... beautiful in that she found herself through the difficulties of the story and chose to go and finally have her own life. I love the brave character that starts the love story. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, I love movies because in the end it is a picture that shows the complex nature of the relationship, no matter where they are. Is it a family? We see Paula's weakness. But she will have everything she wants ... (when she tells her that she will have a child for Darren, whether he wants it or not after her mother asks Darren to want her child) Impress the relationship that can change. But still reveals things that happen all the time May hinder her creativity in raising a family The family that you don't want but is "what you just did when you were young" I loved this scene when Darren called her an old tart and she smiled and said "I've never called it before." It's a real gem of a movie. <br /> <br /> And Daniel Craig, I just love him. I'm surprised. Not only will he be satisfied with the eyes only. But still a real talent What is the role He is more than 007 exact and I hope to see him in the role of this nature more. The scene in which he was satisfied in May and the appearance he gave her seemed like a surprise that he was able to control this woman and was one of the happiness that gave this to her. He enjoys giving her happiness. Wonderful scene The difference is the love scene with Bruce. Bruce totally absorbed his happiness ... Two completely different men <br /> <br /> Alas ... I wonder where my Darren is.
