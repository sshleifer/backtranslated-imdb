For beginners, I am always a comic cartoon fan because the theme is universal. 'Every person who has an ego change life' This is the truth in the mystery of Batwoman. While the overall story is good, I'm disappointed that they didn't do much for the franchise with this story. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, you're trying to find out who is Batman's identity. Unfortunately You can easily search by looking at the credit posted on this website. (So ​​if you haven't seen it, don't go there) I was disappointed that they didn't make the movie longer. 75 minutes, too short for any movie. Batman's secret was too early in the movie. In the middle and become anti-climatic afterwards, because you know that good people will always win and new characters known as Batman will disappear after the movie ends. Br /> <br /> I'm not yet Thoughts on the new animation style used in the film. I love new characters that are slim. But should have more details that call for details Some of the animations look awkward and stiff, which instantly attracts your attention by distracting you from the story. I do not like the bright atmosphere used in most scenes. It loses the gothic feeling which is Batman. In the same way, we should get to know more about Batman's personality so that we can create the same deep sympathy that we do with Bruce Wayne. I think the fight with Bane should be better. In the typical way of children, bad people find their death too easy, whether by stumbling, receiving electrical systems or doing things that are not right for them. Think about it. There is no blood leaking even in this movie. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is a good entertainment flick and I recommend everyone who is a Batman fan. It has a good story, a universal charm and even a great performance. I just hope that they will be able to change the story more permanently by making Batman stay to make things more interesting. Don't just introduce her and kick her out when you're done. I want to see other people understand the mystery in order to finally change. There is something other than Batman to solve the mystery and complete the details for him later. <br /> <br /> I hope to have an animated movie to watch and wait for the time to see. The breakup between Bruce Wayne and Barbra Gordan. He's always been with you and doesn't like you, and I can't believe that she's stupid enough to fall in love with someone who is over 20 years old. Leaving because he was sick from the old man In short, I want to see everything that brings the characters to where they are in Batman Beyond. Otherwise, the same formula will end sooner if they decide to proceed. <br /> <br / >
