Of course, the original is better. But it's not as bad as everyone says! Yes, it consists of 3 things, but wait a minute! I think it's quite good to be honest. I like that Anastasia changed a bit when she fell in love. The story is not too bad. <br /> <br /> I like the sound of Cinderella better in this story as well. I have nothing with her voice in the original. But I just think it sounds better than here. I like her personality as well. She also has more spine. But she is kind. <br /> <br /> So I'll give Cinderella. Second: The dream come true. 7/10
