This is a great movie. <br /> <br /> I agree to look at the ball. I never heard of this or anyone in it. (Except Mike from friends) <br /> <br /> But it's great! Eva, Lake and Paul gave a wonderful performance Humor is always dry and sharp. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd plays a friend from Mike. (Which works well) Other characters are schemes and the plot is formulaic (I mean, we don't say 'Apocalypse Now' here) but the characters are cute, the story is interesting. <br /> <br /> <br /> Everybody has their own taste and production direction. <br /> <br /> <br /> Everybody has their own taste. But I do not understand a certain level of criticism for this
