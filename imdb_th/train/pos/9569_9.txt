As I understood, after China took possession of Hong Kong, the infamous cat 3, the Hong Kong movie disappeared. At least until now and this movie is amazing. I know it's a rough crime drama, but it's the first cat. 3 I just bought it, which has just been done recently. I'm not sure what will happen. <br /> <br /> Cambodian killer. In Hong Kong to shake off the judge's wife who is also a lawyer. It turns out that the judge has prepared for a hit-man because she is divorcing a judge and threatening to use all his money. All this is known within the first ten minutes, so there is no distribution. The police hit the men quickly killing But in trying to arrest him, many police and civilians were killed. He dodged the police and now the race will catch the man before he escapes to Cambodia. This is a movie that never stops, and hardly gives the audience the opportunity to experience the breath. Yes, it was violent and violent. Many police were killed because the killer proved very difficult and fell when they found him. During the passage of the killer in an attempt to hide in the garbage he found that women were raped and attacked by some men. He helped her and saved her from the guy and she persuaded the hitter to take her with him to escape. I love this movie. It's like a roller coaster that just moves and moves at high speed because one event leads to another event and the police sometimes get worse or worse than the movie hit. The performance was excellent and the filming of locations and photography was an amazing time. In this film, there is no release of time, even the most incredible ending. The ending is quite unbelievable and is also the end of all action and violence. Yes, sometimes violent violence But this is a ridiculous crime drama that will cause your socks to fall off. "Dog Eat Dog" needs a more prevalent release, including R1. Of course, great movies are highly recommended.
