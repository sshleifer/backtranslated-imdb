This is a great movie. It shows that our government will go to other countries if we don't like their government. This is not as bad as Reagan and Bush number one do for South America. But the United States still has no business to interfere with other countries like this The film also proves that the American media spend government propaganda. This is what they do with Aristide in Haiti. The reason that this coup with Chavez was unsuccessful is that Chavez was chosen with over 90% of the vote. <br /> <br /> This movie is not only a political documentary. The drama is so amazing that this story is true. <br /> <br /> Other critics are lying when he says "Chavez seizes the wave." Private media are always fighting against Chavez's propaganda
