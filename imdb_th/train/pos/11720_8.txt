I didn't expect much and spoke directly. I didn't like this movie for the first time. But watch again and I know that it's very cool Of course, it's a funny movie. But it is a joke. <br /> <br /> There are people who post that can write better and be possible. I think this film has the potential to be my cousin Vinnie. But with a horror host instead of a lawyer Sadly, it's a waste of opportunity. With a little more writing, it may be classic. Children are being used without reason. There is no reason why they should approach Elvira apart from clear reasons. It would be good to see their relationship prosperous. I know it's funny. But there is a small difference that separates good movies from brightness. <br /> <br /> Elvira herself is always fun and engaging. No need to talk about colors. Every time you smile, you will do as well. It's hard to knock the film when the main character is very charming. And it's really her charm. Don't let her look fooling you into thinking she's some type of tart. She is very good But she is a good person The type of person you want your children to take care of, not allowing her to cook for them. Too much <br /> <br /> She is more than a great set. In addition, she has an incredible pair of legs.
