19 years ago, Gordon Gekko used "Wall Street" to tell us that greed is good. Now, Michael Douglas takes the role of GG and turns into a secret service agent. Pete Garrison guesses what it works! This is a strong political thriller that makes me guess. Details on the safety precautions that SS operates on behalf of the President and the First Lady are also interesting. All leading actors are quite good. But try as much as I can. I can't accept Eva Longoria as a spy agent. While Jodie Foster makes you stop believing and thinks she is an FBI Starling spy in "Silence of the Lambs", you don't get the same feeling as Longoria. Fun to entertain the escape with Beltway as a backdrop.
