I love this movie. It is a very interesting fantasy movie from the true meaning of the family in our country history movies. The fun-filled performances are shown in movies. I watch @ @ about 4 X per week and I Just love it! I hope the sequel will be made to see Susan's father more in the past and see that Susan sends her new sister and no computer phone, game boy or anything in the 21st century. I hope everyone will Enjoyed this movie as much as I had thought you could say that I had the most crazy time and I didn't mind The movie boy Robert Lincoln Walker is a cute person. I wonder who he is and how old he is today. Does anyone know if he plays in movies or TV shows?
