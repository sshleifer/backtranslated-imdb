Hey, I'm really in this movie! I didn't even know that it was on this site until I watched a few years ago and I was very surprised! I play the main character Pete's son. It's a wonderful experience and I like every minute. While filming, they wanted me to be in two places at the same time, so they used my twin sister as a partner! The finger that pressed the option button in the car is not mine. I still show and do TV but not much. Oh and if you want to prove my name as the first one on the top of the scroll. <br /> <br /> Review: I think this movie is ok From my favorites I think the performance is very good. But the story is enough
