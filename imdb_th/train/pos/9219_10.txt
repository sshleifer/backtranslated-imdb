This movie makes me want to go and call someone so they can enjoy it as well. It's very funny. Angelena Jolie is great like Juliet. Parents are hilarious. They are service providers like the enemy. Play Romeo and Juliet in the church. They fall in love and parents try to separate them from each other. After the party and do it Surprisingly, they still want to get married at the end of the movie. If you don't like the pattern and dirtyness of classical literature, don't look. If you don't mind the person you will have an explosion, look like this.
