I saw this film at the Palm Springs International Film Festival 2005 and from the 14 movies I saw there, I would rank it as my 3rd movie. I had an initial interest in seeing this as a Swedish descent. And many of my ancestors from the Norrland region of Sweden, which is the filming location In addition, I grew up in the rural areas of North America in many small towns like the movie scenes. It's good to see other movies that take place in the countryside as their location, like SÃ¥ som i himmelen. This is a very good movie and I'm sure it's a very difficult movie to pull it with the actors. Big, but the director Kay Pollock really pulled this thing out. After almost two decades of lack of director, Helen Sjoholm in her first film made her debut as a great actress and I will wait for her. On the big screen, I enjoy Michael Nyqvist in the cast who are knowledgeable. I would like to recommend this film and give it a score of 9.0 in level 10.
