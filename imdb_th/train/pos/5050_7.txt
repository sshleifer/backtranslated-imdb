We are happy with the gray owls: simple stories that tell well in the classic fashion of Attenborough: There is a little romance with humor and stress archetypes from dignity and values. <br /> <br /> Beautiful shot. This step is the true story of Archie, a British who turns into an Indian native and goes to live and be in a trap in Canada. <br /> <br /> A strong performance from all makes this movie a message Easy. <br /> <br /> Two stars in the movie, no doubt the cutest we have ever seen - this message is good with eco-cleaning. It would be great to see or read the Gray Owl in the 1930s, which is a unique character and this is the right movie tribute.
