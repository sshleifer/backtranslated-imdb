When I was the president of our college coffee shop, one of our tasks was to check groups and movies for student activities. One of the best things in 1972 was the Groove Tube. The original venue was a Broadway show in a cinema where TV screens were placed around the audience, so everyone had a good seat. The premise is that the game will change regularly - Ala Saturday Night Live makes it fresh. They decided to make a movie for sale. <br /> <br /> I believe that the developers say this is the first time Chevy Chase has screened. He runs naked even though the forest is whining. As with many previous reviews, it was Saturday night before that thing actually existed. I would like to recommend this vid. I told my 13-year-old son about Koko's clown - he couldn't wait to receive a copy!
