Makes me hope that my happy bird can talk. Tisk tisk on the examiner that separates the movie A sweet story that people of all ages will enjoy. Polly is a lovely little treasure. He has a few lines of clever lines that really make me laugh. I like the dance sequence during his performance. You can forgive the obvious ancient thoughts as you cheer him on a quest to reunite with Marie. The charming movie consists of two strong characters that are friendly to the little parrot, separated from his young owner. Would like to see women who are more blind and have to abandon travel together I like the artistic inspiration and poetry of her. The shame that she cannot share Polly's reunion. Bless Paulie in his new home finally with Marie may be joined by a good young man who helps He defeats the enemy for his journey.
