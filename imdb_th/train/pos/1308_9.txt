I must say I don't really know that I will sit down and watch this movie. I think it's true that I have nothing to do better during my studies. But for one TV movie that I'm interested in More important, Helen Han caught my eye. I am not a big fan of her before having this movie. Sure i like twister and as good as it gets But some things about this movie really do for me I will now see myself as a big fan. This movie comes with a high score from ... I give it a chance. It won't let you down.
