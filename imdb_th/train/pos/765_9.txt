I guess when "Beat Street" appeared at the national level "Flashdance" at the same time, the problem of "Flashdance" is that there is only one dance scene, the rest is jazz dance and ballet. That's one of the reasons why "Beat Street" is better than the only movie that can be compared to "Beat Street". It seems to be "Footloose" because both of these films focus on using people's dances to express feelings. The best <br /> <br /> The dance scene in "Beat Street" comes before the middle and the end of the flick. And i love them all Almost all of the stop-tricks are featured in the break scene: penetrating, flames, spoofing, suicide, sitting, crazy legs, human, turning forward, figure four --- almost everything /> < br /> Like "The Warriors", "Beat Street" has violence associated with gang life in the hip-hop world ... but in a less intense way than in the past. The only major battle scene in "Beat Street" was when the graffiti artist Ramon (in which the film had the acronym "Ramo") was chased by a rival gang member on the New York Subway train track. .... fought on the third track and both were dying with electricity on that track Although the chase scene ended sadly But better than that, they died that way, rather than having a blast from a gunshot Culture and rap music Many rap songs appear in the flick because hip hop members use rap music to divert negative attention of gang life. Even the soundtrack of the movie that covered the curtain was not just a show of respect for the hip hop culture. But it is a show of respect for Ramon's death. <br /> <br /> Anyway, during the dance scene called 'Tango, Tango', I guess the female drummer in the orchestra's pit game was created. By actress Rae Dawn Chong, Sheila E.
