I was only thirteen years old when I saw this series for the first time and I watched it again on the DVD thirty years later. Pictures that are more than open credit never leave me. It affects my perspective on the world and the people in it. My parents were with me long enough to watch this series with me, and we always talked about this. It gives the love of learning, history and the highest score I received from public exams in our school. <br /> <br /> Sir Laurence Olivier's voice and delivery are timeless and perfect I get the feeling that people living through it will feel that this is a historical version of World War II. I can't imagine being bored. Perhaps a similar cold war series may be considered, even if anyone replaces Lawrence is difficult to imagine. <br /> <br /> Buy now!
