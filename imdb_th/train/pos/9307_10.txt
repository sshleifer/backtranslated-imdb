Not a movie for everyone But this movie is in my top 10, I'm a black comedy lover. With actors including Richard Dreyfus (Vic), Jeff Goldblum (Mick), Larry Bishop (Nick) and Gabriel Byrne (Ben 'Brass Balls' London) in the lead line can't help The support team is almost dead. Counting minor defects in the movie: Ellen Barkin's makeup makes her face look dull. There are a few pendants by Joey Bishop and Richard Pryor who do not have the purpose and time. Michael J. Pollard's screen is too short. Above all, the actor is incredible, without the ego to destroy the good chapter. If you've seen the movie Underworld's Larry Bishop (Flick the Dark Crime), you'll enjoy this story. His next outing (Writer, director, actor) is Hell Ride with Michael Madsen and Quentin Tarantino.
