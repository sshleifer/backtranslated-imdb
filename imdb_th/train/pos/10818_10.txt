Why is it low? I don't understand at all ... is it because of a bad performance? Bad conversations? Who would be interested in these stories in low-price horror movies? Serious performances and conversations are not important for those movies. People who hate movies just because of poor performances and bad conversations should not be allowed to rank movies with low budget. Those movies should not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> Anyway, when talking about movies, right? I like it very much! I bought it because I expected to be a gorefest, but not gorefest and blood was not good enough. (Most are just the courage of animals placed on the actors' bodies and crippled) but I don't care because Hilarious movies! The characters are hilarious, the performances are hilarious. (Bad performances are good in horror movies with low budget), the conversation is hilarious. (Bad conversations are good in horror movies with low budget), rape zombies too. The big dick is hilarious. The boy's flying demon is hilarious and I can go indefinitely. But I don't want to talk too much ... but I have to mention that there is a scene in which the girl masturbates. Oh and rape zombies fall in love with sex dolls lol! <br /> <br /> The best lines in the movie: <br /> <br /> Detective etiquette: * Inhaling Coke * Detective Sloan: Beep * Are you doing * Etiquette? What sin do you have? What is it? Investigation etiquette: It's not human. It's ... Eh, cold medicine ... <br /> <br /> Investigation etiquette: * Injection of heroin on his arm. * Detective Sloan: What are you doing? ? Are you crazy * * crazy? Detective etiquette: It's a cold medicine. <br /> <br /> Detective etiquette: * Kick the man at random, over and over again. * Detective Sloan: What happened to the devil? what are you doing? Investigation etiquette: This mania is passionate about the devil, and then he begins to smash his head on the rock! He began to smash his head on the rock! I think he uses a PCP or something! <br /> <br /> Haha!
