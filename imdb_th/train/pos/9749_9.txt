I watched this movie with my mother when I was in high school many years ago. I wasn't interested in opera at that time. But he changed my perspective I really enjoyed this movie and really enjoyed the opera ever since. I even bought many of his CDs. Who cares about his acting ability? He just plays himself, which is cute. He is charming, very attractive. I just want to hug him sincerely. I was very saddened by the serious criticism of him. It is very straightforward, not accepting people who pushed him around or judged him from his actions. He deserves respect and appreciation for his abilities. Of course he will miss !!!
