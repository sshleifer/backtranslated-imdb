Back in the year 74, Eric Monte made a classic TV show. JJ has always been my favorite, and I like watching replay on TV Land. Jimmie Walker seems to be an actor, not Esther Rolle. Most of them are jealous of the popularity of Jimmy Walker, who has been popular with millions of fans for a good time. The program will die if JJ is not there to record with Kool Aid's attitude. Always drinking KOOL AID is like his favorite thing to show me as 3 when it comes out and 8 when it ends. Instead of the years 1974-1979, it should be longer as in 1980 when I was just growing up.
