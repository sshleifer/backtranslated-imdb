We only hope that there are times when powerful people like Morgan Freeman can spend time helping people who need help. <br /> <br /> Everything comes down to those who love. As Will Rogers said "I have never met a man I don't like." Of course, if you meet Paz Vega, what will you not like? Her smile can melt diamonds. She was so wonderful that I was able to see what she was in. Same as Freeman. He is just a magic on screen. <br /> <br /> The two of them gave funny movies from beginning to end. From the Mexican supermarket to Lorraine & Bobby to Packy. It's gentle, charming and funny. <br /> <br /> You have to try it.
