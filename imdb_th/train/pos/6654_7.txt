This film presents a new perspective on Gandhi's life, which is good to see and show how he is human. His relationship with Harilal is something that Gandhi was worried about and mentioned it many times when his failure as a father in his autobiography <br /> <br /> My big fear is I think Gandhi Should do better by those who play Gandhi Some of Gandhi's statements seem too satisfying and it seems that he has been deliberately depicted in some parts of the film. <br /> <br /> The movie isn't really all round But focus only on that Father-son relationship The rest will be blurred and used to display the time frame and general settings of the movie only. <br /> <br /> Overall good movies if you remember that it's not a complete picture.
