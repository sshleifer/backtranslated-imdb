For Danish movies, I must say that this is a very good movie. <br /> <br /> It's in my own class. But it has international potential. <br /> <br /> Movies have a big budget and starring famous Danish actors and a few newcomers who play very well. Everyone who loves adventure can see it and the movie 'Ghost'. <br /> <br /> Don't be afraid. Be excited!
