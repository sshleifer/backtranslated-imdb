... may be the best word to describe this movie (In my opinion) besides one of the wonderful services of a girlfriend for a girlfriend (That is repetition ~) It is a story that makes me lost the cheers for Takahisa Zeze and Gackt! And I know that some people will not agree with me about this But it's not three actors (People who play Cho, son, and K) who give the best performance (For me) It is Taro Yamamoto. The boy, age 5, from the battle Royale! <br /> <br /> Don't understand me. Wrong. I like Hyde. I worship his voice. But the problem is that some of his scenes came out a little 'off' but I liked that scene that he also danced. The body of a dead man killed another person and Gackt wasn't that bad either. I like that his character is a lonely person from the beginning. Nothing much I can say about my background on Lee Huang Huang. I will not pretend to know him. But he carries his own weight along with the actor. <br /> <br /> This movie paved the way for one of the best media I've heard. Orenji No Taiyou (forgive my spelling if it's wrong) ) While all songs take about nine minutes, you won't notice the length because you will enjoy hearing Gackt and Hyde together. <br /> <br /> However, this movie is something that shouldn't be missed for fans. (Big fan base ~ ~) but For those who like sci-fi movies, Asian style films
