I.Q. In my opinion, a romantic comedy that is sweet, charming and hilarious about finding the right person for you. If you ask me, James (Stephen Fry) is really boring. For me ed (Tim Robbins) is more suitable for Catherine (Mexican) than James. However, everyone involved in this film did a great job. Now, in conclusion, I would like to introduce a sweet, charming and hilarious romantic movie about finding the one that suits you for Tim Robbins or the fanmake Ryan that hasn't seen You are laughing a lot. Go to the video rental shop or buy, kick back with friends and watch.
