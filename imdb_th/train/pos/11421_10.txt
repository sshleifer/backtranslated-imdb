I do not know what the previous reviewers are watching. But I think that is a personal taste What is missed in this movie is the deep, deep film that has many emotions that affect The brilliance of love that has been suppressed because of surrendering to social beliefs, the prohibition of time and class, racial relations that are not in a very good state of equality, guilt, desire, hatred, confusion Emotional darkness To send to aire of it, the movie flows, shortly as previously stated, letting yourself into the flow of the movie, the mood will show itself, the characters reveal the flaws, their nasty insides, Excellent and really cruel!
