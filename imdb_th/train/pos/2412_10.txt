I feel that Monarch Cove is one of the best writers and serves the "Drama" series that will come on any network for a long time. This program has a lot of potential and I can't wait to watch it each time. Week This can be developed as a great Primetime soap. People are looking forward to this type of show while we are "exaggerated" on TV. I need the type of writing and performances that show like Dallas, Knots' Landing, Dynasty, MelRose Place and others. Monarch Cove has improved this concept quite well and I expect to be better than ever. There are many things that will continue to expand with these characters and they are interesting and charming in themselves. It will be a loss not to explore this and develop these characters after being attracted and caught in their world. I like this show a lot because it's mysterious, interesting, and has feelings without having to go down or not satisfied. Love it.
