This is a great movie and makes heartbreak. It is the best thing I have ever seen, which shows the truth in Latin America ... The kidnapping, corruption, ruthless and greedy police. Denzel Washinton gave the most moving work of his career. My thoughts, Dakota Fanning, are amazing actresses. The relationship between Washington and Fanning was amazingly written and I believe that every minute The character is excellent, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke is great. As always, Walken shines the screen for me like no other actor. I want to see both of them more The real location is outstanding. The camera works interesting and different. There are many famous Latin actors in the show, making everyone more interesting for people familiar with Latin American movies. I would like to recommend this movie.
