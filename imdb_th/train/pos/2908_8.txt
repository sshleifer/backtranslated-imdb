The journey of discovering this film follows the lives of a family that lives in a quiet island town in British Columbia. A cheerful and dreamy dreamer who will allow life to continue around them until a new young teacher with a new concept arrives and brings her life from the mainland Slowly, their status was awakened by the father. (And the principal of the local school) looking for mother's excitement for stability, the oldest daughter for love and the youngest person with power Although it is not an incredible or broken movie theater But this movie is fun, quiet and good for a tired night when the wind blows. Unfortunately, I suspect that anyone outside of Canada will find it easily accessible.
