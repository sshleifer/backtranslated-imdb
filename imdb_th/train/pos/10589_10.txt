I enjoy Longstreet, which follows the steps of Raymond Burr's successful Ironside TV series and intends to make it competitive. But this show was canceled after one season because of the decision - I believe it was wrong - Longstreet was unable to compete with Mr. Burr's Ironside. <br /> <br /> I may add that the pilot for this program is Especially well done and very memorable. I hope Longstreet's box will appear. <br /> <br /> Writers should know that this concept has been explored only briefly here.
