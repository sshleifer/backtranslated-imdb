Surprisingly, one of the best musicals that ever existed. Busby Berkely's three numbers that ended the movie were exciting. But what makes this film great is the unstoppable sound and the natural performances of Cagney and Blondell (Keeler is cute, even though she may not be a great actress). Fresh in movies that you don't see in today's movie, very little in the 30s movies that are arrogant. Although the plans related to the creation of the script are quite old.
