Over Body Dead She is a good little movie. It's good and fun while still being funny. There is a little clich√©. But I found the freshest thing. At first I didn't think it would be good. When it starts out, if you pass the first 20 minutes, the movie will start to be more interesting. This film doesn't utter hilarious laughter and not my movie. MY MY GOSH It's just a movie. You can sit down and enjoy the fun. I don't see how bad this movie is. Its score is too low. I can handle 5.5 but is 4.8 with 1. It's disgraceful. It's quite good and there's nothing scary enough. To give it 1 which is what most people give
