Nicolas Roeg's project is the least variable to say. But not less than interesting "Insignificance" is clearly the first and most important thing is the drama adaptation: it is quite a word 'Tied to the room', but it paid to watch this movie more than once: the basic theme was not openly presented, and more than that, it took a moment to adapt to the juxtaposition and flipping Returning to the role of the four protagonists: Einstein, McCarthy, Munroe and DiMaggio. <br /> <br /> Einstein was affected by Hiroshima's offense. But still imagine the simplicity of having sex with Munro Munro was sick of being viewed as a brainless person and longing for intellectual credibility. Senator McCarthy was at the peak of his witch hunting power. But being a powerless detective, DiMaggio is not safe about his celebrity, obsessed with himself, and prone to violence. Each has its own destructive seed. Each character has past problems, abuse / abuse and suspicious future issues. We will gradually see that passion is central. America's fascination with icons, culture and traditions The protagonist's passion for what no one else can do: peace of mind and / or happiness <br /> <br /> Compare with the theory of relativity, field theory, the unity that is presented and the universe Own The inspiration and all the interactions of the protagonists of Roeg seem insignificant. But these things of the physical universe (It is all quantum, believe me!) Affects us when they are used to developing ways to destroy us. Monroe talks about the principles behind neutron bombing. (Without naming this name) is not an offense But can only be understood by contemporary audiences In fact, all references in the script are accessible only by knowledgeable audiences: one ait fait with 50s events / cult personality and what they affect us in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> This movie and screenplay Either very intelligent or very opaque and hypocrisy However, in the end it may not matter. <br /> <br /> Live long and prosperous :) <br /> <br />
