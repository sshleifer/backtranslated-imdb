Another piece of the puzzle about the Holocaust appeared in this documentary about the Rosenstrasse protest in Berlin, an event that I didn't know, which began in late February 1943 with more details in the appendix. Following this review, <br /> <br /> The film storytelling determines the story of this protest within the contemporary story that began. Based in New York City today The Jewish woman, who was not observant, her husband had died from this incident, causing her to be afraid that her children and others would insist on mourning rituals. She proceeded by calling on her daughter's non-Jewish fiance to leave the house. <br /> <br /> Hannah (Maria Schrader), a distressed daughter, then learns for the first time from her older cousin. World War II in Berlin Her mother was 8 years old and was protected by Aryan women. Hannah reduced everything to Berlin and met this woman, Lena Fischer, now 90. Hannah persuades the woman to tell her story easily. It seems to be quite bad. <br /> <br /> This film has been improved by focusing on the long history of the year 1943 that surrounds the protest which the main characters assume. Became like Mrs. Fischer 33 (played by Katja Riemann, a successful pianist and married to Fabian (Martin Feifel), a Jewish concert violinist, one of the men detained at the Ros site. enstrasse back to the present time and ending in New York City again While the current scene is saturated with color, various scenes in 1943 are washed out in a strong blue-gray tone. <br /> <br /> The quality of the performance is quite good, generally what we might expect from Deep ability In Germany and the direction of Margarethe von Trotta, the most outstanding female filmmaker of the New German Cinema, is a former actress. <br /> <br /> The story of the protest is simply told. There is only one missing feature which will help: notes at the end of the text that show the end results for those who are being held in Rosenstrasse. The results that occur due to the appendix below make it incredibly positive. <br /> <br> "Rosenstrasse" is still not good in the opinion of most film critics. The person who delivered the sex model with a layer longer than necessary without having to use music, so try to knock as usual. It's too long, but I find that in this film there is violence, power, nature and credible sounds from Protests from women who watched outside the place at Rosenstrasse, where relatives, Jews and others were detained. I found that there was nothing that was flashy, contemporary or twisted. In this picture <br /> <br /> Severe violence (No one was shot or physically abused) causing my tension to become more intense. You wait for the evil attack to start every minute. After that, the darkness of the movie was with me after that. I woke up often at night. I saw this movie. My mind was full of frigidity, melancholy, chaos and a sense of rigor by this film. For me, it happens very little. (In German and English) My Score: 8/10 (B +) (see on 05/31/05) If you want to read more of my reviews, send a message to find directions to my website < br /> <br /> add: protest of Rosenstrasse: Swept from their compulsory work in what was intended to be the final roundup in the national capital, Jews 1700 to 2000, mostly men married to non-Jewish women, being cornered into Rosenstrasse 2-4, welfare office. For the Jewish community in central Berlin. <br /> <br /> Because of these things The Jews had many German relatives who were highly connected.

But before the exile of prisoners could happen, in this case, the wife and other relatives were aware of what had happened and appeared at the address of Rosenstraus for the first time and the second time. <br /> <br /> May six thousand people join the protest, even if not all at the same time. Women demanded the husband return once a day for a week. They faced the most brutal forces in the removal of the Third Reich without unarmed unarmed and unarmed leaders. <br /> <br /> Joseph Goebbels, Gauleiter (Governor or District Chief) of Berlin paid. Responsible for the morale of the country Both are concerned about the potential consequences of women's actions. Instead of inviting a more open conflict by shooting women on the street and fearing the risk of secrets "Final exit" or Goebbels and Hitler who agreed to release the prisoner Rosenstrasse and ordered him to return twenty-five men to Auschwitz! <br /> <br /> For both Hitler and Goeb Bell's decision was a postponement of the inevitable thing. But they misunderstood Almost all of those released from Rosenstrasse survived the war. The women were surprisingly victorious over the power of destruction.
