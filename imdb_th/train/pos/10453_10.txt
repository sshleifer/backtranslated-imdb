While traveling by train through Europe, American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and French Celine (Julie Delpy) met and decided to spend the night together in Austria. The next morning, Jessie returned to the United States and Celine to Paris. <br /> <br /> "Before Sunrise" is one of my favorite love, of course, one of the most beautiful love stories I have. Ever seen It is an economical movie with a simple and very realistic story. But the relationship between Ethan Hawk and Julie Dale was perfect. That direction is amazing, conveying the feelings of Celine and Jesse to the audience. I just finished checking the number 1,000 on IMDb and I chose "Before Sunrise" for this important number because it is a very special movie for me. I cannot understand why this film was not nominated for an Oscar with great screenplay, direction and performance. Yesterday I might watch this movie for the third or fourth time and I still love it. My rating is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Antes do Amanhecer" ("Before Sunrise")
