This performance is excellent. I think both when Paul died was so sad. I really cry But other programs are great. Kerry is my favorite character because she is in the "dark side." I think that the guy who plays Kyle is really cute. I like it very much when Kerry speaks sarcastic about everything. The guy playing Rory is cute and Paul played by John Ritter. It's really funny. All these TV shows are funny and I hope they will continue to perform on TV. Even if they perform on TV But I watch every time it is turned on The next time it shows, I'll watch it over and over again.
