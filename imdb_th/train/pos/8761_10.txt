I love Claire Dennes and Kate Beckinsale. Look no role in her role. The film is only flawed because it seems that the two suspects seem to be in the monastery, some of whom work like a monk in the pasture and under a martial arts discipline. The performances and works of the film and the amazing colors of Thailand are striking, but Claire Daines stole both the film and the deep unexpectedness of learning the difficult lessons of her life to the end. Of miraculous selflessness, never heard and truly unexpected in the real world The flaw is a few minutes and I would like to recommend this movie that seems to be buried with sadness forever on a rare TV program. I want a movie for my collection - just 10 popular movie collections. Watch it. You will be very impressed.
