Professionals snobs and pretend to think "It's the best way from De Sica to the best." People who suffer from lack of innocence will seriously encounter problems connecting with this masterpiece. De Sica speaks frankly. His Italian style does not have a complex self-examination of modern Italian filmmakers or bitterly mocking Pietro Germi's bitterness from Mario Monicelli. De Sica tells the story like father sitting at the edge of the bed before they sleep. There is no attempt to make wisdom, Miracolo A Milano and at a lower level. Il Giudizio Universale is a true fairy tale or what we call magic. This movie is a gem from beginning to end and Toto is the character that you accept with an open mind. But naturally you have to have a heart Cinema in the most pure and beautiful style.
