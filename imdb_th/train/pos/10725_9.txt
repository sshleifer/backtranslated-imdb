Space Camp is a good movie. The plot is predictable. But the actors do the job well and the special effects are appropriate for the time. <br /> <br /> This film was first released about the catastrophic moments of the shuttle. How popular it is. <br /> <br /> The scene where the shuttle door opened in space is so beautiful ... on a large screen that is ... on TV ... It looks normal. I remember. This scene in the theater It makes you feel that you are really there. <br /> <br /> This will be a good movie to watch in IMAX, but I'm sure it won't happen.
