"The Journey of Hope" tells of the poor Turkish families and their hopes that circulated into despair while traveling to Switzerland to find prosperity. Although the film that won the Academy Award was invented quite well. But still lack the content and there are many impossible The time for screening 1.7 hours, mostly on the bus, take the bus, board the boat, board the boat from the car, go to the van, leave the van, etc. The time seems to be better or totally used. The story has predictable conclusions, especially for those who are aware of the general crime of human trafficking in illegal immigrants. Worthy and entertaining watch
