I give only 9 out of 10 because I have to look again in a newer concept in order to have a new perspective. What I remember was a psychological thriller that made my brain and eyes dazzled when I watched it. I'll watch it every time it comes to HBO that day (maybe 1990 or more). I might even record it. But the recording is long gone. I'm sure. <br /> <br /> I wrote to GreenCine to try and use this name. I hope I can find it at a local video store. <br /> <br /> I would suggest trying if you find it somewhere. It's interesting, at least If you enjoy movies like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Gummo or something strange along those lines, try it.
