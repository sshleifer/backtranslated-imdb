The creation of the sitcom world by creating 'Father Ted' Arthur Matthews and Graham's next creation. Linehan is a forgotten gem for the BBC called 'Hippies', although created by a couple - all six scripts written by Arthur Matthews. Just one person <br /> </> Located in London in 1969 - Ray Purbs. The hippie is the editor of an anarchist magazine. His friend is his flatmate, a person who smokes and places marijuana like Alex. His 'girlfriend' is a popular woman, Jill and doesn't have too bright Hugo. <br /> <br /> Simon Peg Kank is the most wonderful person as Ray. In everything he has, this sitcom feels like 'Citizen Smith' about it. Ray is like Wolfie Smith trying to overcome society. But failed miserably Finally, this sitcom will be released in March. I can't wait to buy it. As it was in 1999 and still not repeated on ground television - my memories are not as good as sitcoms. But I still clearly remember two episodes. The first one to open 'Protesting Hippies', which I thought was a good start - that Ray went to protest against the sandpaper and the other episode is 'Hippy Dippy Hippies' which I think Episode 4 is a clear memory about the police again. Sadly, the sitcom has received feedback from viewers. (I can't figure out why) The BBC undertook another series, but Arthur Matthews decided to resist because of a negative reaction. Oh well, I can't wait for the DVD. <br /> <br /> The best episode: Hippy Dippy Hippies- Series 1, Episode 4
