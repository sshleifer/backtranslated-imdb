I've watched this movie and even though I knew who the murderer was from the beginning, I still liked watching it. I will recommend to others. It comes with a lifelong movie network. And I think that because it's close to Halloween, then they may play more So please be careful if you are interested. I believe Alicia Silverstone plays her role very well. I like you very much as an actor and person. She looks good and goes down to the ground. Kevin Dillon, he acted like that for me. I didn't try to knock him or anything. But I believe that Matt, his brother, will be able to pull up this terrible serial killer. Kevin looks too cute for me. But I think he's okay.
