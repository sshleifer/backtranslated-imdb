I do not remember that this movie has a movie release here. I saw it when it came to cable. This film deals with the reduction of humanity's children into the killing machine. One person, especially the way he has been replaced and discarded (literally) in an extraterrestrial community where he finds himself unable to cope with the deal with the person he really is and what he feels. <br /> < br /> It seems to me that many people expect this to be Rambo in space and will be happy if it is <br /> <br /> I am absolutely happy that it can't be - Kurt works. Well in drawing and Emotional disabled The scene that he sits outside of this area shows this, although the decision of the slow-replay will deviate from the moment. <br /> <br /> This is not a classic SF movie in the way Bladerunner A. The silent running of Logan or THX1138 is the most regrettable thing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> He changed the movie to the level he believed. He didn't break Arnie one liners. No absolute happiness. <B r /> <br /> That's why this movie didn't work well. It doesn't follow the formula and in the 18-25 year old American audience who can't forgive because it's not what they expect to see. <br /> <br /> Fear and discipline <br /> Always
