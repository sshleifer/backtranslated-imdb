Masterpieces of comedy, horror stories, masterpieces of love, if there is anything negative to say about the Chinese ghost story, it may be that special effects look old compared to modern technology. This film has simple evidence: poor debt collectors must be in a quiet area while trying to collect debt. Of course, it's a ghost. <br /> <br /> What I didn't expect the first time I watched this movie was that it was one of the most impressive love stories I've ever seen. That is without losing any comedy that will have you in stitches. This Chinese film is different from some Asian movies, not difficult to swallow for people without experience in Chinese culture. Of course, it plays in a timeless form and without the paranormal and romantic culture. <br /> <br /> Think Evil Dead 2 if they throw a wonderful love story in the mix. This movie is true even though it has been overlooked in many ways. It's the best thing I've ever seen. It is the ability to combine the best aspects of many types and cross cultural boundaries to attract humanity everywhere. Highly recommended, 10/10
