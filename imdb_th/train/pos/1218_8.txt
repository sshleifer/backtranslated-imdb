This cartoon is strange, but actually this story has more depth and emotion than other comic movies. We have girls in camps with low self-esteem and almost no friends, except the brothers and sisters who are miserable while she is. She reached the lowest point, and when the opportunity arose, she would make a contract with a demon like a demon. I found that this movie has a lot of truth to life, and when things can't worsen, the woman sees what she does. The twins also developed by helping the little bear and they will feel their own value as well. The message is very positive for children, although some elements of this film are strange. But it's still a fun movie. Music from Stephen Bishop (Tootsie song) makes this movie even better.
