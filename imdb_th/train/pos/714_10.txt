Even if you're not a big Ramones fan, Rock and Roll High School is still the greatest roll-and-roll movie ever. Why? Because under all camphor, it treats with respect to teenagers, insulting and hate. The last scene is the last scene that is glorious and the highest level for the movie I've seen. "My eyes have seen the glory of ..." Rock 'n' roll! <br /> <br />
