This film is a very good entertainment and Jimmy Stewart is as good as Chip Hardesty with the performance of Vera Miles and Murray Hamilton, but this movie directed by legendary director Mervyn Leroy. Be examined and approved by the script, as well as all aspects of the film until the clothes, not that J. Edgar Hoover has nothing to be proud of. His Bureau of Management from 1924 until his death crated in the best investigative service in the world, but in 1959 Hoover became concerned about being forced and began collecting documents about authority to ensure and protect. His small kingdom and he is determined to make sure that no animation shows even a single wart about the office. The film shows the success and continued selection of failures and part of the Bureau of Witch Hunt in the early 1950s. Enjoy the story. But with the tongue firmly in the cheek
