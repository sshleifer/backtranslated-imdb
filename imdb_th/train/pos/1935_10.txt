Writing something that is genuine and accurate is a challenge. Knowing how to shoot and combining together, without making the story a little better I was touched by "A bad swim, big time" and from now on I will promote it as far as I can. It's a shame that I have nothing to show to my friends. (You know, like a DVD ???) because the talk is good ... but giving something better to watch Not everyone can go to the festival to discover the pearls like that, and this movie is worth it to bring out! Thank you very much for the staff of this masterpiece and I'm waiting for it to be published.
