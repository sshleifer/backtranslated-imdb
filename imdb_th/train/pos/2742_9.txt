Richard Brooks, a great movie in 1967 from Truman's Cap Coffin's IN COLD BLOOD novel, is a perfect performance for the Oscar-winning performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman in the CAPOTE year. They were on a separate night). It is unusual to find movies that have been made for over 38 years. Both of these truly strengthen each other. Although different actors will play as Perry Smith and Dick Hickock But both actors blend well Only part of the writer (played by Paul Stewart) in the Brooks movie is weaker because they give a different name. Then with Capote, I recommend watching the CAPOTE first, followed by IN COLD BLOOD. It creates a powerful experience!
