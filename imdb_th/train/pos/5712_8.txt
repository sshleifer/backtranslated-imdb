This movie is a very fun and cheerful movie. <br /> <br /> This movie has the best-looking scenes that you will see in the 30s film, although it's too obvious. Set over real locations Often the characters will fall or shake, shaking the entire goal post to move clearly. <br /> <br /> The best moments of the movie are more quiet and outdated. It shows that Ren√© Clair's true heart is in creating a quiet movie. The overall humor is great in this film. Of course, the time of music is even greater. This is a really fun light and simple early French music. Although the best time is a quiet time But it does not mean that the movie is not full of funny conversations But has been conveyed from the main actors so much that everyone looks like my stage actors Good for the overall style leather and the atmosphere, do not worry pleasant It is not surprising that it works very well, because this movie is based on a stage performance by Georges Berr. <br /> <br /> It's a really great movie with a great camera innovation. Some work very well. Fast and satisfying edits to watch fun sequences There has never been a dull moment in this movie. <br /> <br /> Rene Claire is a brilliant director who knows how to create and plan funny moments in movies. It is a movie that is created creatively, although still being simple all the time as an original and cleverly created movie that has never been entertained before. <br /> <br /> The last half hour is fun. Specially without forgetting Too much and is one of the most wonderful moments and the most creative moments of making early comedy movies. <br /> <br /> This film is full of really fun characters, of course. That is a stereotypical and silly And apparently because of their appearance It adds a funny and captivating atmosphere of light to movies. <br /> <br /> One of the most satisfying films you have ever seen. <br /> <br /> 8/10
