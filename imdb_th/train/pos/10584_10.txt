"Footlight Parade" has many levels of charm. There is no way to "the theater scene prologue" that should be created in any theater in the world. Of course, think of a large pool and three-story fountain for "By A Waterfall" (Berkeley directed John Garfield in "They made me a criminal" Six years later and had a Dead End child singing "By the Waterfall" while they were bathing) <br /> <br /> "Shanghai Lil" is the best amount of production in the picture. It was the Warner Bros. Sensitivity catalog. The African people mixed with the scene with white and Asian prostitutes. You will not see black people gather as social scenes in other movies at that time, unless they are baggage on the train or housewives in the big house. Here, black people are sitting at the bar and singing with others. I was also thrilled when the military dancers made the presentation of the "card part" of Roosevelt's image. There is also an Eagle NRA - the national recovery management logo of the new agreement. FDR is the new president and hope is so high that he pulls the country out of the economic downturn. You've never seen what is a working class that focuses on coming out of MGM. Of course, Warner Bros. supports full mental upgrading by FDR administration. <br /> <br /> Dear Miss Ruby Keeler, never better than you. Playing a Chinese hooker "Lil". She barely looked at her feet while she was dancing, which is one of her shortcomings. <br /> <br /> The basic thing is fun. The number "By a Waterfall" Excellent in that Both girls transformed into swimsuits on crowded buses and speed through Times Square. The Magpie girl who swims through the camera is a target that cannot be seen for 35 years. In the next few months, the production code will eliminate the mischievous happiness.
