50 years old. Imagine a comedy. This story may look old. But it wore with honor. <br /> <br /> This movie is still fun. Crosby never used to bring really romantic material. But he delivers the material that is humorous that requires Bendix to play wide and enjoy in the part that calls for his strengths. Hardwicke - is a pleasure to receive the Knight of the Kingdom - genuine - to make Himself became a caperings like this by being abandoned and Rhonda Fleming enjoyed himself in the most important role. Only Murvyn Vye was disappointed as Merlin. <br /> <br /> Even though it's not music But the song is very good and the "dance" routine that comes with Busy Doing Nothing is perfect - funny, appropriate, maneuverable, without challenges. And create goodness from the music movement of Crosby, which we have fun for ourselves because it has never been his strength before. <br /> <br /> The color is good, the sound is a little mud in the place <br /> And the story - Okay, it takes some freedom with the original. But I wonder if Mr Clemens would be satisfied with the results.
