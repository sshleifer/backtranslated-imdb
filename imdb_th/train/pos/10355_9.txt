An interesting movie from a true story about an Australian woman Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) accused of killing her daughter's daughter. She insists that the dingo take her baby away. But the story is very suspicious. This film is true about the circus of media that happens around the way in which Australians interpret what is presented in the media and the ideas of Lynch groups that lead to women's confidence. I love movies that question the media and movies that focus on people through the justice system. I always thought that the jury should show 12 angry people before they passed their duties. It is not often mentioned that it is a free film. But there is a clinical feature of how our human beings interpret various events based on prejudice and desire to take revenge. The voice in the dark is like a clinic. Schepisi is careful not to make this movie interesting. Some people may find that the movie is boring or dry. But i think it's interesting
