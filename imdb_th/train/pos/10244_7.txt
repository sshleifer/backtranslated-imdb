I will not call it "We are back! The story of the dinosaur "is just an abbreviated version of" Jurassic Park ". I find it more interesting. Like the past, it calls for questions about the safety of living things from one age to ours. But it really opened my eyes when I saw those who gave the voice: John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King to paraphrase: actress "Bravo "Host" Tonight Show ", the most trusted name in the famous chef news, police chief" Young Frankenstein "Lisa Simpson, one of the three Amigos and CNN's men <br /> <br /> But I guess I shouldn't focus on the actors only. I think that this movie has something for both children (fun) and adults (natural history). True, it is an escape. But it's easy to understand. In fact, I would say that John Goodman made Rex's voice. This is the ancestor of his voice in "Monsters Inc".
