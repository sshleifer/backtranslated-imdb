I'm checking out the old VHS tapes that I have and seeing John Denver & The Muppets A Christmas Together. Let me go to my computer and find it to see if I can find the DVD version of this program I was disappointed that I couldn't find it on the DVD. The program was broadcast in 1979 and is a delightful program. I have recordings and CDs. But I prefer to buy a DVD version of this item. Old tape and picture quality is quite good. But the color fading is not as good as the CD There are also a few other songs that are not put on the CD. As a fan of John Denver and from the Muppets, this DVD of the program will be a really good seller. If you don't have a CD, it's a great Chritmas collection of songs from that list. The album is also good if you can find and still have a record player to play.
