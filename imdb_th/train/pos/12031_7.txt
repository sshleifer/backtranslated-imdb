(Warning: small spoilers) <br /> <br /> I ran into this room and looked from there, not knowing what it was or what was the plot. It certainly attracted my attention. I don't know until the end that it's true! The man she used to do dirty, looks like a good guy who just got his head twisted by a winding girl. I have to ask what the truth in the life of the image is. Everyone who will kill a husband and wife because they sleep is not entirely good. Yet I have some sympathy for him as he has been established and exploited; It's very clear. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is the ending. (This is the greatest spoiler! Skip this paragraph if you don't want to learn.) A few minutes before it ends, there seems to be no way to discover the truth. The way that was discovered was in the "sting" operation, but my question was: How could the police convince him to go with it? This film doesn't show us and seems to be too convenient to explain how they are being persuaded. <br /> <br /> I think the way they manage to do it for that purpose. Remarkable Ignoring the explanation causes a radius of doubt to the important scenes that are not there. (We probably already know what the scene is about and what happened to Brad in that) <br /> <br> Otherwise, this movie is quite good. I gave 7/10. It made me think. Now I'm interested in finding the facts of the case. <br /> <br /> Another thing: The movie was created in 1996. Some comments here seem to be considered a newer movie. <br /> <br Lovely PS Meadow Sisto I have never seen her before. You can do a little too. (Always positive in her field, LOL)
