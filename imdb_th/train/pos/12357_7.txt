I like this movie a lot and go back and watch it twice in a week. <br /> <br /> Miss Detmers reinforces acting - she is like a starving cat playing with her prey. She leapt out in anger and received "too young" love and beat the pieces of hundreds of Chinese terrorist mothers of good fiancee. <br /> <br /> The film is full of touches. beautiful Maserati, excellent wardrobe, flower boxes in the roof of the house I especially like the ancient Greek class and reading 'Antigone' <br /> <br /> It has the feeling of 'The Story of O' - That is where people enjoy unrestricted sexual adventures. As she walks around the wonderful apartment in the movie, she is comfortable - and why would he stop? "Devil in the Flesh" <br /> <br /> This movie is real!
