In the spirit of the classic "The Sting", this movie hits the real pain ... in the heart! A suitable female psychiatrist who is hungry for adventure, meets the most dirty and vile of villains. The risky doctor fell in love with the sales person and asked to participate in his operations. While the movie is "slow", it's an amazing climax and end! You will enjoy the doctor. "Forgive yourself" especially!
