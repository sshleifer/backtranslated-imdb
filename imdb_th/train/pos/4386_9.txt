This is a powerful movie. The first time I saw the Scottish accent made me very difficult to understand and made the viewing experience worse How good it is The evil This is Liam Neeson (D) and Tim Roth (evil) both work well He is arrogant and annoying. (He was disgusting and disgusting, critics who ill love his character more than anyone else here) Strong in here as a female lead The movie brings you in and makes you fully involved, preparing to have an emotional experience in watching this program.
