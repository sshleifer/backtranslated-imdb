From the example I saw, I went to "shower" by expecting a cute little comedy. What I discovered was a very appreciating life drama that was told in a lush photographic image. The most I have seen in particular In addition, reflections later made me appreciate the sudden decline of the scenes from the past. (In arid countryside in northern China and in the Tibetan Plateau): This is how memory is not working, right? One time I am here, I'm in the landscape from the past .... <br /> <br /> I'm not only suggesting this movie, I will put it in two. Or the three best movies I've seen in my 60 years. <br /> <br /> By the way, a couple of years ago, "funny", other Asian, was released in the United States as "Will we dance?" (Japan). Like "Shower", this example does not indicate the depth of the film, which is a delicate psychological study. (Although it is filled with funny moments) On the part of the distributors, there is a fear of creating movies that appear "important" or "deep" too that will attract viewers in S. S.?
