Turkish bath set in a noir movie set in New York in the 50s. That must be hinted at something! Something that is curious in previous comments. No one points out. But it seems I need to understand this movie. <br /> <br /> The order of the Turkish Baths: The road behind the night, the entrance of The gentle sauna and Scalise wrap one piece to massage his thighs. Steve, the masseuse is a rough boxer (Beefcake!) And another person is a bodyguard? Finish dressing up Apparently Dixon hated what he saw. We know that he has a reputation for causing police suspects to be good but easy to control. Why do they hate them so much? <br /> <br /> Is it possible that he will hate himself? Is he a part of himself from his father? The dark side that can take him to the destination. Foot to the trough? What happens if the dark side lies in "wardrobe"? Remember: Whenever Dixon meets Scalise (3 times), the man is lying in bed and he has But the guy around him to be friends (a poster of "Girls" stuck on the wall near his bed!) /> <br /> Scalise acted funny: the affected manners cranking his neck like Arrogant, challenged, shoving his inhalator (poppers?) Into his nostril every time he talks with Dixon. Dixon with a vengeful bend, Scalise, who doesn't seem to understand: "I never saw a man full. Go with hatred while you me I think it's almost funny how you come alone. "Four years jumped at me. As if I was a special person! why? "<br /> <br /> Because Scalise is really special: He is the direct successor of Dixon's father:" Your father likes me "," Your father keeps me in business. "He stands as the brother of Dixon, a criminal, a dark side, an avatar and, above all, he likes the company of men. Dixon knows well:" Who killed him (Paine)? Are you or one of your friends playing? "Playmates! Notice that each time they meet Dixon manhandles Scalise: He takes the address book out of the jacket, slaps him in the face, slaps him. Scalise: "I warn you that don't touch me! Or make a difference: his homosexual, which is not expressed Dixon, also known as Dixon, is the son of a thief. In this reaction, he decides to be a good cop. But there are some things that The criminals in his dark side: He is a violent copper, murderer, liar. In addition, he is not married, bringing a "dizzy blonde" to the place he was familiar every time ago. The waitress scoffed, saying that he didn't know how to love a woman. Dixon was guilty and hated himself for those reasons. "The hat and gangster like his old man, the blood will tell." San decides to sacrifice himself: if he gets an ego, Scalise his ego that will kill him, he will free himself from the guilt and free the woman and her father. <br /> <b r /> <br /> At the end of the movie, bringing us back to the opening sequence: Scalise is pushed in the trough and Dixon deserves the right to walk on the sidewalk and win her love. Eventually, <br /> < br /> The unspoken theme of the movie may be the person who conceals his oppressive feelings, wants to experience the love of a woman (Jean Douchet). <br /> <br /> (These notes are owed. The film was very criticized by Jean Douchet on the French DVD, edited by CarlottaI.
