Mr. Destiny - 3.5 / 5 stars <br /> <br /> The theme "Mr. Destiny" is recycled from many movies, which consist of many different years. Its themes range from recent spoofs in the plan (see "Scrooged") to serious and amazing ideas that work in "It's a Wonderful Life" and a century earlier in the story of Scrooge according to Charles Dickens "Christmas song" "It's related to an ungrateful man in his life's guided tour and witnessing what his life will be. (Or likely) first hand. <br /> <br /> In most movies of this type The guardian angel saved a man from ungratefulness and showed him that his life in retrospect, or that it should be, should be received.

The program with Jon Lovitz, when Hello, broke down, he walked into a bar looking for a paid phone and reluctantly decided to tell the bartender (Michael Caine) about the way. His life changed This is where we saw him for the first time, remembering that he hit baseball in his childhood. <br /> <br /> The bartender listened and nodded, apparently not having to worry about other customers. This may be due to the fact that the bar, although old and tattered, seems to have never had a living human being to save these two men. In fact, Larry also commented on having never seen a bar before. This is most likely for some reason that the audience expected before Larry <br /> <br /> The bartender, who may be the angel of God, reincarnated as Clarence fixes Larry. His special drink, which ended with the life of Larry in the opposite state, showed him what his life would be. Was like if he hit home runs many years ago, but Larry had no idea of ​​any changes at first, just as Jimmy Stewart did not know that Clarence had erased his life until he entered the bar and was fired. Larry also Probably forgot any changes until he returned home for Find a different lawn outside and a big wrestler occupying his home. <br /> <br /> Larry soon finds out that his life is very different if he runs back.

"Mr. Destiny" shows us that material wealth is not like spiritual wealth as a lesson. Teach us over and over again But never quite soft, memorable and truly cute as shown in "Mr. Destiny". <br /> <br /> "Mr. Destiny" has never been so hilarious, but it is a good-natured comedy that doesn't Used to be too serious Problems with "It's a wonderful life" that has retaliation like "The Family Man" is that they try to be influential and memorable as "It's a wonderful life." But only a few times you can screen a famous movie alone and "Mr. Destin here" knows this and plays the correct role. It doesn't try to be anything. Rather something that doesn't try and this is clear to the audience. <br /> <br />
