The world of Damon Runyon in Times Square in New York before Disney Fusion is the basis for this musical. Joseph L. Mankiewicz, the man who knows about the movie, has directed this nostalgia for "The crossroads of the world" that shows us that the bottom of New York in the past, Frank Loesser's music sounds great. We look at the beautiful characters that are typical of the area. People on the edge of society tend to lean toward that area because of the light, the action, the possibility of that part of the city. The weakness of this city makes life outside of street life very violent. <br /> <br /> Some songs from original production are not included in the movie. We don't know if it's reasonable or not. But this is not uncommon for Hollywood musicals to change and correct what works on the stage. The original actors included Vivian Blaine and Stubby Kaye, who were fantastic and we wondered about the decision not to let Robert Alda, Sam Levene, Isabel Bigley repeat their original roles. These outstanding actors can create amazing works. <br /> <br /> This film is an amazing picture. Luke follows the fashion of time. As far as Marlon Brando's casting, otherwise Frank Sinatra and Jean Simmons still don't know his singing ability. After that, Sky Masterson is a man who will watch. Is a girl if he presents a different 'Luke' Frank Sinatra did well like Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons, as Sarah Brown, did an excellent job in showing that woman from the rescue team who met the same man she tried to save her life. She never stood still as a surprise as Miss Adelaide, a young woman with a golden heart that was loved by Nathan Detroit. Miss Blaine made a wonderful impression as a woman who was smarter than she was. Stubby Kaye created a wonderful work from his beautiful Nicely Johnson indemnity. Great with Abe Burrows, a talented person The costume by Irene Sharaff is the right sounder.
