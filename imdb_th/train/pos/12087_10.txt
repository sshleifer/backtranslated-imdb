I take the opportunity "Hardcastle and McCormick" by buying the first season. (Canadian release) from Amazon. When I received, I started with a pilot and I was hooked immediately after that. I rated 5 stars on Amazon and I gave 10 stars. Here it is good. My favorite thing is the opening and closing theme and of course the logo of Stephen J. Cannell at the end of each episode. But the most important is the relationship between the judge and Mark while they work together to break each case. I was so impressed that I bought the second season as a friend and I enjoyed it equally. If you don't have this great series on the disc, I believe you should buy it and put it in your collection.
