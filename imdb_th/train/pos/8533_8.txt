This movie is the most Lupine story, especially from other Funimation and bad dubbing is not bad. <br /> <br /> The first hour is like Comic (which is all Lupine 3 is based on) Lupine tries to get great treasures. Fujiko uses Lupine's weaknesses with women to try to get something out. The last bit is not bad. He is with other women, but of course, Fujiko is still number one. <br /> <br /> Many Lupine movies are family with more swearing words. Lupine A good Lupine fan, whoever I think would be surprised (I know that after hearing many bad things about this movie) it may be a little better if there are no small animations rolling between the credits. (It makes it look soft) But overall it's not a bad movie. Good enough to be one of the few people I will watch the movie Lupine III again.
