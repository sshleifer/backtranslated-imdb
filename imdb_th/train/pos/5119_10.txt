I must say that this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I can't count the number of times I have seen I love John Travolta. But the first time the camera moved his body after he was neat and beautiful for his first trip at Gilley, I was scared. Debra Conservative always shows the perfect performance as a young wife, an offshoot of shoots. But with the attitude needed to marry a cowboy stubborn and work hard If you are not a country music person, I am not. This is a 1 sound track that will let you sing along with every word. If you have a chance, please watch this movie - it won't disappoint.
