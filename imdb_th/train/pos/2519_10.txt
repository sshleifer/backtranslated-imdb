This movie is really special. It's a very beautiful movie. Which started with three orphans, Sho, his brother, Shinji and their friends Toshi. They were poor children living on the road. But one day they succeeded in stealing a bag full of money and then they could live to buy. Houses and their lives seem to be much better. They are looking for new friends, life, friends. But there was something wrong and they became enemies and it ended up killing them. <br /> <br /> I was negative about this movie at first because when the singer (Gackt - Solo, former singer in Malice Mizer, Hyde - Solo, singer in L'Arc ~ en ~ Ciel, both very popular in Japan and Wang Lee-Hom - Taiwanese singer), trying to be an actor But unlike other singers - movies One of my favorite movies Maybe a little because I'm a big fan of Hyde, but - it's a movie that made me discover him. <br /> <br /> Okay, Gackt (playing the main character - orphaned boy) is part of the group that wrote the script. And he is the person who confirms that Hyde should be a vampire, KK friend of Cho At that time, they didn't know each other, at least not like friends. But after the movie, they became really good friends and that showed us that they worked hard with this movie and they had good cooperation. <br /> <br /> Many different feelings, hate, sadness, pain, loneliness, happiness and others. I think the first hour is the best. It's very beautiful. After the people were dying, Kei went away and it changed a lot. But it was a great movie. It was the only movie that made me cry. It ended in sadness. But still beautiful. <br /> <br /> So if you haven't seen this movie yet Because it's wonderful, but sad. You won't regret ^^
