Ira Levin's Deathtrap is one of the mysterious movies in Sleuth's tradition that can be easily broken if the plot is verified. So I will briefly talk about a play, a man who is a famous playwright, another mysterious man who is a promising writer, younger and sexier playwright's wife. Should be For the ride, director Sidney Lumet had no strangers in filming quite well, for the most part, to create the tension that this film had to use. The dialog is fast, fresh and witty. Michael Caine is good at this role. Christopher Reeve is really helpful and growing up with you. The more you see him acting, Irene Wirth, stands out as a funny psychic. Dyan Cannon? The love that Lumet kept behind her in tight tight pants and was the best fit. But she has a terrible mistake in this role, which is a role that should be given to older actresses. But why the quibble with a clear attempt to bribe the male audience when nothing is changed now? Deathtrap is fun, funny, witty and level. The mystery has some obvious flaws that have diverted some and I am not very satisfied with the ending. But watching Ken and Reeve under the direction of Lumet with Levi's extravagance is enough to hold my attention.
