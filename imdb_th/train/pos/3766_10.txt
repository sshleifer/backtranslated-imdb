The epic of creating images in a style that is not imitation. <br /> <br /> This film may not have the most drama, alternative or artistic performances. But who dares to say that this movie is not art? I'm not a supporter of the idea that important films must be serious, non-commercial, or disturb me with questions. Even though there are many movies But I like this feature. <br /> <br /> Bogus Journey is definitely not one of the movies. What you get is pure creativity and abundant with positive and innocent energy. This film does not reflect reality. It's friendly and innocent. Imagine the world of the future described by Rufus - for me, it should be a mixture of places and times that are worth it! Except that song -) <br /> <br /> Technically, Bogus Jorney is very good. I always like movies and scenes of this movie. Especially at this point, traveling is a scam. It's a very far-reaching gathering. The result is good as well, and I think most of them do without using CGI. I always like good old effects in low-cost movies. Of course 'Another Hollywood movie' from the perspective of people But I think it is a very charming way. <br /> <br /> A short word for the soundtrack: bands and orchestras all work well with movies. In addition, the sound design is not lacking. I'm not a fan of rock music. But I have to be followed by Winger from the 'station', creating a bill and Ted robot in the van. I liked the unorthodox camera at first. <br /> <br /> May I summarize: <br /> <br /> This movie is innocent and has a lot of imagination! It's a better way Panzerkreuzer Potemkin, The Godfather, Eraserhead or Aguirre - The Wrath of God It's better than Kane, the Apocalypse now or the Chris Sanzo logo ... ... It's better than Total Recall ... No way!? Yes! <br /> <br /> Kill Bogus Journey of Bill and Ted is the best movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Who dares to disagree, makes himself guilty of behavior. (What is the bigger self-defamation?) <br /> <br /> PS: Part 1 is not a better movie, so Bogus Jorney is a great sequel. Not even Terminator 2 is a great sequel! it was not!
