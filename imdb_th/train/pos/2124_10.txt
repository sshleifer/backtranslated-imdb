This is a truly classic movie in presenting stories, performances and movies. The best actor is composed of both Miss Sullivan and Jimmy Stewart as the frontline characters. In real life, she was greatly appreciated and liked Jimmy and gave him the role of acting for the first time and helped him to be more calm. "Chemistry" between the two is clear and warm and fun to see. She is a beautiful and fascinating woman in her personality. The story of these two young people and eventually they come together in the end is the charm of watching and entertainment, pure magic. There is also a presentation of warmth from other actors in this great film / story. I gave Miss Sullivan the perfect 10 in this golden age classic movie which has a special charm for all generations. Must see it all!
