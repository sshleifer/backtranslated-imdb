This show has a great story! It's very reliable! A man's wife died and he could not take care of one child, so he called his brother-in-law's best friend, like Rebeecca Donaldson, Comet, a cute dog. But strong, Nikki and Alex that you can discover by yourself (DJ's close friend) But the kids are also great. This is Mary Kate and Ashley. First! And you may know Candace Cameron Bure from the performance of St.Elsewere Punky Brewster and that is like a crow! Jodi Sweetin plays a step in a childhood with love. Really, this is a very good performance!
