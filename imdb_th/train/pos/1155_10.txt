It's very funny. It has great actors that each give excellent performances, especially Sally Field and Kevin Kline. It's a screenplay written by Andrew Bergman (Honeymoon in Vegas). I don't like drama. Sewage even though I didn't see it But I like this movie a lot because it's crazy and then closing the wall. It beats hell from stupid soaps that they have in the daytime. In my opinion, it's the best movie of 1991.
