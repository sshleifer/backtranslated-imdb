I consider myself to appreciate David Lynch's work very much because he gives a unique animation with the typical "Lynch" element. When he saw almost all of his work, I thought I would predict the next step of Lynch was innocent. I was wrong. Dumbland was something I never imagined under the name of David Lynch. Still, after I first recovered from the shock, I began to think about this original main character and I concluded that all the nonsense, cruelty, cruelty and disgust that was presented reflected this. real There is something in our lives that we never give importance because it's disgusting or scary. However, they surround us. So I dare say that Dumbland emphasizes these things. This is not a movie to be entertained, although sometimes you laugh out with a distorted sense of humor. This is a motion picture reflection of everything we refuse to observe with simplicity, irregularity and irrationality. Used as is, you don't need to like It actually exists And finally, if you care enough, you'll find Lynch's typical elements as well. I recommend this place for generous people !!!
