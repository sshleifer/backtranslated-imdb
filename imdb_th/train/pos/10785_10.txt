I saw that when I was still young and excellent, Kelsey White was a lovely Lisa and Meecy Mices. Susan Bonde is a Doodle and Sandra Dee Heidecke is a Snoodle that Hilarius Karen Boettcher-Tate as Profster. Interesting. Burl Ross is Little Bunny Foo Foo. Gregory Donavon jokes while Kaiso is great. Whats Hilarius, Snoodle and Doodle eat too much candy. What a tragedy that Little Bunny Foo, who attacked Meecy Mices on the head, then the fairy will give Little Bunny Foo Foo with a little desire. This story is about when Lisa, Snoodle, Doodle goes to the Candy Rock Big Mountains. This performance is great. Kids will like this show, new words, songs and watch them play.
