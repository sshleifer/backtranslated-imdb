I'm a big fan of Stephen King's work and this movie makes me a big fan of the King. The pet Sematary is about the Creed family. They just moved into a new home and they seem happy. But there is a pet cemetery behind their house. Juded Creed's new neighbor (played by Fred Gwyne) describes the burial ground behind the pet cemetery. The burial area is pure evil. The judge told Louis Creed that when you buried a human (Or any kind of pet) in the burial place, they will come back to life again The only problem is that when they return, they are not the same person. They are evil. Soon after, Jud explains everything about Pet Sematary. Everything will start to hell. I will not explain anymore because I do not want to separate the main parts in the movie. The performances that Pet Sematary did quite well But need a little work The story is one of the main parts of this film, mainly because it is original and catchy. This film has many makeup effects that make the movie look even more creepy and scary. One of the most fundamental reasons why this film sends my back pain is in fact the impact of makeup. There is one character in this film that is truly insensitive. The character is "Zelda". This character appears in the movie about three times for precision. Zelda is Rachel's sister, who had passed away many years ago. But Rachel still haunts her. The first time Zelda appeared in this film was not scary because she didn't say anything. But the second time is the worst and the second straight talk makes me afraid of the living person. **** There is nothing wrong with this movie. It's almost perfect. Pet Sematary gives great fear. Some wonderful shows, first-rate plot and mesmerizing makeup. This is one of the most favorite horror movies of all time. 10 out of 10
