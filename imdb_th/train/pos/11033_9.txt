I don't think I can understand Renny Harlin's hatred of 'Die Hard 2' is great and he gave the world. 'Cliffhanger', which is one of the best action movies ever Correct, little punks, 'Cliffhanger' rules, and we all know well. <br /> <br /> The cunning player, Gabe Walker, a former rescue climber who 'just went' his old town when he was asked help Former friend Haltker (Michael Ruger) helps to help on top of him Clearly, Walker came back at a convenient time because the people in the band were a complex band of robbers, led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow), certified & lost a lot of money, even though they were He stole from the US government somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and they wanted it back ... <br /> <br /> Basically 'Cliffhanger' is another form of 'Hard Hard'. Just exchange the boundaries of Nakatomi Plaza to the open mountains of the Rocky Mountains, along with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our heroes and make him die Naturally, that setting was torn to pieces soon because Stallone's character easily avoided many bullets and slapped his face in stone for the first time without any side effects. clear Finally, what is the action movie about? <br /> <br /> 'Cliffhanger' is one of the most exciting action movies. Performing fantastic scenes and stunt scenes, one of the previous stunts, is one of the best stunts I have ever seen in a movie, and while the rest of the movie doesn't get better than at first, it still continues. Ultimate action The villain, led by John Lickow, has entertainment and is a bad friend. May be one of the best villains. <br /> <br /> 'Cliffhanger' is one of Stallone's best efforts. Renny Harlin's best efforts and exciting action movies - 9/10
