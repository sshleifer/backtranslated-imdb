FORBIDDEN PLANET is one of the best examples of Hollywood SF movies. Its influence felt for over a decade. However, some elements related to this widescreen entertainment are aimed at middle-aged audiences who have now disappeared for quite a long time, and sometimes movies walk slowly and do not help. But the main interesting idea of ​​the story that is related to the ancient civilization of the extinct Krell and "Monsters from Id" didn't attract attention and still make this movie a "must see" movie. The thing that I'm most interested in saying here is the current DVD for this movie, very bad. This film never looks good in home videos and its elements need to be refreshed. I hope that will happen soon and we will receive this special SF Classic.
