I find it very interesting that this film can bridge the gap between my American culture and the creators of China. It became a story about values ​​and made viewers watch their own choices in life and institutional loyalty. Amazingly enough to do this in a gentle and gentle manner, which, when looking back, threatens his original status. I enjoy the movie and will watch again if possible.
