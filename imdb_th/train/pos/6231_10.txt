This is a great movie, fun and cute. It captures the true essence of the decade and the people and tells the beautiful love story of two brothers and two crew members. Although this movie is only white and black But it is not counted in the present day The main objective of this film is immortality. The film has excellent performances, music and numbers, excellent dance, as well as great design and shock. Follow the Fleet is a joke. There are funny moments that will make you laugh But other times that the show gets you involved in the story It is amazing that this movie may have been set up in the last decade. If you want to see something great, try it out.
