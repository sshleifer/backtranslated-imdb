Last night I saw this movie on cable and it was a special story. What I like most about this is that it is low and important. Of Henry Thomas (He played the boy in E. T.) The performance is not good. (He should be a few people) David Straithern is a great villain. And amazing (From which we are talking about Hollywood products here). Babies act as the main characters. But people who do not show or have lines But rather Interesting to know that the mysterious relationship of Thomas E.T. is the heart of this film. While his bond The baby acts as the core of "good children". <br /> <br /> Then there is a song - Oh, what song !! The song of Gillian Welch is great and all scores are beautiful country music. <br /> <br /> This film has a great atmosphere. I highly recommend
