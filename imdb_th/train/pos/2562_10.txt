This is one of the greatest love story movies I've ever seen. Yes, I agree that some parts may look obsolete. But this didn't distract from the movie Should try to observe, criticize and enjoy all forms of art from the perspective of time Obviously, according to the standard "sex in the city", Charlie Chaplin is horribly boring. However, when judging from the expectations of 1925, America was amazing. In the same way, Sayonara is a progressive film that looks like a love story with a variety of races, arrogance and prejudices that appear in America and the complexity of different cultures. It is a natural next step for movies such as Gentleman's Agreement. However, its purpose is not just a social explanation. But it is entertaining and entertaining, with countless chapters that everyone will not forget. <br /> <br /> However, even if it's just a love story, it's great, even though Brando's accent attacks sometimes. He will be as close as possible in a slightly different manner. Buttons and umeki (Which both won the Oscar) and the rest of the actors helped to increase the popularity of the movie. <br /> <br /> Taka, a true star, has done a great job, making you feel fascinated by Brando while being torn. Lacking with her commitment and loyalty Her words when she met and talked to Brando for the first time were something classic and something if never paired in the cinema. The conversation between Taka and Brando in her dressing room in Tokyo at the end of this movie is quite good. Of course, it doesn't have to suck the mouth, spit and worse, which is an example of love in today's movies. But that makes it all better It represents true love and passion, not just "heat". If the film doesn't touch you, it shows that you're too young, scornful or dead.
