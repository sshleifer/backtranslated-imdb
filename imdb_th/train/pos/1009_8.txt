Reality: Stargate SG-1 is a wonderful Sci-Fi TV series. <br /> <br /> There are no facts to escape. You try to forgive yourself or explain that Stargate SG-1 is still a wonderful Sci-Fi TV series. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG-1 lends and steals ideas quickly. Not as impressive as it should be, and that action will not leave you out of the chair. Or the sofa for that matter <br /> <br /> But and this is where I think Stargate SG-1 deserves all the credit to get for every episode or every stolen idea. I think you can count Get at least one sci-fi movie that's worse than the one hour TV show. <br /> <br /> In fact, some episodes may be 90 minutes long and still better than most movies. <Br / > <br /> <br /> and the ability to heal Image throughout the show, and delivery and pushing the story is what makes Stargate SG-1 was something special <br /> <br /> I am careful in my choice. I follow maybe one or two TV series and I hold a very high standard which makes me even more surprised when I find myself caught. <br /> <br /> So for those who decide to Use Stargate SG-1 now. Another tasteless sci-fi show. Stick with it and you'll see what I'm talking about.
