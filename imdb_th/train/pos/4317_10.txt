I like this movie a lot when it is released and I still do it because the story makes you feel hopeful in general life and people as well ... One of the things I like about Lawrence Kasdan's movies. Feeling positive from the movie and there are other reasons that make it like the Grand Canyon. For one thing, it has outstanding actors ... For example, Kevin Kline and Danny Glover, in my opinion, Crash, the highly regarded movie that won the Oscars for the best image, is similar to the movie. This much The difference is that Grand Canyon makes you feel good. The mistake has the opposite effect on me. It is very dark. I will choose Grand Canyon above mistakes every day.
