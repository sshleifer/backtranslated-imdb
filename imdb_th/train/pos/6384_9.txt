Is written in stone that Disney animation must be a musical drama, right? Where? Show me because I found that this effort was even more fun than not having to put up with five-year Disney music standards. <br /> <br /> While the story didn't make it as charming as it should be, it was still good. Fun and adventurous I hope to get more. Yes, then consider this. But this movie is not ~ the bitter disappointment or the greatest failure that it has been charged. <br /> <br /> The quality of animation is moderate. But the dialogue is quite interesting as well as the storyline, story, plot, sub story and amazing creativity that I found in this production I will refrain from summarizing the story as I have already done. But this movie is worth watching if you are a fantasy fan. <br /> <br /> This is my opinion. THE Disney is the best movie, length, motion feature. <br /> <br /> Rate 9.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Demon:
