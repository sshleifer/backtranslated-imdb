I was surprised that no one mentioned that there were two versions of the same movie. The share of both lion images is the same. But this is where they differ: in one version (The version that I have seen most often on the broadcast TV program) The entrance guardian group consists of "Brotherhood of the Guardians", a group of priests and siblings "wearing" by sectarian groups In another version that I saw once on TV, the monk who oversaw the gateway was formally painted as a priest of the church, referring to the Archdiocese of New York. (Or Brooklyn) In addition, in the old version, in most of the related scenes, the priest called "brothers" (and in some scenes, you can see that the lips say "Father", so - and - but the voice says " Brother "so-so in the latter generation, I believe everyone is called" Father "<br /> <br /> In any case, it seems that one of these two versions will have some more or less again - shoot people. Other with "Brotherhood of the Pitt Lahore "New-shot scenes as" the Archdiocese "scene or vice versa (A pattern that reminds me of the Raymond Burr cut scene in "Godzilla") I recorded both videos. Models that are broadcast on TV, so no, I didn't imagine this. Can anyone clarify the story behind these two movies?
