John Waters' most easily accessible movie is one of his best films, considering that it cut all the bitterness and vulgarity that seemed to make his previous work all out. Of course, nudity and sexual references are still there, at least in the form of <br /> <br /> that can't be considered too nasty or disgusting. With an excellent selection of actors, this film creates a frenzy associated with modern art and the nature of your modern artist. Funny and quite happy (If possible for Waters) This is one of the movies that I will watch on a rainy day.
