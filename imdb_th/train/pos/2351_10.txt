First of all, I want to clarify that the average user who can't appreciate the imagination is scary. What makes this program special is the fact that it is beyond reality. You don't have to know why Ned can bring people back from death or just for a moment. Where to tell the strange story of a lost child like A Wrinkle in Time There is no room for imagination or surprise. <br /> <br /> It is good to add excitement to the television experience. <br /> <br /> My greatest reality is acting. Setting the style of the 1950s, innocent and rare characters, and the scenery and physical settings that do not mean pure reality. <br /> <br /> This performance conceals the nature of death . While other TV entertainment programs have been put back in this series It returns a feeling of curiosity, imagination and novelty to the television. <br /> <br /> Fast daisy pushing makes it the top of my list.
