I was very impressed with this custom made small picture. Stories about social outcasts that meet together as friends and provide help systems that both seem to be lacking as children. Sometimes it is hilarious, sometimes sad. Most songs by underground bands are used for good results, as well as experimenting with camera angles, filters and slow or fast motion techniques. Performances (actors led by writers and film directors) are the best that I Have seen in the past few years If you ever feel like a square pin that has been forced to fit in a round slot, I really believe that you will appreciate "By Hook or By Crook".
