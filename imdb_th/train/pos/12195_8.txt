Every movie in the early days of Orson Welles was a victory to The Third Man and Joseph Cotton. He's still great in Touch Of Evil. See them all! He tends to be exaggerated and to serve himself in a movie like F. It's a fake story. It's really stupid. Don't waste your time watching it. It's really stupid. Orson Welles is a movie icon and everyone who studies. The movie should see everything he filmed. All his top women are great. But eventually Wales became a drunken person like his character in A Touch Of Evil! For some reason, Orson Welles has a way with women. I see that he may be regarded as interesting in his youth, unlike Gary Cooper or Joseph Cotton or Cary Grant, John Wayne. I can go on. But I'm talking about ... and because I'm a woman, I can see his charm. He (Orson Welles) is one of the last true filmmakers and if you don't count the filmmakers today: Tarantino, Scorscese, Spike Lee, most filmmakers do not measure film makers of the Forties! I know that there are many great filmmakers today. But in a short time I can't name them all There is no fault for this great filmmaker of the millennium! August 21, 2006 Please remind me about the upcoming filmmakers and coming. I don't want to be stuck in the past! Now I like some movies. But there is none that I will be on the list of "100 best" .. "hustle and flow" is very good, so "Fargo" and "Oh, brother, where are you," from the line of travel Sullivan; Another good movie from the forties! Can anyone give me the best program for me with the 90's and until 2006? I want to know who looks! Thank You! Also assembled with this site! Where you can plug the film or boo! I like ranting and raving from normal people like me who can say what I want and I promise not to destroy any movies for people who have never seen before!
