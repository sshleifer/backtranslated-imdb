Chris and Andre are two normal teenagers. Misunderstood by some people and chosen by others But they stand together and everyone will pay Together they founded "Second Army". They planned and planned "Zero Day". That day was when they decided to invade their high school and kill 14 people in cold blood. Told through the tape that they made "Zero Day". It was telling the wrong Columbine tragedy story. <br /> <br /> "Zero Day" is one of the movies that will make your head messy later. Two main actors (Calvin Robertson and Andre Koch) performed very well that their characters seemed to be teenagers who were eligible to walk on the road. Their performances are very reliable. You like these guys a lot and that's scary. Taking almost all videos from the perspective of a teenager, "Zero Day" feels like real and genuine, just like you are there. These children try to rationalize the audience and actors for you. But have to warn that it follows the tragedy from beginning to end and the ending makes it shocking and uncomfortable for some people
