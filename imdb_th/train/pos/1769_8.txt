Just came out of a sneak preview for this movie It made me laugh every 30 seconds. The ending was so funny that my tears broke my face and made me think that I didn't buy a large coke. There are some lullabies. But overall it was very fun The movie makes Steve Karel have the opportunity to shine after stealing interest from both Jim Carrey in "Bruce Almighty" and Will Ferrell "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgendy" in their movie Paul Rudd is as hilarious as ever. I love that he can be very funny in these spacious comedies and still work in indie dramas (like PS). I think Sethrogen should work more because he is talented and involved. Leslie Mann also has an incredibly funny moment. I highly recommend it for those who want to laugh like crazy. However, if you're easily offended, don't see this movie. If you're a crazy feminist, don't watch this movie. And please do not think that even if you think you are one of those "hip" parents, don't take your children to watch this movie Of course, you should let your teenager go to watch this movie. Don't watch with them. It will make the moment incredibly uncomfortable.
