Robert Wuhl is teaching students in film classes at New York University in Manhattan, New York. <br /> <br /> He covers the misunderstandings about history and the truth that is not generally known anymore. I want to see this program a lot. It's very fun. Mr. Wuhl uses examples and "shows and tells" to receive his points. He explained that Paul Revere's midnight horse was not Paul Revere! Henry Wadsworth Longfellow used Revere's name because it sounds better. <br /> <br /> I've been watching Robert Wuhl for many years since he performed. Funny, stand up and pass "Arli $$" HBO. He is a good actor and a great comedian. But he is a great teacher! I suggest you watch the episode of this show. It's worth your time
