Two years ago I watched "The Matador" in the cinema and I loved everything about this movie. Obviously I was totally impressed with the beautiful role of Pierce Brosan. Yesterday I watched this movie again on TV, so I looked a little deeper. Now I can say confidently that this movie is not a special matter. But you just have to love it because a man <br /> <br /> Brosnan elevated in my opinion with the amazing performance of Julian Noble, a tired killer who doesn't have friends. Soon, Julian met Danny Wright. (Greg Kinney) in Mexico City, an unfortunate man: his son died due to an accident. His job was not good and he wasn't sure he would keep his wife. Pe / br>> <br /> Always like this movie Crime movies with humor Most of the humor comes from Brosnan while he tells a joke about the big dwarf d .... or one of my favorite lines in this movie: "I look like a coward in Bangkok on Sunday morning. Brosnan said. That it is charming as he drinks his margarita as usual. I also like Greg 'a typical American face' Greg in the role of a loser that is very lively because there are many people like Danny Wright <br /> <br /> So I recommend You see the role of Brosnan's best ever, he will make you smile and appreciate him in the Great Brosnan in the film are excellent as well.
