"Spaced Invaders" is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I do not understand why this film is not better criticism. It's funny, harmless and sweet. I watched it first when I was 11 and I really fell in love with it ... 2 days later I received in the VHS :-P. To this day I have shown many friends and they like it. But no one knows this movie before I think that's a problem almost nobody knows, so almost no one can like it ... This movie has never had a real chance. Sadly, "SI" has the potential to be funny, like "Monsters Inc." Or " Spaceballs "OK, not satisfied enough - what I want to say is if you want to laugh out. Even if you're not angry, it's worth watching! -> Prepare to laugh the garbage land!
