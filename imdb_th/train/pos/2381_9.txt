"The Classic War of the Worlds" by Timothy Hines is a visibly entertaining movie that strives to strive to create the classic book of H. G. Wells. Mr. Hines succeeded in doing so. Me and the people who watched his movie with me appreciated the fact that it was not a predictable Hollywood fare standard that came out every year, such as the Spielberg version and the Tom Cruise that is similar to a little book Obviously, everyone is looking for things in the movie. Those who see themselves as "critics", amateurs, are only looking to criticize everything they can. Others rate movies on a more important basis, such as entertainment, which is why most people never agree with "critics". We enjoy Mr. Hines's effort to be honest with HG's classic novel. Wells and we find it fun. This makes it easy to see what "critics" perceive as flaws.
