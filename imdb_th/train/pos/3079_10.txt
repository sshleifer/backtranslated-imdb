While listening to the audio book, Cambpell Scott was a reader. I was very excited to hear his voice and that made me disappointed that "Six Degrees" was canceled. That can connect to the story of the item It's a shame and shame in the network that doesn't allow this performance to be filled with opportunities in the season. This is a great show to watch with great actors. A network for witches. The second chance "Men in Trees" is a great list. But they closed the "invasion" and that was completely different. Why the network can't get it right?
