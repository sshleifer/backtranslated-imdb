I accidentally watched this movie because I was released free of charge, which was not new from the blockbuster, and had to grab something quickly because the store was already ready for the evening. Plain white collar and my name is amazed. I am a "older" woman and my son is a 30-year-old young man. I like movies that provide full entertainment such as The Sixth Sense, interviews with vampires, Harry Potter and Beetlejuice. Enjoy foreign movies with special expertise, such as movies directed by Bergman or Hertz Niche. In general, we hate each other's movie choices. But we both see and love this movie! It's not like the movie we've seen before. We are both people who have a sarcastic / critique personality and we often play movies while we watch them - but in this case we just laugh and enjoy the movie from beginning to end. We are of the opinion that if the film is promoted and screened in the main theaters in the United States, it should be very good.
