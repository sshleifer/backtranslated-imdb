I give 10 points out of 10. Why? <br /> <br /> * Offer insights about things I hardly understand - surfers because of everything they want to do; It seems that nothing else is as important as surfing. And it's not a temporary thing - it's the life of these people * buried in this movie is a great history of surfing I never surf But I love surfing movies and seeing many things. No one taught me what this movie was doing. * This film has been well resolved. It flows well. The interview is great. * It's interesting from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> In summary, it About a documentary that is as good as I've seen, so I have to rate it in terms of it. So 10/10
