Today, Spielberg "The Color Purple" is most often remembered as being nominated for eleven Academy Awards and zilch Awards. What's more shocking is Spielberg's nomination. Excellent director The filmmakers deserve more admiration than they agreed. <br /> <br /> The story of the trials and tribulations of Celie Johnson (Whoopi Goldberg), an African-American woman who took the position in first Father then by her inappropriate husband This film takes years and focuses primarily on Sealy's relationship with women around her. It is said from a woman's perspective. But you don't have to fear that it is 'Flick the chicks' saccharine <br /> <br /> The story is interesting and sometimes humorous, even though the main character's fight is great. Some people may not be satisfied with the sound changes at the end of the movie. But I didn't think of anything, even though the similar content in the movie that was less than that might make me open my eyes. <br /> <br /> The film was nominated: Whoopi Goldberg (actress Excellent), Oprah Winfrey (Best Supporting Actress) and Margaret Avery (Best Supporting Actress) Believe <br /> <br /> Already mentioned Spielberg was not nominated for Best Director for his efforts. Such neglect is a begging belief due to the direction of Spielberg. This is the most important thing. I'm not crazy about Quincy Jones's score. But not below any mean. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is a very satisfying story. Awarded material Take a look and you may be puzzled like me about how to be treated badly in the Oscar night.
