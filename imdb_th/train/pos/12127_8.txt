The story is somewhat arrogant with the main characters of the sudden reversal of fortune. Leslie Howard and Bette Davis are portrayed by Philip Carey, a passionate obsession with Mildredro. Jerry <br /> <br /> Philip's sensitive, culturally large part of the image is a slave to his first passion, and then his pity for Mildred is no different. From Howard's character Southern gentlemen who are innocent and beyond to be created in an era of rough creation Philip, in fact, seemed to resign to disappointment before Mildred came into the picture. He was not surprised, especially when his art teacher told him that he would not make it. a painter Perhaps these sluggish, declining expectations caused him to endure Cockney, a selfish waitress, as long as he did. <br /> <br /> Although Leslie Howard is memorable, but now "Of Human Bondage" as Picture Betty Davis may be due to a story that is well known that she has to fight with Jack Warner to be part of Mildred, and probably because movie viewers tend to like the characters. Mildred may have a scary sound. But she still has the unexplainable beauty of an angel who made stained glass. For this reason it is understandable why Philip let himself be upset as long as he did Although people who eat the Mildred may sometimes see one dimension at a time. But she felt sympathetic to the audience from time to time when she was ill and realized that Philip was the only good person who had taken care of her. Some people may think that she is doing something when she accuses Philip of looking at her without "good" enough. (The scene in which Philip and Norah canceled the love magazine as a trash for the housewives in the kitchen seemed To confirm this) <br /> <br /> Most of the supporting characters are also effective, especially Norah, a rational romance writer. She could not compete with Mildred and Sally, who had the beauty of Mildred and the suitability of Norah and appeared that the woman deserves Philip in the end. The only character that I found hollow was the father of Sally's strangely aristocratic character who seemed to be a character from the previous era. <br /> <br /> Classic that deserves fame.
