Now I love American Pie 1 and 2, while the 3rd is great for Seann William Scott's performance as a Stifler. But after that, the quality is reduced. Band Camp maintains a fairly high standard for the characters you care about, but Naked Mile. Is the same joke and reused (Erik Stifler's sexual problem is like Jim's) It has a funny time, such as football games with dwarves and Coozeman's 'punishment'. But overall, it lacks creativity and 'Mile' is stupid and stupid. foolish No need to talk about annoying girlfriends who don't want to have sex. <br /> <br /> Anyway, about Naked Mile, I watched Beta House in fear because I thought it would make the new series low. But I was surprised To be honest, there is no real plot. But full of hot girls (Ashley is incredible) and many jokes Yes, it's a formula and old joke, but Dwight Stifler (Steve Talley) raises the level of lively performances. Greek Olympiad is especially fun, the last and last event, while Christopher McDonald is hilarious. At first he was still baffled by the way he was involved. <br /> <br /> The terrible coozeman Erik Stifler is worse than John White, making Naked Mile painful to watch, but in the Beta House he shows up. His show To the new lowest point First of all, he lacks the talent, which is a prerequisite of Stifler. You don't care about him less. The only reason I care about his relationship is that Ashley can appear on the screen! She shines over him, like the rest of the actors. John White is seriously the ultimate performance of bad and charismatic as dead fish. <br /> <br /> Saying that this movie creates entertainment and Afraid of Coozeman, whose girl is not a funny woman, cleverly <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is worth renting for a few friends and laughing at the festival.
