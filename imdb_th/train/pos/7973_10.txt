Maybe i'm good But this is the sweetest movie! I saw it for the first time when I was about 4 or 5 years old and I cried out. Between now and now (embarrassed at age 15) I've seen it 25 times and sobbing every time. Don't worry that they will have tears of happiness! And it's not all! There are lots of humor and humor. Usually, things that talk about all animals can be a big deal. But in this movie is not the case My only suggestion: Even if you love this thing - don't see things continuously ... repetition! I encourage everyone to check this story ... You will not regret, no matter how young or old you are!
