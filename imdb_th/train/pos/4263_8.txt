During the celebration of Kurt Weill in Brooklyn, where can we go from here? Finally being dug up for screening It is an amazing story from movies of any age that have cooperation. Weill-Gershwin May disappear from the screen High standing scores and CDs of material with Gershwin and Weill, just underlined which is a lot. Yes, the movie has a problem. But the score isn't one of them. Ratoff isn't in his composition as a music fantasy director and Fred MacMurray can't understand the content. Then, as well, the 'modern' section will be written softly. But the imaginative elements bring the movie to the top, as well as the work of two happy women - Joan Leslie and June Haver. As a Second World War, showing respect for the history of our country - even in the 'never was' frame, this movie has a place in Hollywood music history.
