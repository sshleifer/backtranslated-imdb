I was totally surprised by some comments on this forum and many comments. I think Tony Scott created a good movie here. Yes, it has a very cool style, flashy and higher. But it's very fun I'm glad that at least Ebert and Roeper agree with me :) <br /> <br /> This movie may not be suitable for anyone. But if you like humor, humor, action and great interaction, see it. <br /> <br /> I've seen Scott Man on Fire, Crimson Tide and Enemy of the State - all good movies But I like this one more It's like a roller coaster ride with a selection of great music, visual style, and when every movie seems to be on page 13. It's good to see that there are people who are not afraid to show nude pictures. > <br /> Keira doesn't hurt so hot and even shows tits in this ...
