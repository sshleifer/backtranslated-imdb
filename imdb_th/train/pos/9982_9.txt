I saw this movie last night after waiting for the age and age to be released here in Canada. It is worth the wait. I am an avid reader of Margaret Lawrence and was excited to see that the novel became a movie. I like this movie better than a novel. I like the character of Bram Shipley seems to be less intense and seems to have more love stories between Hagar and the bourgeois, which makes the scene at the end of the life of the game more active The loss looks stronger. Hagar is not a favorite in movies than in books, but Ellen Burstyn is a genius in this role. She is Hagar through and through. Christine Horn is great and there are many wonderful things ahead. I'm sure her scene with Cole Hauser is very exciting. I can keep going. Overall, there are 9 * out of 10 that are great and can't wait for it to come out in DVD format, which must be my collection too!
