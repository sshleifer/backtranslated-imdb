<br /> <br /> An old man worked as a janitor in a mental hospital to get close to his wife who was a patient there and tried to take her away. <br /> <br /> This is one. Of the most forgotten masterpieces of the silent and bizarre era in Japanese film history The long-lost idea found that it was printed in the 70s and the soundtrack was added. May be influenced by the cabinet of the doctor Caligary (director Kinugasa claims that he had never seen a German movie before). However, it is more than in the form and in the more convincing (and cold) image of the inner mental state of the inmates in hospital In order to achieve this goal, the film uses all the existing movie techniques at that time: multiple exposure and subjective vision, tilted camera angle, fast and slow motion, slow and slow motion. In addition, it is a complex movie that needs to be tracked due to lack of subtitles. <br /> <br /> The film opens with pictures of the rain that hits the hospital window, the tree shaking and thunder. The metaphor for unstable weather makes the patient's mind better and introduces one of them: a former dancer, a combination of sounds caused by rain, wind and thunder, acting as a song that encourages dancers to enter the dance at Excited and almost hypnotic In another sequence related to the same patient who once again participated in the crazy dance, she was watched by other inmates. Many dancers' exposure represents the patient's perspective and the "confused" view of the world. <br /> <br /> This is just two examples from this remarkable movie, trying to show the patient's subconscious mind and The view of the world of patients "There is a reason." <br /> <br /> Three words must be seen.
