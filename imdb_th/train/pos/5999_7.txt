This is a strange movie for me after I checked a good movie from a new filmmaker (FAR OUT by Phil Mucci). Another writer / director Ryan Jafri contacted me and asked me to watch. Usually I didn't watch. This movie But what heck - I love shorts and can't wait to see again. <br /> <br /> Interesting as it turns out, I like THE CURE. I'm not excited about it and let Jafri know. For his credit, he encouraged me to review it further - giving my honest assessment. <br /> <br /> The film has a great style and as far as Jafri's direction goes, it's great. It was the first film. A mix of excellent choices of colors, rhythm, walk, and music suitable for movies, creating a great atmosphere You are really drawn into the movie and that is the credit for making movies. However, what I didn't love was writing. While the basic idea is excellent, the ending is too easy to see. I will love the ending if it's more surprises or have unexpected twists. However, considering that this movie is from someone who is unable to make a professional movie that gives his experience, it is a good omen for his future.
