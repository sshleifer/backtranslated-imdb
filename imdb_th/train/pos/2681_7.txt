As you may already know, Jess Franco is a rich man. He has made hundreds of films from hundreds of films, many of which are nonsense. However, he sometimes tries to sneak into quality work, amidst the exploitation of the entire assembly line. "Succubus" is not his best work (that is, "The Diabolical Dr. Z" or "Vampyros Lesbos") It has many trademarks that make people interested in diving in his large catalog. He combines arousal (Switch between showing full nude pictures and letting the rest of the imagination) and seamless images This film is a dream movie full of wonderful atmosphere. I especially like naming. Even being revealed as acting unbelievably But it's fun to be influenced by all Franco. <br /> <br /> There are still many users who don't like "Succubus" and I see where they come from. It's a pleasant walk, but I can handle it. have More problems are inconsistency. Obviously, the script here is in a hurry and within five minutes of this movie I don't know what happened. (And it never came together from that point). Those who want some substance with their style, look elsewhere In addition, if it's a horror movie, it won't be scary or suspicious. Even though I was still entertained by all the enchantment I didn't consider too much of these important flaws (7/10).
