I almost gave 10 out of 10. However, there are some parts that cause confusion, just like the leader who missed the flow of movie continuity. Excellent storyline and well composed; You will have to look quietly in order to fully understand. The characters are complex and therefore it's a matter of late, expecting to get enough information to stop scratching your head. It's a movie that is all explained at the end. The animation is great and the mix of femme fatal and noir makes a great movie, unlike anything I've seen in animation. It is a black and white film, dark and quiet in some scenes, so it's worth it to watch on a good T.V or plasma. The voice of the character makes this film in English. But more reliable if having a French accent that emphasizes what is happening in Paris. I enjoy it more with English subtitles One of them is to buy a DVD or BlueRay that is worth it if they have it! And personally, if you like this movie, you may like; Awakening life and ghosts in the innocence of Shell 2. This is just a personal suggestion.
