I am quite surprised with this flick, though their budjet is obviously still lacking. But you must be impressed that this movie takes 7 years to build and still comes out well. The performance is quite impressive and the story really impressed me. My only complaint is that the ending is actually too little consensus for my taste. But wait, if your audience wants more, this movie is a success Excellent The bad novels in the show) Antonella RÃ­os is a truly growing star.
