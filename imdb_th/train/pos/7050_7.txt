I do not want to take a long time to travel about the plot - you have seen an example and if you are not online I do not recommend watching it - it's a bad craft and doesn't contain laughter or magic from the movie. Therefore, those who avoid this movie because of a lousy trailer should give this opportunity. It's really funny. I blown away with the ingenuity and originality of this movie. The first 40 minutes let me stay on the floor with hysteria - My only problem is that it has become a bad movie Austin Powers in the last 20 years without unnecessary. The rest of the movie (Which is usually the case) everyone gives a great performance (especially Joan Cusack) and has some really wonderful moments Personally, I plan to see it again when it comes out - to catch all the details that I laughed during the first look!
