I love this movie The noir image, combined with Mike's ridiculous character, Hammersmith Spillane, works amazingly to create the mood and feeling that is rarely found in the low-budget detective movie of the early 50s. It may not be 'The Maltese Falcon' but This movie has contributed to this genre. Spillane is often criticized for being an alleged woman, etc. But 'Thao' is superior to men in terms of wit and intelligence. Mike Hammer, a poor player, effectively by Biff Elliott, blinded by the beauty of a mysterious psychiatrist that he encountered when investigating the death of a fellow soldier. Finally, when Penny left his face as a picture Well, seeing that censorship in the 50s did not force filmmakers to ignore the famous last line. Classic low budget honestly
