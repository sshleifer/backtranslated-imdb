"College Girl Murders" is my first familiarity with Edgar Wallace's writings? And in general I know the movie "Krimi" for the first time in general ?? And I can say that I am moderate This thing is entertaining even though I don't think it will be like that ?? Stupid! This film has a plot of exhilarating and well-complicated stories with a healthy humor, distorted colors and creative killing. James Bond is an evil mastermind, right? Who often sit in the shadows and in front of a large monitor - find a prisoner to kill some girls in a specific toxic college In addition, there are evil monks with a whip dressed like Communist Party members. KKK get rid of the remaining characters, such as teachers who are too curious and like the crafty police commanders who still solve problems with psychological methods Seriously, if I knew soon that these Krimi movies were colorful and crazy, I would buy all of their dresses. Plotsel plot raises more questions than answers at the end, and exaggerated humor in the accounts of Scotland Yard Higgins inspectors sometimes swallow. Even the 60s soundtrack still stuck in my head for a long time. It's like a variant in Giallo, Italy, but has a slapstick element.
