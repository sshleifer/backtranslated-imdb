Not sure what will happen to this movie because it is a collection of celebrities and directors. But in the end, it didn't disappoint. <br /> <br /> For me, one of the highlights is the final episode with American tourists. (Which makes me feel better about me) which is actually quite impressive and is a good way to wrap movies. <br /> <br /> The story of the doctor and the victim who is stabbed is still very much. Moving and pure comedy shows, Coen Brothers and Steve Buscemi won the clip. Tom Tykwer was impressive, though quite ambitious in its scope. <br /> <br /> However, Bob Hoskins's part is particularly interesting and the story of The vampire looks completely fearsome. The dialogue on the part of Westen Kraven was extremely pressured and the story of Chinatown was completely incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is worth looking at a good bit. It's not too painful to sit in the bad part - they only take 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Ca vaut la peine !!!
