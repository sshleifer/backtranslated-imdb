All movies created before 1912 need to be viewed with real time and location. <br /> <br /> In 1894, the Lumiere clan [Father: Antoine (1840-1911), son: Auguste and Louis] owned. And manage the factory that produces photographic sheets and paper Not a small organization The factory has more than 200 employees who receive pensions and social welfare - an innovation at that time located in Montplaisir, in the suburb of Lyon, France. What makes Louis Lumiere interested in building Cinematagraph in 1894 is still open for speculation. My suggestion is the presence of Edison's Kinetoscope (peep-show) in Paris in the autumn of 1894 as a catalyst. <br /> <br /> WKL Dickson of Edison's staff created a camera. An animation about the size of a piano set up that received a patent in February 1893. It worked with electricity. (Energy from a battery that has a large amount of storage, this large machine is powered by the Eastman celluloid pump) via a lens of about 40 frames per second (fps). It is attached to a nearly moving object in "Black Maria" Kinetescope shows a scene presentation (less than a minute in length) that was filmed in this studio. <br /> <br /> During the year 1894, Louis Lutia Have Content yourself with inventing the camera movement, he decided that even at 16 frames per second. Celluloid film The persistence of human eye / brain vision helps normal motion to recognize his camera dubbed Cinematograph Is about the size of a large shoe box Storage for movies enough to make Take a picture for about a minute when the lens is rotated at 16 fps. <br /> <br /> The size and weight of the camera. (Can be converted to a printer or projector by adding Light source) makes it portable enough to be taken to any location to record events (If there is enough sunshine) In the spring of 1895, Louis filmed: riding horses by some cavalry House on fire with firefighters arrived and controlled the building covered with water. And many scenes in and around Lyon. With the use of a Molteni light bulb, he transforms the camera into a projector and presents his films to scientists who gather in the Revue Generales des Science lounge. Images are projected on the screen away. About five meters from the lens The screen was stretched in the door between the two rooms. At a meeting of professional photographers in that same year, Louis took photographs of the delegates arriving and on the same evening showed them the animation of their arrival. <br /> <br /> Praised by the scientific community and photographers Public exhibition of his inventions by the end of the year Since each of his films takes about a minute, he needs at least a dozen movies for a good presentation. For one of these films, he installed his camera at the entrance to his factory, taking pictures from the staff at the end of the job. <br /> <br /> The public place chosen by Antoine - who offered himself as "The petitioner "For the movie - is the Grand Cafe Indien Salon Indien on the street des Capucines in Paris. It was a cold Saturday night of December 28, 1895. As the first audience sat, they were presented with an anticipated view. Outside of the factory Lumiere (with closed doors), some people feel that they are watching the daily routine. Lumiere's slide show, but the crank on the camera / projector changed and the movement began. Louis has a natural feeling for shooting movies. This film has a beginning, middle and ending. At first, the door opened and people started to leave the office. In the middle, people will pour out - many people try to ignore the camera and the cameraman because they are happy to leave the work behind. At the end of the door the factory is closed. <br /> <br /> And this is the first movie that is screened for the entertainment of the general public.
