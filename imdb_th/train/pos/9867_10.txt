I saw Ice Age for the first time in Subiaco Cinemas when it came out in '02. At that time I was only 13 years old, but I also liked it. It has a little warmth. <br /> <br /> We have had this video for many years and no matter how many times you watch it is boring. This is because one element that makes it different from all other three-dimensional animations that occur at the time - the characters don't have 'houses' that they go out. They are nomadic and it looks really fresh and uplifting. <br /> <br /> In addition, each character on the surface seems to be fighting against each other. But they are really good friends Every character has its own charm. (Even the bad guys) Sid the sloth is charming in a way that is more annoying than his love and innocence. Manny is cute in depressed characters, solitude, and so on. <br /> <br /> Another good point about movies is the beauty of animation. All the environments and characters are created by clay, making the film more artistic. <br /> <br /> Another aspect that adds to the feeling of the movie is that sex has very little meaning. There are almost all female characters. But you don't know until when you watch it a few times, then there is little effect on how you watch the movie. For this reason, there is no mention of a pathetic nuclear family in an environment such as the ice age. <br /> <br /> All Ice Age is a great movie and is a testament to how much effort Was created as a 3D animation before Shrek 2 and The Incredibles came out
