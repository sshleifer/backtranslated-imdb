I have six months at home and occasionally she struggles to sleep really badly. One morning, she had a difficult time, especially when the song in the doodle bops theme came to T.V. She stopped crying almost immediately and the rest of the performance was content. I sat her in her bouncy seat and watched her kick her legs, swing her arms and really laugh. In this performance, she enjoyed and enjoyed all the time. I also got their videos too, so sometimes my youngest child is confused. I have something that makes you calm. Get late at night if she wakes up with colic to doodle doodles. Not her cup of tea. But they are sure to be useful when I have to spend a little time doing housework, etc. The most surprising thing about Doodle bops is that my child doesn't like watching TV. Our little more than watching TV. I don't know if she will like them in the future or not. But now she is stuck
