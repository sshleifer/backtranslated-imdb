Every time the filmmaker brings a group of unique people and allows you to see things that make us human. Lawrence Kasden does this again. I always feel that The Bg Cill is a song of its generation and he can do it again in the Grand Canyon. Often we find ourselves at a point where we have the opportunity to choose life and often we explode. This is a movie about people searching for the courage to choose and experience life because of that choice. The cohesion of small and large events that help us see that the most small things that we worry about are geniuses. I have watched this movie many times and was very surprised by the emotions that flowed through this film. Danny Glover and Kevin Kline performed their duties with tenderness and Stever Martins, which showed no management of this movie. Thank you to Mr. Kasden again.
