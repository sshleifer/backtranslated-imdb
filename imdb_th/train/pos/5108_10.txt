This is my favorite movie all the time. It used to be a Friday night movie with a pizza and a bottle of wine when I was single. I saw this film for the first time with Aunt Brend and the sister of Chasity. I was in the 2nd grade. I love Travolta and Sissy is my new best friend. I have read a lot of comments about the causes that I had left from Sissy and Sissy. "Learn to do" How to marry But go back and look at this thing a second time: Spoiler - My interpretation is now not when I was eight years old. This is about Bud & Sissy's relationship, causing the worst because she makes him Stupid in riding Gilley the cow. They get in a big fight. Bud tries to make his sister jealous by asking Pam to dance. The sister thought that two wrong things would be correct and Wes asked her. "She needs any help." They are all on the dance floor acting like a fool when Bud asks Pam. "When will you take me home and rape me?" Pam replied: "When you're ready for the cowboy," Bud then returned home with Pam to her condo in downtown Houston. Which my father bought for her with his oil and "Meaningful things" Bud is the one who cheated with Sissy. The sister is waiting for the bud when he returns home the next day. The sister is one who leaves the bud. Then it was up to Bud to prove Sissy that he was the real "cowboy" and win her heart. <br /> <br /> Next, that's my interpretation. Everyone has theirs. I'm sure! I love this movie. <br /> <br /> And believe it or not, I have a real cowboy! I love him! :)
