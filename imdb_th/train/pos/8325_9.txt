I like the idea of ​​this film from the first moment I saw this movie trailer. Einstein is always one of my heroes, and his image as a playful, slightly irate genius is enough to take me to the movies. Matthau's added spices as well as Einstein make it better. <br /> <br /> The story is pure fantasy. The car mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman who is Einstein's niece. With the help of the angel of the gods, the four gods of physics, Ed makes a mission to win Catherine's heart. Throw a jealous fiance (Which is the worst example of experimental psychology) and Eisenhower mixes and you have real fun. <br /> <br /> This film is full of great character actors. Walter Matta plays Einstein as a puck. Cupid with slide rules Tim Robbins is astonishingly loved as Ed and Meg Ryan play above her normal rom-com level. Stephen Fry is happy as "RRRatman" and Ryan's fiancé. That doesn't have a single romantic bone in his body. <br /> <br /> This movie drops below most radars, but it's a delightful treasure that doesn't grow with repeated viewing. Great performances and gentle treatments in a lesser world
