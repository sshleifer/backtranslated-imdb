People do not seem to give enough credit to the Lensman when due. Some problems are overlooked, which is the key to understanding the Lensman's experience. <br /> <br /> Year: For this year, it happened in 1984 (1984). Lensman has the most amazing effect. I've seen As a person who watched many animations early in the year 80, the Lensman is unique in using what appears to be a computer generated image when the computer is very original. Kim's battle with the geometry cutters in the laser labyrinth can be an excellent example of this. Every time I see that I have to repeat myself that it was 1984 when it was created. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack: Lensman has one of the most crazy soundtracks that I have. I have heard Overcoming the infiltration of every corner of the Lensman movie, borrowed heavily from two Western mistakes and dealt with the first mistake - the need to fill the silence every second in movies with music and heroine needs. While the music was well tuned and made scenes such as motorcycle fights in Thionite Factory on Radelyx, the heroine's theme failed because Chris was annoying. It is interesting to note that the song probably interferes with my efforts to get rid of the noise when I archive the lensman from an analog tape in digital format - because there is no single second silence to use as a reference point. > Western Influences: Helmut - Looks like a "helmet" and a rough sound like Darth Vader Clarissa Fairborn - the same hairstyle as the Princess of SW and her name sounds suspicious, similar to Marissa Fairborn's Transformers. Chapter By the sailing and technical expertise of Buzzkirk - a clear improvement about Chewbaka. The lens - a good concrete copy of the power that is less than past as an opportunity to declare Christianity. To the audience more than the original SW, while the force relies on faith rather than concentration But the lens is a pure concentrated tool In theory, everyone can use the lens. The lens is more restrictive than the Force - which is a purely aggressive / defensive weapon. <br /> <br /> Technology: boskone alliance has an interesting bubble ball boat. They look like strawberries that wear red uniforms instead of white. The idea of ​​DNA weapons is good if it is developed only. The Galactic Alliance looks like the Starblazers (or whatever is called - that is the 60s series that they fight with Xylons). Delivering the battle for me - this has been greatly improved in the second Lensman movie. <br /> <br /> Finally know about Worzel. This character is a unique character. Very interested in luck That has been shown in the second movie <br /> <br />
