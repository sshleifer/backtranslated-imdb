This is a really interesting movie. It's an action movie that has a funny mix together. Foxx collaborates with Epps, a comedian in this movie. It will make you wonder what will happen to Foxx. It is a movie that can be shot well. The director uses the correct color in this movie. (Dark blue color) to give the right feeling She performed well. Even Jamie Kennedy is still in this movie. It's worth seeing that you haven't seen it. If you are a fan of Jamie Foxx, it deserves more credit than actually received.
