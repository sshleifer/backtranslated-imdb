Special things were called to play as generals in the film about the Russian Revolution. However, he is not a normal person. He is the former Russian army commander Serguis Alexander, who is now forced to come back to life in the same scene in which he experienced a professional and personal tragedy to satisfy the director That was once a revolutionary in Russia Now it is time for a broken man to "win" his last fight. This film is a powerful movie that has a meticulous direction by Von Sternberg, giving the greatest satire in Alexander's character in every way he can. Jannings deserves an Oscar. For his role with a very dramatic movement in general playing at his peak and at his deepest valley Powell provided horrific support as a revenge director, and Brent was perfect in her role with her face and movement, expressing Jennings' love. All rounds, intelligence, score 10
