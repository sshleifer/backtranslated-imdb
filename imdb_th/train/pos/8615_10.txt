I waited for this movie to stay for a while in Canada, and when it finally did, I was really excited to see it. I really enjoyed it. Of course, at first it was a very sad movie. (And is New Year's Day - make it very sad) - However, it's next to you The next day I was thinking about this again, because even though it revolves around something to drain the emotions, you know that after a few days it's a beautiful story One person can see that it is a link to many people. But sometimes you can blind many things And the way in which the character Diane Keaton helps to treat the rest of them just there And the way they help her in the process as well It's a great movie and Chris Pine (one of my favorite actors) has created the perfect comic. It is a movie that requires a tissue box. But will stay with you for a long time
