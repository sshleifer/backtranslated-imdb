OK, this is what I say: <br /> <br /> Great movie I am a big fan of Nancy and I read 1-56 original books and I read more. I am now 96 years old. Be careful of the bad guys. Keep grades lower than they should be. All clues point to great movies! I love everything So what Nancy is at the present time? She is still outdated as in the book! Those who do not read more than 5 books are complaining about Nancy's view. I have read all and I think Emma is perfect and Nancy is perfect. I found some of the horror movies. I love thrilling car chases and getting good things. I love the clues. It's really wonderful I encourage you to watch because people who are complaining do not know which movie is good and B about Nancy Drew to see it. It may not be worth it to Oscar, but it's really good
