Three flashbacks introducing the main character (Abu Jaffar and the princess) to interact with Ahmad Three songs are each linked to the same character. Ahmad pronounced the word 'time' three times to declare love for the princess by answering her three questions in the first meeting three times. His strong impression is that the princess will resist the three attempts of Jaffar to conquer her - with three successive stones: deception, hypnosis and memory erasure. However, Jaffa was the owner of what he described as the three inevitable tools of power over women: power whips and swords. The third is the number of aviation agencies: Mechanical Horse, Genie and The Genie and Magic Carpet. Genie offers three wishes to Abu in their first three encounters; Jeanie laughed three times loudly in his niche and three of his considerations about human weakness before he left. Abu overcame three obstacles in the temple of dawn. (Armed soldiers, giant spiders and giant squids) Three are tools of justice: the magical eyes that show Abu in the future, the magic carpet that transports him at the right time to help Ahmad and the princess and bow and arrow to carry The Jaffar is the third magic and has magic in this movie.
