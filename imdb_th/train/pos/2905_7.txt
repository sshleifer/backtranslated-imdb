This is an easy-to-watch comedy that will entertain you most of the time. The work of the director is known and the type of humor is his trademark. This film is a history of police, general partners such as deadly weapons. But funny and funny is an Argentine type One of them was a psychologist who played by Peretti and had to go with Detective Diaz (played by Luque) in the assignment as he helped him (Diaz had a problem because his wife cheated on him). And laugh anywhere Overall very good. It deserves 8 but I give 7 points because at the end In my personal observations, I have to add that is "Cheers" for Argentine filmmakers recently.
