This is my first review about IMDb. I don't want to write one. But since there are only 2 for this great movie right now, I feel the need to increase my perspective ... and no, I'm not involved. Filmmaker in any way (Yes, how often did you come here before? ;-)) FYI I was in my late 20s. <br /> <br /> The number one place of all. Seeing is limited by the imagination of the creator and they imagine this. Not so much in terms of stories. But in achieving a style that is unique and imo fresh, the characters look good but far from the real thing and work well with the movie because it is a fairytale world But the background and the world in general are full of wonderful images that my jaw fell many times while watching this thing. Mini blue cube, short like a rabbit, showing iron and having the most fun time of the movie easily. He is an instant classic, which is Scrat from Ice Age. (The anti-hero group must go out to kill the greatest dragon you can imagine.) But who cares that this movie looks good and sounds good? The movie is not suitable for very young children because it has darker scenes in it and may be scary for children under 6-8 years old. But worth to mention imo. However, I have a good time to watch and can't wait for such a popular shop to watch it over and over again just for its true beauty. > <br /> 8,5 for me
