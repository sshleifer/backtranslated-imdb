May not be as good as this But the second episode, which was the first time I spoke, was very memorable. I still remember today. I am a fan of Dick Francis. I would recommend if you are interested in horse racing and mystery. <br /> <br /> Chico Barnes, a close friend Chico Barnes is very amusing for those of us who have never heard of Bow London Bell, but the actors are attractive and the show is interesting. <br /> <br /> Sid Halley is one of Francis's very interesting characters. Interestingly, the electronic hand of the sequence used in the story seems to be less usable for the user than the sort that was created after World War II.
