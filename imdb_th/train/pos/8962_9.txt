As a heretic, I must say that this movie is of little importance. If Magickal is a "fun" witchcraft and doesn't mean to teach us anything but love is the strongest magic of all and never uses it. In a controlled or vengeful way That is a lesson that everyone must learn, not just the people of religion. <br /> <br /> That has been said that the film is written amazingly and performed by Kim Novak and Jimmy Stewart, who is respectful. br>> <br /> Hermione Gingold gave a great performance like Bianca, Elsa Lanchester (with too many movie credits to mention, except Miss Jane Marbles of "Murder By Death"). Novak is a crazy fellow queen. Unconscious, starring Jack Lemmon (Great Performance) and Jim Kovacs (sharp, sharp) <br /> <br /> "The witch can't cry. Why can't they shed tears because their hearts are full of Magick? They don't have time for stupid things like love. "Queenie <br /> <br /> Gillian Holroyd (Novak) and her brother Nicky (Jack Lemmon) are Manhattan witches. Hidden deep in the secret geospatiality of the vehicles. They live among other New Yorkers as one of them without causing high eyebrows. <br /> <br /> But later Shepherd "Che "Henderson (Stewart), a dedicated businessman who is steadfast and determined to marry Gillian's old rival. <br /> <br /> By chance, he found himself moving into the building of Gillian and being "enchanted" instantly with the charm and elegance of By using Magick with a little help from Pyewacket (familiar with Gillian, trained by Robert E. Blair) and Queenie, Gillian began working with this handsome new dream man to return to her old enemies. <br /> <br /> But Magick should not be used to control or hurt and Gillian learns that the most difficult way in the most bitter way. She doesn't just have to face what she's doing. But she must confront Shep with her guilt. <br /> <br /> From an important point of view However, this film has changed drastically: the effect is very obsolete to the point that it is purely a camp. It seems that some scenes are shot in the basement of someone's small house, but at least the characters are strange and fun. <br /> <br /> In my personal record, Pyewacket stole the big cat show! Great training by Robert E. Blair. <br /> <br /> It's a note of little things. This is the root of my beloved TV sitcom. This is a traditional introduction to Samantha and Darrin. All the characters of the notes are available and accounted for. You have to look for yourself. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorites and I watch often. <br /> <br /> This movie gets 9.1 / 10 from .. <br /> <br /> Demon:
