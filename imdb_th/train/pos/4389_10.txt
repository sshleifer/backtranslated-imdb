Rob Roy offers a rare experience in the movie: one that is almost impossible. <br /> <br /> There are many comparisons with Braveheart that came out in the same year. With the credit received from Mel Gibson, Braveheart made me a noble epic and declared himself too much to be a rival to Rob Roy as a movie I wanted to watch more than once, while Braveheart worked so hard to As a serious epic, Rob Roy grabs you and absorbs you into a tightly edited narrative. <br /> Rob Roy has the perfect balance of tension, action and humor from time to time. The characters are conveyed in the best manner of the film, conveying the local characteristics and the manner in which they hold the real moments. <br /> <br /> Moreover, they are not a parody of goodness and Evil. <br /> <br /> For example, while we hope Rob Royillo is better, we realize that his embarrassment is a proud and honorable work. Tim Roth plays one of the most nasty bad guys in the history of movies. But there was a time when we could understand how the events of his life had made him into what he was. Rob Roy uses character development at a level that makes the story more reliable and interesting. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy is a delightful treasure consisting of one of the greatest sword fights ever designed.
