This is an amazing movie from 1936, although the first hour is not very interesting. (For modern audiences) But the stylish vision of the year 2036 comes with the story going on. However, do not plan to be able to understand all conversations - sound quality and accent. (An American style - but "1930" American style) makes it difficult On the horizon of 2036, when the technology leaps forward and creates its own problems Before having ideas The suspicion and vision were quite low in today's sense. However, when it comes to the future, it's just fun to watch. The big scenes and retro lights of all things are hard to beat. <br /> <br /> If you don't have great listening ability I think I understand only 80% of the dialog. It can use subtitles. <br /> <br /> If you are a sci-fi fan, which is a classic type and is a must see. (At least after the first hour) For the average viewer, wait until the subtitle version is closed. See if you are satisfied with the movie during this time.
