Ghost Story (New House) is a wonderful horror story. This is from the Circle of Fear and Ghost Story series of the seventies, the beginning and end of each story told by Sebastian Cabot. Remember him from the early family series, Family Stories in the 1960s? This story has Barbara Parkins and David Birney as the lead actor and the main character in the story. I saw this thing recently and I was very scared! If you are alone, I won't recommend you to watch this story. Excellent. There is no word to stab or curse. But very scary Barbara Parkins plays the young bride David Burney plays the role of her husband. Both actors are very good in their part. If you like ghost stories that are scary, fun and scary, you will like this gem. I give this high rating. I would like to recommend this.
