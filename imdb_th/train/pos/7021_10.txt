I am happy to join The Pacific and Eddy film last week at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. This movie caught my attention for a while when I stumbled on an article in Jalouse magazine that seemed to be interesting at that time. But nothing too exciting However, I saw it on the festival list and decided to try it. All I can say is that I don't say anything when the credit begins to end. This is one of the most beautiful and refreshing movies I've ever seen. Photography, the direction of the performing arts and the particular direction is seamless and flawless. Nothing is spelled out for you in this movie and makes you think. What most movies today do in reverse This dialogue was carefully created, and although this script does not talk like a Wall to Wall, the character's words are prudent and meaningful. <br /> <br /> It's one of the movies that should be. Receive a second visit The more you notice more things It is a film that is very layered and intelligent. Not sure when or where to play again? But must have a favorite movie audience
