OK, it's not a perfect movie, but I don't agree with the overall opinion of IMDb. It's really bad. I watched a lot of Hong Kong Flix in 1990 and deeply loved this era. I never saw the 'black mask' at that time and just saw it last week for the first time. In addition to the infamous voice dubbing that my DVD copy didn't give me off, the movie options still have raw energy and bravado that permeates Hong Kong movies during this time. I still stick to my gun in the opinion that when it comes to these actions, regardless of their budget, will add magic elements to the screen. There is no Bourne Supremacy, Casino Royale or Mission Impossible. Movies - I'm just Thinking that they lack the naturalness of this film and feel too controlled) to be successful. What is it? It is the feeling that filmmakers do experiments while they are filming and editing, not afraid to leave acne marks to learn the next lesson. For me, it makes watching movies more fun and dangerous.
