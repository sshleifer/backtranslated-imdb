I caught this movie in my local movie channel and I liked watching movies more. It has all the elements of a good teen movie and others - this movie, in addition to dealing with the relationship between men, women and sex and dislike, also involves steroid use issues by young people. <br /> < br /> This film feels real in life - no music, no special effects and no outrageous scenes - which for this movie is correct. That feeling makes it easy to relate to the characters in the movie - some of which we might know from where we live. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good movie. Enjoy watching. <br /> < br /> 8/10
