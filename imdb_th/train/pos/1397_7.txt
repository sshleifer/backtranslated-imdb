"Getting out of the shore" is mostly a Star Trek adventure. On average, there is nothing wrong with it now. I think this is not the best presentation for fans. It is light, entertaining, nothing more. However, I am glad to see that this type of TV program has a good feeling enough to break from violent inter-space conflicts. Now, Kirk decides to give time to his crew and the landing party is sent down to the planet that looks like a perfect place for a holiday. Normally, the planet is not as calm as it is. There are some periods of action and stress. But most stories are for good laughs but without exception
