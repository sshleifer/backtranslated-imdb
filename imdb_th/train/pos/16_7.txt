I found it to be a love / drama that had a good ending and felt good. It is not the family movie of the Hallmark Hall of Fame that has a pre-wedding sleep. It is considered a "normal" behavior, but when considering being a star Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro, I expect to have a much richer movie <br /> <br /> The most memorable part of this film is the depiction of the difficulty of learning how to read and write when you are an adult. That is the main theme of the movie and involves some scenes that can be touched. But actually this movie is not a memorable story. <br /> <br /> It's still a gentle story and a good story that I'm happy to recommend.
