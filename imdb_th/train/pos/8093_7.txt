My friend had an idea to watch the lively LOTR after seeing Peter Jackson Return of The King. Finally I bought it out of the e-bay, thinking at first that it would be sucked. In fact, it's not as bad as I thought it would be. The animation was good at that time. They used a combination of live performances and animations to create interesting effects and people who made the sound of Frodo sounded like Elijah. Wood The greatest adaptation of the book But believe me, I have seen much worse It skipped a lot of things, because both the Fellowship and The Two Towers were compressed into the Definatley two-hour movie. Looks like the kids might like it, but nothing compares to Peter Jackson's trilogy
