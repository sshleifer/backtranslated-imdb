It's impressive that director Emile Ardolino died! He was able to bring the screenplay lightly and by selecting and correcting it to blink in it and make it shine like a star. This particular star may not be the brightest in the sky while the great love proceeds. But it is a star that will follow you until the end You want to know how everything will be possible. <br /> <br /> This script is suitable for Cybill Shepherd, which at that time needed to take advantage of success. "Moonlighting" her for the new generation who is lucky for her) may not know how many large screen curtains she has after the very promising start In this film, she returns in the form of a widow who still lives by relying on her daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson, on the top of the star, which will also rise). She may look too young for the role. But it works well for the way the story unfolds This is your movie But she did not advance beyond the scope of leadership Previous movies to that point And receiving sufficient support from Ryan O'Neal (in his best role in many years) and Christopher MacDonald Makes her character seem to breathe in all the fresh air. <br /> <br /> Ardolino takes advantage of the sex of the actors. Just like he did with "Dirty Dancing", but this movie is not so hot, so you can still watch with your parents if they are in the room. (Use your best judgment, they are your parents) I give this mark high because it is very user friendly and romantic movie lovers will find it noble. <br /> <br /> Again, credit to Emile Ardolino to create the most charming screenplay by Randy and Perry Howze (Where are they now?) Ardolino's next film Will be the sequel of "Three Men and A Baby", but in the end, his final drama show, Mr. Ardolino, touches your cinema. Miss!
