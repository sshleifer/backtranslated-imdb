This is one of the highlights of ST: the semi-unforgettable second season of TNG, before they 'grow up' or grow into their own in the third season onwards. This is not just a show for new actors like Bill Campbell and Teri Hatcher, but is also a continuation of the search for information about his 'humanity' at this time through a joke concept. Still one of my favorite moments. <br /> <br /> In the notes on the side, I'm still disappointed that there is no credit for the actor with the characters that Okona is about to receive an appointment. (After the character of Teri Hatcher) before being rudely interrupted by Lt Worf. I remember seeing it now. 'First run' at my friend's book store in the daytime, and we all thought she would be the perfect Jean Gray / Marvel Girl. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to know. Who is this beautiful woman ...
