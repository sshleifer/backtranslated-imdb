This is a rather boring movie. Photography with realistic performances, especially the very good things from Depardieu as a child, caddy and bad boy who has a realistic place, mood and connotation in the home One of France's most respected and regular working partners about movies with Depardieu - I believe they do 7 together - Pialat failed to join. It seems to be an article about why a woman falls in love with a bad boy who is hurt when they have a caring boyfriend and a kind husband Such as "I don't know"; "I like his arms"; "I like the way he gives love" to her who asks a husband who tries to kick her out of the house. But nervous and reckless because ... I think he loves her So he accepts and hopes for what? One day she will wake up and touch her. This is not a response in the drama style of divisions that have long speeches and even scenes that are not combined. I know the answer doesn't increase, but please stand Jules and Jim. The last shot is cold, like the movie we just watched is the heartache and headaches with the most forgiveness.
