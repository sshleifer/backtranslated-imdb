This film surprised me in a good way. From the box, I was impressed that it was a thrilling action movie. But it's too funny to be a thriller, although it is quite exciting. <br /> <br /> There are many situations like torpedoes and jokes. This movie and James Belushi was born to make Bill Manucci. He works great. The actors are not bad either, and especially Timothy Dalton is an actor. <br /> <br /> The story can sometimes be confusing when new characters appear in Movies, things are more complicated because no one can tell the truth about things often. If you don't care, things may be a bit messy in the end. But I really like it. <br /> <br /> Louis Morneau is not everyone well known. But he did well with him And I have never been impatient while watching movies. <br /> <br /> Make a man worthy of an examination
