Clint Eastwood certainly created a better movie. But this did not shame him Dirty Harry appeals to everyone, and if no one wants to see a love affair, but there is no reason you will not like him. He is cool because he is very dirty because he kills without thinking a lot. It is very suitable because he has received a bullet from your heart and hero because he doesn't care. Seen in the movies that Eastwood acted as a lead character, often causing viewers to be fascinated by the White Hunter Black heart. He is a madman in "In the Line of Fire". This is "almost" unemployed with his job, that is, he works for himself. Not interested in someone about his boss who sent him on a holiday. <br /> <br /> Based on the rape victims, this film promises to be a movie watcher without feeling. This movie has nothing that is far from his center. However, what makes it slightly inferior for Eastwood's better film is that even though the character in the lead role doesn't attract attention in the plot because it's too clear from the beginning. Not a movie that will make you sit in a place without movement There are also too many people dirtier than Dirty Harry.
