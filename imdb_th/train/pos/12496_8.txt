For many years we have watched all the horror films that came out of Hollywood movies with interesting content, such as Saw 2, until the horrible indie movies that were unparalleled ... We experienced bad movies. All with the hope that the gems will remain <br /> <br /> Although it may not have the budget or power of a movie studio But it was packed with an eerie atmosphere and fear Performances and movies are the most important thing. But it's the direction that makes this film worth watching The story and characters develop in the right rhythm to create a terrifying fear. <br /> <br /> Editing and seeing fx is the best. And while many horror films cannot use music for their benefit, the score for "Dark Remains" will only increase disgust. <br /> <br /> I know that this movie has been screened in various festivals No one is near me, so I can't wait to finally say that it will come out on DVD. Believe me, even if you're bored with the status of the current horror movie, try it once ... You won't regret it!
