Before I comment on this movie, you should realize that when I watched this movie, I expected a horror scandal, movie B and wanted to have fun. Jack Frost is someone who not only gives, but actually is one of the best things I've seen for a long time. Scott McDonald is great, like Jack Frost. In fact, I think he has a future in psychosis. In the big movie, if given the opportunity McDonald's is a serial killer who turns into a snowman through an absurd element by accident from a ridiculous element. As soon as the snowman starts moving and killing people, you will find that it is not difficult to laugh. The line is said to be completely cluttered, but it's really funny. The fact that the remaining actors act beyond just increasing the stupidity of the movie. But folly is a genius The scene where the snowman is with a teenage girl is a classic movie about B-movie, a horror movie. I sincerely hope that there will be a sequel and I will be there to watch on any cable channel. Of course, it's fun to watch the first few times and it's not a good job of movie technology. But I just want to see the snowman kill me for 7 of 10. This is a great movie for dating and acting late at night.
