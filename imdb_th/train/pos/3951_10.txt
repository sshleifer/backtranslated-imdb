I've seen this movie only once on TV and haven't repeated. This is strange when you consider the garbage that has been made over and over again. Usually, horror movies for me are a source of entertainment. But this movie really scared me. <br /> <br /> Don't continue reading BIT if you haven't seen this movie yet. The most frightening thing was when the townspeople followed the preacher so that his wife almost died. (They were poisoned by her) He asked what kind of person you were. One by one, they give their true identity The girl who pretended to be deaf for corruption and persuaded him to say, "I am a Lilith, a witch who loves Adam before Eve."
