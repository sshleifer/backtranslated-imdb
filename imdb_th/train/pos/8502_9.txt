Gung Ho is one of the movies that you will want to see over and over again. Michael Keaton is responsible for acquiring a Japanese car company to come to his city, so creating work for residents in Hadleyville. What will happen after that? Another fun time Both cultures clash and depend on Keaton to do things together. Look for great performances from Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturro, Soh Yamamura and Sab Shimomo all being cast. perfect Don't be fooled by low scores. This is 7.5 in my book. It is interesting to know that Hadleyville's city name is also used in High Noon. Yes, there is actually Hadleyville but in Oregon.
