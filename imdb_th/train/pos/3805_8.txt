After previewing, I was surprised that this movie had never been made into a movie theater, so I ordered BluRay. I had a good time watching it and having to say that this movie is definitely better than big animation movies. That it has bugs But I can still recommend The animation is very good, fun and very unique, and the story makes me watch it until the end. Some of the backdrop is beautiful and you can see French talent. I think Forest Whitaker's performances gave a feeling of lifelessness. But that's how the character Lian-Chu performed in this film. Overall, thumbs up, I like it a lot, and I hope it will be successful enough for all the studios involved to create such a great movie. I would like to recommend the opportunity and wonder how big the movie can be with a small budget. Hektor is only worth watching movies because some of his time is like hilarious.
