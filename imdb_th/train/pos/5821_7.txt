I was quite surprised to read some comments about this work in good faith. Some people are looking for the plot ??? Ok, when this video came out over a decade, I watched it for what it was: a collection of music videos. It's not a movie It doesn't have a plot or a central story. It's an anthology that has the most art of videos that are mostly long. They are all quite intelligent or creative. Michael Jackson may be seen as a fanatic today. But after all, this is the person who makes us excited. (Many people think of it as the greatest music video of all time) and set the trend with Billie Jean and Beat It with Moonwalker. He and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him again brought his music and dance to create Entertainment that is full of colors, soil, special effects, live performances and even a parody ("Badder"). And for those wondering what Joe Pesci is doing, this video A little before he became a household name and one of his most memorable film and IMHO I think the sequence criminal smoothly. (The choreographed part) Dances whatever Michael Jackson does to that point!
