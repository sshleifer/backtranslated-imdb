When you can pass the movie name "Pecker" is a great movie, perhaps one of the best films of John Waters. A great actor led by a strong performance by Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci makes this story very funny and very true There are some shocking scenes that are definitely not suitable for small children, but they are for purposes. Unfortunately, this movie has not produced many, and most people will be denied the opportunity to watch. If the opportunity fails, go to see this movie.
