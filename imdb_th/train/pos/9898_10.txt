My 10/10 rating is just a fun factor and you decide that you like "Slaughter High" before watching. Yes, it's a revenge story that has been prank for years after being dirty. But how do you like something that they pull here! I can't predict that the bathtub scene in one million years. <br /> <br /> Ok, so maybe we may be others and say that this movie is nothing new. It doesn't pretend. It is a flick that the characters in "Scream" may watch and contribute to their rules about how to survive horror movies. Finally, who doesn't like to watch people suffering from doing these things? Obviously it was a conservative sound because people were punished for doing what the '60s were protected. Still, you must love this thing! So with an apology to Don McLean, this comedian didn't sing for the king and queen!
