I love Malle's documentaries. They are easy and simple. But still fascinating I don't know why this documentary works. It's about Glencoe, Minnesota. There are 5,000 people living there and nothing really happens. But Malle can still make it interesting and interesting. His love for humanity, even racist or homophobic, is so overwhelming that you can't help falling in love with them as well. <br /> <br /> Malle filmed most of the year 1979. He returned 6 Years later to see what has changed. This should be a good movie without material. 6 years later, but this small addition makes it good. May sound like Malle is doing things that are done in the Up series, but in reality it's not like that. The Up Series is a matter of people. Malle's emphasis does not occur with what happens to each person very much. But what happened to this community And a very good change. 1985 was the Reagan era and farmers were suffering. Once in a proud community, now no one sees the future, and parents hope their children will teach themselves and do things other than farming. <br /> <br /> This document Is very relevant today Our financial crisis today begins because of what has already happened. Just look at these last words in a movie spoken by an old lawyer from the city (in 1985): <br /> <br /> "I have high hopes for this country because things are going to happen. Now I can stand out in my heart as being passionate about greed and the country is not with that passion, especially democracy ... with good - good - good - very good in the country. This and many more Of good people and they will not - they will not apply for membership with the philosophy of greed that is happening now. It's scary. "<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it took more than 20 years and was Hell's Headache before it happens
