** Possible spoilers *** Adam Sandler is often a character in the Comedy, but in "Reign" gives a deeply moving performance while there are people who show courage. Posted on September 11, 2001 Sandler played Fineman and "lost his own world". Johnson (Cheadle), a dentist, practiced face with an old college friend (Sandler) and wanted to follow. Catch up with "ancient times", we see the same as Rain Man (Dustin Hoffman), Fineman From now on he has been emotionally and withdrawn in stressful situations. Old songs seem to be comfortable and "psychological" crutches for him to rely on. <br /> <br /> Johnson looks in Fineman, happiness and ease of disappearance His family still feels unhappy and unhappy with his work. In the same example, he also wants to make sure that his friends don't fall into society. "Cracks" I come from this movie with a different perspective and More sympathetic Mercy for a sad family
