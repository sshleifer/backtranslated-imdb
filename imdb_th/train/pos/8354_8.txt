I have seen this movie many years ago during Cinemax Friday after the dark series. (Back when the cable box was built like a keyboard) and it made me amazed. Although there is a ridiculous aspect for this film Depardieu & Dewaere's performance is very fun. They have a good chemical relationship together & Miou-Miou makes the pink hair look amazing. Done in a time of political correctness (At least not in the US) because it seems to create excitement for things such as violence, robbery and informal sex. This movie proves that with talented actors and talented directors, a good movie, no matter what, it makes me sad to meet Patrick Dewaere and commit suicide in the near future. Will check him with Depardieu & Miou-Miou in your Hankerchief
