I love the work of all creams, even with a small catalog, although they take up to twenty minutes with their songs (Spoonful and Toad from the Wheel of Fire is a prime example). Still shaking socks. More than half of any rock shows that work today The power of the jazz on this stage was given to the greatest rock band ever with the performance of the Royal Albert Hall last year. They may grow up like their fans, but the energy is still there with the good preparation of classic blues as well as their own. Redundancy of the White Room, Badge, Politicsian, Spoonful, Sunshine of Your Love. No one seems to miss. Clapton's solo has a style that sometimes he doesn't have on stage with his solo band, Ginger Baker. When speaking, Jack Bruce is strong enough that his vocals are still powerful. That Clapton couldn't do it by himself Bottom line, if you want to see the best thing you want, you've seen last year. (Some people may have seen them) It's on this DVD with great special features.
