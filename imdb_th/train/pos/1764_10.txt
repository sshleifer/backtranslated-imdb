Steve Carell took on the role of his first actor in Virgin Old for 40 years. He played a supporting role in films such as Bewitched, Bruce Almighty, Anchorman and his work on daily shows. The real comedy that Karel created You can tell that Will Ferrell had an influence on his "funny air", but Carell brought it to the next level. Everything he did was pure, innocent, cute and hilarious. I will not hesitate to say that Steve Carell is one of our next great comedians. <br /> <br /> Virgin 40 years old is two hours that doesn't stop laughing (or 4 hours if you see It's twice) as I do) The perfect actor and the great leader attracts viewers through all the movies. The script is complete with many great lines that you will want to watch again to try to memorize them all. That song fits the sound of the movie and you can tell the director what he is doing. <br /> <br /> Full of humor, sex, nudity and many languages, this movie is not for Everyone, but if you like Wedding Crashers, Anchorman or any movie, you will love The 40 Year Old Virgin.
