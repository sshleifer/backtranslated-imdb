I watched this movie three times. The last time I skipped a confused scene to find a resolution for the plot. Perhaps the plot may not be intended to be a logical reason. Or maybe these rough spots are in the plot because Ann remembers quite a distant event. <br /> <br /> Take Ann Grant, the youngest (Claire Dennes) This is a young woman who attended an unnamed college along with the heirs of a wealthy family. She had to get help in paying very expensive tuition fees. But it seems that there is no connection with the family at all She never had a relative that she could turn to when the consequences of one of her disastrous decisions happened. <br /> <br /> Ann tells her love in the evening with her. Patrick Wilson then, when Harris comforted Lila after Buddy's tragic death, her brother, Ann, found that he was disgusting and disgusted with her own behavior. I have to miss some important things here. Ann's behavior is completely mysterious. Ann abandoned her relationship with Harris and eventually married one of the grooms in Lila's wedding. Although Harris refused to Ann But she still has a deep feeling towards him when she dies. <br /> <br /> It is obvious from his behavior that Harris is heavily attacked with Ann and will marry her gladly. One scene showing the opportunity to meet many years after Lila's wedding shows that Harris still has deep feelings for Ann. <br /> <br /> This film shows the relationship. Ann's romantic She often goes out to fall with her people and she denies them. This format was held with Harris and two husbands. On the other hand, Lila married a man she didn't love and she remained with her husband until he died. Maybe Lila was able to build a relationship because she refused to let her marriage fail. <br /> <br /> Then, Lila Ross's once more comfortable appearance next to Ann's bed. Obviously Ann's nurses were able to retrieve sufficient information from Ann's clear moments recently to identify and contact Lila. No communication appeared on the film. <br /> <br /> I wondered about the house that Ann lived in during her last days. How can you buy a house like this from a small income from her singing career? Ann seems to move forward from a financial disaster one step while raising two of her daughters. <br /> <br /> On another level, I enjoy the scene and the film very much. The seaside mansion is very beautiful. Claire Dennes shines like the young Ann Grant. She is a really talented singer. I like her natural brown color with a blonde bottle that she has in a special movie. If only these annoying CGI fireflies are gone, I can upgrade my movie score!
