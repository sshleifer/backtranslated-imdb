I decided not to believe what the famous film critic said. Although this movie will not receive the best comments. But this movie created my day It makes me think This is a real world. <br /> <br /> What do you do when your loved ones fool you? It has been said that no matter how often you are feeding the snake, it will never be loyal and will bite when given the opportunity. Like some people that they never felt thankful This movie is about selfish people and eventually everyone just thinks about himself and works for himself. <br /> <br /> His brother died unintentionally from the gangster's hands. The brother who survived decided to take revenge. Through this process, we learn about the futility of this world. Nothing is true and nobody is loyal to anyone. <br /> <br /> Amitabh gives the performance of his life. Aryan new actors give good results. The actor who played Amitabh's wife stole her small role. But she showed her role diligently that her role was stimulated. Chawla had excellent facial expressions. But her role is very limited and does not get the chance to fully express. <br /> <br /> Great movie by Raj Kumar Santoshi. His films are like the novels of Nanak Singh (Punjabi novelist, whose novels are often intended and aimed at social evil) because they have real messages for the audience. They have fun including giving lessons.
