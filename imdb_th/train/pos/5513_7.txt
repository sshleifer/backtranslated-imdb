From what I have read, many people are disappointed with this film compared to Part 1. At first, I can understand. But after thinking a bit, I thought they were wrong. Soderbergh still told the truth according to Che's life, which he started in episode 1, part 1 tells the story of a revolution that moves from an unexamined beginning As a successful conclusion, Part 2 tells the story of a revolution that changed from the beginning that would not be a complete success. It's not Soderbergh's fault that Che's 2-part life has completely different results. He chose to tell both bravely and honestly. The audience may feel better from the movie than after Part 1, rather than part 2, but that is the reality of Che's life and not my opinion of the director's fault. This film is far from perfect. It may be too long. At least in Part 1, we saw various aspects of the war. When the guerrillas succeeded in Part 2, they were unable to take a break and we saw their numbers continue to decline due to death and arrest. The arrest and death of Che is well managed. This film has been greatly improved from the Spanish dialogue, Benicio Del Toro, once again as charming as Argentina. So if you see Part 1, you will see a very different storytelling in Part 2.
