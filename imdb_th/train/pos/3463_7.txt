I am a big fan of the Beatle Beatles that I like. Paul and John, my least favorite is John. I know a lot about Beatles music and the truth behind the breakup, including things like my family. John Lennon and Paul's Wings I want to know how this film will manage the relationship between John and Paul. Many years after the breakup, <br /> <br /> I'm not disappointed with this movie. Although the characters themselves are fiction But many references that both musicians use are very accurate. These include the way Yoko Ono stayed with John, no matter where he went. Wing song "Stupid Love Song" is a hit song that year and a concert on the roof of Apple Studios. Play songs from the album "Let It Be "br / <br /> The actors were very good at playing John and Paul. The accent should be a bit more active. But it seems that they act like I have read two of the former Beatles' past. I like the dialogue between them, which is generally what this movie is. <br /> <br /> The first episode ends. I am disappointed But the more you think, the more impressive How is it in real life They also performed great dances from "Saturday Night Live" at The Beatles, offering $ 3,000 to be shown on the show. (Compared to other people who offered $ 220 million). Overall, I'm not disappointed with this movie. It gives you more feelings about why the Beatles broke and why they didn't come together again.
