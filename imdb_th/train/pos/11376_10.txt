This is one of the best movies about serial killers I've seen and from those who love Silence of the Lambs HBO. Hit the jackpot here. This movie is interesting from the first moment to the end. <br /> <br /> This film has many themes that are hard to tell about what it is. It's a decade-long search for Russian serial killers. Andrea Chikatilo Stephen Rea provides excellent booking performance as a forensic expert specializing in investigations and Donald Sutherland. The show is related to his work as another leader and is the only one in the Russian government. Both of their performances are delicate masterpieces --- Rea became innocent and unwilling to compromise while Sutherland began to separate and almost amused the situation. At the end of Rea became a system that More tired and beaten in the world. While Sutherland found himself more passionate and idealistic, <br /> <br /> In other films, I would say that Sutherland's performances stand out above others. But here, although it is unparalleled by Geoffrey Munn see the serial killer himself. Dannmann created a wonderful character here, which inspired him to care for more than the hatred that we thought we'd find - he was a monster. But he does not want to be and we get the idea that As we are, he is tortured, ashamed, but also a stone. <br /> <br /> If you can bring an incredibly dark story (And it is very disturbing *) you should watch this movie
