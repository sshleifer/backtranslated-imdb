This movie is so misunderstood that it's not funny. If you think you will see this thing for filming .. don't forget about this and the impact and injury that the survivor must endure Even the detectives are searching for the answers we do ... Why? Great performances from both leading women as we see that the things we ignore are affected by the same things we get. Yes, the language is sometimes violent. But it is suitable for the character well There are no loose ends or no answers. But every movie has Having dealt with important issues and this film created an important statement about how we all feel after important events. Highly recommended for teenagers and adults.
