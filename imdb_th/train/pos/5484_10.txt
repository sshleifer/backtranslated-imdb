This film is a documentary of the sequence of events that took place from April 10, 2002 to April 14, 2002, in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace of Venezuela, Caracas, Venezuela. <br /> <br /> The pathos of this film are real And felt the pain, sadness and the happiness of the people who lived in this revolution of the failed President Hugo Chavez. <br /> <br /> One came from watching this movie that Hugo Chavez was a person. The personality of Hugo Chavez led the Venezuelan people to overthrow the military government that was installed 3 days old and build a democratic government once again. <br /> <br /> Cool, clear film from the George W Bush administration, aided and supported the coup in Venezuela. The main media assistance and support for George W Bush is not surprising. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, there are only a handful of people who have seen this movie and only a handful of people. Which recognizes all the damage of the American media. <br /> <br /> It took only 20 years for Ronald Reagan to cancel the principle of justice in 1986 to turn America into a state without state. And <br /> <br /> <br /> Hugo Chavez may open the eyes of patriotic Americans. Of true American vision
