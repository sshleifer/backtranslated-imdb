I remember watching this thing for the first time. When I was 9 years old, I wanted to be one. "Barbarian Brothers" This movie is still good. One of the original views is that the battle scenes are very short, meaning "brothers and sisters", which is a very good thing that they will get rid of enemies there quickly! In addition, you have to chase the dragon cage fight and yes, even the brawl bar! <br /> <br /> Yes, the performance is not good, that's why it's not one of the ten, and the story has many reviews. I think it's quite original. Don't let a lot of movies in that genre have original stories or colorful conversations. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie.
