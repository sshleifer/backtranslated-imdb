I saw this movie recently. 2 hours later, my head is still painful from laughing. The story is terrible, the jokes are terrible. But what I didn't think of was: <br /> <br /> 1 2 scenes before and after the movie with Pat and Jay posing (causing too much laughter) <br /> <br /> 2 The kick through the windshield, which destroyed the evil head. <br /> <br /> This film is about 20 times better than the Rush Hour series and my copy comes with a revelation that if you don't like the movie. Send the certificate to HBO while I consider the date that you have to send is in January 1991 (which caused a strange occurrence).
