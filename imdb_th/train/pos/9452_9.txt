After seeing Deliverance, the movie like Pulp Fiction does not look serious. Maybe according to the blood and ammunition standards today, it doesn't look annoying. But if you think this is 1972 and this movie has a really horrible axis, it makes you think differently. <br /> <br /> When I start Watching this movie seems to be absolutely nothing wrong until I get to the "Banjos Battle" scene. In that scene, the cruelty and edge of the film is truly visible. While I watched Drew (Ronny Cox, Robocop) go face to face with a boy who seems like a new story, it shows how the film is frustrated. When you think that a child has a small banjo which he can do by hand, compared to Drew's good expensive guitar, how can you think that four men are outside their territory? <br /> <br / > When the plot is reliable and never exceeds the specified limits But what makes this movie truly different about the four businessmen who received more than they bargained for is canoeing. Director John Boorman (Excalibur) separates all the characters from a caricature or pattern So when the movie enters horror and suspicion, I care about the four men and what will happen to them. <br /> <br /> The performance is excellent internationally with Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy , Enemy of the State) and Burt Reynolds (Boogie Nights, Striptease) are excellent performances leaders Jon Voight may do the most difficult thing of this movie and that makes him change from a family to a very reliable warrior. Unlike Reynolds, whose character is a warrior from the beginning, Voight's characters change throughout the movie's path. Ned Betty also has a very good role when being raped by a countryman while Ron. Here Cox turned to show credibility. <br /> <br /> One thing that really makes this movie effective for me is That the villains are as scary as I've seen Bill Mckinney and Herbert "Cowboy" Coward are great and terrifying people as a countryman. <br /> <br /> The overall delivery is great and I advise everyone, except those who are weak and 10/10, watch this movie.
