This program is very fun and the title song is fascinated. I can't get out of my head. I found that when I got older I would be drawn to the wrinkles that made things and these things were great in my efforts. Some things they do are outrageous. But it's great when considering that our PC world can't do it in real life. I usually learn something from the list. But if you like mystery, comedy, and forensic work, you'll love this show. It reminds me of Quincy, ME in one way and Barney Miller in another way that they work and interact with each other. They failed a lot. But working to complete and that is important
