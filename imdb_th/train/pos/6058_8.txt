This is a well-made documentary in the exciting world of indie racing. The shooting was excellent. Is the scene where Mario Atetty drives an old race car along the New England road that is lined with ancient maple trees. Leaf blown to the side with the speed of the car is incredible. This film loses beauty on a small screen. But if you like to watch cars that reach the limit, you should see this movie.
