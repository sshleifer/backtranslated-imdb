This is a lovely movie. Movies that truly feel good when you want The story is light. (This is not the wind and the wind), but sometimes we want this plot. Funny and warm characters, excellent performances and beautiful costumes / wardrobes. <br /> <br /> Parminder K. Nagra (from the ER TV program) was great in this role. She is a new star for Hollywood. Everyone should keep an eye on her. She will be a big future. <br /> <br /> An impressive soundtrack for this movie. A good mix of modern music and Indian music. I dance throughout most movies. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended if a fun movie is what you want.
