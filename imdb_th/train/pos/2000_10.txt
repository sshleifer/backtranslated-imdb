I participated in this small production when I was 8 at the school competition and my mother bought a video for me. I love it since !! When I was young, it was a song and an exciting dance sequence that I liked. But since I watched it when I was older, I would like to thank the acting and the wonderful characters Oliver Reed and Ron Moody are great. I can't imagine anyone playing Bill Sykes or Fagin Shani Wallis' Nancy. If the character is the best for me, you can endure those children. .. Do you know ... make me cry always! The best music in my mind all the time It lasts all the time. It will continue for many years to come! 11/10 !!
