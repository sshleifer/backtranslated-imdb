I will never forget when I saw this name in the video store. When did you go back? I am always a big Weird Al fan and when I saw this video I rented and watched it. I am too young to appreciate Al's humor and delicate words every time. But I remember later when I was old enough to understand what I was watching. If you are a big fan, especially his previous work, you will enjoy this movie. It's done in MTV's "Rockumentary" style and tells the true story. (But sometimes exaggerated) the way in which Al must be where he was in 1985. You will love it if you like his brand humor, his music
