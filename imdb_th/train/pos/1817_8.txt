All Dogs Go to Heaven plays in the underground crime of dogs. This movie is a delight for children with funny and gloomy stories. But pleasant and ended with happiness with music and dance It was a trait that was driven out of Charlie, a criminal who was murdered. But returned from death He met a homeless woman who looked up at him and from this relationship he realized the meaning of life and sacrifice. This is a cute animation that I like very much in my eyes since I was a child. I would like to recommend this movie to children. I'm not sure how adults will respond. (I tried to watch it a few years ago in the VHS, but those records didn't last long. Do they?)
