Although reading "initial comments" from people who do not like this movie wonderfully - (why only one negative comment on the first show?) Is a very good story to know that everyone really loves it. ! Obviously the church wants to emphasize some points and depict the prophet Joseph Smith in a positive manner ~ that is the whole idea. And in fact, those issues are very effective We already know that Joseph Smith is a human being ... but even so, and all the terrible negative attempts that the adversary provoked showed that he was able to do the work that God had given to him Amazed I would recommend it to everyone!
