There are many discussions about "Western psychology" but this is one of the few people in that category. It has many famous stars that can perform well. But is a director who makes this movie very good Stewart Granger lost the attitude of an English safari hunter to play a retired buffalo hunter who is regarded in the West as one of the best. Robert Taylor plays as an upstart (In contrast to the ordinary child, the character of middle-aged Taylor) who wants to kill the buffalo and lure Granger to do business with him They hired two other big-name actors, Lloyd Nolan and Rusthamblin, to be their skins. Grainger was haunted by the buffalo he killed, knowing that he might be blamed if they were extinct, knowing that they were extinct. Soon Taylor revealed the sadistic side. But it is a fact that is different from the sadistic one. At present, movies are created by nerds and dorks. They are not safe and need human companionship. Yet he will not stop at the murder. In the end, both holes are connected to each other with an astounding conclusion. The psychological impact of what they are doing is a good picture.
