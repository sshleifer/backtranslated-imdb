"FULL HOUSE" in my opinion is an ABC classic, of course! I'm not sure I have never seen every time But i still enjoy it One of my favorite episodes is Jesse (John Stamos) and Rebecca (Lori Loughlin). If you want to know what makes it funny, you have to see it for yourself. It's two parts, so you have to see both parts. Another favorite episode is that Jesse, Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen) are trapped in a gas station on Michelle's birthday. You have to see it for yourself if you want to know that How did it happen and why? I have many people I like too. Everyone always gives good performance. The production design is excellent. The costumes are well designed and the writing is very strong. In summary, although it can be seen in the publication But I suggest you catch it in case it goes out in the air well
