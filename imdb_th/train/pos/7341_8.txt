I enjoy the movies of Ralph Bakshi ("The Wizard", "Cool World" and the animated movie "Lord of the Rings") and I am a collector and fan of Frank Frazetta. I am also a sword and fan. The magician who loves the world of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard <br /> <br /> I miss the fire and ice drama in 1983 and hope to see it. Some videos or revival since then So the launch in 2005 is a dream come true for me. However, I bought it with self-consciousness, because I hope it is not worth it to watch only once and then put on the shelf as "gather" to gather dust until the day I died. Fortunately, my fear was unfounded and I was very impressed with this movie. <br /> <br /> As with Frazetta's art, this is a film with a fierce physical appearance and Sexually rare in fantasy / sword movies without being magic or dirty. The art is good and you see the glimpse of Frazetta best. Even my young man likes to watch it with me and ask to see it again and again. However, my wife has some objections because the clad princess (Frazetta-esquire) I do not mind because I can believe and there is no sex scene. <br /> <br /> Use roto-scoping. I like roto-scoping. It gives a more fluid and realistic movement with rare characters in animation. <br /> <br /> Despite the problems of continuity, I recommend the movie. This to fans Bakshi, Frazetta, Conan Enjoy a magician!
