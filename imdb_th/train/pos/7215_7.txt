FULL OF SPOILERS <br /> <br /> This is a fast and fun horror movie based on Ira Levin's play about the two chapters (Caine and Reeve) who plan to kill a wealthy wife (Cannon) to receive property. And insurance This plot was successful, but Christopher Reeve, at a younger age and less acceptable than the two writers, decided to play the actual drama of the murder, with only a few detail changes. Allowing Easthampton, Long Island to become Southampton, Long Island in the script. Plot the rest of the play as a free gift that is dead and to tell the truth that Reeve doesn't mind. Tools to gossip a little, or even a trial in the death of Canon inadvertently. It will increase his income and intelligence. Warhol himself. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is Sidney Bruhl, a playwright, megabucks that has four productions, the final blow and who wants nothing more than to Going back to work quietly. The replay may have Reeve's input to redeem his reputation. He does not allow the production of the famous Reef gameplay, so the scandal - anything else - he tries to kill him. In the end, they broke up killing each other. The manuscript was written by their neighbor, Helga Tensdoorp, psychic, and she sold millions of dollars to Broadway. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of fun for numbers. One reason is the design. manufacture Many multi-storey houses with large wind turbines are located on nine of the most valuable acreage in the world. (Easthampton!) Will be a beautiful digger set everywhere You will not be able to buy a dog tent in Easthamptom. This house is not large or baroque in decoration. It's just a little polite, even if it's a little bit for my taste. But the house is so clean that you are afraid to step on the thick carpet for fear of leaving footprints. <br /> <br /> Next, the show may not be improved. Ken Cannon and Fred Jones are excellent. Dyan Cannon delivers the perfect performance as anxious wife with loose pants. They look as if they are sprayed, which is okay to get her property. Even though Reeve, who has limited abilities, seems to find a comfortable channel in his role as a psychopathic killer. But as a psychopath, Irene Wirth, as Helga's neighbor, who is in a difficult state to get her - or someone like her - is necessary for the plot. But my God, the disgusting thing of her character is going around and claiming "I feel pain in zis woom!" I think in order to make her more interesting, she wakes up with sweat and a hat. That looks stupid with a bike reflector Even though she is still an annoying person from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> You have to love Ira Levin's conversation. Ken's hope is to ask Reeve to tell him why he wrote all the plays. "Because there, Sydney!" Reeve said and Ken shouted. "That's the mountain, not playing! The drama was not there until there was a hole. *** Some of them were written! "The best thing was to call Ken of the police after his wife died in fear. He worked by himself until he became a heavy rain, unable to speak while he reported the incident and asked to send an ambulance immediately. When he placed his ear, his face would be quietly expressed. He waved his nose into the handkerchief and walked out of the business again. <br /> <br /> The climax is even ridiculous. The trickery lacks the evil charm that Levin and Lumet brought to the previous scene. Most points consist of the faint-hearted riffs on the harpsichord, making it perfectly compatible with the movie. <br /> <br /> You may enjoy it.
