When I watched the tenant and interpreted it as a horror movie, it used tropes of the genre: scary apartments, suspicious neighbors, costumes, mysteries, hallucinations, hero's life. Trelkovsky seemed to be surrounded. With the evil secret forces trying to drive him angry. <br /> <br /> The last time I watched it, I challenged this first interpretation. If this movie is a horror movie, it's a horror story in the sense that Kafka's novel is a horror movie. In fact, this film can be understood at the true level as a lonely man slowly becomes a madman without external influences. <br /> <br /> Polanski did in his career three things about madness. Frantic: Repulsion which I didn't do Because the development of madness in the heroine has never convinced me. Rosemary's Baby, whose heroine was driven madly by evil forces And the tenant, which may be the best study of the suspicions that had been made in the theater He was obsessed with her and began to become her slowly. He wore clothes, makeup, and spoke like her. But he was overwhelmed by the spirit or he just let his wild imagination get the best? It is hesitant between what is true and in the imagination and Polanski has never solved. That makes this film charming. The events in the movie can be easily combined with supernatural things, just like normal causes, and depending on the audience to decide what to believe. <br /> <br /> Although this is not a Polanski movie My favorite But it is a good example of his ability to create doubts and show madness in convincing terms And technically speaking it is amazing as well It can be said that he collaborated with composer Philippe Sarde and legendary director Sven Nykvist (Bergman's DP) to create this film. Slow pacing and sometimes not interesting may make this movie difficult to enjoy. But it is an experience
