<br /> <br /> Robot jox is a good little movie. Okay, some scenes are not good and the performances aren't great. But special effects are great for movies of this size and age. You have to remember that this movie is over 10 years old and has been created very accurately at # 1, so you can't groan about the bad parts So just watch a cool movie with a big robot.
