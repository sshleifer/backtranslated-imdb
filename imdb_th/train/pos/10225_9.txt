I got a good laugh in reading the stupid comments for this movie. <br /> <br /> Because it is obvious that people who criticize the movie have never seen or stupid enough to pay for it. <br /> < br /> The best reason to watch is Elvira's performance. A few years ago, Elvira sent the movie with as much laughter as possible. <br /> <br /> It's a monster flick that can be agreed. When compared to American flicks Hundreds of scary stories The better way !!!!
