Christina Raines plays a cute model in New York, looking for a new apartment and starts meeting with strange neighbors and revealing secrets about the building and herself gradually creating a climax at the end of the movie. This film has an orderly composition, everything from the Roman Catholic Church vs. the Devil to the door to hell, a strange ritual to an increasing conspiracy, and eventually a host of famous actors and actors. Gifted, we have Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Chris Sarandon, Jerry Orbach, Deborah Raffin, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, Slyvia Miles, Beverly DeAngelo, Eli Wallach, Christopher Balsam, Christopher Wallin Forget John Carradine as an old priest Many of these actors thwarted it, especially Burgess Meredith, who gave a comical / degenerate performance as one of the neighbors that had a little bird and cat. Meredith is as memorable as Balsam and Chris Sarandon. Show some people nothing to do like Jose Ferrer in a non-invaluable role, even though it is nothing more than a cameo. The Sentinel is a horror movie with many psychological elements and some scenes that The truly scary The scene ends, nasty and still chilling. I found errors about sex and violence in movies, especially those scenes, especially with DeAngelo and Miles. Is it really necessary? I think not. In addition, the content of the father / daughter is quite good as well. But overall, this film is effective and has a beat. Director Michael Winner works like a person and creates tensions and horrific moments in movies. The scenes with Carradine are particularly effective.
