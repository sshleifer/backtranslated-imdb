This is the despair that the beach has never been. As far as I want to love the beach, it seems that I "feel" too fast for it. (The soundtrack of this album is one of my favorite albums.) On the other hand, Stella moves slower. (And too slow from time to time) and although it has an influence on the tales that make tears about mothers who sacrifice, it works because Betty and the rest of the actors in the performance are excellent.
