If I just saw the pilot of this program, I would give 10 points. I was immediately addicted to this beautiful new world. But I will watch and hope that it will be better. The production value is incredible and the performance is excellent. I don't think it will be completely consistent with BSG because I am fascinated by the location and let's see them as two different items. I am thrilled that both Esai Morales and one of my all-time faves Eric Stoltz come back in my life again. (If only once a week) because I miss them This is a list that requires a little thought from the audience and is always a good thing. You have to wrap your head around some aspects of the show; Things are not as you see and of course there are shades of gray, both letters and figurines in the plot of characters and of course, various virtual worlds. We all know how it will end. But the trip is quite a ride
