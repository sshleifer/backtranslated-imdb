I finally saw this movie tonight after renting at Blockbuster (VHS). I have to admit that it is fiercely original. Yes, maybe the characters may not be fully recognized. But it's not one of those movies But we are treated to the eyes of the director of his vision in regards to And it doesn't stop And to be honest, I don't need it. I believe Sabu will have to influence the director 'Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels' and 'Run, Lola, Run'. The road to divert their attention soon I have to watch this director's other work because this movie really surprised me. If you want insights, culture, excitement and excitement, go somewhere else. If you want to laugh, camera movements and criminal hilarity, look here.
