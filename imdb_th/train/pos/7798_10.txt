I can't begin to explain how amazing this movie is. When I can say at any time that I feel depressed with unjust or useless things, this is the movie that I rented to put me in the right mindset. An accompanying song makes you realize the convenience of existence and simplicity, giving you the greatest happiness. The Indian girl who sings this song is just one example of the character in this film that doesn't try hard and is happy to be effective. Rudy's colleague Persifina (Ashley Judd) is another one = - Eyes and good smiles may make the day of the people difficult. I watched this movie and I dreamed of a better day to come or a good conversation with my friends and I knew that being alone - Ruby was alone quite often - unlike being alone. Recommended for everyone who enjoys movies.
