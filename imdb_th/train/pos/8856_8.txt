Before the devil knows that you are dying, starting with a promise, a simple robbery setting that is distorted from a different perspective (in RASHOMON style) at the hour mark. Sidney Lumet turns this movie into something that More than the sum of the various parts It eventually transforms into a family drama with many aspects, exploring the boundaries of human emotions and relationships. When the story reaches a chilling climax, <br /> <br /> Like Lumet, he manages to seduce. Acting for a star without any comment, Philip Seymour Hoffman, one of his best roles, is a complex, mysterious and interesting character, and often the dwarf Ethan Hawk, who plays the younger brother. His man That doesn't mean that Hawke is not bad. In fact, he is quite high enough in a problematic role that fits his style. Marisa Totti is excellent in her short appearance (the fact that she doesn't wear her flesh with this). Albert Finney's character (Andy's father and Hank) is the most interesting person and in my opinion he deserves a bit more screen time. Amy Ryan is still working on her enough. <br /> <br /> Before the demon knows that you are not a great movie. But it proved that Lumet remained near the top of his game at dusk. Famous career Many of his features and trademarks appear here, not least involving the use of his characters. Merge into killer script (No pun) Conversations and intelligent pacing and good scores before the demon knows that you are dead must go to see. Gems that are truly impaired 8/10 3 stars (from 4) should enter my top 250 at 248. Highly recommended.
