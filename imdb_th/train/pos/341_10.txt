I'm really happy with this thriller! I want to see it again as soon as it ends. The performers are great, the plot is suspicious and fun and it's just a fun movie overall! I will rate this as one of the best excitement I've ever seen! The girl in it is really cute as well, especially Denise Richards. She is a very cheerful person throughout the story and gives the character OOMPH!
