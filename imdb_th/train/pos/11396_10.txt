Launched two years before I was born, the Oscar-winning film has everything, including techno costumes and movie costumes, amazing Gershwin songs, great from walls to walls, good choreography Kelly, Levant, Foch, Guetary and Caron Hollywood didn't make them like this again. Of course, this is my favorite movie of all time, which is the standard that I judge all other movies. Enjoy, enjoy!
