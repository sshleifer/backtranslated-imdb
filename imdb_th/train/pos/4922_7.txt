I wondered what the audience of that day thought when looking at Walter Jack Palance (Blackie) for the first time. Of course, he seemed to have no time, a skull-like face, a flat nose and a long body - even though he still appears now. stable And what might be more appropriate than his birth from a dirty New Orleans slum that seemed to fester like the plague that Blackie was in the city I'm just sorry that he doesn't have another scene. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is very good ?? The black humor of the morgue, Widmark-Douglas has a mutual influence, a place without tourism, the struggle between all the staff is combined into a realistic thriller. Even the domestic scene of Widmark that makes women (Bel Geddes) come in to manage marquee doesn't make it too complicated. Director Kazan demonstrates his aptitude for being a studio product assistant (Fox), no matter how he feels about the commercial aspects. <br /> <br /> Widmark performs important functions. Firmly low as a health officer But my money is only at Zero Mostel There have been actors who are sweating that can be loud, loud, or being pushed around more than people who are unwieldy (such as The Enforcer, 1950). Exciting surrender when Mostel tries to comfort each other like a crazy pinball. Unfortunately he lost his blacklist for many years. (I wonder if it's a water soluble Kazan named him) <br /> <br /> But it's not just a professional that adds color. City people add both character and accuracy, especially two Asian people interviewed by police. All the scenes have air that has been adapted as if Kazan saw their potential and immediately created interesting little scenes. Then, as well, the colorful employment hall with all the decks was pure inspiration. And what about the flea-bitten coffee shop that let me run to the nearest Denny. <br /> <br /> However, this movie is still a great thriller and has air in the foreground. Today, many millions of strange-hits
