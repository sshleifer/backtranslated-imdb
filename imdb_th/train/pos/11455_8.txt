This German documentary is in English about the Scottish environmental sculptor Andy Goldsworthy. He created art from objects that he found naturally. For example, at the beginning of the movie, we saw that he put together a piece of icicles and "glued" together with a little moisture in the form of a snake that seemed to pass through vertical rocks repeatedly. Melting ice But that condition is part of most of Goldsworthy's work. He goes to the site and accepts the feeling that it was decided instinctively what to do that day. He talks about having "conversations" with rocks and other materials that he works with. Try to work with * instead of using them. It may be stone or flower or leaf or wood. Sculptures may take several minutes or years, or may not be long enough to complete and photograph. The work seems to be a process rather than a goal. <br /> <br /> Movies and work are beautiful, inspiring and inspiring. It moves quite slowly which is suitable for the content. But you must be sure to go when you sleep But if possible, if you have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> Find other pages about Andy Goldsworthy or read about his local sculptures at Stanford University. There are also many books with statues of He <br /> <br /> My thoughts: skip this part. Read if you want to find out how this film is meant to you freely. I remember some ideas that happened to me while watching movies, which I thought I would share with those you still read. First, the temporary nature of most of Andy Goldsworthy's work reminds me of the natural decline and flow of human life. We were born, we live, and we eventually die. That is natural and part of Goldsworth's art. <br /> <br /> Other ideas are scary in the way Goldsworthy can blend his passion and work with his life. Most of us have the best patience, life that we hardly notice the life and interests that we intend to spend more time if we remember what they are. Andy Goldsworthy can create a combination of all aspects. Of his life that looks like it works very well and nourishes him and those around him. <br /> <br /> See on 8/28/2002
