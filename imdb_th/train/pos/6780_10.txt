Colman's performance has been helped by excellent writing scripts. The great Hollywood studios in the 30s and 40s can copy some Zionist elements in German and incorporate them into Hollywood movies. Very good use of shadows and light and shadow. I like the scene in which Coleman shuts down the lights in his dressing room near the beginning of the movie, and he begins to recite Otello while his face is dark and evil. The audience will see Shakespeare's text and plays that have been "Tony". Then he travels to a disaster. I also enjoyed the dramatic death scene inside the drama when he was frustrated with his emotions and accidentally squeezed his neck too hard until she couldn't stand. Her pleadings "Stop Tony. You're hurting me." Being cold and jealous. You just don't know that he is going to top and kill her all the time. The chase of the cat and mouse to reveal the killer has been greatly increased in 2 / 3rds via the movie to increase the spacing faster. Expert work from George Cukor. He is a skilled director. Great movie Unfortunately they didn't make them like they used to ...
