Probably the most strange sector in the first season. 'Shorast' is both up and down. Some parts dragged too long and some were cut short incredibly. But cannot deny that they throw in everything except the proverbial kitchen sink Kirk and the crew seem to have discovered the perfect planet for landing after a prolonged duty, causing everyone to be in need of rest, relaxation and so on. Residents have beautiful scenery and ideal climates. The first thing that indicates things might be a bit worse is when McCoy leads the team ahead of Alice. (From Wonderland) Follow the big white rabbit wearing a vest. Kirk Khan down and found that other people reported the same incident and strange confrontation. One thing they have in common is that each crew member thinks about the person / place / thing they discover before they discover it. This did not happen to Kirk or anyone else immediately. Strange ensues, including the sight of Don Juan, the Siberian tiger, the WW2 fighter, etc.; Kirk meets Ruth, a beautiful ex-girlfriend (of course) and a bully from Finngan in his academy. The chase / fight scene with Finnegan continues for too long. But at the same time, McCoy was called by the knight on the horse and appeared to be killed. Eventually the elderly man appeared and explained what had happened. This world is a 'theme park' of the future where visitors must imagine something that will appear. Nothing permanent Genuine, not dead Kirk decides to leave for everyone after all. Even if it's the ending of 'It's a dream' but 'Shore Leave' is still the first episode of the first season of Star Trek.
