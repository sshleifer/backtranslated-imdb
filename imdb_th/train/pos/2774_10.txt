For me, movies and performances are all about storytelling. The story of David and Beth Sheba is a deep tragedy and anyone can read and understand the Bible story. In this movie, I think the storytelling by Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward is the best. To know and understand the story of David and his journey to become the king of Israel, make this story even more interesting. You will feel his desire for a beautiful woman. Gregory Peck shows the true human side of this man, which in his time is larger than life. The fear of Susan Hayward is unwilling. But after that, she obeyed his power as her king was beautifully conveyed. Anyone felt the pain of David that Uriah spent the night at the door instead of home Including sadness when he was killed in battle The powerful and powerful punishment of Raymond Massey made me angry. The scene is large enough and the atmosphere is convincing. Overall, I think this is one of the best movies. I rate it ten.
