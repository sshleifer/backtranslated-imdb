Okay, we have a lot of Verhoeven violence (although not as extreme as other Verhoeven flicks). We have many sexes and nudity. But there is something missing ... Oh yes, it lacks the wisdom that Paul Verhoeven knew for his sci-fi movie. I appreciate the way in which Verhoeven introduces characters and how they have humor. But unlike most Verhoeven movies, the movie itself has not enough humor to fall into the funny genre. The overall performance is above average when compared to most slasher movies. <br /> <br /> The thing that makes Hollow Man a good movie is not an actor or a character. Like this is impossible The crew acted as a truly invisible person without having to use things such as a hat that floats on the piano strings and other effects. The most dramatic effect scenes do not appear as Kevin Bacon. Seeing them is not when Kevin Bacon doesn't see and see. <br /> <br /> The problem is that this invisible man deserves from his imagination. Here it happens that most labs are I will be happy to see Kevin Bacon, who cannot see, rob the bank and flee with it, or suppose that stealing something from people's pockets or something like that. But what is shown is good enough to make Hollow Man an entertaining movie. Grade: B
