This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and while it may be moving too slowly for some people, the lawyer of the company (Richard Chamberlain) is dragged into a case involving the city people and is not a normal case OK, one man died. But it's not normal killing In addition, there is more rainfall than average recently and the atmosphere of most movies is quite uncomfortable and awkward. Aboriginal people are keeping secrets and refusing to make six nuts. This is a story about a white person who has assumptions about the "tribe" and "tribe" townspeople. And of course, there are no Abo people in big cities. The key to what happened, even though how many times I saw this This is an eerie and creepy movie and a good example of Peter Weir's ability to create tension from anything. The ending is a bit vague. But I think it is the easiest and most scary way, 10 out of 10 and highly recommended
