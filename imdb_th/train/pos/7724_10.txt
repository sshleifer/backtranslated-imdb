Sure Star Wars (movies that I have seen at least fifty times) beat others with special effects. But this movie has everything else! <br /> <br /> It has horror. (Not graphics), romantic, intelligent robots, intelligent solutions (Surprisingly good) effects and drama <br /> <br /> I saw this movie a couple of years ago in revival with a new publication. Held today I think electronics in the 40s will look like hokey, but they look modern and modern. <br /> <br /> Ann Francis here (mostly) short skirts and Barefoot with the innocence of children <br /> <br /> <br /> The monster Krell that appears in the beam is still scared of bejebees from me. <br /> <br /> Of course we all know that "Galaxy's Great Bird" may simulate the "Star Trek", mostly from this movie. <br /> <br /> Nobody beat Robby the Robot in terms of personality. <br /> <br /> (Sorry, R2D2 and C3PO) <br /> <br /> The film is a standard that all other science fiction movies have to measure! <br /> <br /> Speak of honor for the electronic score that haunts us. All are in pins and needles.
