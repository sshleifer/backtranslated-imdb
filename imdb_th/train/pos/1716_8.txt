Abhay Deol meets the attractive Soha Ali Khan and greets her "Hello Sister" !!! This caused the sound of the debut film featured by Shivam Nair Soha, a middle-class girl fleeing from her house in Nainital and coming to Delhi to marry her lover Shayan Munshi. But Shyan didn't turn from Broken heart Soho and alone in a bad world. Abhay, the lower man beside the door, turns to the weak Soha and helps her find work and shelter in the old house. The romantic blooms slowly and Soha agrees to marry Abhay. Then Shyan returns to the life of Soha again. <br /> <br /> A carefully crafted movie with a very unusual story. Made with love in New Delhi This well-built movie has a moment that will last forever in people's memory? The first awkward kiss and Abhay's quick apology; Abhay describes Soha as "class wali ladki" & increases the urgency. "That he didn't love you"; He gave a gift to the homeless at Soha and asked her to date for a moment. <br /> <br /> Good music and great soundtrack in the scene where Soha ran and embraced Abhay. The audio track will disappear. The stillness expresses the awkwardness and tenderness of the relationship. <br /> <br /> A terrible ending makes the movie a bitter, bitter, lasting memory. <br /> <br /> Must see that I will give you an 8.5 / 10 rating
