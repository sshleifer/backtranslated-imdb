The Sopranos should be the most widely accepted TV series ever, so my expectation is through the roof and still have a superior performance. I like mafia and crime types in movies and I enjoy tracking interesting stories in this world. But it has more More than 86 hours of content allows the story to not only But one of the most exciting and unpredictable mafia / action stories But also a great family drama, educational, shocking characters, funny, laughing, loud Psychological examination related to the nature of good and evil and intellectual collaboration of dreams and hallucinations, all in one place.

But Chase's decision to leave from it for some occasion "The Dream Episode" and favorite things add a layer to the series. Chase - along with a strong writing team including Matthew Weiner and Terrence Winter, the future creators of Mad Men and the Boardwalk Empire, respectively, change New Jersey. To become a complex universe that is filled with the greatest characters I have ever seen on TV. <br /> <br /> James Gandolfini is above acting as Tony, one of the most famous characters on TV.

But he challenged the other half completely and through his family's interactions and his therapy with Dr. Melfi (Lorraine Bracco, where he has a lot of chemistry that makes sure that the therapy scene We often see almost every aspect of Tony Soprano and learn that he is more ordinary than we expected. <br /> <br /> Edie Falco caught The power of Gandolfini's performance as Tony Carmela's wife from her various feelings about Tony's life to the suspicion of her murder, Tony's torture towards her thoughts about With unfaithfulness, Carmela uses emotions during the six seasons and Falco makes her an important vehicle for non-mafia audiences. There are eyes to this degenerate world. The scene between Tony and Carmela presents the most realistic and painful drama ever seen on TV. <br /> <br /> Almost all the supporting actors are phenomenal and characters. There are many characters in all six seasons. Nancy Marchand stole acting as Livia, Tony's stubborn mother. Understanding of Tony's personality problems and panic attacks. The familiarity of Marsha's incessant complaints is very scary because she plays this role far away.

Her character is used when she is involved in Chris's career. Tony Sirico's Ferrari, Paulie, was introduced to the ultimate mafia master and is a source of comics. But eventually he became one of the most compassionate and complex characters in the show And that is just the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> familiar faces like Peter Bogdanovich, Jon Favreau, Ben Kingsley, Lauren Bacall, Will Arnett, Nancy Sinatra, David Strathairn, Robert Patrick, Hal Holbrook, Burt Young and Eric Mangini appeared throughout the show, while prominent names such as Joe Pantoliano, Steve Buscemi and Steven Van Zandt played a regular role as the main character in the series. There are more than 50+ great characters, powerful arc, and excitement and tension. Never give up on various subplots throughout the show. <br /> <br /> All funny elements and full episodes. Go with great hilarity Of the series, which has many things for a single reason or when credit at any time makes me puzzled The soprano is the most powerful and addictive series I have ever seen, and the highs of it make me think I have to call it my favorite, despite the very low content. (Mostly I disagree.) <br /> <br /> No matter how you love or hate the ending or what you do, it's not relevant: the discussions that are created are your own success. The distinctive characteristics of the entire series make it an important part of television history.
