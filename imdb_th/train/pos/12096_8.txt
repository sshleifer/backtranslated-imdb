I have watched this movie many times and found it very good. The film is known as "Castle Of Terror", "Coffin Of Terror" and "Dance Macabre" Barbara Steel. She is beautiful / creepy. George Riviere, a leading actor, works well with his role. The film is full of atmosphere and tension. The camera angle is good and most of the performances are not bad. This movie is quite suitable for rainy days or evenings. I have an uncut DVD, which is better than the edited TV version. Pick out the popcorn, turn on the lights, relax and enjoy. John R. Tracy
