Yes, it's on top. Yes, it's a cliché, and yes, Constance Marie is an overall baby and deserves to see it again and again! Jokes and gags may look old and repeated for a while. But the show is still fun to watch Because it is a family that shows a more humorous sense of humor and the author combines the values ​​of family and ideals during the jokes. <br /> <br /> George Lopez is a joke. Don't take him seriously and the performance is the winner. I'm sure he didn't intend for his character to be serious or moral. <br /> <br /> I must say that the big, dark and bitter point is Benny. I hate the character ... so much that every time you stay for more than 30 seconds, I'll turn off the TV so I don't have to listen to her. There is nothing funny about her conversations or jokes. As a mother, you must be the worst person and I am shocked and surprised that George, as a character, will stand by the miserable person for a long time. <br /> <br /> Even when I was sued for seeing Benny. I thought to myself: See you better. Have a look at Bill Engvall. There are now bad sitcoms ...
