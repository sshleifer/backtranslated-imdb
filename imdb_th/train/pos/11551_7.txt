THE ODD COUPLE (3+ outta 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Like most people, I tend to feel that Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are "strange couples" that clearly show their amazing work in Serie. TV from the beginning to the middle of the 70's is a very high mark for television at that time ... above the stage version and on-screen scenes. However, how can you make a mistake with the pairing of Jack Lemmon / Walter Matthau Matthau in particular? Oscar, the slob Lemmon takes a little time to get acquainted with Felix, especially if You've seen Tony Randall's outstanding performance before. Good script ... Of course, for Neil Simon (I'll record it here, stating that Neil Simon may be one of the worst dramatists. And The most popular of American theater), the story is simple: Felix is ​​a neat freak and a separation from his wife. Dirty people who need help saving money for alimony payments Their housing management became like marriage as well, causing excitement in the form of tiffs and quarrels. Lots of fun and one great ocean liner.
