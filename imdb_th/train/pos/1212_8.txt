Care Bears Movie 2: The new generation is not bad. In fact, I really like it. Yes, I admit that the conversation is repeated and the story is rarely told. But Dark Hart, while very dark, is a convincing shape enough to change the villain and Hadley Kay works great. Speaking of sound performance, it's excellent. There's nothing wrong with it. The animation has some colors and images, especially at the beginning. It is amazing. The song and the score are cute, especially the Growing Up and Forever Young songs. The second song is my favorite song. The bear I like to do is cute and the child is doing well as well. And the end is the true tears All in all, a little fun that is not dangerous. 8/10 Bethany Cox
