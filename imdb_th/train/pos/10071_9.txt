When the tradition says that the artist must pass his wonderful skills and magic to the heirs of a very old and proud street performer known as "King of the Mask" desperate to train young men to accept and practice. <br /> <br /> His warmth and humanity found that he paid a few dollars for the small ones displaced from natural disasters In China, in this case, a great flood in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> He brought his new 7-year-old friend to his hut to live with monkeys. His only "precious and beautiful" will discover that he and his child are his children. <br /> <br /> His life has changed as soon as his love for this young slave has become The tradition that caused him to be shocked by only young men. <br /> <br /> There are many stories in this story ... Many people experience and the culture of China is open to our Western eyes. For thousands of years the legacy fell into the drama and only a handful of people would leave this DVD with dry eyes. <br /> <br /> The technical transfer wasn't as great as I found. Sound level throughout Meter and can see the video transfer line in many parts of the movie. Highly recommended :-) 9/10 stars
