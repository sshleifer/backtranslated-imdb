"Hundstage" is seidl's first novel (previously he directed a great documentary as "animal love" or "model"). Seidl worked on this project for more than 3 years, but cost about 2 million Only dollars The actors are very good, especially the non-professional actors who are almost playing on their own. Filming is also good. Both movies are creating panic, and some scenes may be too much for "ordinary" viewers. This film shows a lot of sex and violence. Finally, I must say that this is one of the best and most rewarding Austrian films of the past year. Please excuse my bad English. <br /> <br />
