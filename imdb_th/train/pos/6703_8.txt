My children just started watching the replay of this program - both the first episode of N and the next episode in the ABC family - and they loved it. (I don't know if this program has passed one or two seasons) I want to know what triggers the changes of all actors - I've seen them explain that "Publish greatly" and spend half an hour searching. The effort on the website did not reveal anything except the endless comments that the first episode was much better than the next episodes (I personally didn't see all the differences - scripts and themes remained the same - But they lost the great people at the same time.) My daughter put a DVD on the list that she wanted. Of special qualities and opinions will shed light on all this I hope that they will create their own reference humor about the changes, such as "Boy Meets World" in which they release a little sister throughout the season or more, and when other actors appear later, she asks her. Where is she and she says "upstairs" or when the token geek series "Minkus" appeared for high school graduation? They asked him where he was and he said "there". At the part of the classroom By the camera before saying "Hey Mr. Turner, wait!" And ran out of the screen. (Mr. Turner is another character that has passed away) Oh - maybe there is a true Hollywood story in this or something? I'm just glad to see Aunt Hilda appear in the ending - she's always one of my favorites - it's too bad to be able to reunite with the actors (Chandler Zelda didn't cut me )
