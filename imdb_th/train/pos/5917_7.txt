Streetfight (aka Coonskin) is a unique movie directed by the comic pioneer Ralph Bakshi. It is a strange story of cinema and is worth seeing. It's a live action mixed with animations that seem to be influenced by the legendary Disney song of the South, as if it were a response to that flick. Philip Michael Thomas later became a close friend of Don Johnson with Miami Vice and Scatman Craggs, the most famous for his role in the film Kubrick on The Shine. Charles Gordone and Barry White (yes, Barry White) is a friend of Thomas and plans to help him escape from prison. They were stuck on a roadblock. Police and Crothers told Thomas about the black rabbit, bear and fox that moved from the south to Harlem to find a more peaceful life. The story is animated and gives many surprising things to watch. Like Bakshi's movie, most people are annoyed and don't like animation. True animation lovers will forgive the nonsense and fall in love with creativity. The film is very violent and has sex and is about fighting between races. For a long time I thought I was watching something very important. But after a long time, especially after I finished watching it, it started to seem to be using black drift. It's very sloppy and doesn't say anything. In addition, white Bakshi isn't it? No matter what the answer is, Coonskin / Streetfight is still an interesting thing to watch for those who love animation and movie fans.
