Karen entered the Japanese house as a nurse instead. Emma, ​​a strange woman, slept during the day and woke up at night. The Karen go upstairs after hearing the sound when she meets a horrible ghost. She will learn the secrets of the house. <br /> <br /> It's scary! The scene was shocking and scary! Very good character, creepy settings I love the whole story! The ending is shocking! I stopped at the scene where the little boy rang as the voice of the man followed his sister up and I was shocked. This is the most horrible movie I have watched. I do not see the Japanese version. I recommend this to the awesome fans. 10/10 and 5 stars!
