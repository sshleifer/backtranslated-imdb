Can I be simple and original in my assessment, like saying "I like"? It's funny enough to get a great star, and it looks very good. Songs (there are about two songs that are repeated and repeated) are memorable songs. But they received ridiculous treatment (Such as the handsome Mr Fairbanks, which exploded violently into a crazy Wagner song There was not much dancing with all the crinolines in 1861 that crossed the Miss Grable cycle and the comedy might be quite heavy. But the results are still very high. Photography (including real outdoor images that are exciting) is amazing. Play around with the lush shades of heavy gold. Miss Grable is quite through her prime and in the shit Somber But still fresh and comfortable in the comedy "olde worlde". Continental is quite along the line. "Down to earth" with Rita Hayworth and tends to dislike many people So I think many people will think "Lady in Erin" is outdated and boring. But it is a fairy tale and these things tend to move anywhere My suggestion is - just enjoy the artwork, costume, script with flair and everything else that this film has to offer and stop complaining. This film was released on DVD in Germany with a soundtrack in both German and English.
