While I was trapped, I found myself watching independent and foreign movies and lying to myself that I liked them. Fat burning is an exception. It is a fact. It's the most "bad" movie ever. <br /> <br /> It looks like the "badness" of this movie will happen naturally. Halfway through the opening of Satan, the word "hell" appears at the bottom of the screen. The charming Bridget is a man who does not shave hair in wigs and dresses that grow rapidly. Must use a strange pair that tries to kill each other forever to walk down the stairs Jesus walked to the soundtrack to listen to music. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Fatty felt that people lost their duties in consulting senior film projects. But it is a sincerity that it is so bad You will get the impression that the creator knows that it will not be good. <br /> <br /> Don't be surprised that Fatty is given a great deal.
