After seeing and liking Greg Lombardo's latest "Knots" film (he also co-wrote and directed the film), I decided to watch his previous work and this film was worth the effort. Scotland in Manhattan is a person with cheeks and a favorite of Shakespeare, has been renovated and moved to New York. I was impressed by the wisdom and ingenuity of the script and impressed with how the story was created in the film, reflecting the story of the play - and very intelligent. The trials and tribulations of Manhattan life are parallel to playing. Shakespeare's many times and Central Park rarely used anything better than the forest around Macbeth's castle. Clearly, Mr. Lombardo had a place where Like in his mind for the story of New York and New York (Knots comedy is funny and warm, about thirty to thirty people in New York, located in Brooklyn, charming. In good measure) and spent some time with Shakespeare's plays This film has been well developed and the story reflects the deep understanding of the dramatic theme of Macbeth. It reminds me of Al Pacino. "Looking at Richard" is another great Shakespeare. "Playing in the movie" I suggest checking Macbeth in Manhattan.
