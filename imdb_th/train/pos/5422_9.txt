The story of an untouched person who acts like a great soldier, saving hundreds of lives if not counted in the 1939 movie "Gunga Din". The film is directed by George Stevens and Carrie. Brent, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Victor McCachen, Sam Jaffe, well known in my era as Ben Casey's master, is Dr. Zorba. The name is synonymous with the big hair. And Did not say "I am Dr. Zorba" with everyone in my generation and they know what you are talking about. <br /> <br /> Located in India at the time of the British occupation. Three people - two bodies, romantic and lively In Grant and Fairbanks and McLagen as an avid player - in fact, three boys who are too cluttered. Gunga Din is a provider of water transport, which has been treated in a meaningful way. By McChesney (McLaglen) but Cutter (Grant) liked him when he caught Din (pronounced Dean) practicing the military walk and congratulated him as he attacked the unit during their maneuvers. Let the pointer /> <br /> band at a gala The Ballantine <br (Fairbanks,) announced that he was going to marry a girl who is cute (Joan Fontaine) and out of service. However, when Gunga Din and Cutter run across the murderous Master Thugees led by Eduardo Cianelli, Gunga Din escapes to warn the unit and Ballantine confirms his request for help again. It's a close friend's movie. <br /> <br /> "Gunga Din" starts incredibly, with great pain and comedy, especially from Cary Grant, which is quite funny. Both he and Fairbanks are very handsome. It's hard to decide which one to watch first. Most movies contain very exciting action scenes. In the final part, the story will look amazing and cause fierce and exciting battles. <br /> <br /> Grant has the most outstanding role. Fairbanks is a romantic love and McLaglen as McChesney. Big is because he treats Gunga Din as the most different character, even if one detects his soft heart in his love for his elephant Annie. His softness came to the end of the film, especially in the most impressive and tedious final scene. <br /> <br /> Sam Jaffe is a gentle actor and is always a favorite. Sam Jaffe gave the performance. Beautiful like Gunga Din, a brave man with a great smile, powerful imagination and noble dreams Without many conversations, Jaffe expresses the spirit of Gunga Din beautifully. <br /> <br /> This is the most adventurous movie in the realm with great performances, inspiring scenes, great musical scores. Another one from the remarkable year 1939 is highly recommended.
