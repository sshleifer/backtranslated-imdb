"Bend It Like Beckham" is a film that has received very little exposure here in the United States. It may be due to the fact that this film is very English in dialogue and vocabulary and dealing with football. (Football here), which some people may have problems with in the United States. It's unfortunate because this movie is great and very worthy. More coverage here I think the basis of the story (according to dreams) is something that many people can relate to, and in the end, "Bend It Like Beckham" proves to be a movie that feels good with inspiration and good performances. Really I wasn't too excited about watching this movie at first. But now I regret not seeing it faster I recommend this movie!
