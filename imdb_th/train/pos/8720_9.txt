All of you who are desperate to see the emptiness and weaknesses of Disney Studios' final productions are what will heal your wounds ... and every time the Bug's life brings proof that the image Pure synthetic More interested in painting like "Hand-made like Disney" is a fake (see Lion King, Pocahontas and the latest productions that you regretfully regretted that Bambi's magical background and atmosphere is gone forever) <br /> <br /> Life of insects (1001 Pattes for friends in my French cinema!) Successfully avoid all the imperfections that make you wake up in the middle of the movie and say "Hey, this is a computer created!" There is no weak part. The great effort that shows the performance in the background and the general characteristics of the amazing three-dimensional bird set. (Close to perfection in imitating reality) ... and that is just a technical mention only> <br /> My friend's situation, the true backbone of the movie is thick! With curiosity and thanks to Lasseter's team, so truly there is no musical sequence in the life of A bug, which means that this story is long and plentiful enough to free yourself from 3 or 4 minutes at some kids People admire, but most others do not like (Same thing for parents or anime fans like me) This movie reminds me of old movies with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase: 3 Amigos; It has the same background story. (All Mexican villages live in fear of some bad guys, hire gunmen. (Which eventually became an actor) to protect them, etc.) simple but effective and adapted to the terrifying ants that face the anger of the evil insects. <br /> <br /> From Microcosmos Many films tell stories about insects, life, fear and hope, but I think the life of the insect is the most fun and directed subject. The humanisation process is a great success ... and All viewers have been impressed by Flik's adventures (Tilt in France). <br /> <br /> Thank you very much for Lasseter's team, especially in the last 30 seconds .. It's strange and wonderful in At the same time, seeing both the theater with laughter while the insect / actor forgot the line or hit the camera ... <br /> <br /> And finally, especially for you Those who have watched the French version, congratulate others, go to the cast who performed great work in this movie. The life of the bug is very good entertainment and I think it will soon become part of my video collection. (The rights given to the movie are very small and that is not the problem of the storage room :) Go and see that is the order.
