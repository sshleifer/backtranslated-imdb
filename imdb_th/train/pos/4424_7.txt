Incredible as it seems, Gojoe is a samurai action inspired by anime and Hong Kong. Flick with calm messages. The foot of this film is effectively conveyed by the protagonists. (Daisuke's excellent performance) Benke, the killer who turned to the priest Benke vowed not to kill anymore But he still uses the sword to fight what he thought was a demonic invasion ... <br /> <br /> Gojo is a difficult movie to score. It is an amazingly beautiful and beautiful image. But it is too tricky (Loop cameras and high-speed drives, images, expressions, leeched colors, digital effects, etc.) So the results can be quite boring. That said the beginning and end of the movie still has both elegance and efficiency If only the director Sogo Ishii is smart enough to not use his tricks too much, <br /> <br /> Gojoe's other problem is the amount of violence. For movies with anti-violent messages, Gojo consumes too much energy and takes time to select scenes to show endless fighting scenes. In addition, the way that demonstrates violence is always on the edge of self-indulgence. In fact, blood bathed in the night sky seems to be one of the movie signature images. Fortunately, Ishikawa is also smart enough to show violence that is ugly and sad. However, it seems that Ishii is not sure whether he made a traditional action movie or a moral allegory. The audience is not sure about this until the end of the movie. Effective termination (Even if it is someone else) is what helps Gojo. It clearly emphasizes that this movie is more than just a festival.
