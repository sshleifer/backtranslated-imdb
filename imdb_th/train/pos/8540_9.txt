It's funny that your life can change for the second time ... Joining '' Waterdance '' for the first time is an unforgettable experience, the way you have to get acquainted with a new life that is scary And To inform you that someone else is working in a similar situation that can help you continue. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz's performance and most of Helen Hunt (Oh man !, Helen is the most pure and elegant woman in the world ...) is a wonderful thing. Wesley Snipe is surprised at your last important role. A simple movie and at the same time deep that doesn't make us ignore. Message sent: Enjoy every moment in your life ... <br /> <br /> Really with any movie, don't join. Hour !!! (Sorry, it's Brazilian expression ...)
