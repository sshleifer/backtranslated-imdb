The only reason I don't give this 10 stars is the DVD format - there are no special menus and more. However, if you ever have a dream of doing something with your life If you believe in yourself and your dreams, don't let anyone or anything stop you. This is one of the movies that confirm the most life story I've ever seen. And magical The performance is excellent, the plot serves the purpose and the opening sequence is a great story. This is one of the movies with the status of "cult" that used to be. I introduced this movie to all my friends. Some people like it and can't do it. Whenever I think or feel that there is something that is impossible, I think of Alan Arkin's role in this film. Of course he wants to create more movies.
