This movie is full of horror stockpiles: chained priests, premature killers, crazy female scientists. (Lesser vaguely) A female scientist with a Madder father wearing a mask because of his terrible disfigurement and women), adultery, murdered lovers, Tibetan mystics, half-human victims / half plants from Unnamed experiments, grave robberies, mind control, walled bodies, lonely road cars, electricity, knights in armor - many, every score is filled with incredible scores and The worst work of Foley ever made. <br /> <br /> The script cannot be understood. (Even by dubbed the Spanish horror film standards) and some modifications are only bizarre in one scene in which the evil female scientist brought to visit our heroine in her bedroom for one of the bad dubbing: " That's strange. I don't understand. Explain to me once again that this is ... "This garbage dump exhibition scene The movie has a hand pulling up the girl's thigh immediately because she got up from the bed without a clear reason except to hide being cut in the bad scientist of "Mwahaha! All your werewolves are mine! "Speaking, even if they were annoyed, I didn't know because there were many other jumps and jumps all over the place - even allowing them to quarrel fiercely and scan the pictures I saw. > <br /> The director of the interview, one of the stars, was very drunk for most of the filming and the movie looked like It is a disordered regulation. It has been created more continuously by combining the rampage of werewolves from various films, The Mark of the Wolf Man (made 4 years earlier, with the same actor. But playing with more aggression and having different shirts Spanish words for "The continuation"?) And the rise of other actors in Wolfman rose to ambush in the long run. <br /> <br /> The unbelievably bad music is almost random from the band. Full of eerie houses, songs like bosannova, to the longest pair of piano and gongs ever recorded. (Think about it, it may not be a pair, it may be solo, but the piano is very easy to be able to pick out with one hand while the player hits the gong with the other hand) <br /> < br /> This is one of the most trance states that caused bad movies this year. For me, fun. <br /> <br /> Favorite line: "Ilona! This madness and perversions will make you dissatisfied! "What a real story. <br /> <br /> Favorite image: The lover discovers his girlfriend was murdered, putting a candle in the cartoon style shown. To the surprise Amateur ranks directed there.
