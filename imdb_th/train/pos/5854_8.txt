This game is fun and has a storyline that you can expect from a cartoon. Spider-Man has been framed by a mysterious quack. This city is full of strange gases and is similar to Venom and Carnage that appear throughout the city. Who is behind these crimes as Doc Ock? It seems that he has flipped a new leaf. Venom is not involved because he has just been sued for Spider-man causing him to lose a good chance of shooting. Hijack from other heroes and many villains later. Spidey will solve the mystery. The fight is basic, not difficult to catch, fighting with the boss is quite fun. You have been collecting cartoons, you run out of web and it's quite fun in the city. However, that is a weakness. Swinging is not the best thing you can do: move your mouse around the city because Spider-Man looks like his fiber in the sky. You still don't have much fluency in web applications, especially when compared to Spider-Man 2 video games. However, it also causes a relatively poor swing with other elements, especially the story. So be prepared to watch Scorpion, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Doctor Octopus and Carnage for a fun adventure.
