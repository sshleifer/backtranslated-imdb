It is especially true with traditional cartoons with the same or known name (Tramps Like Us in the United States), but can still be enjoyed even if you do not read manga. It is a different tail, showing a strong and independent woman who is painfully like everyone. However, due to her external strength, she was afraid to express her inner feelings and make her peers hurt her with their blunt comments. There is only one person who truly thinks out and she can live comfortably with her new pet ... Human ... Momo If you want something different from the usual boring stuff with the actors / J-Dorama's great drama, so this is a series that you should watch ... and read!
