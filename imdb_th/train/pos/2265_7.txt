I am a big fan of Vonnegut's work and I like this movie very much. But I won't say that this is the movie "Mother Night" that I read when someone said that Vonnegut couldn't make it useless in two things in my heart. One is his style, many of which are close to the knuckles or taboos. Despite accusations, sometimes he chooses "easy" for his sarcasm. This means every day that passes as little as possible. Today's director seems to be happy to break the prohibition and I have high hopes for the "Bluebeard" version now in production. Amazingly, Vonnegut's idea of ​​a pure piece like "Sirens of Titan" should be equivalent to "R" rank if taken when it was published back in the 50s for violence, language and sexual content and even though it are Tragedy that no one came with this screenplay. And in the current economic climate, I also hope that some directors will look closely at "Jailbird", "Galapagos" and "Hocus Pocus". <br /> <br /> Another thing is his narrative style. Irony when irony But also makes funny hilarious It seems impossible to protest and appears to be the biggest obstacle to creating a great movie of his great novel because of the little writer's comments that make the color of our response in As a reader is not possible, "Vonnegut suggests that there are missing characters from his own work as an author / narrator with the credit of" Breakfast of Champions "(movie Lahore) trying to maintain the humor and Cropper cause for pain. Other turkeys are made from the novel of Vonnegut "Slapstick" in a more impressive way. <br /> <br /> There is still nothing wrong with the director who allowed us to translate the personal meaning of Vonnegut and "Mother Night." "A great example of how other investigators put it in. Good directors can add poems to images in such resources. But most humor disappeared even though it was the same story, it was not from the same novel that I read If it was like that, I might roll around in the laughing path a few times. Watch it. For readers of the novel, I think that laughing even at the end will be forgotten. However, the end of this movie is truly painful and I think one of the accomplishments of this movie is that it can make you truly feel that you have seen someone walking the edge of the razor between good and evil. And the jury is still here. <br /> <br /> Stand alone and yourself. It looks good. Worth it. Technically, there are a few small but obvious errors in continuity and often it looks drab and dramatic. But most of the time it is accepted acceptable records and sometimes shows imagination and wealth The general performance is highly organized, although the dialogue may be a bit of today's standard. <br /> <br /> It has survived quite well when looking back. "Slaughterhouse-5" and there is actually quite a bit better. Vonnegut shot there. Most of his short version is - "Harrison Bergeron", "Who am I at this time" and other things, of course, the filming version. The mistake of playing funny But left his "Happy Birthday Wanda June". There are also interesting pieces, if still available, made in the 70s called "Between Time and Timbuktu" which Vonnegut apparently didn't like very much, even though he had Participated in the production because he felt that it had misinterpreted him in general He said that he reminded him of a strange surgery experiment conducted in the story of HG Wells "The Island of Dr. Moreau" but for many people it is a great introduction to his work. <br /> < br /> But if the movie doesn't make you want to go with a better source, they don't do their job. <br /> <br /> As the man said more or less, the big show was in the head.
