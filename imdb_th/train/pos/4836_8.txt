I saw this movie a couple of days before on a video tape and although it was hard to swallow it at once (Because of its length and story) I like it very much. I was first impressed by the script and then by the recognition of this script. This film leads you to travel. But that's not easy. It must go through different periods and political regimes and show their influence on the lives of the common people. What I love is the internal logic that movies follow. Logic, which is like logic in life, is quite unreasonable and sometimes confusing. But in the end, when I think about it, all events and twists make sense. It is not reasonable to try telling the story again because it has spread over 50 years. I also like Nikita Mikhalkov's character Aleksei a lot and the way he plays like some critics saw. What I don't like about this is that I think he plays a character that reminds me of Aleksei in movies such as "Cruel Romance" (Zhestokij romans, which I really love) and in "The Insulted and the injury" ("Unizhennye i oskorblyonnye ")" Sibiriada "I think what the great filmmaker Andrei Konchalovski had before he went to Hollywood and made a memorable movie such as" Tango and Cash "and could not forget such as "The train runs away" I like "Kurochka Ryaba" for them ...
