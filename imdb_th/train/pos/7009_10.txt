I think this is a great movie. It touches all human fibers. Love in this movie is very intense. I think it's the best show to date. Excellent governance like music editing is a great thing. Good use in the past This is the type of movie that everyone should watch. I hope people will get great things from this. Overall, excellent movies I think Hollywood should create movies with more content. Even action movies still have a caring story. I like the fact that Wil is deeply in his performance. He has a purpose and dedication that is hard to find. I suggest watching this thing alone or with someone you really care about. For me, I found that the world stopped and my only focus was in movies. The outside world is temporarily suspended. It was a good feeling with all the chaos that happened in this world. And with my generation, I feel good to see something (people) who care about others more than him.
