I love this flick when it came out in the 80s and still do it! I still speak such classic lines. "Speak again" and "You said you would put my child away." Ron Leibman was hot and very funny! Although it has been underestimated and is not of interest to MAD, but I must say that this small gem will be my treasure and the movie that I will take with if sent to an abandoned island! I just hope someone will release the DVD because my VHS tape is almost out! If you like funny movies, this is for you and should be considered a classic cult! It's the best military humor and worse! Rent if you can't own it!
