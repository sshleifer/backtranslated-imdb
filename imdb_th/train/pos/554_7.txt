(With a little spoiler) <br /> <br /> It's interesting that Anthony Mann uses James Stewart here. Of course, Stewart is remembered by many people, such as George Bailey from the movie "It's a Frank Capra's Wonderful Life, so it's easy to find a line between the two movies in "It's a Wonderful Life". Bailey will see the world as if he had been born in "The Far Country", Jeff. Stewart's Webster without involving helping others (Except myself) saw the same thing: the world in which he (for all matters in practice) does not exist. (And trying to ignore anyone) Webster was forced to look for someone he couldn't help with. But having been injured, being pushed around and killed as he stood, did nothing. This reminded George Bailey's audience who watched the world upside down because he had decided not to join without ever Born <br /> <br /> Both movies ended up with the same picture - close-up rings. Stewart turned to look at a philosophy that was not involved, so it seemed to have received his "wings".
