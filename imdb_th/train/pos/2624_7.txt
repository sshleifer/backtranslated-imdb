In this film, we have a wonderful opportunity to see what happened to Timon and Pumba in the movie when they were not performing - which has a lot! The film also goes back to Simba and (probably) after Kiara. <br /> <br /> It's quite true for the first movie, "Lion King 1/2 (or Lion King 3 in other places. ) "Is a funny, fun, exciting and surprising movie (Or the sequel, if that's what you want to call it). A group of surprises and hilarity is waiting for you. <br /> <br /> While Timon and Pumba are watching movies at cinema "They're going to start watching as Timon wants to go. When he and Pumbaa come in and Pumbaa wants to go back to the starting point. They have a fair compromise in watching their own movie, which is waiting ... It started at the first home of Timon ... <br /> <br /> For everyone who has a sense of humor. The first movie of all ages. Enjoy "Lion King 1/2"! :-)
