Sarafina is a fun movie and some songs are great. Sarafina is fun. Normally I don't like music like this. But singing was not as weak as seen in the box This film is useful for learning about history because it is an interesting view of the Soweto Uprising of 1976. It shows you the views of students in the riots and shows you that they He is a true character. Because you have to see them as real characters, make you like them more as an audience and make you sympathize with them as victims of the white government that you do not sympathize with The singing of the students is correct because we know from the story that students in the riots are singing and dancing before they are violent. The students' clothes in Sarafina are similar to the clothes shown in the photos from Soweto. They create a movie in Soweto which is why it looks very precise in many parts. All these things make this film more accurate for some people People who use it to learn about separation As an audience, we must be very important to the history of apartheid in the presentation. As I said earlier, you are sympathetic to students - this makes it more reliable and less objective. In addition to changing some details from other accounts at Sarafina, it becomes chaos when police enter the classroom and shoot students. The police and the army are very aggressive at Soweto, but this may be an exaggerated event. Police and soldiers shot students But there is no evidence that they will enter school and kill people like this Street fighting is becoming more and more robbery and crime. Doing this in movies may make you feel more sorry for students in the school. This film will be more useful if there are different information about separation. The teacher was arrested for anti-government and the mother went to work in the white man's house. But there is no information about the government and why they do so or any details about racist policies and laws - by George S, Chris and Finlay
