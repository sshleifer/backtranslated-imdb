The best performance of Harvey Keital until the new century Taking pictures is very good. The pre-Castro Cuba beautiful pictures. The story revolves around the nephew of a small bandit in the area that develops friendships with Americans who have ties with Hollywood. It's about the time when the boy woke up with the fact that the small group he knew lived in a much larger and more complex world that he still didn't understand. The script was strong and full of humor. The framework, above all, really professional work that is consistent with the Latin American movie tradition. The only weakness is the decision to shoot in synced English rather than Spanish, which may improve sales in the United States. Unfortunately, this film caused less confidence. But if you can see this, you will find a journey to another world.
