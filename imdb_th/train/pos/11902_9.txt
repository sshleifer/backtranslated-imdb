This film records the life and times of William Castle. He created a low-budget horror film in the 1950s-1960s, which he sold with features in "13 Ghosts". You must let the audience see the ghosts. (They have the color of this film as b & w) "The Tingler" has a theater seat with a buzzer that vibrates the audience when the monster escapes into the movie theater. In case they are scared to death! The movie itself is quite bad. But gimmicks have people rushing to see them In this document, there is an interview with the director who was inspired by the cast in the film and his daughter. It came into his home life and what kind of person was he? (By all accounts, he's a great person) This documentary is absolutely funny and sensational. It's very short (under 90 minutes) and never has a boring time. Must see for the Castle fans and horror movie fans. One of my complaints - there is very little sequence shown from his image. That is a very good thing
