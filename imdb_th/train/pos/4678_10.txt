I chose to watch this movie at Tribeca from Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen and found it to be one of the best films of the season. The two leading actors deliver harmonious, harmonious performance that seems to match the character on a personal level. The director has an excellent role in bringing the characters and stories to life with the ability that is never seen in the first production. <br /> <br /> One of the interesting things about this film is Love in woodwork and New York City (Especially Brooklyn) The film revolves around the family furniture business and continues the delicate film of both the carpenter and the ordinary Brooklyn life. I would like to admire the director in a good choice again. <br /> <br /> This is a gem and I would like to recommend it fully. (I'm sure it will make the screen)
