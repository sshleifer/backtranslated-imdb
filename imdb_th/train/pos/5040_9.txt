The first time I saw a trailer for Frailty on Yahoo Movies back today, after hearing Stephen King admiring it to heaven. Not really a fan of both stars. I still want to see it because I'm a big fan. <br /> <br /> I'm not disappointed. The performance was excellent, especially from the two boys. I tend to hate young actors, but Young Adam and Young Fenton are great. Bill Paxton acts very well as well. It was shot out beautifully. <br /> <br /> We must observe that the plot is twisted. The last three times hit hard and fast and I didn't see them coming. The final twist of the film, combined with the attraction of what has just been revealed, makes me feel cool to this day, even though I watch this movie repeatedly
