I saw this movie while it was limited. Mostly it was the novelty of seeing Pierce Brosnan with a mustache, but it turned out to be the most fun movie I have seen all year. It started almost like a thriller. But continued to develop into a comedy-filled work that was filled with one ocean liner and great funny energy between Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear. But do not forget that it has a heart sometimes and can touch a lot when it needs When I entered the theater, I didn't know what to expect than a mustache. But what I get is one of the best movies I've seen for a long time. Leaving the theater, I felt that I had received a lot of success from the movie and planned to open it again in a wide range. I recommend to everyone who admires good comedy with well-written scripts and large antennae.
