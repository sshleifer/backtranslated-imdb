I saW this movie while in Birmingham Southern College in 1975 when it starred with Red Balloon. Both films are of similar quality to dreams. Many movies impress the fish, swimming happily in his bowl while his new owner, a little boy, is leaving school. The cat came into the room with his fish and bowl and started chasing "victims" carefully. The boy started walking home from school and the audience wondered if he would come in time to help his fish friends. The fish will be disturbed by the appearance of the cat and eventually jump out of the bowl! The cat quickly went to find the fish, hurriedly carrying him with his hands and sent him back to the bowl. The boys come back to fish happily. No one is wise. <br /> <br /> The ending is amazing in both the irony and the technical complexity. It's hard to imagine how the director would pull back the technical talent back in 1959 - seems to be a secret for 2003. <br /> <br /> If you can find it, you won't be disappointed! And if you * do * find it, let me know so I can get a copy too!
