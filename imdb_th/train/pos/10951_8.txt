Big S does not play with prohibitions or forces to do, such as saying Mencia or Chapelle (even though I like them both). Her performance will not change the world or does not have meaning. But along with ex-boyfriend Brian Posehn and John Johnston's ex-boyfriend from Paget Brewster from "Mr. Show". My side was demolished at first. Look, I love this girl and like Jimmy Kimmel, her famous girlfriend. She just sent the script and let the audience run with it. Best comedy Forging anything and anyone, such as "Mary Poppins" in the second episode, when she sings for the fake bird to press the button, criticizing the society and college. Highly recommend this But for those who still have funny bones (And don't lose it in therapy lippo-suction or the latest boob job)
