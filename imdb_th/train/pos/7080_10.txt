Terry Gilliam gave me an amazing movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe, Brad Pitt and even the small appearance of Christover Plummer made this film great! This is the only Terry Gilliam movie I've ever seen, and the Twelve Monkeys ranked my top 10. I think this is one of the best Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt's best movies Brad Pitt delivers the perfect performance. Probably one of the ten best actors I've seen He reliably plays his role (Jeffrey). The role of Bruce Willis (James Cole) is quite credible as well, both Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt perform exceptionally well. With a wonderful story to support a great performance And to support Terry Gilliam's best director
