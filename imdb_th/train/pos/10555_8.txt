The evidence of this movie has spurred my imagination for a while. We all have heard or read about it in the form of content. What do you do if you are alone in this world? What would you do if the whole world disappeared before your eyes? In fact, the last part is what happened to Dave and Andrew, two roommates who live in a dilapidated house in the expressway system. Andrew is a perpetrator and Dave is considered one of the biggest losers in the society. That's the main reason why these two people get along well because they just But to each other when needing comfort until ... <br /> <br /> straight from the beginning of this film and many problems arise with them Both are involved in crime. Andrew suffers from paranoia and does not dare to go out. Dave succeeds in his work and his colleagues do not treat him well and with the respect he deserves. The number of problems that they face continues to increase until one day, which they may have to face with the inevitable and manage it. This is too much for them and they hope that everything will be gone ... and of course that is what happened. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story puts Dave and Andrew. In the world of emptiness. At first, they were surprised and had trouble understanding and manipulating the features of this crazy environment. But later they found that they were able to do everything they wanted because it seemed that they were left alone.> <br /> There are no qualities that are incredibly small characters. Actually, we still see Dave. (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) in all movies Obviously, in order to pull this out, the actor must have more for the mission, because in a world where nothing exists, there is nothing that can distract the audience in any way. Vincenzo decided. Take a shot of the shot in a reasonable amount to make it more interesting and really good to use. Director of photography Derek Rogers also has a great way to tease viewers. With Image data, especially at a time when the characters see something and interact with it. But we don't see it immediately. <br /> <br /> Obviously this is not an event-driven movie and not Most actions take place outside the house when they move in empty places. And that is the place where the most hilarious scenes occur, especially in the case that Andrew discovers candy bars. <br /> <br /> Now everyone thinks: It seems absolutely nothing. The whole world has nothing that is white ... white, no matter where you look. This is the weakness of this movie ... After one hour or less, it is very boring to watch and must have an event to make sure it's more interesting to watch. Thank you for having some For example, sometimes when two children, because of their properties, can jump as high as nothing is made of ... tofu (as Andrew claims), it's fun to see that they can use anything to become gods in <br /> <br /> One of the best parts of this movie is the scene ... The designer created Jasna Stefanovic, a beautiful job in this movie. The inhabitants enjoy watching oddly. But it seems that both of these people are in this place Overall, the production design is without a doubt that one of the most powerful aspects of this movie makes the movie look worthwhile ... <br /> <br /> However, the best part of this film is The performances of both David Hewlett and Andrew Miller seem to be really professional The camera is in them every second of the movie, and as mentioned earlier, there is no scene in the movie. They are really on stage with the development of many characters and one conclusion. (Sometimes stupidly fun) It works to the end - and this makes this film away from low-budget areas to well-designed crafts> <br /> Let's talk about It's a visual effect, because it's worth talking about. There is nothing that has digital image effects and prosthetics that are equal to modern horror movies. There is a very frightening dream sequence in this film, and although The Drews will completely milk the scene But still enjoy watching One of the best visual effects in movies is at the end that Andrew and Dave discover their power in this environment - they have the ability to want everything out. So if they can do other things <br /> <br /> "Nothing" is a bright and bright movie. It really helps to promote their thoughts that may die. (This is one of their theories) but "nothing" is funny and It gradually destroys its own theory. We don't know where they are or what happened to them. We don't know if they will go out because the movie ends before we see something like that. The ending is not as good as it should be. It's quite easy to predict what will happen. But the writer still thought of a few events that would make it even more interesting and eventually it was fairly satisfying. <br /> <br /> Use "Hollow Man", "Kill Bill", "Cube "," Epoch "and many other movies and you have" Nothing ". It is a combination of really different styles. There are still no other films. (At least I know) Nothing is true. For those who remember the original Cube production description on their DVDs, it can be remembered that Vincenzo Natali talked about the way he happened to the story of Cube. He spoke about him and Andr√© Bijelic used to be a roommate at the same time and Both of them are in this extremely boring room without hoping to leave "nothing". It may be a screening version of the origin of the Cube story. In the end, it's almost like the one in C Wah prequels. <br /> <br /> What can I say? I enjoy "nothing". It is a great movie and the various parts of the movie come out very well with many smart ideas. Still feel that this movie lacks something and I have a problem finding precisely what it is ... maybe if we have "nothing 2" I can answer that question "nothing" is a great movie But not as good as I expected, <br /> <br /> final score: 7.5 / 10
