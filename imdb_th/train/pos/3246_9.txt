I saw this movie on cable for the first time about 5 years ago and I can't stop laughing. Everything about this movie seems to click, featuring characters, settings. As far as movies are concerned, I won't call this movie as good. But for what it should be, it's wonderful It gets the opposite meaning. The actors may be as good as they've ever been collected in comedy movies. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades and Ed O'Neil are hilarious people. For this story that was not seen, I would give a brief summary: Four criminals met in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from a friend about a bank robbery. However, when their friends were arrested by two policemen who chased him from New Jersey, they tried to figure out what had happened and hell broke down. This film is truly a great comedy movie of the bank and is a good movie, such as Oceans Eleven, the only poor male model with four criminals who can't fight each other. In conclusion, if you want to laugh, I would recommend you to watch this movie.
