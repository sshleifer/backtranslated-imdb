Slaughter High is a story about a boy named Marty. He is harassed and chosen in high school. Children, pranks with him and prank are terrible. The last prank ended sadly. <br /> <br /> 5 years later, the boy's gang met again to reunite. One of them is set up at an old high school. Now the school is abandoned and they have to break in for some reason. Janitor is still there. But he told them to go forward and have fun because they gave him beer. <br /> <br /> They started the party and watched their old lockers and they saw something Marty. A woman feels sorry for Marty. But another man calmed down. <br /> <br /> When the killing began Every kill is creative and full of blood. We saw the pictures in the clown masks, hunting them one by one throughout the school. It appears that Marty has definitely taken revenge. After the first person was killed, they found that they were trapped in the school. They started to find a way out. <br /> <br /> Now there are many things that are unreasonable in this movie. First of all, I don't know anyone who has gathered for 5 years. Secondly, after the first child died, a woman received blood all over her. They all ran away in panic. But she ran to the bathroom and found a bathtub Your friend has just been killed and she decides to take a shower !? Importantly, why is there a bathtub in the school bathroom? However, the bath doesn't seem to work really well .... and she died horribly Really ending .... with a twist. Recently saw Haute Tension. I can compare both. The only way they have similarities is with twists, which makes me disappointed ..... Then after a great twist, if not the best killer in the movie, <br /> <br /> After the The last kill, the killer looks at the screen and does something crazy and it's the perfect way to finish the movie. I'll "wow ..."
