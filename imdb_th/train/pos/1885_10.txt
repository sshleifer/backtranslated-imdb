This has been my favorite movie for a long time. Recently, I was happy to see it on DVD, which relieved from watching VHS videos. <br /> <br /> I never saw it. For many years and see today to see how surprised The movie stood up occasionally. It is one of the rare and perfect storms of comedy that is excellent writing. (True comedy genre after really funny lines) was paired with great directions and all outstanding performances at the same time. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore for "Arthur" but lost (to Although John Gielgud won the award for Best Supporting Actor), if Moore's performance in the movie "Arthur" did not win the Academy Award for Best Actor, no comedian would be able to win the title. (Another example is Gene Wilder in "Young Frankenstein") <br /> <br /> Steve Gordon crafts this film, keeping the beauty of each character and the warm tone of the story. Is a rare gem It is sad that Steve Gordon died just a year after "Arthur" was launched. <br /> <br /> About the DVD available from 1/2007, it was so terrible. Although the quality of the video jumps over the old VHS, but there is still no widescreen version. <br /> <br /> DVDs have some great specials. But still not enough One example is an explanation from the director stating that he desires to spend a lot of time to delete and scenes. (Because they are hysterical) but he must choose hard for the final correction The DVD, which is the perfect format to include such content, should definitely be presented as well. <br /> <br /> This is "Arthur", the original, a classic comedy that is one of the books.
