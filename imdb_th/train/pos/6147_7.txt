Okay, this movie about Bedknobs and Broomsticks is one of the most charming and delightful movies you've seen as a child. It is a memorable movie about two adults and two brave children on an adventure for fun. It may be an undeniable thing to watch. But I can't see it. My mother doesn't think it's bad. I'm very enthusiastic about movies and animations. They are quite good. <br /> <br /> It's a funny movie that is a delight for everyone in the family, even every child. Sex, ages 7 years and over will enjoy this song with you and your family, especially animation. The animation and layout of the animation is very good and should be a thumbs-up. It's a very good stage for the whole family. What are you waiting for? Go to the video store and rent Bedknobs and Broomsticks immediately.
