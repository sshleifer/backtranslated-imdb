The overall effect is better than The Enforcer in my opinion. It was created to be a great movie. But then I saw the villain and was disappointed. <br /> <br /> Sudden Impact is different from the previous ones. The story goes in a different direction in this movie because Dirty Harry didn't get to the police much this In addition, we have not seen the villain until later, which means less screen time for them, which is better for all of us. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood steals. the item again in the name of Harry dirty. Pat Hingle fun as Chief Jannings new Chief delegates of Harry Bradford Dillman seems to have changed its name to captain Briggs here, either way, he was not unlike Michael. Currie is capable Like Lt. Donnelly bosses, annoying Harry Personally, I like Kevin Major Howard as Hawkins's young punk with a vendetta against Harry Albert Popwell great as Horace. Harry Audrie's friend J. Neenan did the same thing as Ray Parkins, a famous lesbian around Jack Thibeau, a good actor like Kruger in the wrong way. Eastwood's arrest Horribly as Jennifer Spencer, the love interest of Harry. And Paul Drake is scary like Mick. <br /> <br /> This movie would be much better if not for writing and performing better in some parts. <br /> <br /> 8 / 10
