This film is about human relations in general and the interaction between them. The main character is an old woman who, in the twilight of her life, begins to travel to her past by analyzing how she lives. This trip occurred due to the economic crisis of his son and his intention to lead her to a nursing home. It is a story that is honest to some issues that we all ask ourselves at a certain point in life and there are many secondary ideas to talk in this movie, such as family heritage, true love, marriage or fate. Nothing new But this is useful to watch with family members to discuss some ideas. There are good performances from the actors and the characters are very reliable. But because sometimes some characters may not yet fully develop I recommend this movie for a really quiet Saturday afternoon.
