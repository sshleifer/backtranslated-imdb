I really enjoyed this movie. The performances by adult actors are excellent. But I found that the main child was a little stiff. But he held himself well because it was a new talent That humor is very noble and not in your face like most of the Hollywood junk. That is Professor Nutty. If you have a short concentration and are familiar with things in Hollywood, in general, you may not like this. I picked it up on Blu-ray, and I have to say that the image quality is top, probably one of the better Blu-ray that I have seen Specialties are also great. They deleted a little. But it may be good because most deleted scenes do not add anything.
