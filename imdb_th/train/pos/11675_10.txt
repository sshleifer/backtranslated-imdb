I followed Dakar always, so when my husband bought Charlie's 'Race to Dakar' DVD home, I couldn't wait to watch! Of course, we have seen the broadcast of the competition when there is real competition. But that never gave the background and the specific team. <br /> <br /> If you watch the Long Way Round then you won't be surprised. The language is straightforward. I find it more amusing than dissatisfaction. <br /> <br /> I think the only thing that bothered me about the DVD was Charlie's hair. But he has a style in front of Dakar, so women want to be neat Although I can live without clothes 'fire', haha. Just like LWR, the preparation is interesting as a competition. I almost cried when Charlie broke his hand and won all the bruises he had received while practicing ... and of course Andy Caldicott's death ... That was a terrible tragedy. But every year there is something like <br /> Russ makes me feel bad, even though his attitude is better than a thousand times from the cynicism that he argued in LWR. Now, <br /> <br /> What I learned from this Odyssey is - 1. Don't let the scorpion prepare your vehicle for anything! - They have many months to prepare the X5 and still be the day before the team departs to Lisbon. Scorpion has only done half the things that need to be done and the vehicle is painful throughout the race. Dakar had to work more in the plan to retrieve the driver / driver-out from Matt (and expecting a lot of riders / drivers to dry out the way they did. Enthusiasm is a passion for adventure. 'Coarse and strong' but need to add more to show what he wants and finally 4. Charlie and Ewan are planning what is called Long Way Down in 2007 and I can't wait to do it!: D If you Love motorcycles and / or blokes that are truly good. "Going." You have to watch this. I guarantee that you will love it. It's fun. <br /> <br /> In summary for Simon Pavey - you're a hero. I'm impressed. Your serenity and joy That you are done ..... amazing when considering how difficult the competition is and for Charlie, Matt and the rest of the team - full points for pulling out, think of the green team can be done Success is truly admirable. You are great
