In the fear of the streets, Richard Widmark plays a US Navy doctor who is rudely interrupted with a plague that has plagued the United States. Paul Douglas, the police, pointed out correctly that the man had died from two bullets in his chest. This is not a problem here, they both become reluctant partners in trying to find the murderer and anyone who touches the disease. <br /> <br /> As pointed out by many people for a reason In some respects, director Elia Kazan is not interested in throwing small pieces with anyone who looks like they came from Louisiana. Having been to New Orleans, where the story happened, I can confirm Richard Widmark and Barbara Bel Geddes. His wife can make excuses because as a naval doctor he can assign But for those who are native, it doesn't work. <br /> <br /> But with the epidemic there and the news Was kept secret. New Orleans PD began to chase the geothermal world. The dead man left the ship from Europe and he had an undersea relationship. The smart people that New Orleans played by Jack Palance jumped to the wrong conclusion and began to harass the cousin of the dead who began to show signs of plague. Palance expressed frantic comments on the first film he received. <br /> <br /> <br /> Personally, I like this movie. It's Zero Mostel. This happened before Mostel was blacklisted and during that time he made a special play. Jurong more He played the same role in Humphrey Bogart's The Enforcer. Sadly, I was able to identify with Mostel on the last chase scene he and Palance were chased by Widmark, Douglas, and the New Orleans police. Half of the weight of the challenge, Zero tried to follow the Palance otherwise because I was in the league. Zero's is now in the army department. <br /> <br /> Kazan can continue to do well. Time into this movie If there is less, this will be the Indiana Jones Panic In The Streets, winning the Oscar for the best screenplay that year. <br /> <br /> Kazan also takes advantage of the New Orleans waterfront. And French Quarter Some images of the same type will be used later on the waterfront. In fact, panic in the streets is a matter of people who do not disclose when they really want their best interests. Very similar to On the Waterfront. <br /> <br /> The panic in the streets, everyone is proud of it. Now, why is Elia Kazan getting the right New Orleans to listen to people in small roles? No
