Is a great movie that has many labeling qualities that have never been received: science fiction, film noir, along with chapters and intelligent dialogue that treats educated and trained audiences ..... English movies only before the 1960s, England (and only shown in the art theaters in the United States when it first arrived) and never made in the United States. <br /> <br /> The main characters in The Man In The White Suit (1951 ) Starring Sir Alec Guiness and Joan Greenwood, use polysyllabic regularly. Science references such as "polymer" and talk and explain chemical concepts such as "Long chain molecules" then communicate the importance of these things to the common people and the scientific benefits they make.> <br /> The men in the white suit (1951) are the opposite of the video game bombing which is now (2009). Dominate the movie world and of course, dominate the big theaters of the United States ....... It is a prudent action. Tell the story wisely by a knowledgeable and talented British actor. People who are educated and successful) and they do it with humor, charm, pathos and the feeling of satire that the ancient Greek playwright will be approved. <br /> <br /> Every People should see this movie and someday. Worthy filmmakers and his supporters should do this too. <br /> <br /> It's wonderful.
