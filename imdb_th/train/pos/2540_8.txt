Although not as famous as their other collaborations (such as THE BLACK CAT and THE BODY SNATCHER), this is a little horror movie. Even though the selection of actors is strange, Boris Karloff plays Dr. Janos. Rukh, a strange scientist who lives in the Carpathian Mountains, near the hometown of Dracula. Belelukosi plays as Dr. Benet, who had never talked about nationality even though the name was heard in French I think it would be reasonable to have two roles alternately, since the role of the Carpathians seems to be suitable for Lugosi - especially with his accent. However, despite the unusual twists But both are still doing a great job Carlos is the protagonist of this story. But Lugosi was released from himself as a normal person - something he didn't play often in movies !! It seems that Dr. Rukh is quite a bit like other scientists (especially Benet) thinks that his theory is strange and ridiculous. However, throughout the film's path, Rukh became the right thing, and Benet was especially kind in praising his new Rukh. Unfortunately, the wonderful new elements that Rukh discovered had an unpleasant side effect in changing him. To become a crazy killing machine (You don't hate when this happens, right?) While this may be just a normal good scientist that turns mad. But the story is well-built, well-developed characters and crazy Rukh, not a one-dimensional killer. Everyone likes to enjoy movies, except those who hate old horror movies. You can tell Universal. Pictures draws out all the stops and creates movies that are more expensive, instead of cheap quickies, both Lugosi and Karloff that get attracted in subsequent years. Good things.
