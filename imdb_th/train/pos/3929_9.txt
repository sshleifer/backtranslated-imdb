What the director instinctively can bring to the content that just needs to provoke the correct direction in the right direction Mr Lincoln is still full of some 'old-fashioned' values ​​that look back even though they are two-dimensional images. But at least can do respectfully more than anyone can see in the current movie The thing that makes it work great, as it does in its simplicity and its greatness is that it is a truly wonderful courtroom drama in the guise of historical lessons. <br /> < br /> We all know about Abraham Lincoln as the 16th president who freed and after the civil war was assassinated. But as a lawyer in previous years, he is charming, humorous in the most unexpected places and a true gentleman. He is not some superhero who can't do anything wrong. (Which is the only understanding of Fonda before signing), but is a number that has possible shortcomings that are superior to the good <br /> <br /> It's enough to say that John Ford is great as a storyteller, almost never trying. In fact, it's a lie. Try it. But he can do it easily in the studio system He works in an independent manner while simultaneously satisfying with Zanuck, so he is left alone in a tense practice in "Editing in the camera" and not moving around to not be shaken by the story It is the strength of the traditional wisdom that works with either material, such as a companion piece to the Americana blood in 1939, as seen in Mr. Smith, to Washington (only here it is legal and non-political). <Br /> <br /> Fonda is a great person to be his first leader with Ford and never let us see Lincoln through make-up and add specialness to shoes. Fonda's personality has the same meaning as in the vines of Rath and my beloved Clementine came out in Lincoln's manner. However, it is unlikely that there will be other people from this period who can play with him: He is mature and intelligent. But there is confidence to prove himself in the case of the murder that he saw - but - no - her - murder case. <br /> <br /> There are only small pieces, like the last match that Lincoln put on. Along the road with his monument and a small incident occurred in a large parade scene As far as the goal set with Young Mr. Lincoln is met by Ford and his team and actors It's not a hokey like anyone thinks to go inside, and it has a sense of humor and pathetic equilibrium.
