This movie is very cute and delightful! I cried almost every time watching a movie. I would like to recommend this movie for everyone. This movie inspires me a lot. Actors perform well in acting and movies play well and do very well. This movie is about a little girl who owns a parrot, which she named Polly. Polly separated from her parents because they thought it would be best for her. <br /> <br /> Paulie had experience with many people, so he ended up with a cage in the basement This Russian man finally got a job in a place as a janitor. Met Polly in the basement and Polly started talking to him to tell his life story. At the end, the man helped Polly reunite with Marie. (The little girl who feeds Polly) loves to overcome all obstacles.
