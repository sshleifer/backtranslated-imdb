Please note that I am a fan of the genre. But just got to watch this movie for the first time I've overlooked it all the time, this time is a miracle for me. For me, this is a better movie. From then, "High Noon" is highly praised. It's a great western with great performances and great stories. The DVD has beautiful black and white colors with outstanding movies. If you like Westerners or James Stewart, this movie shouldn't be missed.
