This general Mamet movie provides quiet and consistent insights into what makes men confident (Joe Mantegna) is a good person. Explores that it is a psychological study by a famous psychologist (Lindsay Crouse). It slowly pulls her into the world of He with the usual nasty results The actors consist of a number of players found in Mamet's films (Steven Goldstein, Jack Wallace, Ricky Jay, Andy Potok, Allen Soule, William Soule, William H. Macy) and they work as usual. I love Lindsay Crouse. In this movie, and often wondering why she didn't become a player more famous than her. Maybe I didn't look at the right place. <br /> <br /> The movie proceeds slowly with simple conversations. But there are still tensions at the level that causes a rational ending You expect to finish the story. But I found it elevated and satisfying I love this movie!
