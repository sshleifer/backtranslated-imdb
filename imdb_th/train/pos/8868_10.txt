I must say that higher learning is one of the top three movies I have watched. It has equally great actors and excellent directors. Singleton shows how university life is. 3 main stories, skinheads, African-American and homosexual groups I was fascinated by the whole story. But what I received the most attention was the story of Kristen who struggled with her feelings for other women. The end is great. After watching the movie 25 times, I still cry. I will give this movie 11 but I have to pay for 10/10.
