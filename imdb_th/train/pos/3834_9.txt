Great movie! Slowly: Yes. <br /> <br /> ... but the original, the atmosphere is deep, dark and scary than it should be. (Feel like a nightmare) <br /> <br /> I'll compare David Lynch (Eraserhead, Inland Empire, Blue Velvet). The style may be mixed with Barton Fink and a little Naked Lunch (Insect!). There is also Jodorowsky (Fando y Lis) .... <br /> <br /> Add Night on Earth, Angel Heart and a bit Begotten, Pi, (will it be wrong to talk about Tetsuo?) Jacob's stairs, Barker's The Forbidden and Salome - which should be gathered at least the concept of a dark night ... NUIT NOIRE <br /> <br /> If you go out to watch movies avantegardistic and / or surreal (like me) you will be like this If you expect something more like an average action movie, try luck with something else. <br /> <br /> The last word: the plot is strange, strange and very unusual. 1 reason why most people who don't like this movie hate it
