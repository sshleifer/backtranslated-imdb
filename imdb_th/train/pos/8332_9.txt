As Meg visited the mechanic and he said - "Is the shot shot short?" (Meaning bad sexual energy in the part of your fiance) is hilarious. I love Mek Ryan and she is as sweet as in the movie. This wonderful Cute and very smart as well. She shows her innocent dissatisfaction that you want her to be yours. The hero manages the mechanic at the garage to make good physical changes. Einstein has a romantic side for his mind? The puzzle around the media and the audience is very good. It evaluates too low and deserves a reward and effort in rehabilitation. It lost one point for including a very far-fetched theory that is unlikely to be bought by the US government. I do not see why it is not thought of in 20 romantic romantic comedies of the century. Great movie. It has a seal approved by the president!
