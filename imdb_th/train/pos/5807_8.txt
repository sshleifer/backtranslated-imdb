In my opinion, this movie is very good, especially for Michael Jackson lovers. It has a message about drugs, amazing special effects and great music videos. <br /> <br /> The main movie has a center. Is in the song and music video 'Smooth Criminal' which is different from the four minute music video. It is normal speed and in my opinion it is much easier. Michael Jackson is shown as 'Magic thugs' that when he saw a shooting star he transformed into a piece of machinery He transforms into a giant robot race car and spaceship throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> The robot scene, in particular, is quite strange and strange. I found it a little weird compared to the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The kidnapped kid Michael tried to help her tortured and beaten. Blast all the bad guys, strange? Yes, <br /> <br /> But apart from the strange robot scenes, it's a very good movie and Michael Jackson's fans will enjoy the music video Smooth Criminal and the video.
