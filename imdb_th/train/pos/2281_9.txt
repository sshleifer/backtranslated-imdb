There are many movies related to WW2, but Mother Night is unique in them: in this movie we were introduced to Howard Campbell (Nolte), an American who lives in Berlin and married a German name. Helga Noth (Lee), who decided to accept the role of spies: especially the CIA Major Wirtanen (Goodman), recruiting Campbell, who became a Nazi propaganda to enter the high-ranking position. Hitler's regime. However, the agreement was that the US government would not accept Campbell's role in the war for national security reasons, so Campbell became a hatred for people across the United States. After the war he tried to conceal his identity. But the former came back and haunted him. His only "friend" was Wirtanen. Yet he couldn't do a lot for the avalanche that was in Campbell's hardship ... <br / > <br /> The story is very impressive when we watch the tragedy of A great patriot is treated by contempt by all who surround him. Not only that But he gradually realizes that even the closest person has his own secret. Vonnegut gave us the atmosphere of Campbell's despair and made the audience almost choked. <br /> <br /> Nolte has a role in his life. He's still better in "Affliction", although in both roles he plays a sad number that is set to destroy himself. Sheryl Lee is great and can say the same for all actors. <br /> <br /> I haven't read the book so I can't evaluate how the movie compares to this. In any case, this is an unimportant thing here: my criticism depends on the movie per story and this film deserves 9/10.
