While filming at the Florida National Guard site "Tigerland" reminded me of Fort Polk, LA., Shooting range, maneuver area, deep water around the waist and all. This movie is genuine and a similar character in my AIT in 1974. The difference between my 1971 and 1974 tiger years is the military sergeant and the instructor knows that they didn't return to Vietnam. It's quite all over the corner, so training is very relaxing - not a challenge at all. That was the cause of all of our problems in the 70s and 80s, which I knew when I was here until 2004. I never heard anyone talk about "Tigerland", but the army has a Vietnamese training village in a different base across the United States. The Vietnamese veterinarian told me that in 1972 the basic & AIT was quite rough and rough because the trainers were there and were instructed to train those skills for the Vietnamese people, although it is not always the case. Both the military sergeant at Polk and one of my Vietnamese VCO NCOs. When we became the instructor at the Basic Training Corps in Fort Bliss, told me that there was nothing they could do to get everyone ready and people had to search and Think Come out for yourself This movie has a high rate.
