Yes, he's really great. But you have to be smart and quick to understand his humor. He covers (attack?) All sorts of topics like marina, first moon, Easter / Christmas, transvestitism, movies and Herr Doktor Heimlich. <br /> <br /> For you guys Don't like swearing for you while some of us are separated by commas and periods. He uses the -f word. Also, if you can't laugh at yourself, don't watch this thing. You will feel a fool. <br /> <br /> Accidentally, I watched his other things and saw him performing live and this is his best work. He just shines. <br /> <br /> Things that can be said to be famous.
