I rented this movie on the DVD without knowing what to expect - and when I was studying filmmaking in Canada, I would definitely bring it up in class. <br /> <br /> The story is centered. Around the team, the most unfortunate movie in the history of the movie itself was written beautifully and the talented actor managed to deliver pun every time. <br /> <br /> If you can't laugh during "Hollywood North" "I recommend going to see a psychiatrist immediately - you may have serious problems. <br /> <br /> In addition to the excellent script, I also noticed a great chemical reaction between actors Deborah Kara Unger and Ma. tthew Modine - Where will they show? Jennifer Tilly (acting as a badly entertaining actress) and Martin Landau also have a lot of fun and funny performances. <br /> <br /> Great movies and better actors
