This film can be interpreted at many levels. Do not listen to other comments that bash movies and say that it is another story that is played or w / e and is about drugs. It has a superficial metaphor that reveals a lot about drugs. However, the rest of the movie (And why I think it was created myself) is not about that It is a psychology that ridicule and creates society. It shows that the second fraction of the main character's brother is watching those online videos. Why? My interpretation is to show that all the gruesome things that we face make it easier for us to be a mechanism in our profession instead of seeing people as people. As long as the scene is about logic, it reaches out to people in the 1% smart class who receive orders from the government that are confused and frustrated because life is not predictable and math and logic as it seems Macro level You must use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. (Including laws and other uncertainty principles) not only with physics But with life and leaving the room to change your plan and adjust along the way One of the best movies I've ever seen It may go over your head. It is not for you. It is for people who are having problems managing life that doesn't work like math problems. When you analyze a movie or write critical reviews, try not to read the back cover first. (Written by marketers and psychologists)
