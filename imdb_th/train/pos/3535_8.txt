Warning ** - with spoilers! ** <br /> <br /> First of all, I want to say that I like this game a lot. I received it for Christmas after two months of hinting to my parents. I'm glad I did that. <br /> <br /> First of all, I want to say that one player is very good. The first level may be one of the best games when you are at a London party and the demons destroy it by kidnapping the Prime Minister's daughter. Of course, you have to save your life and it's quite big. But should take you at least five minutes The best part and I think the funniest part is when you are in a jet flock and people are teasing Big Ben. Just install the jet pack's most reliable rocket launcher and blow the watch face and the enemy down. True fun <br /> <br /> The rest of the level is very good. But quite short There are four mini levels that you can unlock, and that's one of the declines because only the first two are really fun and the last two to unlock it are just 'kill 25 enemies'. To c 'Monday! We have many points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus missions are really bad. <br /> <br /> Many players, me and some friends agree, very well and challenging, even if there are no Halo bots. Bots, but that is also a game with many good players! You can be a bad guy and fight with others, and you can also place traps, which is the best way to kill people without having to watch the characters. <br /> <br /> Gameplay - 8.5 / 10 (level Can be reproduced quite a lot and can improve the bonus mission) graphics - 9/10 (with bad graphics, strange but not often) many players - 10/10 (no need for great comments, you have to drive Jet packs and vehicles) Sound - 8/10 Repeat play - 7/10 ( G is the only one I return to Istanbul and Loondon Episode 1) <br /> <br /> I give this game: 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br> may have improved slightly. But still good
