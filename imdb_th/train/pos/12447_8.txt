There is a lot of content from Modesty Blaise's comics and novels that are great in movies. Unfortunately there have been many attempts and they lack great potential in the characters. So it's not this. It's not Modesty that you know from the comic. (Reprinted in a good edition from Titan Books). This is modest, about 5 or 6 years before the first bar, and from what you can unite from the story behind her precisely. <br /> <br /> Miramax With rights to movies and characters, with Quentin Tarantino acting as a sponsor and technical consultant The beginning of the Miramax project tries to adapt one of the best novels. But trying to make some important elements disappear Tarantino was not happy with them and offered to remove his name from the project so that they could continue. Studio credit, they want him to be in the process because they know that he "gets" the character and her world. When the movie rights are nearing expiration, they decide to try a different method. The result is "My Name is Modesty". The movie directs to a small video that introduces the character. <br /> <br /> The movie does not recommend Willie Garvin or Sir Gerald. These characters are important to Blaise's adventures throughout most stories published. The thing that this movie is successful is to show the strength of the character by yourself. She never lost peace and you never doubt that she was a caretaker, even a weapon in a room full of gangsters with guns. Most movies occur within the casino, which certainly saves money on production. It doesn't matter. This film doesn't come cheap. It gives a comprehensive story. (And reliable) that covers the character and shows how far she thinks Miramax should adapt any comic or fiction story. At this point, they have placed the character's background well and don't have to spend much time with her "origin". "Video match" does not inspire confidence. But this movie is worth watching
