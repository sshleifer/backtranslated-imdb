This is a good movie, even though people who are not familiar with Modesty Blaise's cartoons and books may find it slow and lacking movement for fans. Modesty, this movie will be very fun, especially because being an honest person in the presentation. "History" of Modesty Blaise. Peter O'Donnell received a credit rating that "Creative counselors" and filmmakers must truly pay attention to him, since the story will follow the details presented in comic books over the years. The only thing that a real fan might find disappointing is that there is no Willie Garvin in the story. This lack of Willie was just as faithful to the sequence of Modesty Blaise, as the movie took place in the beginning of Modesty's career. Alexandra Staden made Modesty a really believable young woman with a look like Modesty should watch the changes. Delightful from mimicking the image of Monica Vitti of modesty
