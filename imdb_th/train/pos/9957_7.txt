This movie received an astounding ranking in IMDb, as well as many movies. This is not Shawshank, but is a fairly good movie if it is predicted that there is a personal growth dance / film competition. If you want to spend one and a half hours watching the female step dancer 8 miles than I think you will like <br /> <br /> Judging from the IMDb ranking, I guess this is what The top 250 movies and "bombing votes" with the number 1s, which happened to many movies that are not related to mob, have no special characteristics or include non-white characters or not. Br> <br /> It is an American movie. But not US movies Most sets in Toronto, the guides are sensitive and some viewers may think that it is located in the United States just because the final race is in Detroit's border town. <br /> <br /> I Like music, i like dancing (But don't believe it is worth $ 50,000 ... but I know what) The eyes of the characters are very easy. <br /> <br /> I agree that the subject is terrible. I do not remember anyone in the movie who spoke these words and it should have "s" (no, it's not a foreign language). <br /> <br /> There's not much to hate about this movie. (And we speak honestly, 1 vote means you hate it) so I can only think that Expressing hatred towards the people there and that is sad
