There is no mistake. Maureen O'Sullivan is the most beautiful Jane ever, and will never be beautiful anymore. She looks very beautiful Other than that, it takes more than a beautiful woman to create a good movie. This is a great movie. It not only has a classic Tarzan aura. But still gives the feeling of a continuous fairy tale We are involved with two white hunters who search for one ivory who falls in love with another, which is a turbulent catastrophe in which the character may be one of the best determined and best verified in film history Great action flick is a classic. There is an uneasy racism that appears. However, Africans were described as individuals and at the end they became more heroes than white and predominantly predators. In fact, people who do not name it may be more sympathetic to the audience than other characters. The ending is one of the reasons to enjoy this movie. The great attack of the lion has never been repeated, and horror is associated with the reaction of the characters rather than the interesting modern movie. If I leave anything, it is because I do not want the image for those who do not see it. But it is everything you need in a movie
