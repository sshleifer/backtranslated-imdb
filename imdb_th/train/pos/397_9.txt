I have to admit that Tsui Hark is one of those types that you can't be on top with strong movie style. Chinese fantasy images may not be easy to present to the audience. The director tries to bring the classic fantasy tales of Zu Mountain and this is what he shows. <br /> <br /> Zu's new legend has been truly improved. From one year in 1983, from this new millennium update, we can see the vision of the Sui Mountains. Amazing visual design, amazing action epic, very well done. Keeps me stuck throughout the picture Great performers with great performances It's a fun movie to watch. But is it too strange? <br /> <br /> Now, the downside is that people are confused with the broader story that is shortened in the 95-minute movie. The plot may not have much relationship between the characters. But when watching movies again, you will have better understanding of the characters. Some people can complain that there is not much physical struggle besides the characters who have supernatural powers to defeat the enemy. Spirit, fighting with bare hands is not reasonable. <br /> <br /> I admire this beautiful image. There may be some things, but look at Tsui Hark's "Time & Tide". We are confused with the story as well. But it's really a stylish and wonderful thing. Tsui Hark has always attracted something different to HK. The American theater audience may have difficulty understanding while watching this movie because this is not Tiger. Crouching, Hidden Dragon, which is entirely new. Although it may not be a masterpiece But it is truly a special technique better than the Storm Riders. This is a really worth checking.
