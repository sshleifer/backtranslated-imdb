I live in Tokyo for 7 months. Knowing the truth of traveling long trains, riding bicycles from train stations, soups, stands and other general scenes that make me feel very grateful for this movie, which I really like. There are aspects of Japanese life in this film that are painted in bright colors. But you don't need to speak Japanese to enjoy this movie Suo's director's tactics are mostly sensitive. I found that he emphasized the character called Tamako Tamura with soft filters, making her a little sublime, but most directors had a gentle trick until I was fully drawn or crying or laughing out loud. +
