After I saw the movie, the true miracle of Walt Disney movies came into me and I knew it was a long time ago that I saw the real magic in the movie. <br /> < br /> The combination of music, speeches and magic effects will bring Disney's feelings back to your body again. The very special thing that I saw that the effects that I didn't know in the movie started with the Disney logo, changed to Cinderella Castle and ended up telling ancient tales to your grandparents. Back in me. I rate this movie 8 out of 10.
