I love this game very dead Ever since I was 9 years old (I am now 15 years old), it has excellent graphics, magical characters, additional weapons and don't forget the best cavalry style! I'm still waiting for a remake, prequel or sequel to this exciting video game. <br /> <br /> You play as a little swordsman with the potential to be a hero. In this adventure you will find wonderful creatures and boss battles. You also find some friends about methods that have their own special elements such as fire, darkness, water / ice, Thunder / lightning, earth, light and wind. There are also items known in Name the dragoon spirit which helps you transform into a legendary magical creature. Dragons, wizards, creatures called winglies and evil creatures. You'll have to face adventures full of excitement and excitement. One of my favorite games of all time, The Legend of Dragoon!
