While returning from a Christmas Eve shopping trip, a suburban housewife who was abused (Basinger) found himself fighting for survival after disagreeing with a group of young people who turned to violence. Directly to the DVD released in the UK, the launch of Susan Montford's director may not be recognized as worthy. This is a shame because the standard of writing, directing and acting is very good and beyond your average quality of flicking the DVD. <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger gives her best performance from time to time. As the deceased wife of an abusive husband (Craig Sheffer) while Sheffer did not give anything more than a terrifying presence, but in their short scenes at Basinger connected - showing painful risks But also indicates anger that will eventually provoke a confrontation with a teenager It was a truly wonderful performance. Transforming her body from the victim to the aggression was smooth. <br /> <br /> Lucas Haas I thought at first he was wrong because of him. (Including the other three children) does not seem like a lot of threats. However, if the four children are more physically attractive, the next scene at Basinger, changing the table against them will not work at all. The fact that these people are four average men, even if they do not receive a little talk. But it is the key to making this movie work as well as it used to be. <br /> <br /> In addition to the minor problems in the second half of the movie and A pair of magical lines here and there, what we have here is a great thriller that actually let the audience with something to think about when this film ends. Some people may be postponed by the nature of the slow opening scene or the sudden ending of others, with sometimes brutal violence. I say give it a chance. Of course, you deserve more time. Saw V.
