I also wonder why I watch this movie. Admittedly, before I watched this movie, I didn't know anything about The Beatles. I don't even know all the names! What I know is that they have many fans. They have albums that some people claim to be the greatest. They quit, marry John Yoko Ono and John is also killed. <Br /> <br /> VH1 is not my favorite music station at all. MTV is for some reason or something else. I decided to watch it. Don't expect much. Surprisingly, I really enjoy it! The conversation was written and managed very well with the opportunity that a slight accent arose. This is very important because John and Paul's talk is a whole lot of movies, even if they are taken outside to find more possibilities and for you to always watch. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn gives good results as a whole. <br /> <br /> The ending is very clever. I enjoy the movie making you excited about the SNL show, then slapping your head and letting you know that it would be better if they let it go and end up with a good note. My favorite moment is probably the impressive rooftop scene. <br /> <br /> Overall, I recommend this movie to everyone. It is a very good way to manage your curiosity about what will happen if 6 years after the fall of Paul just appeared in front of John's door. Which is probably the main reason for me to watch this movie, I want to know who the Beatles really are and what might happen to them after the breakup
