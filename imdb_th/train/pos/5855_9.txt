If you play "Spider-Man" in the PS version, you see everything. If you want a real experience, you should get the DC version. Just enter it. It's a game that is much more graphic. The surface is sharp, easy to use, and has a lot better sound as it is a cousin. PS I bought this game back in the late 1900s and it still remains until today. Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is a great game and Have a lot of strategies But if you're a fan of 'ol Web Head, you have to be stuck in the game library, swing around the city because Spidey never looks good and innocent in video games. If you have a dreamcast to block this cheap, the DC model is great.
