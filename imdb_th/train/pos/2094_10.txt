Of course, 65 years have passed since Thalberg's final filming, but IMDB member friends have come. This movie is one of the 30s masterpieces! It's 10. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie I saw at the New York Museum of Modern Art around 1970 (I'm a teenager). It looks expensive with scenes of poverty, such as taking good pictures, often exciting. And for me it was the best MGM movie creation.

The most talented in history and choosing to come back to celebrate. <br /> <br /> Ok, so you shouldn't win last year (Great Ziegfeld). But don't blame Luise, but only a decade when. Published and her conversations Olan bite, but when the images and voices of her memorable /> <br /> large and <br impressive.
