"Men in the Moon" is a very good movie. Sometimes very impressive and very well done in all aspects. I won't say that this movie is a great original. But today is how? <br /> <br /> Every actor member works well with their role. I am happy to see Reese Witherspoon from childhood and work quite well. Jason London works well as well. And the other person I know is Sam Waterston who works well with his role. I like Sam's character (Matthew Trant) very much. Sometimes he seems to be the father you are afraid of. But in the end you like his character The rest of the actors are good I suggest reading the plot summary, and if that sounds like something you are interested in, read it. Hope you enjoy the movie. Thank you for reading. <br /> <br /> - Chris
