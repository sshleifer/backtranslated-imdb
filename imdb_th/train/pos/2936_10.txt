If only Eddie Murphy was born 10 years later, then we all remember But even then I was only 4 when it came out. If you have not seen the rental, Dr. Look at the Little Show Time. I spy on Pluto Nash and all of Eddie's comedy movies and see this. You will laugh 90% of the time, 10% that you have to wipe the tears from your eyes. <br /> <br /> It must be watched again and again to understand all the jokes. From rude humor to jokes for children! (If you've seen you laugh here) - You will love what he does. If you can (or be a big fan), try downloading clips from Eddie's actions. <br /> <br /> But this is like "the best of" Eddie Murphy 'Top X' if you want. <br /> <br /> And all I can say is please don't look raving if you don't. Like jokes, no humor or not fun out travel You will put this great Eddie Murphy classic and may make someone miss. <br /> <br /> If you want to know how much Eddie has received Beverly Hills Cop and how famous it is.
