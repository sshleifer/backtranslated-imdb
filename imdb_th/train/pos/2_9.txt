Bromwell High is great. Script and deliver perfectly the beautiful parody of students and professors at the South London Public School makes you truly laugh. It's rude, provocative, witty and sharp. The character is a great cross section of British society. (Or more accurate than in any society) after escaping from Keisha, Latrina and Natella, the "protagonist" of our three people who want a better word, acting not shy to mock every imaginative story Political correctness will float out of the window every time. If you enjoy acting that is not afraid to stimulate the fun of every taboo as possible, Bromwell High will not disappoint!
