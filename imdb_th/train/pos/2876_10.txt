The story of Cinderella is one of my favorite things from Charles Perrault, along with Sleeping Beauty, which was created as a Disney movie in 1959. This film is a fascinating masterpiece. Charming from Disney <br /> <br /> This movie has a great soundtrack. That is what I like in movies. It is a very good song and I also like music. My favorite song is Romance. "So This is Love" I love you from movies as well. They are cute. My favorite scene is the backdrop of the lecture. The little bird tries to wake Cinderella to wake up in the morning. I love it when Cinderella's animal friends (rats and birds) repair Cinderella's mother's dress, so she can go to the ball ... until Drizella & Anastasia tear into pieces b *** *!
