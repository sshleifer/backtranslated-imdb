This is the best Emma in my opinion. When I saw another version (1996) that was good and read, I thought I could speak confidently with confidence that this was a true interpretation and was the most faithful Jane Austen's masterpiece. The 1996 film with G. Paltrow is also good. It's almost like a completely different story. It's light and very soft. You don't see the darker edges of the characters, and if you just want a movie that looks good, that person can do well. But the complexity of some issues, such as the Churchill / Fairfax plot, is very glossy, almost virtually nonexistent. But if you want the characters to be more realistic and more varied, the 1996 model TVs will be better. Emma is an amazing person. But she has a flaw. Kate Beckinsale is good at showing the character's strange habits. You see, she looks disgusting in the simple dialogue of Harriet Smith, but she does not show any regrets with Harriet's proposal being right Destroyed until that action resulted in the destruction of happiness in marriage You see your narcissism and it reflects Frank Churchill that they will harm others to achieve their goals. For Emma, ​​playing a matchmaker and having a new friend after suffering the loss of her marriage power. For Frank Churchill, it was the promise of the woman he loved while treating her and others with disgust. In this book, she realized all this in encouraging all the mistakes she had made, both Kate Beckinsale and Gyneth Paltrow, believing in their remorse. But Paltrow looked innocent and silent while stimulating Beckinsale is quite real and serious. Both models are very good. But I like this one more
