Hak hap (Black Mask) is what I want to call a ballerina with fists and bombs. Of course, the plot has been tried and heard before. (A soldier who is biologically designed as part of Superman's elite fighting power that decides that he feels that killing and brute force is not a way to end everything. In his group are trying to find an antidote that will make them survive by taking a police position - his best friend is the police - he becomes a mask. Black) style of film-making Obviously the job and at least for me is entertainment. I love amazing martial arts movies. People flying around are lighter than the air and recovering in a fraction of a second after the shock, causing the pace and action to stop. But that's what this movie is about right. Jet Li's showcase does what he does best and that is an amazing performance of his skills, which is the least talked about. Like most fast-action action movies, Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung, who have just appeared here in America for the first time, these films have low content and have amazing physical abilities. But I must say that despite the large holes remaining in the plot (For example, we can see him safe in his apartment just one scene before he has 20 people who are not more than 15 feet from him with the symbol of escape. Who knows? Scenes cut to him in the apartment ....... Oh, I believe I will suspend) An interesting movie for me. It was only until the last 20 minutes that the movie seemed to feel that it might be a little shorter. But still a great action movie
