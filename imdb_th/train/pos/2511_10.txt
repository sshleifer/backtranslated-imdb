I went to find this movie in passion. Fans in general, I just want to try it. I didn't expect much. Finally, musicians, actors and screenwriters? Impossible for many talents to be in one person, right ?? <br /> <br /> Wrong !! The passion became one of my favorites quickly! The story and characters are not lost in the special effects of Hollywood. The story reflects your emotions and draws you in. While the credits rolled in, you know that you are glued to the end. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, the performance seems to be slightly above the top. However, I believe that it is done with a funny and suitable character. Otherwise, I did not expect the degree of witnessing. <br /> <br /> It's worthwhile to see more than once. I found myself laughing madly or gaping unexpectedly with something I missed or forgot for the first time or twice. <br /> <br /> I completely recommend this movie. Do not hesitate to go with your doubts. But I'm sure it will find that is placed on your floor
