(Famous like Nicholson, Cuzak, Michael Douglas) is quite amazing from young children to the old campaigners of At the age of sixty, they knew the words of every song with their hearts and some people cried when Paul invaded "Yesterday" "Yesterday" "All my love" and all the treasures in his catalog.

He must change their minds for Paul to be a committed artist: "Reputation is a great cause to help charity." This film shows various aspects of Paul's activities. Who is the artist? There is nothing selfish
