I saw ZP when it was first released and found it a big disappointment. It seems that their script is forced and bent and forged too much. '60s It's a straightforward and ridiculous political story. And anyway, I'm still under the love spell known as BLOWUP: and I haven't completely shaken. Now, "Love" has been distorted with every kind of nostalgia that stirs it up and good. . Good luck to me. <br /> <br /> But when the march and the time were kind with ZP and time was my teacher. I come back to watch this movie every ten years and it will get better with age and ZP is my own "experience" and connects with BLOWUP through the creator, Mr. Antonioni, the great great <br /> < br /> Twelve years ago I was very lucky to see the purity. The type of projection that was accurate (immense) was restored by the cultural authorities of the Italian government who knew good art when they saw and knew the importance of keeping this beautiful thing in good condition. good To this day I remember gaping from the audience when the first shot of Death Valley appeared. It was like a shocking picture of thousands of volts. Antonio Nani delivered intentionally to wake us up to the level. Recognize new And what followed from that point was a totally different "place". <br /> <br /> The surprising thing for me was that this movie came into my own. <br /> < br /> I remember the second time I saw it - the early 80s - I started to love movies as a whole and especially Daria and Mark. While before this, both appeared to be a clever shadow version of Olivia and Leonard of Zefferelli (read: Romeo and Juliet). Now they share with me - - especially girls in animation She took her time to live. Everything is dead around you. <br /> <br /> When excited with the cinema, the light of daylight begins to erase. My new discovery "enjoyment" The poignant shoulders, 80 gold hair whispered "But that's the hippie's imagination --- let it go." <br /> <br /> The power of Antonioni's vision that I have realized. Around that time, so I answered "80s" with "Uh-Huh" and secretly protected my "love", ownership and jealous. <br /> <br /> But this is what it is that art. Good in you And if you want it to have a way and "love" you come back: secretly jealous and own And you will get "changed". <br /> <br /> Excited to see that Turner Classic Movies decided to show ZP in the lineup of the March lineup. No doubt that the ZP must appear on a giant screen to be able to take you into a truly created environment. But hey, sometimes even the glimpse of the beloved in the newspaper is not better than not seeing it. <br /> <br /> ZP has been mysteriously withdrawn and replaced by the humor of the restaurant. <br /> <br /> So it's still "hard" too "disturbing" as well. "What? <br /> <br /> Maybe it is like all good art. Live a life while <br /> <br /> Peace
