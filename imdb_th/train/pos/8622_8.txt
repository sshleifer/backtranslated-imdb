I disagree with the comments above - there are a number of interesting and amazing movies. In this movie, it has a strange structure. Moreover, it also explores the strange impulses of suicide, frankly, not pulling any punches on what it shows. It has a hint of a documentary about this story, including horror movies and art theaters, and deserves a place in the 'different' horror movies such as The Blair Witch Project and the original ring. The influence that is not accepted in) is worth it to see if you are interested in horror movies.
