'The Last Wave' is more than the sum of the results. It's not just a disastrous movie, not just an exploration of Australia's Aboriginal spirit and more than a court drama. Writer / director Peter Weir tries to bring these elements to the next level to produce. A truly powerful and thought-provoking movie with an eerie atmosphere, just like he had given to 'Picnic At Hanging Rock' two years ago. <br /> <br /> When the lawyer Another of David Burton (Chamberlain) was called upon to defend Chris Lee (Gulpilil) about the death of an aboriginal, where he may or may not be directly responsible, he found himself not only struggling to get. The truth from Lee But made sense of what he heard when it came As with the Aboriginal beliefs that there are two worlds - every day and the Dream Times, truth exists in two completely different levels, with a more subversive branch than Burton to imagine. <br /> <br /> The 'hanging stone picnic' is better remembered because of the lasting mystery. We were taken on the same path. But was forced to search for answers for ourselves in 'The Last Wave'. We can combine everything together at the end of the movie. However, despite all the information, we have to choose how much we want to believe, because this film frees us from the realm of our normal reality. <br /> <br /> Weir uses his budget. To great effects, creating a sense of punishment in everything from soft lights to heavy rain to good sound The music that was unobtrusive was never a big attempt. Richard Chamberlain managed to bafflement media. The audience felt no doubt as he tried to solve the mystery. David Gulpilil shows a man trapped between two worlds. Want to do the right thing But scared because he knew that the ending <br /> <br /> gather these things together and you have a perfect example of why David Weir is a familiar name in the theater for thirty years. Highly recommended
