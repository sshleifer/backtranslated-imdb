Seeing this as an unintended previous audience, I watched it twice. I thoroughly enjoy it. There is no silly idea that encourages messages, just good entertainment, normal, good music, good characters and a movie that feels good. Highly recommended to those of us who like to enjoy movies. Here I didn't realize that Rosie Alvarez was played by Vanessa Williams. She was great and very hot. Songs like One Boy and One Last Kiss enjoy listening and touching the feet. Your and Jason Alexander is completely different to his character in Pretty Woman and is very good. Tyne Daley is still stuck in my mind from Cagney and Lacey and her voice and accent are still there. Memories in there Overall, I like it very much and will look to buy it if any.
