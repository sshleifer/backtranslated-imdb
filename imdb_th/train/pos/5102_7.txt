Do not pay attention to the soundtrack played by now. <br /> <br /> Still, Debra, always conservative, interesting, and while previously had a role for her, she was quite good as Cissy, a young woman. From wrong The side of the train lived in a trailer with Bud (Travolta), only to be replaced by a time when the city shook Madolyn Smith as a rival. <br /> <br /> I agree with the previous review about Scott. Glenn used it for plotting only thrown into the mixture to create suspicion. The story is predictable and planned. <br /> <br /> Although I am from the east, many of us don't like "Saturday Night Fever" while having this time. <br /> < br /> See the value for Debra Winger; She is still a favorite and has never had a Hollywood personality that we have to face too many actresses today. 7/10
