The best reason I have to watch this movie is that it is a star, Susan Swift, a great actress and an impairment. Time travel movies often ignore me and do not make movies about spells. But this movie is interesting and creepy It does not use special effects that are outrageous and do not focus on time travel so much that the audience gets lost and confused. This is a really creative film that is simple and focused on great performances by everyone.
