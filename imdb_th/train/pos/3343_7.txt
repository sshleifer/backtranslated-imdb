My daughter was really drawn to me when I cited Drew Barrymore as if she had been hit by a pan. Not to mention Dudley Dooright. Her chin that Jay Leno died was amazing when I discovered "Fever Pitch" at I like Miss Barrymore; And Jimmy Fallon; And Red Sox; And Boston! This movie is probably the lightest and sweetest funny character. The girl will like this movie because of the romantic charm and weakness of Jimmy Fallon, and the children will like it for the bonding and the image of sports mania. <br /> <br /> My wife, teenage daughter and I found something like in the movie. That says something in itself It is a pleasant way to spend an hour and a half or more and may be a very good day as well.
