I have seen examples from this thing since I was a child. But while I bought the Blue Underground set immediately because it was a limited edition, I am now fit into my viewing schedule and that is because Bakshi American POP (1981) just released on Italian TV late at night. (See my review about the movie below)! <br /> <br /> Next, I found that this movie is an animated film with both swords and magic that has a particularly impressive background (the rotoscoped character is quite uncomfortable, less accepted. ) With provocative, if coming to score. Plot again is not traditional But has been proven to participate at the youth level and the main character that is well-developed - especially interesting is Ice-lord Nekron and the mysterious Darkwolf warrior. However, the hero and the heroine are quite polite. The pattern - but almost everyone Will not complain when Bakshi and Frazetta describe a woman who is well regarded (Her underwear may be torn in seconds) and bare to boot. Lost her ass)! Even so, it was clear that it was an action scene and it was delivered in front of this. (Related to Darkwolf, especially cruelty); The final showdown, though short-lived, was well managed and saw our heroes astride the pterodactyls attacking the villain's cave inside the cave. <br /> <br /> In the long term, apart from the backdrop mentioned above Of this film for me now is a nostalgic factor because it makes me go back in my childhood. But watch movies like CONAN THE BARBARIAN (1982) and THE BEASTMASTER (1982), but there are also animated series such as BLACKSTAR (1981-82) and humans and teachers of the universe (1983-85) <br /> <br /> For the assembly of "Fire and Ice" (TV) (Mark Bakshi, 1982) ** 1/2: <br /> <br /> Vintage features on movies, animation, swords and magic, which are only available through VHS printing. Washed, owned by Ralph Bakshi! It has some details about the rotoscope technique and also shows a live performance 'show' (in the studio) of the segment from the script, which will be monitored, combined with the background and filming. But even after watching many behind-the-scenes features such as animation art (such as Disney Tins and Looney Tunes, for example), it didn't create a very interesting work ...
