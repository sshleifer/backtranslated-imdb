Although not the best anime I have ever seen, but I like Lady Death. <br /> <br /> I have never read comic books and just saw this at the animation store. <br /> I feel the anime in the 80s, which is what makes me. Why everyone hates that is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Good character development. I like the way they brought the transition from Hope to Lady Lady for you who don't like it. Clearly, Lucifer doesn't tell you how it happened and she uses his words. <br /> <br Creamer is a good advisor / soldier for her. His dark bruised style is suitable for this type of movie. <br /> <br /> I think everyone here at the beat must watch again and consider again. Makes everything this person can say about every favorite anime. Vampire Hunter D
