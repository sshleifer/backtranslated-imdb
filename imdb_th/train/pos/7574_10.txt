This is one of the best series with Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (or Biohazard: Last Escape). This game has a very good story that you play as Claire Redfield in search of her brother Chris Redfield (who you May be known from the original Resident Evil.) It's scary like other Resident Evil and has a more cute scene. <br /> <br /> My score: **** from ***** star (Ranking according to Comparison with other video games)
