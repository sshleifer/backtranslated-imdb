This is the latest Dutch movie, Paul Verhoeven, created before creating a Hollywood movie "Basic Instinct" "Robocop" and "Total Recall". Before we met Gerard Reeve, an author with a central, annoying personality, along with a terrifying fantasy. Gerard was invited to be a lecturer at a literary club meeting in the seaside city for an hour or about an hour from Amsterdam. Verhoeven helped us to see how the imagination of Gerard changed reality. Asked if the writer was close to the madness he accepted when he read the newspaper and said 'boom'. I read 'doom' when it said 'flood'. I read 'blood' when it said 'red' I saw 'dead'. "When he told the story enough, he began to believe. "I lied the truth." He accepted the offer to be an overnight guest of the club's treasurer, a beautiful beauty salon owner. When he knew her and knew that her husband had died, he began to imagine that she was a 'black widow'. Is this true more than his reality or is she a murderer? This is a psychological drama and in telling the story that these old movies are stuck in my memory, I think that is the sex that I like. When looking at his work, it seems to be Paul Verhoeven as well, and he is an expert in making us question our understanding of reality. It is a good change of rhythm from the usual Hollywood fare. I saw it in 1983 and it was the movie "stuck"
