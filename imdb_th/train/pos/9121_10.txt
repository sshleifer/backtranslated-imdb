Spoilers that are in order to make observation <br /> <br /> Twenty years from 1984, this film talks about the future of the music industry's Prince. <br /> <br /> There is The scene that summed up Prince's song performance in the last 10 years perfectly, which if you bring two of the best songs out of his last 10 albums, you will have one great album. <br /> <br /> This scene can be played The Prince ran to his dressing room after playing one song and the club owner came into the dressing room so that the prince had knowledge of his breakup during the 1990s and put the album on the hard-core fans. Only big to be patient and Supporting his art <br /> <br /> The owner of the club - "You don't have the stuff you used to do. The only person who digs your music is yourself!" <br /> <br /> Awesome. Much! How to underline music, which makes the prince worse when he hit Apollonia on the ground in two separate scenes! It makes me feel the chill that is not the only scene that hurt in this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm all a comedian between Morris Day and Jerome Benton because both people stole every scene they were. But the funny thing about throwing women into trash? That's a nasty story! Another nasty thing is the father's chalk body on the Minnieapolis police area. Think carefully, which makes Prince become even more fool !! FANTASTIC !! <br /> <br /> Purple Rain is a movie that is entertaining overall because it is the soundtrack of Prince songs that help increase 110%, but another movie gives a theory about the prince and his songs again because the movie tells us that the big song that For The Prince's Story in this film, written by Wendy, wife Lisa and the Prince, dances to music father! <br /> Are Prince and the filmmakers try to tell us that the Prince stole all his best songs from his father after finding a sheet of songs written by his father? Maybe that's why the prince began to run out of strength during the 1990s because he ran away from his father's thoughts ???? ........... Hmmmm .....
