I like it quite a bit now. Ruth Gordon is a good person, if not a small person like she used to be. As already mentioned, the song is very good and frustrating that doesn't exist at all. <br /> <br /> But there is one big plot box so you can drive multiple trucks. It is acceptable that the light does not work in the vault. You do not think Columbo is very smart or others in the police would think to check if the lamp is working or not? Do you think that in a short time they will unscrew the lamp and find notes? Receiving this is a television investigation novel and will always find holes, but it seems to be too bright. <br /> <br /> It doesn't make Columbo a hidden genius when the light doesn't work. But the testimony "death bed" continues without revealing for many days.
