I gave this movie not 10 because it is a movie that has excellent consistency. But because it is truly capable of causing emotions in the audience The story of struggling for every woman is an ancient idea. But now there are very few movies that bring warmth and sincerity to The Color Purple. <br /> <br /> There is also Demonstrates a different aspect from the experiences of African-Americans who showed that after many freed slaves were in the way of hateful white men I found this to be an important point that contrasted with the violence and won the Oscars. <br /> <br /> In addition, the performance was excellent - especially Oprah, which I am now. There is respect for new discoveries. <br /> <br /> Worth the look - but gives the tissue useful.
