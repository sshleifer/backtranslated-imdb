I like to watch '' Sea Hunt ''. Back in that day, I was in high school and would go home, do my homework, and 4:30 was ready to watch '' Sea Hunt '' and Mike Nelson on an underwater adventure. His water, I like it! He took you to a place that was not very accessible at that time, under the turquoise sea before '' Thunderball '' or before Cousteau became a normal matter. Mike Nelson sparked the imagination of my children. Willing to bet that there are more than a few children who develop a passion for oceanography or biology in this show. Underwater photography is progressing, the obsession of exploration is stimulated. Easily through this program, watch and enjoy !!!
