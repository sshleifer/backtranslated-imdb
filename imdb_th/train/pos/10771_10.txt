The film has stars starring John Kandy, Richard Lewis, Ornella Mutti, Cybill Shepard and Jim Belushi. Give a few names to work in Monte Carlo as well as places. In europe The problem that everyone enters when they lie to protect themselves is great and I suggest you watch this movie. It's worth it! John Candy is in the best form in once upon a time, crime, like everyone else! If you and your family are looking for a great family movie, this is your ticket. Everyone gives great performances, great performances, great jokes and wonderful times that are rare in movies today. Great plot, great mystery. (Which I love anyway) and overall, worth the money you spend on it, for kids to grab popcorn, fruit juice or tea or soda and enjoy the show !!!!
