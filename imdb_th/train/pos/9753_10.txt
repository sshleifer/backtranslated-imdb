... in our household Like everyone else who commented on this movie, my brother (age 7 & 4 years at that time) and me (10) will watch this movie over and over again. We all love Star Wars. But we always go back here because of the great music and adventure We all love camels and will sing at the top of our lungs with him during his songs. There are some slow times. (The time spent with King Koo-Koo in his court) And in general we are tired of The Knight's songs ("The reason I {sound effect} is because I'm loooooove you") But we love traveling. To help Babbette and the ending and the image of King Koo-Koo floating above the horizon of the whole world and laughing madly at the end I still have to sing today "Cheers for me! Babbette of Gay Paris! "Around my friends (now I'm 33 years old) who just looked at me as if I had lost my mind. However, when I sang, I was 10 years old again to commemorate the wonderful year of Star Wars.
