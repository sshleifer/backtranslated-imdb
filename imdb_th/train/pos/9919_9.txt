This beautiful, fascinating and terrifying movie is "Apocalypse Now" that has no novels in a slow, quiet rhythm. It gives a good glimpse of the toxic patches of the world that may be a sign of inevitable punishment <br /> <br /> There is no doubt in my heart - nature is disturbed and we are a disease, greed, the essence of humanity that drives evolution and progress. In the host to eat and die with it ... <br /> <br /> The landscape has produced quite a memorable experience - at least I would not consider toasters and ironing same again.
