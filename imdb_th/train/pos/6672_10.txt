I've seen Mystery Men do something in the media and with the general public (using the imdb vote), but my overall feeling is Mystery Men. More fun than most movies, of course, the most commonly called. The movie is very funny and 'smart'. <br /> <br /> The great actor Greg Kinnear is great, like Geoffrey Rush and Tom Waits. Kinnear's limo scene with Ricky Jay is perfect for 'Spoiled movie star' and he embeds his character with the balance of comic book quality and realism that will make him work. <br /> <br /> I'll accept a little pacing. In places and images that are obviously very obvious, it may be possible to cause damage to specific characteristics. But at the end of the day, this is the creation of advanced conceptual films - it's about a little time - and there are many great movies in this film to make it worth watching.
