Jesse is 18 years old. Wise and doesn't want anything more than playing football when she joins the local team. She has to lie to her parents over and over again because they never agree to chase their dreams. Lovely Indian boy and learn how to cook <br /> <br /> Bend like Beckham is a funny movie that feels very good that doesn't need to be deep and complicated. All actors are very good and they play a very good role. The story is simple and predictable. But it works perfectly and the script is realistic and funny. <br /> <br /> Excellent family movie 8/10
