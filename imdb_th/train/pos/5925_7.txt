Due to the negative comments of this film, I almost didn't look at it. However, I was surprised that it was a horror movie that was quite fun. The acting was not good - besides Alice Krige, which was wonderful - but some dialogue. ("Just consider yourself with lunch") Quite fun. <br /> <br /> Overall, Stephen King tried more than 7/10.
