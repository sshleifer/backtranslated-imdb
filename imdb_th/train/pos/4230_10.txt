For Columbo fans like myself, this is the episode of the episode that makes the case why Columbo is popular and it's so good. Ruth Gordon Mi Wanfield (as always) plays a crime novelist with a flair. Abigail Mitchell looks like Abigail will call her grandchildren to sign some documents, making him the heir of her. She had never received death from her granddaughter and believed that her dead niece's husband (Charles Frank) had done something dirty. To tell more about it, Mariette Hartley had a role as Sly as the personal assistant of Abigail. This Columbo is in the class by itself. It's a well-made television movie. I highly recommend
