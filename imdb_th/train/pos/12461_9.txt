A clever script from SEBASTIAN JAPRISOT and intelligent performances from two male actors - ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON (or should be other ways) cause excitement and fun. <br /> <br /> Add more. Also the direction over the capabilities of veterans, JEAN HERMAN and sparse scores But effective by FRANCOIS DE ROUBAIX, it becomes easy to see why this movie has timeless quality. <br /> <br /> This is a buddy buddy. Maverick and the whole world weary back to the assumption of Algiers Like other colonial powers at this time (after the Second World War leading up to the 60s), France struggled to make appearances abroad. The loss of Algiers is a bitter story. <br /> <br /> ADIEU L'AMI (traditional name) records the actions of our two heroes (against) as they struggle to do it after Discharge /> <br /> One thing happened after that, and the audience had to really pay attention because JAPRISOT was skinny and economical with his script: If there was, then there must be a reason. Suffice to say that these two men fought together. Body and mind a long week. Their motivation is very different. Their goal is different - their survival depends on each other. Alain DELON and CHARLES BRONSON are different, outside - in the past, young girls who Cute and ugly gangster added to chemistry. <br /> <br /> This mission has created a great story. <br /> <br /> Lest I forget that there are women in this movie and really with Japizot's methods, they are also memorable. To say more is to lose one's happiness in discovering their true nature. <br /> <br /> My friend FAREWELL was released in the UK. Animation image, 16.9 update; In English only (Not even a description for difficult hearing); Time spent in running for 110 minutes MONO SOUNDTRACK, but DE ROUBAIX song has a number of punches! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
