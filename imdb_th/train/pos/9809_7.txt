Randolph Scott is heading to Albuquerque to work with his uncle. However, in the meantime, the stage was held - even if they didn't hold the safety box. However, there is a lovely woman on the boat, hiding $ 10,000 for her and her brother's business ... and the thieves know this. <br /> <br /> Once in the city, Scott goes to the uncle. Her about this work However, he soon learned that this uncle was a jerk-general from the west. You know, the rich people who want to get rich are just cheating and stealing and threatening until he owns everything. And it suddenly happened that this jerk was behind the robbery Scott calls for his uncle to return the money. Scott then does business with a lovely woman and her brother. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, this is not the end of the problem - - just the beginning Repeatedly, the various forms of interest arose to try to overcome the uncle's opposition. One trick is to bring a lovely woman to be friends with Scott and his partner. She is a shattered shot and it looks bad for Scott - until he understands why she came to town. <br /> <br /> Unlike the movie Randolph Scots. Mostly later Often in his movies, he is the last person to introduce violence. But in this film, he suggested a quick debate. (So ​​drunk, the law has hangin) and later he hurried to threaten his uncle. It's a very surprising thing to see him as a hot head, but in many ways he is the old scotch that you expect. <br /> <br /> As far as this movie gets it. Gabby Hayes plays Scott as a bad hero, unable to reason, and ultimately is destroyed and Scott gets a girl. Despite this general plot, it manages well and is well worth your time. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there are two strange scenes in the movie. First of all, in this movie, there is a fight between Scott and his # 1 supporter, Looney Jr. .. In that, Chaney smokes while he fights - something I have never seen before and I admire how he can stir. As he kicked the butt Secondly, get a stroller that runs away with a whip - now that's an impossible achievement!
