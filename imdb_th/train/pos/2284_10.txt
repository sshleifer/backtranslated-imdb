This is a chilling scene and most of the drama that is well thought out I'm very impressed with this film. But only for the plot and the great performances Most movies related to spies or wars are filled with British fluent conversations or great battles. But not like this This is not about this kind of war. It's about the war between man and his position. In American spy life in Germany posing as an evil advocate, no one will forget When the war ended, Campell thought he would go home as a hero. But his true stance must be the secret of the government When returning to America, Campell met with supporters of the Nazis and those who hated Nazi, which was an interesting conflict both inside and outside. Nolte took the role and adapted to the plan well for what he asked.
