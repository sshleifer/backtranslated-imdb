After an anonymous phone call about a spacecraft that collided with ice, two police officers found evidence that the incident had actually occurred and it was clear that one Mars had walked out of the spot. They drove to Hi-Way Caf√© nearby and found a bus stop and seven passengers waiting to open the snow bridge again. However, the driver said that he had only six passengers when he parked the car. While interrogating travelers, strange things happen in restaurants that have lights on and off and the plaque open and close. When the passenger is released and the bus tracks his journey, one passenger travels back to the restaurant and reveals the plan to invade the world. <br /> <br /> "Will Tuesday really stand up?
