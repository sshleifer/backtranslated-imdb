In today's world of digital production, there is no computer rather than replacing actors and writers. Alas, this type of movie that has characters is a character that is too rare today. Duvall and James Earl Jones's performances are faithful to the expectations of the audience. I wonder if this film is made for TV? It has personal qualities "close" for lectures. It is enough to say that the performance is outstanding. The only thing that makes it not a movie masterpiece is the lack of a great filmmaker. But beautiful images are not everything Jones and Duvall's favorite talents are still able to create such great works in an era when actors cause digitization?
