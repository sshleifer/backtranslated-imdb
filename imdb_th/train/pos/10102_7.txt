I have to start saying that it has been a long time since I saw it. But saw it 5 times or more A wonderful little run that was inspired by a musical / comedy match of a new star or faded with a group of famous musicians. The mystery of Kay Kyser will be a good example. <br /> <br /> Having Spike Jones unleashed is the best part of the performance because he and his band play many songs and are part of the supporting act. Hugh O'Brien plays the role of Buddy Hackett, which is partly rumored to be presented to Lou Costello, so Abbott and Costello are the leaders. I don't know if it's true. <br /> <br /> All of them are delightful movies. But very important to have Spike Jones and his band on film for history Hopefully it will be released as I have not seen or heard in these two decades. Hope it won't be lost
