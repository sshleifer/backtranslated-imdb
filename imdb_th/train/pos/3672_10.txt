A parody documentary about a pair of Canadian producers, Bobby Myers (Matthew Modine) and Paul Linder (Saul Rubinek), trying to create the first film in the late 1970s. There are many conflicting topics. <br /> <br /> Hollywood North works as a movie in a manner similar to the cause of This Is Spinal Tap (1984). D. is said to be exaggerated in some ways. But it is very close to the truth and the truth contains facts "behind the scenes" which are very different from the public pages of the industry. It's not easy to make a movie, and it must be difficult, especially in Canada. In the late 70s, movies involved dozens of people, if not hundreds of people. Many people have desires, aspirations and incompatible personalities. In particular, the important thing is that financiers and talented people on the screen, as though they were in any situation, while the film was in production, it could adversely affect the whole story> <br /> So it's not surprising that Hollywood North cares about that relationship. The result is a great movie that is both hilarious and sad at the same time. The script is perfect and the performance is the best. This is something that should not be missed for any filmmaker and anyone who is seriously interested in film making. It should be more than entertainment for audiences with intelligence and humor. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
