Firstly, this is the most fun movie I've ever seen. It combines a completely self-defined pain, sexual humor and intelligent stand-up. But it goes deeper than that. The Souler Opposite is the first love story. (Something that we don't see often) that gives me hope that there is love there. Two people who love each other can work through difficulties And funny things used in life (What I believe we should all have) Can be recognized by people who are really important. Chris Meloni gave a convincing performance, such as Barry Singer that he should win an Oscar. This film is written beautifully and I hope we can see more movies from everyone involved in the future.
