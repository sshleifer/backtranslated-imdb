I watched this movie for the first time when I was a child and was the only time in my life that I could remember putting my hands on my face and eyes with the horror of one scene. I remember it again with discontent with my friends and bought it in the video immediately, with many hesitation that I might add. (Surprised me, I found it on the web in America when it was done in England!) When I watched it My reaction again and to my surprise almost the same from the real fear and fear and my heart never danced as well. This is mine in the movie SCARIEST that I used to create. Hollywood movies seem tame when compared to Pony and Trap (shit), causing punishment to pun. The amazing thing is the power of this film and at Uni, when watching this thing with my colleagues, about twenty people, I have never heard many loud screams as well! Even the video made the fear of God come to me in that scene and made me feel that I wouldn't walk alone in the dark again !!!!
