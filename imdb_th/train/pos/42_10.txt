Busy Phillips falls into the underworld of both funny and dramatic performances. Erika Christensen is good but is busy with acting. It is a great touch after The Smokers, a movie starring Busy, which is not as good as this. If Busy is not offered any name for this movie, it will be a disaster. Forget Mona Lisa Smile. Look at Home Room.
