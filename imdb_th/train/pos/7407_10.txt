This movie has many reasons because when society "More progressive" What culture is loose? Do not give a sermon I can relate to this film from my kid's skirt and lose my life that will never come back or the same. This movie is the top 5 movies I've watched. There is a raw truth that I feel when I watch movies and it's not true that you have to dig correctly in front of your face. The creator of this film did a great job and I enjoyed this movie a lot.
