Wow, how can I talk about this without tears? It was the highlight of my year - no - my life, as if the raptor graphics were not amazing enough. The award-winning editors continued to use the same shot throughout the movie, even though the background didn't match the actual scene. Wow what genius And while the film is full of plot holes (For example, a few t-Rex animals that the prey should be and one important time Pappy discovered the torture room shouting "Colin is a girl!") I will never forget the brightness that is the Raptor Planet. Thanks to Sci-Fi for another classic.
