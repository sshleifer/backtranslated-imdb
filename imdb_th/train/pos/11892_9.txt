People in the movie Pialat are in an intense emotional situation, generally with many violent scenes in La Gueule ouverte. He dealt with serious consequences for a woman's husband and son while she died of cancer in A nos amours. The sex experiment of a young woman leads to a violent confrontation with her family. Here we have a rather spoiled young woman who abandoned her husband for a sexy past. Her motivation is quite cloudy because Loulou can't read or talk about anything more challenging than a TV show. On the other hand, he has a great shape. (I wonder why Depardieu never created a sports movie to show off that body - he should be good as a rugby player) <br /> <br /> The casting is impressive. Isabelle Huggert can't. Allowed to show politely and express without reason (She gave many people); Depardieu plays the role of Loulou with the power and charm you need - see the scene in the bar where he is stabbed into the gut, running away for healing. Then start with Nelly Guy Marchand, who has dark eyes and looks Suffering to play as Nelly's husband beautifully Is a good repeat of the match in Coup de foudre
