I love this movie The scene is amazing. The plot has great twists and turns and the characters are rounded. However, in two perspectives, "Rob Roy" scored higher than the average. First of all, I rarely see "popular" movies that the quality of the conversation is high. There is a lot of verbal tapping and thrust that comes with superbly designed fencing. I can give many examples. But why do I need Just watching movies Secondly, this movie understands the principles that are not accepted anymore. To make the drama successful not only But only need a hero But still a credible evil If you do not have it, there is no pleasure in rooting for good people and "Rob Roy" doesn't have one. But three of them are the Earl of Montrose, the follower of Kilcairn and Archie Not a bad one with one dimension as well But has a full and very disgusting flesh It takes more patience than "Braveheart" - more conversations and accents are quite difficult. But it is a very clever and more delicate piece (As I said, I love this movie!)
