I'm always a big fan of David Lynch and with this film, Lynch proves that he has the talent, style and artistic integrity of creating movies outside the supernatural glory he knew in the last decade. As far as this film has been rated G, it is Lynch's style with style, pacing and color tone. The movie walks in a rhythm that is hypnotic and expertly filled with scenes of emotion and genuine power. <br /> <br /> The movie is as brilliant as expected from the movie Lynch and the amazing editing sequence. In addition, it is very refreshing to see the movie that every character is friendly, a good-hearted villager and not a character that has not been mentioned, which clearly shows that it is "good" or "Evil" <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth, acting as well as other actors Sissy Spacek, the most outstanding in his beloved performances and Harry Dean Stanton in a small role <br /> <br /> The film David Lynch proved to be critical. That he was able to create a powerful movie like he did in the 80s with 'Blue Velvet' and 'The Elephant Man'. Critics seem to have lost faith in the past decade after he created a surreal movie like ' Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me 'and' Lost Highway ', but with this film, he shows how FWWM and LH are. The critics finally caught up with his latest film, 'Mulholland Drive', which was highly praised and nominated for the Lynch Academy Award. <br /> <br /> 'Story That is exactly the feeling 'is a story for me. I've seen it as a love story about family, friendship and kindness of strangers. I would recommend that.
