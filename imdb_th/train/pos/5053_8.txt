Okay, I will accept the casting in this movie. Really strange - part of this story is due to the plot. But I still have a little problem believing that Pierce Brosnan has shown this role (although he did really well). <br /> <br /> It depends on the true story of the British who live with Canadian Indians In the early 20th century, he claimed to be a mixed blood of India. In fact, he was successful and had a good idea that people came from all corners to listen to his lectures and were taken to explore wilderness forests - even though he was not a mixed blood Indian. The movie center about this and what happens when the scam is revealed. <br /> <br /> The performances and settings are great and I like this movie a lot. (When I stopped believing about Brosnan) it wasn't widely published - probably because it was a beautiful brain - not a Bond movie or a love affair - just a strange movie about an amazing guy.
