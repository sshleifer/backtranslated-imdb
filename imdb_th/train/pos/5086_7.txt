When I finally heard that Patrick Swayze finally returned to his acting career with KING SOLOMON mine, I was very excited. I expect to have an action adventure in Indiana Jones. What I received is 4 hours (with advertising). The epic is very slow. The second and third hours may be left simultaneously and the story will not suffer. The ending is good (there are no spoilers here) but I still want more. Every man can do it, which is the victim of Swayze doing "RoadHouse 2" so that he can return to the action style that makes him famous. Until more than if you were a fan of King Solomon's mines, rather than reading or watching the 1985 edition with Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone, which was not very good, but only an hour and forty minutes for life
