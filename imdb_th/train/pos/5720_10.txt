I saw "dissatisfaction" yesterday and wow ... I'm really scared of being good. I love horror movies and I really like this movie. There are many surprise scenes. (What is the English word) that makes you jump on the seat Although screaming from the audience too much makes it difficult to not laugh. I think the most scary scene is ... on the bus when the face flashes by the window or when Yoko walks without a chin Makeup is also very good as well. Sometimes you may see that it is really there, but it also adds a surprise to the scene. The child is really good. Very cute. Without having to makeup and be scary.
