Brian Dennehy, Bill Paxton, Joe Pantalino and the best of all, Jeff Fahey, all in one movie Wow is all I can say about that. These are four actors who evaluate the lowest value in the business and work together beautifully. It's like a poem, the way they play and flow, natural ability that looks like they are the best friends for eons, even in filming. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is good. Rather concentrated in the first viewing, and the four stars allow the ability to see again at a great level I can't explain how good it was to see Bill Paxton and Jeff Fahey together on the screen. The greatest moment when they watched a lover from afar and fill their own cries. <br /> Good movies, great actors, why go to see? Four words Fahey, Dennehy, Paxton, Pantalino
