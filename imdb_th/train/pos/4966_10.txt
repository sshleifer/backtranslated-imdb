Diego Armando Maradona is sixteen years old in 1978 when Argentina won the World Cup at home. He is the greatest star and the greatest player in a country that is passionate about football. Everyone asked Cesar Luis Menotti to play the genius of children. But the manager thinks he is not ready. <br /> <br /> Historical records that Argentina won the 1978 World Cup are quite credible - they don't really want Maradona. Likewise, it's not true in 1982, Spain is. Catalog of disasters for Argentina Menotti - still smoking - playing Diego at this time But that opportunity is too much for a temperamental child Maradona signed with Barcelona on June 4, 1982 for about 7 million dollars - nine days later, he played his first game at Camp Nou and Belgium beat Argentina for just one day. It was not the first debut, and although he scored two goals in Hungary in the next match, Maradona will remember his memory as his lowest point. Argentina's reign as world champion <br /> <br /> But now it's behind him. Maradona confused the crazy moments in Barca and traveled in 1984 to join Napoli. As if he were at home in the end The Neapolitan people in Mexico did everything to attract Maradona to the poor. The gift from the old woman and the money from the young man is uncomfortable with millions of Camorra as part of the transfer fee and the city is determined to make him feel at home. So at least Maradona was El Rey - he brought his Argentine side to Mexico as one of the favorites and the new manager - Carlos Bilardo instead of Menotti. <br /> <br /> Maradona is the hero of this football win. The only male world in 1982, hundreds of young men died in a pointless battle for the Falkland Islands. Right now, the British media want to compete. (With the same result) in Mexico City Maradona is still regarded as outstanding in England, recognizing the great performance in the United Kingdom during the 1980 tour rather than for Spain. But he is still an ARG: Enemy. <br /> <br /> England is really good and Lineker can score after only twelve minutes. The main event took place in 8 minutes. Fenwick, the big British guardian and limited, was booked - now he is afraid of doing things around the penalty area. <br /> <br /> After passing 45 The first half, the second half, starts with a bang. Maradona danced forward after 50 minutes but could not find a way to pass. In the same way, Valdano's efforts were only hit by a white shirt. Then the moment of shame that served as the inscription of San Diego The hodge fears the ball back into his own penalty area. Chilton hurries to claim - but Maradona, who is taller than the English goalkeeper for the net. How can he do it? Easy: Handball <br /> <br /> The most famous rules in football history pass slowly. Every visitor waited for Al-Sharif of Syria to blow to the foul (he couldn't). Chilton looked and looked at the director - he ran back to the center circle. Unless he assassinated the Pope or became the first man to step down on Mars when the great man died during this time, he would appear for the first time - in the long-term, lingering, slowly moving, followed by a cheerful expression. The next picture will be his next gift to the world - the best goal of the World Cup. <br /> <br /> Burruchaga rubs the ball for Maradona, who is lurking around the right half of he He expanded and accelerated from Beardsley and Reid. This is the real Diego - he exploded through Butcher and attacked Fenwick. Now Fenwick has a chance to stop the attack. He usually aimed his boots near Maradona's thighs - of course he would pick up a red card. But who cares? Then Fenwick had brain waves - he hesitated and decided to run at Maradona, waving his arms - maybe he tried to take him out? Diego shot in the frame while Fenwick fell. The butcher ran with the genius as if he was encouraging. Chilton bursts in fear and Maradona twists around him and prepares to score. Now, Butcher recalls his role and tried to destroy the Argentine people - instead of giving a special impetus to the shot that hit the target. England is going to go home. <br /> <br /> During this wonderful Mexican summer, the world met with Pele's successor. In fact, the greatest footballers have ever been - Pele has played superbly in 1958 and 1970, but there are great players around him. Maradona is not 1986 as his World Cup.
