This anime is something that should not be missed for Evangelion fans. It is the previous work of Anno Hideaki, but his incredible style is not limited to any. In addition, those who do not like Evangelion may find that the launch This time is slightly more satisfying. Gunbuster is quite strange in a sci-fi anime, which is based on real science. In fact, the show has a "little science lesson" interlacing, explaining the physics behind some events in the movie. One of the remarkable points in this film is the time associated with speed near the light. This series works excellently in dealing with the painful experience of leaving the world on a six-month mission that travels near the speed of light and returns to the world that has passed for ten years. The main characters are still 17 or 18 throughout the series, while almost all other characters are very old. Be warned, this item is heavy. Sometimes, SAP also has a breast image that has never been done as much as I have ever seen. I found it quite easy to ignore the stingy uniforms and the Bubu Hoo scene because the series was very good. But viewers who are tolerant of low milk intake may want to avoid this. In an interesting note, Gainax, for example, used to run out of money in the last few episodes. However, they can use black and white film and sketch action to get a good resolution. The ending is quite stupid. But it makes me feel good in my gut. I can't help but love it. Gunbuster is, in my opinion, one of the best pieces of cartoons around.
