Ruth Gordon is one of the sympathetic killers that Columbo had previously dealt with. And a plot that is creative all the way around This is one of the best episodes of Columbo Mariette Hartley and G. D. Spradlin. Excellent in their supporting roles, and Peter Falk delivers more little things in his scenes with Gordon.
