I saw movies in the Nashville Film Festival. It is beautifully done, from movie shooting to acting. It is the story of the father and son and how they admire each other during the family crisis. Written in a beautiful dialogue that has never been spoofed, this film shows Paul Reiser and Peter Falk's acting abilities, including this outstanding actor. The movie begins with the old-fashioned father. (Peter Fulk) is trying to find the cause of his wife. (Olympia Dukakis) left him. Father presented himself quietly in front of the door of his son and daughter-in-law. Father and son take the next day to see the property and end up on a classic road trip. They fish, play pool, watch baseball games, get drunk, participate in quarrels in the barroom and dance with strange women, but more importantly, they each face unspoken tensions that may result Impact on any family. It is a movie that can touch the heart and make that person appreciate the most close to them.
