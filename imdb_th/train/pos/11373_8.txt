This is a strange story: modern movies about serial killers without a fight scene, no one saw death, no cars running and no loud sounds ..... and happened in Russia. There are only two short action scenes, but they are scary. <br /> <br /> The remaining story is a detective job and a red tape that the poor detective must pass to solve the murder. This is a very gloomy and "somber" movie that best describes the hero's personality (Stephen Rea). Still, the story didn't make it depressing and an interesting story all the time. <br /> <br /> Rea is striking as a determined investigator. Jeffrey DeMunn is seriously scary as a killer. Donald Sutherland's Russian accent is suspicious. But he plays as the only character in this warm film. <br /> <br /> Once again, the story is dotted with liberal agendas here and there. Prejudice against gayity, integrity of the world psychology, police and government officials detained / coarse / large This is a movie that is unique, which may not be known. But is a favorite of people who have watched Since it depends on the killer's real life account, it is more chilling. Don't go through this because you don't do anything.
