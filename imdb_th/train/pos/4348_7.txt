Paul Reiser stepped out of the extreme comedy spotlight to write a warm and gentle story about the family - what we saw and what we didn't see what we expected and what surprised us. Things about my FOLKS do not set new standards for movies. But it is a small matter that reminds us of important bonds that families represent. <br /> <br /> Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) used to be a workaholic, sometimes pushing your wife Muri Mitochondrial (Olympia Dukakis) His daughter (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan) and his son Ben (Paul Riser) come behind. One day, Muriel leaves a message that after many years of marriage, she will leave! Her daughter, along with Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins), Ben's wife immediately began to search for her address, causing confusion and pain and discontent. Sam was able to distinguish things while traveling. With Ben's son Traveling on the road becomes a time for both people to learn who they are and what they each mean to their status as father and son and as family members. Sam relaxed for the first time in his life and introduced Ben to work now for happiness and fun in life. The journey ended with a call about Muriel's location and why she went out and organized a group of clever families that made the scene of the story warm. All is not something that looks like: to be better and better. <br /> <br /> Falk and Reiser play like a pro, but in many ways this movie is a short time when Olympia Dukakis is on the warning screen. We think she is one of our top positions in the movie. Looks good. Worth it. Grady Harp
