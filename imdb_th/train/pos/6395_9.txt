For me, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Racism, struggling throughout my life and proving myself that he is not just a "cookie". The best performance of his life, De Niro, which is a living legend, gives what the film hates his character in the movie. But he gave a very good performance to this film, a great performance and the beautiful appearance of Charlize was a great advantage for every movie. So if you don't watch this movie, I recommend for those who love courage, greatness, inspiration. You have to watch this great drama. My vote 9/10
