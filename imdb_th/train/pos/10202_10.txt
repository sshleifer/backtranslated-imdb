I personally like this movie, and I am alarmed by the ratings of some people. It's a movie created by a comic book and it's an animation now. If you don't like comic books or animations, of course you won't like this movie, so why are you watching? Although if you are a big fan of interesting characters, strong characters and brave (sexy) women who kick the butt and save the world (Hell), you will love this movie. I think this story really pulled me in and it was a great movie. Rather an anime cartoon or similar to some American movies based on adult animation trends like Titan AE meet as the Punisher action version. At the end, I would like to recommend this movie to the anime And super heroes or anyone with an open mind looking for fun movies
