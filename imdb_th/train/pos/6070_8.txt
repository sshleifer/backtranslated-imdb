Yes, Shakespeare will certainly be proud. Lawrence Fishburn is not the best, but not bad. Kenneth Brannagh, on the other hand, is great. His planning is great, like playing with the audience. It is a very good job. <br /> <br /> There are times when the drama is too little to be expected. For example, the murder of Cassio was too cloudy, causing the audience to twist their heads to understand it all. <br /> <br /> Am I talking about Michael Maloney? Even annoying. <br /> <br /> If you have never seen Otello before, see this. If you haven't read Othello for this, if you don't hear Othello, look at this. On the other hand, you do what you like by reading by seeing it acting on the stage and hearing it as well.
