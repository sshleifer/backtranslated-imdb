In addition to being a very fun movie, I would like to add that the costumes and scenery are great. Women who love this kind of fun have a lot of money. Unfortunately she had two coveted daughters who wanted her money. This lonely woman since her husband died He offered her in a theater that was being torn down. To prevent her from buying it Her daughter is afraid that she will leave "their" money and decide to proceed. The actor in the film is also a plus. I will give almost everything that will have a copy of this movie in my video library, but at the moment it's not a regret
