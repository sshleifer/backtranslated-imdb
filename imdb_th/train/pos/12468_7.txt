OK, this movie started out like a cheesy Lifetime movie and didn't get better than this movie. The script is full of 'cheese' and 'fluffy' and the actors are not well directed for most. In the first half of this movie, a little girl, I don't think this is one of her best performances. The only reason I bought this movie was because it was already sold and Ellen Burstyn was there. She's great. But this isn't her best performance. The story is based on real events and helps the movie. Actually, I don't like movies at first and feel bored when I see the stills of balloon travel. I mean ... get it where it should go with it! But everyone will be forgiven when reaching the destination and the story is near. If this does not make you tears It's wonderful and predictable. But also makes you feel good about the world again
