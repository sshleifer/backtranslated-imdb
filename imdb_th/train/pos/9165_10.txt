This is the best adaptation I have ever seen. It is my favorite thing and I think it is still close to the book. The thing that makes this thing to see really is the selection of two leading actors, Timothy Dalton. Is my best Rochester Saw on the screen, lamenting and sad, while Zelah Clarke was a perfect combination of strength, courage, self-consciousness and tenderness like Jane. The story (as I am sure most people know) is this. Jane Eyre Little and simple, is a teacher at a charity school for girls in the 1800s that advertised her services as a parent in the newspaper. She offered a post of Ruled at a large manor house, Thornfield Hall, to tutor Adele, the young guardian of Mr Rochester Hall, a mysterious and respected man. Last month, he fell in love with Jane and caused a few situations to try to see if Jane was crazy about him like he was with her. However, there is a secret that is still waiting to be discovered at Horne. Nornfield and when it was an effect, it was very damaging. This is a drama that moves and shows well with good places and beautiful costumes, as I said. That the performances are excellent, especially from previously Zelah.
