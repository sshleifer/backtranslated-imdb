Actually, I like this movie very much. Not because it's a comedy plot, not I like it because it is one of the worst movies ever created. It's very lame, so bad that it becomes very funny. Some funny stories are really cool. But the rest made me pray for unemployment for the screenwriter "Men in white" are so stupid and stupid that you can only do two things. Turn off the TV or roll with the floor laughing. (Beer can help a lot :) I choose the second option.
