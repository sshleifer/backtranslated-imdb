As a knowledgeable fan, I would like to recommend this film as honest to the facts and perform well. At the age of 11 in Istanbul, I heard a friend speak of a new musical feeling that made women scream I think Um, if women like them, they must be ridiculous. My only record until now is Haley Mills, The Everly Brothers & Ricky Nelson. Soon after, on a holiday with a family at a military cafeteria in Ismir, I heard the song. (Which I learned later was 'Love Me Do') and paved the floor with the difference between it and every song that I had heard until that time. When I heard my brother's 'Meet The Beatles' album stuck for life. After reading the first book of their start (by Davis), I was amazed that the film did very well, except for the majority of sex and some medications. (It touches the use of metharin / dextrin)>
