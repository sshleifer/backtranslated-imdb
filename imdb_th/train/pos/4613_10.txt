This movie has one of the most wonderful plans I've ever seen. For me, that's what makes it so great! Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis are very good at what they have achieved in the original Munsters series, while having less pain, they still work together wonderfully As Lily seems to be more involved She shows that she can perform comedy in the original series. But most are wasted in this movie The film also shows the great Sid Caesar, but sadly he has no interaction with Gwynne and Lewis. I think this better job would be possible.
