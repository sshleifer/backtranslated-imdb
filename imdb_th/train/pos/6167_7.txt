"Long journey" is a well-made movie, good filming and good performances for some performances. However, the story is a confusion of the sub-characters and strange characters that become the jack of all plans. In addition, Western audiences tend to find the mystery of the Parsee culture that is somewhat ambiguous to get their arms in 1.7 hours. Recommended for those who are interested in India.
