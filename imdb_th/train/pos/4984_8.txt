"Secret of the Lens" may be my favorite forever The best and most fun from Kajawari Yoshiaki, well known for anime, splashing anime and anime-anime anime-I hope he will do this more. /> My favorite scene is the psychedelic CG scene where Lord Helumis explodes his failed henchmen. And whenever my favorite character Worsle appears, <br /> <br /> Let's see. <br /> <br /> Warning: This is not for a complicated anime fan!
