This is a movie that I decided to watch because I was a big fan of adult animation. I often find that when movies do not evolve around famous actors or actors But it is a story or style. It helps this movie to be seen as an art work rather than showing the talent of different actors. <br /> <br /> This movie is more stylish than the story. While I found an interesting story (Thriller that borrowed stories and atmosphere from movies such as Blade Runner and many anime movies) It is difficult to follow at times. Probably, of course, there is a mixed feeling between French animation and Japanese anime together Whether it is good or not depends on the audience. This film is an eye treatment and in this sense is a work of art. <br /> <br /> If you like animation for adults or want to watch movies that are different from most movies right now, I would recommend. All I can say is that I am happy with the experience of this movie. But a little disappointed because it would be better
