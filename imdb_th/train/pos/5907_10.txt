This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. My parents came from the Indian countryside and some parts I saw the lives of the villagers. People are poor and have financial and social problems. <br /> <br /> The film reflects the same thing. Full credit for directors and actors They do very well. I just wondered how movies like Lagaan and Paheli can go to the Academy and not Doghi. I don't understand the criteria for choosing a movie. Is money that makes a difference or has a big name in a movie, making a difference. <br /> <br /> Hope to watch this movie again in the future
