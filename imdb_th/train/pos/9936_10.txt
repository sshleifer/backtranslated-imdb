This is one of my favorite series when I was a child. The Swedish broadcasting company decided to broadcast it last summer again when I just finished my first semester of medical school. I was surprised when I saw the depth of the organs described. Of course, some things are easy. But most are correct (Although it was created 22 years ago!) And quite understandable I would recommend that all medical students who are going to be doctors should watch it. It is a very good way to learn some basic medical terms. I am currently in the 7th semester and I think I will watch the series again as soon as I buy a DVD-box :-)
