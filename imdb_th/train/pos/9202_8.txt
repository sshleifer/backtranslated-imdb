Must admit that Dev has eyes for beauty and talent He stopped at Zeenat Aman, a successful model, and also won the beauty contest by casting her role. She looked solemnly thrown with stones and swayed at the hypnotic music, causing her to become loved by the audience immediately. This film preserves the sight of beautiful places, ethnic people, temples and those Mumtaz that are mischievously mischievous in their ethnic wear and dance skills. Dev is definitely cute and this is one Performing with his commercial success, Hare Rama constantly strives to acquire a script that is written, edited and a charming song. Like his other film Des Pardes, Anand manages the story of a child who is in an addiction habit and their theory comes from a disturbed family and a difficult childhood. A good actor, this movie is always fresh!
