I will go against the grain in this movie, so it seems Being a big fan who confesses to myself Around the railway station But movies that lack money do not distract from the story. Yes, the story is quite far and not very well explained, but THE CREEP is a show in the class and proceeds to overcome and separate the incoming parts. Message for women !!! There are some parts of the movie that you should close your eyes or at least cross your legs !! You will understand when you see it. <br /> <br /> All in all good movies and it makes changes to see really good slasher movies.
