I almost did not rent because of bad comments. But I keep doing it. I think it's like the darkness that I like. The only part I hate about the ferry is the two red-necked brothers at the gas station. They are funny and the conversation makes me laugh But this is not a joke It destroys a little movie for me because it is not necessary. The rest of this movie is how horror or suspicious movies should be The makeup is good and I've seen a worse way in this movie. It's a simple story that has a reliable acting, not a scary or scary movie. But I didn't get ticked or needed a refund after watching it In the DVD, there are other movie trailers that look good and I will try.
