For the first three seasons, Sabrina is a hidden gem in the TGIF (and after that it will be replayed during the first afternoon of the school). Each episode has a passion for energy, jokes and fast pace that beat the awkward funny game Occasionally Melissa Joann Hart expresses her comedic abilities, especially in her facial expression. Her two aunts play "straight men" or as the two witches may have at the time of general comics and chemistry with Hart Salem as a talking cat. They are free to dabble in crazy things. He's interested and he can laugh. And get it quickly because he is a talking cat Sabrina's friends get a social experience at the school which is home to "Evil cheerleaders" and "main dictators" Perhaps the most interesting and unique thing of acting is the ability to combine pop culture. (Such as the band of the era, Jerry Springer), the physical condition / morals typical of humans (Such as the importance of friendship, the spirit of Christmas) and the representation of relevant metaphors, such as in Magical Realm. Unfortunately, as with many other programs throughout the life of the TV program, the show reached its peak in the third period. The first year which is close to Sabrina entering high school Starting in the fourth season, moving to university to become a deterioration in the quality of the show, especially when the writer chose to introduce Josh as Harvey Josh's competitor and cook the excuse. Something for Aunt Hilda and Zelda As the main player The last season that Sabrina worked in a pop culture magazine was very disappointing. Still, in the end, Sabrina (especially in high school) is still a unique item in a hybrid film that has a magical element that elevates the boring fare produced in this category every year.
