Excellent show Instead of watching the old type of comics, showing that it is the same old story, just "different" stars, this refreshing performance makes the office look incredibly fun. We are away from watching TV for 2 years and after returning from all the available programs, we hope to see this program in W. Shame on Global to pull the plug out. I think this will be the winner. Come true about a few things in Canada showing Everyone I talk to will like this show and I believe it is a stupid thing that Global walked out. I guess they want to show it out with a general idea of ​​stupidity from the United States instead of pulling the show at Made in Canada with many contracts Don't understand me wrong, I enjoy many shows on TV. But come to the people, let's treat variety This unique performance gives a humorous view of the real life in the office and a slightly exaggerated relationship with a character that you have never seen in sitcoms today or in the past. Unfortunately, people around the world must not tell this story to a fool.
