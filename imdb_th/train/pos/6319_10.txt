Had the opportunity to watch the filming in the Slavic Village-Broadway area I can't wait to see the final filming. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie at Cleveland Premier on Friday and out loud in a comedy for a long time! It hurts a lot Russo brothers work well. All actors perform their best comedy ... No slow or dry segments ... George Clooney is one of my favorite actors. I was most impressed by William H. Macy as a rogue "Riley" and Michael Jeter as "Toto". They put you in "stitches". I believe they have the most fun role in all movies.
