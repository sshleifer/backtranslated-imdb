This movie deserves better. It's fun. There are great jokes and jokes. There is something for "Geeks" among us (and we know who we are) and the effects will definitely be effective. Seeing Paul Reubens fart in front of the Academy Award winners is worth the price of attendance only. I have never read the cartoon series before watching movies, but since it is as good as they are still introducing MM movies (even though Flaming Carrot is a character, it is cool too) Greg Kinnear is ... amazing As an amazing captain and no one else will be The Shoveller, except William H. Macy, favorite in the movie. "We have a blind date with Destiny and it looks like she ordered a lobster." Watch this movie. Buy this movie! It's just 5 bucks and some changes to Wal-Mart in your area. You will thank me. In fact, you and Ms. Garafolo are in there. That Alone makes it worth looking at.
