I rented this movie when it came out on the videotape and really enjoyed it. I had the opportunity to buy it on a DVD a few weeks ago and watch it many times since I have to agree with others when they say that the Indian summer is a movie that misses. When I watched it, I hope I can get 10-14 again. I think that's why we all like to watch movies. Sometimes we wish to live again as a child with knowledge / knowledge of adults. Will it be good if all your friends / parents are children again? Don't worry about your job as a parent, etc ... ??? I know I want to jump into De Lorean and go back in time. While I enjoy a lot of movies, every time I like a movie, the camp is a ball with Bill Murray.
