I absolutely love this movie I'm not even sure especially about this. But I think it's great and should be for DVDs. Women are strangers and get together well enough to spend time in villas in Italy. The actors in my opinion worked great. The characters are very different and the clever story also makes them work. With humor, drama and relationship problems at a good time This thing needs 10 lines, but I can't think anymore to say so I will continue talking until I get 10 lines. Sorry about this. What else can I say that it has been a long time since I last saw it? I am looking forward to watching again But it is not available
