I swear when I saw this movie for the first time. I cried out! STAR IS BORN is a movie that lets you know how love is, though John Norman (Chris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand) must face. You also experience what is like. Lost that love at the end of the movie Streisand and Kristofferson Has excellent chemical properties as well and the music is great! When Streisand sings by looking at you again / looking closely at the moment, it's just pure magic! This film makes Evergreen music one of my favorites and Queen Bee is a fun song. In addition, I love the fashion of the 70s (except Streisand Africa. In addition, she is a beautiful person) A Star is Born is my number one popular movie. This movie is happy to see and destroy the heart at the end.
