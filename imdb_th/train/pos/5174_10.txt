I swear I will watch this movie every weekend and never get bored! Every aspect of human emotion is captured astonishingly by showing the script, direction and general feeling of the film. For a long time, I saw movies that made me breathless, laughing, reflecting from sadness and feeling the intentions that came through this wonderful work We need more movies !!! Mike Binder: Are you listening?
