This film is a proof that film noir is a style that is enduring and has great value for living. For me, it is the best example of a noire film since Chinatown <br /> <br /> It will be luck. It has never been properly promoted when first launched and must create a group of fans through locations such as Vanguard Cinema and referrals from word of mouth rent. <br /> <br /> I suggest people to look at. Find something that is not interested Entertainment, rent this movie and drill down in a highly complex plot.
