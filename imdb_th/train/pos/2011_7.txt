If you have never watched this movie and like old professional actors, this is the movie for you. Seeing Frank Sinatra, when he was very young and very thin that sank in the cheeks and the great sound that was sung in the old songs. And many music. Leon Errol (Cyrus Drake) provides excellent support, along with Victor Borge (Sir Victor Fitzroy Victor), a classical piano performer and without a slapstick comedy like he did. This is not a great musical, but Frank Sinatra is very pleased to see the beginning of his career in 1940.
