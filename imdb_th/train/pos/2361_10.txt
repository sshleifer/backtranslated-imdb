I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses and I work in a hospital with immediate care. Over the years, I have seen people die from hemolytic reactions in blood transfusions, attending many meetings about blood-borne diseases and seeing many patients seriously ill from pathogens caused Blood transfusion I have heard many Jehovah's Witnesses who say that they will die if they refuse blood and after 26 years in the field I have never seen it really happen. Blood transfusion or community Got a lot of benefits from this fight? "The issues for Jehovah's Witnesses are moral issues. "You must abstain from blood" is not a vague statement. Thank you for this movie and give a comment to it.
