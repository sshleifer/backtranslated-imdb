I love it now. It's great that all 5 of them have collaborated and stopped LutherCorp and saved the world. I still love it now because Kyle Gallner (Bart Allen / Impulse) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen / Green Arrow) are guests. Invited in this movie !!! I just hope Clark will join the Justice League and we will follow the hero groups around the world !! =) It's very exciting and makes the audience interested because what will happen next. I think Chloe should also join the Watchtower team, which will be the cool thing for you to do besides the Daily Planet because you don't have the magical power. In addition, I want to find out what types of volunteers to use for 33.1. I wonder what other people in this world have the power !!!
