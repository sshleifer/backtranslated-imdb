The name of the film is taken from the party game called "Seven Minutes in Heaven". The game was popular among my husband's friends when he was in high school in Brooklyn, New York, and he explained it. are "Spin-the-Bottle," "Lifesaver Relay" and other kissing games. As a rule, the names of boys and girls are pulled out and the selected person enters into the dark wardrobe together and is there. For seven minutes In the meantime, there will be speculation from the guests attending that both have nerves to hold hands, embrace and / or kiss each other in the privacy of the wardrobe. At the end of seven minutes, the game leader will say "time out" or knock on the closet door and both will emerge from the closet. After other guests asked the couple, they must accept what they did during "Seven minutes in heaven", then choose another couple to come in the closet until all the guests will join. The pair that accepts to do the most will be the winner of the game. <br /> <br /> The game has served as Social "ice-breakers" for children and teenagers. This film has earned this nickname because it involves the first experience of a teenager with wrinkles and romantic love.
