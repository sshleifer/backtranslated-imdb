I just saw this movie @ TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival). Hal Hartley fans won't be disappointed !! And if you are not familiar with the work of this director ... not important, this movie can definitely stand on its own I have to go to the second show ... It's great that I have to see it again - very fast !! <br /> <br /> This movie is very funny. It was a very clever dialogue and Parker Posey's performance was outstanding as she played the role of Fay Grim Fay Grim, the latest feature to visit the world and characters in the Henry Fool movie. (2000) The most striking characteristic of the stylistic approach is to use a tilted (or Dutch) perspective, which is often seen in the past. Hartley's work appears in the shorts that are possible in the movie: Short work by Hal Hartley 1994-2004 and in The Girl From Monday (2005) <br /> <br /> I watched this movie the most on September 11. The adventures of Faye Grim in this story go back to the world that changed after September 11. In 2001, when I didn't go to the big spoiler, I saw this work and the story of the world as a political image. If in the foreground in the mainstream cinema, the character posted -119 heretofore (cf. Syrianna: Side note - Mark Cuban Exec. Prod in these two movies ... the most interesting to say the least) <br /> < br /> Finally, for those who attach themselves to the characters of Henry Fool, Simone, Fay and Henry, this film is self-conscious and self-referring. Which was said that the character of Fay Grimm started in the movie where she was when Henry Fool ended, but at the end of the movie ... Fay's knowledge and experience changed and expanded throughout the course of storytelling. What's in the store for Faye's future and stupid family ... ?? I can't wait for the third part in this story!
