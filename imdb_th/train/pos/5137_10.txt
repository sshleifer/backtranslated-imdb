Interesting, fast and amusing. <br /> <br /> I'm not the one who watched many television programs. I stumbled on this list while the house was ill with flu one day and was immediately hooked. I developed a lot of interest with John Burke. Both he and Claire did a great job in managing the performances together. You can tell that they love their work. <br /> <br /> High-level collectors are great. I found myself interested in things I never thought of before. <br /> <br /> What I want to know is: No matter what happens to Jack the Dog? Does one of the hosts accept him?
