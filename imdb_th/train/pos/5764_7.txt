I've watched this movie on Amazon about 6 or 7 years ago and destroyed it. I believe I call it "miserable" and "turkey". Okay, according to most standards, it's still a turkey. It has almost no value in producing anything that is a small plot that has no meaning and performance is at the level of the third level of play. That said, this has grown with me over the years as a classic camp. In fact, every film of Todd Sheets director has this effect. They are almost the same as Ed Wood in that story: watch them over and over again and choose a line with errors, continuous errors (Same zombie, second place! Say this: Sheets are very good, and at the moment, one of his first works is not great. But he did better And I have to add that the only really good actor / actress in this movie is Kasey Rousch, although I may be biased because I attended school with you
