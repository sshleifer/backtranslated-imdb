Walt Disney's "The Rookie" movie is based on the story of Jim Morris, a former picher minor who made the most amazing comeback in sports history, ending his retirement for almost 10 years and launching his major league in 1999, at the age of 35. <br /> <br /> The film was released with a brief summary of Morris' childhood, including many places - his father was a soldier. And even when his family judged to be good at Texas football, Morris' baseball passion remained strong. <br /> <br /> The young age group jumped for about 23 years for Ma. Adult (Played by Dennis Quaid) is now a baseball coach and a chemistry instructor at Big Lake High School (in real life it is Reagan County High School in Big Lake, Texas). Is a baseball player But it doesn't work. <br /> <br /> Morris's team is struggling and he teaches them about giving up on their dreams. They opened the table with him telling him that he should try the Major League team. Many times when he pitched them in practice, they were surprised at the speed at which he threw Morris. But agreed to agree with his players, which if they win in the field, he will try the Major League team. <br /> <br /> Big Lake wins the zone and follows his agreement. Morris joined the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Let's play a miracle. He threw 98 miles per hour - faster than he threw during a professional league play and outstanding speed, even for a major league pitcher. After trying to play with the team again, Morris will receive a contract with Devil Rays. <br /> <br /> This makes him difficult to decide - living in his comfortable life or following the Major League dream again. Minor League members make money and spend once a month leaving the house. And that decision was more frightening than in the first filter, because now he has a wife and three children. <br /> <br /> Morris signed with radiation rays starting at AA level and moving up quickly. AAA level lower than one major league baseball But when this season ends, the opportunity for him to receive "demand" grows. <br /> <br /> Most of the time I like this movie. There are many great performances and characters that are pleasing, and it's easy for you to find yourself pulling to Morris. In addition, the film has done a great job for professional baseball teams at both the major and minor levels. And most importantly, it teaches a timeless message that will hold on to your dreams, even if they look far and almost impossible. <br /> <br /> Still have flaws. some While the general accuracy is overreacting and even inventing something, check out http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020410.html. To preview In addition, for one scene in which he prayed with the players, this movie was not interested in Christian Morris's faith. But considering the enthusiasm in the left wing of Disney, it is not surprising. <br /> <br /> Assuming there is a lot of exaggeration / invention to make the story look even more dramatic, but the 20-minute documentary of Mo Harris, included in the DVD, has some information that makes his story amazing. <br /> <br /> For example, from birth until his family settled in Texas when he was 12 years old, Morris was 14 more times and his minor league career started. He ended up after four surgeries, where he lost half the muscle on the left shoulder (pitching), causing his 98 mph pitch to be more mysterious. <br /> <br /> To appreciate and understand the story Of Jim Morris It's good not only to watch "The Rookie", but to watch the DVD documentary. Check out the link to the wrong link of the movie and may read Morris's biography, including "The Rookie". read a book But I hope to have one day. <br /> <br /> But overall "The Rookie" is a very good image of miracles and is a testament to the power of powerful dreams. And the victory of the common people 8/10
