I will keep this short. I believe this is an extraordinary movie. I saw other critics who commented on the effects that they wrote were not good, shot badly, had a terrible soundtrack, and worse, it wasn't true in describing life. OK, so it may be unbelievable for all lengths. But this film has a message of hope that some others seem to miss. Hopefully it will not be too late to save the lives of many bad things that happen in life. The violence of Gangland is true, right? No, right! This film has important social messages that ridicule people may not like. But what should be praised is not an insult I watched this movie with entertainment at least eight times each time with equal enjoyment, and each time with the feeling that the world might be better and less economical. 9 out of 10 from me for this one It's almost perfect in my view.
