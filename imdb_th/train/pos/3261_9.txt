Nay Sayers in this film tend to be bitter from unrequited love. This is a great movie for anyone who can understand Johnny Mathis or any of those songs: Bobby Darin, Beyond the Sea ... or Stan Getz's, The Girl From Ipanema, and ... <br /> <br /> How many times do I measure movies? I have to watch them before I am satisfied ... The chance that I will come back for a few good times. <br /> <br /> I can still see. Collaboration between actors .. I think they work together well. <br /> <br /> Open your heart and fight At least give you a magic comedy <br /> <br /> 'alan.
