Almost every film review that I've seen is quite bad. It's not bad. Actually, it's quite good but not good. The character Judy Garland is annoying. But she didn't allow I became a big fan that lamented too much emotion. Van Heflin, at least in the early 40s, Judy's singing was excellent But this movie missed a great opportunity without showing up their relationship. I gave 7 items.
