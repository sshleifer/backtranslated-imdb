It's been a long time since I watched this LOTR. I'm currently searching for a copy to buy Bakshi's work. It's quite true to traditional work The pictures are scary and sometimes haunt. <br /> <br /> Defects Sometimes movies are confusing or confusing. There are one or two times the story slows down to gather information, but overall - buy this movie. It's great for children, adults and collectors.
