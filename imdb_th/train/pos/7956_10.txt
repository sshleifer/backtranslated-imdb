This is just a classic film in which human voices from animals are what they think. I don't know if my video copy has a missing scene or not. But never showed whether the dog stepped down from the hole or not It also shows the animal's survival instincts and the ability to track humans in the same position that the helicopter will come out. For the first time, the original movie was updated by remake because the removal of the sound for the first movie was removed. There is only the use of animals that can work in this type of film because the use of people must make this a murder by proving that animals are more interesting than the average person.
