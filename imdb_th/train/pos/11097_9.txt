Spoiler! <br /> <br /> From the moment I saw the film critics in the area left this movie in the review in the news 10:00 I want to see it. I can't remember who or what local Omaha announcer is criticizing. But critics argue that the film is too lazy for Nebraska, where the church is doing. They show examples from the scene where John Glover is about to kidnap Ann-Margret when she swims in the pool. Glover's character praised her how well her body was and used many words that the local station felt necessary to fix. I was hooked even though there was one problem. I was only 13 years old and I had to wait one year until it came out on the cable. Suppose it is worth the wait. <br /> <br /> If there is my fault in this movie If wanting to call this movie as lazy, it is very little to say. This film focuses on successful businessmen who were blackmailed by spending a few times in doing business with the powerful Lady Roy Scheider. As always, he played the poor who wanted to escape and now Found himself at the mercy of three excellent villains John Glover's character is one of the most memorable memories of all time. He is lazy, funny all the time, and always doing something crazy. Then there is Leo Trebor's character (good name by the way!). Leo is clear in his head with this blackmail pattern. He is a coward, sweating, coward who takes care of the show with nude models. Then you have Clarence Williams 3rd as Bobby is embarrassed by the thoughtful anti-socialists who are all scared for good reason. Who will forget to call him to Vanity and the giant teddy bear? <br /> <br /> After dealing with the first shock of being aware of what he did with Scheider, turn the tables on these creeps and control. That situation is until Glover will follow his wife! The conflict was brutally caused by both the character being raped or bombed. <br /> <br /> I don't know why I like this movie so much. It should creep me away. But it wasn't It may be because these characters are interesting and the story has many opportunities that most movies today will not try. It's scary to think that the adult film industry may have more than a few characters, such as Glover running away in LA to find problems. Just thinking about his voice is enough to make me laugh. "Hey, sports. Have a great day!" <br /> <br /> This movie has hotshots. Cool cars, excellent conversations The abundance of hijackers from porn stars in real life Look for Ron Jeremy frolicking around in a hot tub with two chicks in a party scene at Glover's place. <br /> <br /> Another thing I have to add: How hot are women in the movie? This ??? Wow! Travolta was right by marrying Kelly Preston Yum! In addition, we saw that Vanity was naked at the time before she became a Christian again and Ann-Margret would say anything about her unless she was a quintessential American beauty. <br /> <br / > 9 out of 10 stars <br /> <br /> Say Hound, <br /> <br /> Added on 14 February 2008: RIP Roy Scheider!
