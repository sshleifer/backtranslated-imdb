Quite a little warm and not just for children. John Thaw is great as always (There is no hint of Inspector Morse about him.) The boy playing with William works well as well. But I didn't find him believing in every scene I love all the feelings of a small village and a slow life at that time. I felt the various scenes in London with historical accuracy as far as I could tell. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of the Scandinavian movies that I saw a few years ago called Mother of Mine. This film is the story of a boy who was evacuated from Finland to Sweden during World War II. The wife of the family took him to find a woman because (As shown) She lost her daughter. Get the boy instead. She doesn't care about him completely. The fact that children speak Finnish language is more complicated. I would like to recommend this movie to everyone who is happy with good night. Mr. Tom has the same feeling.
