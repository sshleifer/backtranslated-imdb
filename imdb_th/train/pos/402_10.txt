Previously I saw Zu: Warriors from Magic Mountain. In this movie, this scene takes place in the mountains of China. The Legend of Zu looks like another dimension !! Thanks to Tsui Hark's extensive use of CGI, he is able to convey his vision of a mountain that floats above the clouds, a land where creatures fly freely and have power since the blade. Cut the blade apart. Many of the characters in this game focus on King Sky and Enigma. The main aspect of love is there, although this movie is darker than the previous generation. Cecilia is beautiful and the appearance on the screen makes this movie so glamorous. At first I liked that she was similar to the Countess (from Zu Warriors) and she played Enigma well as she faced her past life. Oh yes, I mentioned that Cecilia is very visually appealing. <br /> <br /> Actually Zu Warriors have more funny elements and special effects are limited due to the time in 1983 Tsui Hark Raise to a new level and create new standards in cinemas.
