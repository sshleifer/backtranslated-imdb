The best Cheech & Chong movie until now !! From all of Cheech and Chong, this is the best. I think I see them all at least twelve times and I love them all. But this is definitely the best thing.

After 25 years, I hope that one day they can create another one because they are still good comedians. I heard that they are writing a new script, so who knows ... I guess these people are the only ones who have succeeded in making good movies in this genre. or not ...
