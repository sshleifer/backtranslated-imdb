Honestly, I found that this movie was almost depressing to my own goodness. It fell so much until the end. There is no way I can prove justice through the characters that do things that I don't like. (Well, except for the nasty characters played by Fred Forrest) but still disappointing when seeing people behaving like this, placing a wall around themselves when saying a word can break the ice and promote Cure <br /> <br /> The terrible tragedy that the Montana family They believe that they have lost one son. But it turned out that they were defeated. 2. The key is that if they communicate and confront the grief together, they will not have to lose a second son permanently. <br /> <br >> But they can't. Something is blocking this family from sharing sadness. Some families retreat in silence and resentment, while others point the finger of guilt. (Then go ahead and cheat on their poor pregnant wife by tricking the beautiful girlfriend of the deceased ... Andy's character is a real snake!) A family that doesn't threaten Arnold in Either way is the grandfather (Wilford Brimley) Grandfather seems to be able to talk to boys without judgment or even a child glove. It seems that he knows what the child is thinking, even though Arnold is not saying much today. It is truly a blessing for a poor child who has someone he can turn to. No one seems to understand the fact that Arnold may be shocked, denied, or the way of his sadness may not be the same style or with the speed as they expected. It's easy to judge and get angry and feel that someone is "made with stone" just because they don't regret the way we believe they should <br /> <br /> The story is quiet and natural. You will not receive a storytelling with a spoon or feel good about Hollywood. I am very concerned about the fact that this child is feeling very guilty until he feels the need to wave. The car went hundreds of miles to apologize to Andy Piglet's wife because of something he should not blame himself. Arnold may have accidentally killed his brother. But no one is responsible for the end of this marriage, which is clearly a punch, except for two people in marriage It was just foolishness. Arnold didn't get into the car with a pedophile or a murderer. <br /> <br /> Robert Duvall and Glenn Cole had a frustrating performance because of their parents. Who cannot communicate with the son To find out what Arnold is doing, Jason Presson, whom I have never seen anywhere, other than the favorite story of childhood called EXPLORERS and the creepy ghost story called THE LADY IN WHITE has done an amazing job. Like Arnold, a great performance from a child actor <br /> <br /> In addition to being quite slow at times, THE STONE BOY is a great and depressing movie.
