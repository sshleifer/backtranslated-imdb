Now you know this. But the additional episodes that had not aired 5 episodes can be viewed on ABC.com. I've been watching television for many years and this may be my favorite. It was a crime that this beautifully written and executed performance was canceled. The actors playing Laura, Whit, Carlos, Mom, Damian, Anya and omg, Steven Caseman - all have incredible and natural roles in those roles. Sadly, it's gone. Of course, I wonder about why it was canceled. There is no way I can let myself believe that Moyia's pregnancy is related to this. It's in the perfect time in this market. I watched the whole episode again on ABC.com - I hope they all come out on DVD one day. Thanks for reading.
