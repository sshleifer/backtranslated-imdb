Oh, dear, we don't like when love in our super heroes develop our brains or not. <br /> <br /> There is something happening to people. Easy, good and love stories / jokes? Kirsten Dunst is a revelation - funny, sexy and true. I laughed out loud at least five times and I was not ashamed to say that there were a few tears as well. The actors and scripts are great. I watch many movies across the board and I have never seen this successful movie as it should be. Those who do not agree, please tell me what I can find! I'm sure this book is good as well. But I think you have to judge by your own goodness
