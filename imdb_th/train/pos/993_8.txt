Actually, this movie is not bad. It has funny action and excitement. There are good actors in this movie, such as Doug Hutchison (Percy from "The Green Mile"), Bristol player. Another famous actor is Jamie Kennedy from "Scream" and "Three Kings". The main character, played by Jamie Fox as Alvin, is quite good and funny. But the person who surprised me the most was David Morse as Edgar Klein. He plays a character that is different from what he had done in other movies such as "The Green Mile", "Indian Runner", "The Negotiator" or "The Langoliers". Conversely, people who don't have any emotions are good things to see. The only really negative thing about this movie is the many images of the World Trade Center, which makes this movie look a bit old. Overall, I think this is a good little movie!
