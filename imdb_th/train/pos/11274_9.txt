One of the best Tarzan movies is one of the most tight action movies (and graphics). <br /> <br /> Pick up a year or more after Tarzan, Ape Man, Niel Hamilton's Holt. Have asked a wealthy friend Safari goes back to the elephant cemetery to collect ivory. His friends came to hold the dress and perfume that Holt hoped to use to win Jane back from Tarzan. Before they left Holt, he found that his map had been stolen and it became a frenzy in trying to match the match. When they finally steal, they find that both the party dies and surrounds themselves. They have no choice but to fight with the exit and they soon find that they are leaving the pan and into the fire. Finally, Tarzan and Jane appear and everyone is more adventurous. <br /> <br /> The infamous movie has been heavily investigated to reduce graphics violence. (Its graphics according to the current standard, it may be PG 13) and to remove the hint of all nude pictures (There are many long nude swimming scenes related to Jane that is full of foreheads in nude pictures. It has recently been restored.) The clear view of the restored version makes this film less. 20 minutes when TV show time Because it is in a newly restored version, it is a romantic movie that is full of romance, action and everything that should be in the movie. It is an almost amazing movie. The best of all types of movies that can play well as a standalone adventure. We don't need to see the first movie to enjoy it. But it is a movie that deepens the character and theme in the original movie. It's an amazing story. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. <br /> <br / > If there is a defect in this movie The rear screen is often very noticeable. There are a lot of gorilla sets for monkeys and some other effects seem more strange to believe. However, at almost every level, this film is very distinctive. <br /> <br /> You owe yourself to seeing this. Make a large popcorn by yourself and curl up on the couch and let yourself drift in an easier time. This is one of the great adventures.
