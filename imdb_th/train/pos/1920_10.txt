Paul Hennessy and his wife, Kate, have to deal with two teenage daughters and a strange son ... but after a short time of John Ritter, the show begins to deal with. With the loss of loved ones ... <br /> <br >> I found this item through the channel one afternoon and I must say that I laughed myself until my ribs were just painfully over the character. The sharp lines and situations in which Paul finds himself involved with most of the daughters ... Then I watched the remaining programs when I was free and I had to say that the writing was very good. But then I read about The Death of John Ritter ... After a while, I watched 'Goodbye' Episode 2 and I must say that almost tears, tears, the emotions of the characters, lost loved ones ... Robert How to penetrate the wall in anger and frustration .. How does Cate relate to sleeping on her bed? ... Briget and Kerry talk about what they should do. <br /> <br /> But The show proceeded by bringing Jim Egan and CJ Barnes, the best laugher. While Cate's father tried to protect his family and gave 'Talking about men' and Rory ... but the real jewel is CJ ... who is hilarious like a cousin. <br /> <br> It will always be John Ritter's masterpiece.
