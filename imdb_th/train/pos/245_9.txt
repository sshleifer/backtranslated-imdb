The only reason I want to see this is because of Orlando Bloom. In simple terms, this movie has an exciting average. It's not bad, but actually it's not that good. Editing is good The movie is very good. That direction is capable and confident. The story is stubborn. This film acts on average by Ledger, Bloom and Watts and Rush as usual. The accent is not compatible if you are from the United States, so just sit down and enjoy the scenery. At the end of the movie, I'm not bored or not moving. Some people ask what happened to Ned Kelly at the end of the movie. I must say that I do not care at that point. <br /> <br /> Actually, the only reason I can recommend this thing is Orlando Bloom. The type of sorting shows some of the suggestions of the range (though often-current images Look "I'm beautiful and confused." Very notable.) So the fans may find it worth the price. Besides not seeing at all It's not good enough or not good enough to have fun.
