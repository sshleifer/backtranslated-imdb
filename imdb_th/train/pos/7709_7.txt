I know I should like this movie and I do it for the most part. But as others say it is quite long in the teeth I also found that the maniac hormones of all the male crews were a bit annoying. It is surprising that they did not start panting and wailing at the moon as well. I must say that overall the movie makes me cold. It is a very sterile atmosphere that permeates movies. Plus a great effect (In addition to monster cartoons) as well as effects, costumes, accessories and of course Robbie If the robot is not in this movie, I don't think it will be as popular as ever. In the second half of the movie, picking up steam when we began exploring the "Krell" forgotten device. Many times I saw this movie. Krell still let me scratch my head, who or what Depending on what was created at that time, apart from "The world of this island" The world that is forbidden is miles above the average Sci-Fi movie at that time. Color shooting also enhances enjoyment. Of course, the classics in their own rights, defects and all and so deserving.
