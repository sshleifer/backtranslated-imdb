It started to slow down after the great introductions of animation because the director had a lot of characters and settings in the school. However, once the bet has taken place, the movie will accelerate as it competes with time to see if a certain number of worms can be eaten by 7pm. We have a great opportunity on the way home to talk to some of our sons. We: The gangster helps others to pay more attention when you don't want to do anything. <br /> <br /> The special note is the woman who plays Erica (Erk): Hallie Kate Eisenberg, the director kinda sneaking her without Expected and when she was on the screen she was cute She is one of the groups. "Hey, she looks familiar." Then I remembered that she was a little girl that Pepsi introduced about 8 years ago. She is still in "Paulie", a movie about a parrot trying to find a way back home. <br /> <br /> Miss Eisenberg produced many TV shows and movies in '99 -00, but didn't see much in the next few years. Now she is 14 years old and growing up to be a beautiful woman. Her smile warms up on the screen. If she can play a better role, she should have a better (or better) career than Haley Joel Osment, another three child actors. But hopefully there will be no problems that Osment has received recently. <br /> Anywhozitz, according to my 8 yo son who just finished reading the story, seems that the film will not follow the entire book. But not much fun The ending of this movie appears to be a huge sequel for some sequels (How To Eat Boiled Slugs? Escargot Kid's Style?) Which may not be a bad thing. It is good to take the family to watch movies and not worry about language, violence or sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Another good aspect of this film is the respect / fear that teachers have. Big, Mr. Burdog (prototype). Today's movies tend to show adult numbers as males While he had one stupid scene, he ruled the school with a steady hand. It was good to see Andrea Martin getting some work.
