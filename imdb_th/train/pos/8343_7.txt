Australian Fred Schepisi (crying in the dark) directs a comedy / romance that is fun, relaxing and set in spring. You will laugh while watching this movie. Tim Robbins (Shawshank Redemption, Dead Man Walking) is a car mechanic, Ed Walters, who has a high IQ which is higher when receiving help from Albert. Einstein Walter Mat Weaving You can tell them with preppie Meg Ryan shoes (Sleepless in Seattle. You have Mail). Catherine Boyd, Einstein's granddaughter, talented. But not very confident mathematician Maybe because she is surrounded by all geniuses She thinks that if she marries someone with a high I.Q, her children will have high I.Q as well, but she doesn't know what she wants. Between Tim Robbins' cute smile and the cuteness of Meg, this is a refreshing movie. I love sweet stories. People of all ages should enjoy this movie. Catherine is engaged to James Morland, who jerks, which works in animal behavior. But it is very boring This is the first obvious love situation between a mechanic and a mathematician. Witty lines and soft lines! The movie was very good. Princeton, New Jersey is beautiful in the spring. With the help of these wonderful men, Catherine fell in love with Ed without knowing that he was a car mechanic. <br /> <br /> Favorite scene: Ed tested many options in front of the crowd with help from Einstein. Kurt and Boris Ed and Einstein ride a motorcycle Nathan Kurt and Boris release all free animals. <br /> <br /> Favorite Quotes: Albert Einstein: "Don't let your brain interfere with your heart," Ed Walters: "Last When did he say "Wahoo"? Catherine Boyd: "Well, I'm sure I don't know." This is a refreshing movie. I have a tape and every time I will watch again
