This may be one of the most influential people I have ever come in. John Singleton stepped together when combining this educational masterpiece. Great performances by all the actors, but Epps and Rapaport turned to work the best and most reliable in the career of a young actor. While they are facing problems on many universities, they do not receive a great presentation or launch, because this movie will make anyone believe. In some cases, it seems ridiculous to think that this may happen. However, apart from the fact that it was a little drama, this movie was great and shocked me. One of the things from this picture that I will remember forever is the words from the character of Lawrence Fishburn. "Knowledge is power without knowledge. You will not see your power."
