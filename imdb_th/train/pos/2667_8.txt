I've never been a big fan of horror. They often try to use cheap techniques to scare the audience, such as loud sounds and creepy children. They often lack initiative and there are too many. The only horror movie I like is Stir of Echoes and Kevin Bacon. It serves well and has a great story. But it has joined and probably surpassed by The Shining of Stanley Kubrick, which may be the most horrible movie ever. <br /> <br /> This film follows the writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family. Agreed with the hotel Closed in winter There are rumors about the place that is haunted and the last inhabitants are frantic and killing his family. But Jack believes that it will work and he can use silence to overcome his writer's block. After several months of solitude and silence, Jack became disgruntled and violent later. It's a fever in the cabin or something in the hotel that makes him crazy. <br /> <br /> One of the most scary parts of the movie is the feeling of separation that Kubrick makes. The hotel is very quiet and the rooms are big but always empty. Also, it is horribly calm when Jack's son rides his bike through a barren walkway. Jack Nicholson's performance was one of his best, scared by me and made me sure to go out once. My favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from the fridge. Walk-in <br /> <br /> Shining is the ultimate horror movie. In my opinion, the witch project can be an oldie but a goodie. Of course 8/10
