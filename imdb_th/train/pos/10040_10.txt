For me personally, this movie went down in my top four all the time. Unexceptional. James Cameron proved himself again and again that he was the main storyteller. Through films such as Aliens, Hell and Terminator, both are clear that he is a good and reliable director until action and science fiction. He saw the story and added strange qualities to the movie. But the Titanic is very different to the rhythm of his intelligence. This film has a special movement and helps to have space for surprises, plot development and character development that is interesting in the story that everyone knows. The story of a famous traveler caught up with her first journey is legendary, so the challenge for Cameron to create a movie that is really interesting and fun about it. The performance was excellent, like Leonardo DiCaprio, who played Jack and Kate Winslet. Players rose to become superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most movies I was annoyed when The supporting drama didn't do much. With more purpose because as the elder Rose (Gloria Stuart) clearly tells her story about Rose and Jack alone. No one else. The mood is completely satisfying and does not leave dry eyes in the cinema or at home. The song has become a symbol and a legend. It is the best soundtrack of James Horner that has ever been produced and motivated by a lot of movies and audiences. Music after long ago became annoying. But I still appreciate it for the phenomenon that it is and this film is The only problem, James Cameron's problem, is a memorable conversation. But in a way that is not as good as it is But something beyond James Cameron delivers romantic masterpieces and epic that will sweep you through life. My heart will not go from this
