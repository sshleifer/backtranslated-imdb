The excellent PICK UP of PICK UP depends on the road. SOUTH is choosing a bunch of low-cost cars that have been influenced by the Cold War in the early 50s. The running time is less than 80 minutes. Picking up on the road. SOUTH is difficult, brave, explosive and endlessly fun. <br /> <br /> Widmark star as a pickpocket across McCoy who has been picked up three times. Even so, he was unable to prevent his fingers from getting lost, and the problem was what he slid into when he swung Candy moll Candy's purse (Jean Peters). Candy's purse contained a small film film that could not be evaluated. To the communist movement and it was her last job that Richard Kiley, a former girlfriend, delivered However, when Widmark raised it, Peter had to do everything to claim the movie that she (initially) didn't know. <br /> <br /> It's a delicious setting with Widmark's characters. While not a psychopath of KISS OF DEATH, this is a true, unpredictable and charming bond. But there is a curious charm when Bogart or Mitchum steps into the noir movie script that you know you are going to receive: the only hero in the fight (Bogart). Keep yourself trapped (Mitchum) with Widmark. You just don't know what you are going to get, and with his incredibly stylish acting style. Here he was torn between making a big score for himself by selling movies or sending to the police and fighting the "Commies" on the right side of the law. And he also had to pretend that he had never fenced Peter to avoid a serious fourth punishment on his paper. <br /> <br /> Peter received her best role as Lollipop candy with gold Widmark's unpredictability may be best expressed in his scene with Peters; Fast beautiful homeless people (And unbelievably - the corner of a rather hasty love) falls under the spell of Widmark, but Widmark alternates between kissing her or slapping her around. The unforgettable beauty of Peters But the lack of glamor over Hollywood (Lana Turner will never work well in this role) is an important asset of the movie. Candy is not naive. But she was very sensitive, passed between men and slapped continuously. Widmark knocked her cold in the first meeting and woke her by pouring beer on her face. But from the last act he was more gentle to her (After her police one hell is coming from Kiley) The hospital scene with Peters and Widmark is not available. But it is so. <br /> <br /> Thel Matters is very good as the character Moe deserves her Oscar nomination. Ritter's performance is like everything else in this movie is sincerity, truth and heartbreaking. The scene of her death was amazing. The movement of the camera and the fuller position settings are particularly interesting. Fuller likes to take close-up shots and picks up on SOUTH STREET. Fuller is not afraid to let the camera take longer than the standard Hollywood model that is really allowed. But pulled out remarkably from the death scene of Ritter so that the audience was most affected. City attractions and unique camera angles make you wake up on SOUTH STREET, a modern and unique look. <br /> <br /> 10/10
