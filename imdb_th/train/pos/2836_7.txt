There was a sudden attraction between Zandalee and Johnny and they entered the story, but Zandalee struggled with her sexual desires and consciousness and love for her husband. But no one in them is not Zandalee, not Johnny and not Thierry. Can stop the relationship between them completely separate from control. <br /> <br /> Comments: It's set to be a thriller. But may be a heart thriller rather than a general thriller about life and death and threats from violence Not that the thriller of the heart cannot be used with serious proportions. But the threat comes from different angles And it wasn't true until the second half of Zandalee until the thriller appeared and even though its foundation was laid in the first half, I couldn't explain the genre as a thriller The drama is too romantic to have anything else. But there is a stream of other types The thriller is developing there. But it has a slightly more erotic erotic color Because that's what it is about what drives the characters and the whole story, the desires needed, and the need to be <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it's quite good, of course, much better today ( 4.1) Rating It takes time, but it increases the sense of wonder and manage the erotic part very well with the taste. It's always an important part of the story, having to stay there to tell the story that needs weight, and I never felt it was an excuse to show naked breasts or something like that. Unfortunately, the important point of the story comes to an end, and ultimately feels flat, even if it's in its own way. <br /> <br /> An impressive actor spearheaded by known actors like Nicholas Cage. And Judge Reinhold, but the performance was almost completely stolen by Erika Anderson. Beautiful and versatility in showing subtle feelings. Sometimes she excelled in both cage and freehold, sometimes going to bots into the sea and becoming rough. TheAfter that, her career was too thin for the talent she performed in Zandalee. I could only hope that it was because of her own choices. Two personal favorites that appear in the small roles that make movies special: Steve Buscemi and Joe Pantoliano. <br /> <br /> When you're in the right mood, this is a very good movie. Use the other end to receive the credit you should receive. <br /> <br /> 7/10
