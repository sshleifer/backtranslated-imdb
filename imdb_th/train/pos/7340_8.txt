This animation has a good plot that is simple and straightforward and is about action. What makes it different from other animations is how well the human movement moves. It is very beautiful when seeing a girl running on the screen from left to right and looking around her movements. well done Why today does not use this rotation technique more? It is quite effective. <br /> <br /> Fire and ice in prehistoric settings and women dressed hardly have been dedicated to showing beautiful women in distress in various sexy ways. The face is a pure eyecandy. Some people may hate this and think that it is a sexual fantasy of men who have other morals (including many women). Not sure! Bakshi likes to show cute and charming baby animations that can be seen in Cool World and I don't think he'll have to apologize because it's an adult animation. But I was happy with this animation since I was a child and I never forget. <br /> <br /> This special is very different from the standard fare of Disney or anime and for a reason. The only worthwhile look since It may be the best of Bakshi for those who like animation with lazy women: Try Space Adventure Cobra. <br /> <br /> I give Fire and Ice 8 of 10.
