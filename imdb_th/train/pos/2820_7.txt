This film must be viewed in the correct mindset. Firstly, the relationship between father-son and child makes it clear that the film is intended to be a prequel for the movie "Drunken Master" by Wong Hung (the idea from this film was born. Again in "Drunken Master II", where Chan retreated from this plan and changed the character's name, indicating that he himself did not believe that the content was appropriately combined. The feeling of incompleteness, for example, the relationship romantic half the plot. Was fully hung at the end of the movie "Master" from the same time, it felt bad But at least at the center of the film, the film ends with the film feeling as though Chan has struggled with the story and The character who tries to find his main theme just to abandon the effort may be due to time and budget. <br /> <br /> Or maybe this movie is too ambitious, this is a major turning point in Chan's career. Because he is determined to develop himself nt of the main character above all other concerns - which is why there is a lack of kung fu throughout the movie Chan wanted to create a romantic movie in the past that happened to Kung Fu in there. But both the historical elements and the romantic elements found more than twisting the plan. <br /> <br /> That makes us funny. Because Chan's concern is that the development of comedy characters is a character driven by the conflict between Chan's character and his best friend. But there are many hurt as well I find comedy movies amusing enough to forgive the imperfection of the story. <br /> <br /> This film shows Chan's efforts to find practical formulas that he can use and develop. Always It doesn't work and Chan will find that formula after abandoning the historical elements of his previous movie by creating a contemporary action comedy "Police Story". But returning to watch this movie still gives A lot of information about the way Chan works in historical ways and perhaps why he abandoned it.
