This movie, along with WESTFRONT 1918, is a movie I like directing Pabst and I enjoy them more than his famous movie starring Louise Brooks (like PANDORA'S BOX). Probably because both are similar to the Neo-Realist movies that Italian people created in the 1940s and 50s. This style of movie calls for the use of non-actors (common people) in everyday settings to create images. In this case, this film is about French and German coal miners. Properly, the person in the role looks like a digger, not an actor. The main conflict when the film began was that there was a large mine located on the French-German border instead of a single large mine. It was divided on the border and German workers were not welcomed in French mines despite unemployment Increase in Germany This is a language difference. (Which shows amazingly in the dance scene) and WWI conspired to create a large split between the groups - resulting in us with their ideas Later, the explosion caused a major collapse in France and Germany refused to sit down and do nothing. Risking their own lives, they prove that there is a real relationship between miners and people. <br /> <br /> This film is a strong criticism of foreigners and tries in vain to make German audiences saw uselessness. Of war and hate It's a beautifully animated movie with frightening and frightening images I've seen. When considering the history of this film, there is minimal impact. It is really a shame like this. WESTFRONT 1918, J√ÅACCUSE (Gance) and all QUIET in the Western Front (Milestone) have excellent messages of peace and harmony. But eventually failed in a positive opinion Therefore, from a historical perspective, it is an amazing and sad gift that is worth watching.
