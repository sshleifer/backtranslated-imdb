Call me silly But I love horror movies, Valentine's Day, 2001. It's good to do, write well, do good, direct, etc.! Everything about it is great! There are rather recurring parts. (Lily's death) Very funny (www.Bleed-Me-Dry.com) Scary and completely creepy (Paige's death) and just heartbroken (first scene) I think all actors do very well by Only the three leading actors: David Boreanaz, Denise Richards (both of whom I met and received autographs during the filming of this movie - very good people!) And Marley Shelton. <br /> Bored with people calling this movie "Scream clone". Another story about this movie is no longer Sc. ream clone In fact, this movie is projected around Scream. It makes sense! Scream is not the only movie that has a masked killer in it. Sorry, but it looks like Scream is a clone as well (Ahem ... Friday the 13th, Halloween and many other horror movies. I also think that the novelty of the killer wearing a Cupid mask is great. It was strange to see a sweet face and Cupid made all these horrible things. Another novelty (Nosebleeds) makes a great ending! The ending makes me chill every time I see !!!!! So even if you don't like it for the first time, look at Valentine again and give it a chance again. <br /> <br /> PS - Keep an eye on my new website. (WWW.LOVE-HURTS.ORG)! soon...
