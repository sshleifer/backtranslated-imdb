Hood of the Dead Dead has lots to do before starting to open credits. First of all, playing "... of the Dead Dead" will call His Holiness Mr. Romero and create high standards for many movies that cannot be desired. And secondly, my movie-watching companions wondered what horror movies in the city would be beyond Leprechaun in the hat Oh, of course, the budget is low and of course the friends of the amateur directors will be shown, but Hood of the Living Dead likes a cheap zombie cinema? Yes. But when the price is cheap, you can clearly see where the love is stored. <br /> <br /> Ricky works in the lab during the day and is the parent agent for the younger brother at night. He dreamed of moving out of Auckland. However, before the planned escape, his brother would be shot to death in driving. Ricky's enthusiastic scientific mind offers an alternative to CPR or 911: injecting the experimental reform formula of his lab. Sadly, the little brother woke up in a blood-thirsty Oakland zombie hospital! Chaos and Mayhem! I think eating your enemies is more economical than avenging by driving. But again, I am a poor judge about the complexity of city life. (How poor is the judge? In response to a bloody scene involving four men, I chose "Ah-ha! Everyone's white T-shirt so that the blood appears more economical! I used the same technique in an inexpensive horror movie. "Jordan replied," No, there is a white T-shirt gang set being banned from a bar in New Orleans for a while. "Oh.) < br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of people. The living room therefore hangs out and awaits many zombies. But the characters are sympathetic and the film is sincere - it's over budget in the spirit. <br /> <br /> Description Zombies: When humans play as gods, zombies happen! Or: Follow the FDA approved test rules before human trials! <br /> <br /> Being involved with Zombie Zombies: This is the first zombie movie I have ever seen with shooting by driving. As long as the real zombies are still infected, spread as normal. But the unusual head image doesn't work - it's a heart-killing image. Zombies have an impersonal pulse that proves true death. And these zombies make the jaguar-roaring sound cool. <br /> <br /> Zombie movies Horror stories: mercenaries named Romero groan. <br /> <br /> Favorite zombies: Jaguar-noise The little brother of the zombies, of course!
