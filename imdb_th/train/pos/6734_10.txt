Riding Giants is a documentary with details about the history and stories of the three big surfers, including Gregg Noll, Jeff Clark and Laird Hamilton. Stacy Peralta has a remarkable performance in the role of director and should be Congratulations for this wonderful work. The structure of the movie has been superbly modified and works perfectly with subtitles, interviews, animations and surfing images. The music soundtrack has just increased the overall satisfaction of watching this movie, making the Riding Giants look fantastic. A personal highlight, including any comment from Greg Noll, with his outspokenness, the image of Laird Hamilton at Teahupoo and the filming at the end. But actually this whole movie is a recommended highlight that is highly recommended if you have the opportunity to watch. It's a shame that I don't know each other better. But it is a gem that deserves attention. 10/10
