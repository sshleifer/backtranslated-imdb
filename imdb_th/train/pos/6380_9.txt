Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a better movie than I thought. I never thought that this movie would lead to my expectations. Actually, this movie started slowly. But when this movie wears it, I like it more. The story takes place in 1914 and is about a man named Milo. Milo believes in Atlantis that lies Together with his grandfather's friends, he began his own amazing adventure. Along the way he must love friendship, betrayal, trust and many more. The voice-overs are great. They certainly know how to bring movies with their voice capabilities. Nothing special. But is already a favorite Animation is not the best, but still good enough. Overall, this is a good family movie for all ages. I rate this movie 9/10
