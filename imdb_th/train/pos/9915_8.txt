I have no place to go. I am on a flight to Vancouver I might miss this movie if I didn't choose Air Canada. When viewed on a small screen on the back of the front seat, I found something attractive and attractive. I drifted a couple of places and had to jump. But I have to be careful until the end Now I am looking forward to the DVD release in Europe, although I am quite transfixed when I can walk out of the door yet to be discovered! <br /> <br /> The amazing shooting elements and The movie provides a lot of insights and 'add' stories that the photos tell <br /> <br /> recommend (if you have time on hand)
