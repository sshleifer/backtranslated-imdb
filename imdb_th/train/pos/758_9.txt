Basically, three Welsh and a mad Englishman were brought together in the love of skateboarding and disregarding happiness / socialism that didn't care about health and Safety. They have puking, eating pizza with roofs, covering pubs, jumping in midwives, biting paintball, parody, mocking, jokes with little ones while sleeping / snoring heavily. , Boy Boy and many other crazy stunts that cause bruises, bumps, blood and vomiting may not just be for himself, starring Matthew Pritchard, who has done everything very well. Lee Dainton also serves anything. Dan Joyce (English One) who almost did a lot of things and laughed OTT and Pancho (Mike Locke) who did a lot of things, but became more popular as being lazy and lazy It's what numbers in the 100 greatest funny moments. Very good!
