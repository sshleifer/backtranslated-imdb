If you are a big fan of the composers like me belonging to Jim Thompson, it may seem ridiculous when their work is converted into a movie. This is not the case with Scott Foley's action on AFTER DARK, MY SWEET, Classic Noir, suspicious sex and sexual intercourse, which is closely monitored and given justice to the original text. Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward give the performance that The best in their careers And Bruce Dern, who is constantly evolving, may make him one with this Like Thompson's book, this film creates a dark and surreal world where passion, logic and cross-over are not far reaching. Must see for all fans of the good film noir **** !!!
