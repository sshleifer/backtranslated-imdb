The original animation of the Dark Knight is back in Mask of Phantasm's rival Aces in the coolness, style and ingenuity of Mystery of the Batwoman, more than Batman Forever or Batman and Robin. <br /> < br /> There is a new crime fighter on the streets of Gotham. She is dressed like a bat. But she is not a grown-up batgirl Batman is denying her connection. At the same time, Bruce Wayne had to deal with normal love and detective work, but Penguin, Bain and the local mob made things a little more complicated. <br /> <br /> I don't have hope. High for this story, since he was dropped heavily, but the weak Batman: Sub Zero (Robin isn ') didn't give much importance to this place!) But I was satisfied with the fantasy and exciting scenes. Clever and humorous messages that arrogance This is a movie that Batman fans shouldn't have. Don't forget to open a catchy song called 'Betcha Neva' which is an outstanding song all the time. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the DVD isn't good. Do not understand me wrong. There are great features (short, 'Chase Me', great) and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack that is very cool. But ... this movie is presented in Pan and Scan. Man was drawn and shot in 1.85: 1, but this DVD was presented in the format 1.33: 1, compared to the widescreen clip displayed on the feature that the image was cut on both sides. I find it extremely annoying when considering the Mask of Phantasm being presented in anamorphic widescreen. Warner has to launch dozens of movies on the DVD again because people complain that the original aspect ratio is lacking in some names. Why do they choose to make the same mistakes here again, too? <br /> <br /> I will give this DVD 5/5, but the lack of OAR causes the overall score to decrease to 4/5. The embarrassing story because the widescreen will complete the excellent DVD package.
