This is Antonio Nieto's medieval film that most critics quickly overlooked as 'Defective' looking at the culture / politics of the 60s of the American people For something worthwhile, I found it more impressive and memorable than his award-winning films, such as L'AVVENTURA, perhaps because he showed more emotion and empathy. This story is simple. But used as a framework for Antonioni's great observations and critiques of American consumer culture, student life, anti-culture and all of the outstanding anti-backlash at that time. <br /> <br /> Even though it is a perspective Purely technical But it is a remarkable movie created From the opening sequence of credits to the strange desert 'love-in' to the use of billboards and then to the final scene of a drama using 17 tripods (in the style of The Wild Bunch ) In addition, Antoni also chose one of the top women hell with Daria Halperin, one of the most beautiful people in history. There is no 'show' that is very relevant. It feels like a docu drama and use. The value of non-professional actors as chief put it to work quite effectively within that context. And the soundtrack is not only full of amazing music, the use is impressive as well. (I can't forget the beginning of most movies due to the selection of songs - by Pink Floyd - which makes the picture look good) br /> <br /> In contrast to popular comments, this is a success. The cinema and I strongly recommend to everyone who has a taste or tolerance for mistakes. Worthwhile to go out and find one of those important movies in the 60s that needs restoration / release of DVDs.
