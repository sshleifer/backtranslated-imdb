One critic said that it seems that it doesn't matter what Welles really says or what he says. He will move you. I agree. He is and still is a unique power in the movie. More than three times the threat that can be written and directed, he has a unique talent for filming. One can consider that in the previous era he would be a painter. This movie definitely reinforces the impression. Are musicians, actors and actresses the descendants of Shakespeare? Hard to say, but I am very grateful for his time with the movie and he let him catch on the film. I like the accent I like the face, size, style, mind and game. I love all his movies and hope to have more. I like how other actors interact with him in the movie. Many people never get better, or at least different from him because he is firmly there. Although at the end when his beauty was destroyed, perhaps because of his own intentions, he could not ignore it and he did all the scenes he was in. Rita is a beautiful blonde - Lana Turner looks the same. But sometimes more cute The eyes went to Wales and wished one minute a minute, another movie, another hour in his company. That's why we all hope that we will see the missing debris cut from his movie because we know that We all know that there is no part of him that is not worthy of our time. Watch it and thank you for the opportunity.
