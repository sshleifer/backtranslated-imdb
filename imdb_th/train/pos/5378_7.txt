This is an interesting little flick that happened in 1967 with a cool soundtrack, a strange soundtrack, and a plot that will make you laugh ... Okay. It's not really stupid. But it's very fun I see many similarities between this and "Blue hand creatures" (AKA The Bloody Dead) and they have the same director! Most of Scotland Yard is investigating a murder in a college girl. It seems that the criminals are being released from the local prison to make a bid for the wicked and come back when their work is done. There are good equipment hidden inside the Bible that squirts, prussic acid and there are other devices that are not both good and secret Looking far away, there is a "monk" and everyone indicates that this is a "monk", apart from me. It carries a whip and sets in a red dress with a red hat. Klan members with different colors Over the day There are a lot of good equipment, such as the stove, the fireplace that goes up and down to get the monks and stepped on the fire without setting his robe down. This is a strange combos of dramatic crime that is striking, and while it's rather stupid, sometimes it's fun to watch. 7 out of 10 is not bad ....
