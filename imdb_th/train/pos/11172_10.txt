Personally, I love this movie and novel very much. (I read the book first and decided to watch the movie.) First of all, the plot is truly original and one of a kind. The performance is great and I like the actor Judd Crandall (playing Fred Gwynne) perfectly fits his role and sells it to you. There are also a few small curves that are thrown in there (Idk if they intend to repetitively), but they will make them cheerful and give good laughter The atmosphere of Maine is the perfect spot for filming this movie and it attracts you throughout the story. Not only will you love it But you will want to see it again and again. I recommend this 100% to awesome fans!
