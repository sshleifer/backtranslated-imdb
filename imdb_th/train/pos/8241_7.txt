Fido is a very strange movie and in many ways is a very good thing. <br /> <br /> My first thought after watching if Shaun of the Dead is a romantic comedy with zombies. Fido is a boy and a story. His dog combines with comedy in the fifty-five era with zombies. <br /> <br /> Fido has a little slaughter of Sean, blood and belly laughing. It's a completely different beast (forgive Pun). <br /> <br /> Fido begins with a black-and-white film explaining the latter. - Humans win the war with zombies by developing sub-control necks. <br /> <br /> At first, I thought we were in the Cold War as a paranoid psychic. But soon we were thrown into the world of bright colors Thinking about class <br /> <br /> Young Timmy Robinon is a lonely boy who doesn't attend school. His mother is a social climber and his father is a fearful and bland person. <br /> <br /> Carry-Anne Moss becomes a zombie. Jimmy doesn't care at first, but 'Fido' (Billy Conelley) soon proves to be a good friend for Jimmy. <br /> <br /> Fido isn't a horror movie. But my problem with this movie is to find out what it is. <br /> <br /> Most of the humor is a light variety of the family, and sometimes his plot is dependent on boys and dogs / ranges. Too much time in the family. <br /> <br /> But this movie was filmed with a truly dark and amazing moment. While welcoming, you can be sure that the R score for things that are long-term is a joke for the family. <br /> <br /> This film looks gorgeous and performed amazingly by everyone involved. <Br /> <br /> Despite the difficult tonal problems, I hope this movie will find the channel because it is a little gem in this year's crap movie.
