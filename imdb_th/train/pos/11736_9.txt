Those who are not familiar with Elvira adapted from Cassandra Peterson. This is a good starting point. <br /> <br /> "Elvira, Mistress of the Dark" begins with our heroine with gravity that challenges the girl who gets News seems like her aunt is dead and she wants to live to read the will. Wanting to make money for the performance she wants to open in Las Vegas, she decides to go in the hope of receiving a lot of money. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the place you have to go to. Is the city of Fallwell, Massachusetts When having to break the spell because her car broke down, she found that her good aunt left 3 things: a dog house and a cookbook. Residents of the city have reacted: teenagers like her. Women hate her and men want her. (Although trying to preserve the moral pillars of the community) her worst problems became her big uncle, Vincent (W. Morgan Sheppard) because he wanted her cookbook. It seems that the cookbook is a book of magic that will make him a powerful magic. <br /> <br /> This movie is really funny with Peterson aka Elvira using "endowments" and sexiness is a joke ("and "Don't forget tomorrow. I'll show your head and two things ... I mean two things.") Especially funny like Edie McClurg as Chastity Pariah, the woman who works the most to keep the city in line. But ended up looking ridiculous (Picnic scenes are perfect examples) deserve to be viewed. (The movie is definitely not your girl)
