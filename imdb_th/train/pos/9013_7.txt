Although this movie has weaknesses But it's worth watching I chose it because of the actors and applauded Bonham Carter and Branagh for choosing roles that were different from what they had done in the past. Both showed that people had many problems with warts. But made them favorite because of their humanity The story is touching But it was the soaring "Jane" Bonham Carter's performance that was a remarkable achievement that the pursuit of love made my eyes look disabled, which I had never thought of before. But also interesting for other reasons I felt the movie ended abruptly. But better than ending with emotional provocation (see "Stepmom.") The English language setting that truly increases my enjoyment - it is British in the 90s both in the city and in the countryside.
