This is one of the most overlooked gems in Hollywood that had been produced by British-era World War II fighters, whose aircraft were about to crash. There was a radio connection with an American woman who comforted the pilot Brave knows that within a few minutes he will die. For some reason, people who should certainly die walk away from the ruins and eventually realize that they intend to report to heaven. When the messenger asked the pilot to accompany him to heaven, the man refused and called for a "day in court" to argue his case. The man stated that his situation changed during the last moments of his life in the world that he fell in love and became a different person who deserves the opportunity to live. <br /> <br /> " Heaven Court "is a pleasure in the cinema! "The announcement of the jury" is a clear feature. The story is interesting and engaging and will keep you amazed for almost 2 hours of playing. The final scene is beautiful and must have "Kleenex treatment" for most audiences. This film is in my top 10 personal favorite all the time. It has my highest recommendation!
