I've seen hundreds of silent movies. Some people are always classic (like Nosferatu, Metropolis, General and Wings), but among them I like is this movie. (It may not be the best - but it's a favorite. Yes) In fact, when I searched for it on IMDb, I noticed that I immediately laughed at myself because this movie was so cute and very good. Marion Davies proved with a movie. This is that she has really great talent and is not the love of William Randolph Hearth. <br /> <br /> Stories related to Georgia An experience and an interesting star pendant in her time, making this movie a game for movie lovers and must watch!
