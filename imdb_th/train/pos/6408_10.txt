Classic Hollywood Biopic is the best feeling of the genre Gooding and DeNiro. Both show sincere performances in two leading roles, and the supporting actors are also excellent, with great performances from Carl Lumbly and Michael Rapoport > <br /> The only thing I can choose is the role of Theron that is not necessary and disturbing. (Not her performance that is not good But it seems that the movie adds two unnecessary scenes to support her role. <Br /> <br /> In addition to that, the characters, changes and actions of real-life stories are exciting and memorable. The evolution of the main characters and the ways in which they experience the evolution of life are unique by the performing artists. Even if the movie has the maximum length But the spacing rate remains constant The score is still excellent. <br /> <br /> Are we guessing Hollywood movies? Bet. So Mike Leigh's addict should remove the star, but everyone should be extremely happy.
