Once when I was in college and we had an international exhibition, the Russian department had a Soviet era poster that said "Ne boltay!" "Don't be a Gladiators!" "You will see that it's not a laugh. In this case, a witty military ceaselessly heard anything about the bombing and assumed that the Axis had attacked the United States immediately. So he told the people who told others who told others and that it would continue as "Russia is about to come. Russia is about to come." Coming to Snafu ... You know what I mean! Yes, it's a World War II propaganda, mostly a derogatory term for Japanese people. But must say that Snafu Pvt. Shorts are very funny. Of course, since they have Dr. Seuss wrote and Mel Blanc gave it a voice, so it was not surprising that these things came out quite cool. Worth watching
