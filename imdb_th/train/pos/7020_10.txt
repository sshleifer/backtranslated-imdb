* I marked with spoilers! Overall comment: If you can make a serious movie, watch this Have an open mind and you will enjoy it Do not leave the theater because you are confused what happened! This movie got along well in the second half. I will take my mother to see again when the movie is officially launched. <br /> <br /> I'm lucky to see this in the show a few weeks ago when Will is promoting this movie. He's great - spend a lot of time with the fans. Thank you for the Will! About Will's performance: Many times you see a movie with a very famous actor for a movie / other performance, you often miss them in their current performance, just like you miss them. Past This is not the case with Will Smith in this movie. I didn't imagine a fresh prince (laughs) when I watched this movie. He is fully confident and fully in this very important role. He grew up as an actor. I think at least he will be awarded an Oscar for this performance. <br /> <br /> About his character: Ben conflicts and is very tortured. He is sad ... riding the guilt ... very much. Very scared, very real to myself His character is very deep ... and in any way can make it alive. <br /> <br /> About Emily (Rosario): Rosario performed very well. Which shows Emily, a woman, a tax. Perhaps she is not the star that will shine in this movie. But she was very convinced I think her character doesn't work as much as I can. <br /> <br /> About the plot (No spoilers): I agree that I don't like movies until the second half of the story. I don't know anything about the movies that were released and there is nothing reasonable until the second part is like that. But when things finally came together, wow Surprisingly well written and well thought out It is a movie with a very high concentration that really carries you. <br /> <br /> It makes you look a lot. In the theater that I live in, most people cry until the end - even the older men. When you realize what Ben is doing and why it is a very powerful moment ... <br /> <br /> ******* Secondary spoiler ***** which Is the reason that is difficult to talk about The story does not let the important things go out. I felt that I knew too much about this movie. It really destroyed. There were many symbols in my favorite movies. I'll talk about something here. (Without much effort) <br /> <br /> - The fish that Ben kept in the hotel room At first, there was no reason at all. There are many nonsense stories in the cinema when people realize the reality of the fish. <br /> <br /> - I hate Ben at the beginning of the movie. At the end of I love him and hate him. That is a reliable way. I think Ben is a jerk for Ezra, the blind, just trying to make him stay in this world. Why is he clearly keeping the Ezra in the movie? Wait a moment. Everything in this movie: Wait. <br /> <br /> - Ben is a good person who makes a big mistake that he won't forgive. It's not clear for me if he does what he does because he tries to get rid of his own mistakes or if he really wants to help people. I think it's a little both ... I think he wants to help people. But also eliminating his past I love his character You love him and hate him because you realize that what he is doing is nothing amazing. You hate him because of what he did to himself. (Very good) both physically and emotionally
