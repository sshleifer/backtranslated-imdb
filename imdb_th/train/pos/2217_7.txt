Usually, I often wonder about watching movies or mini-series created from novels, because the screenplay is always different from the novel. Fortunately, I was wrong. The screenplay is very close to the novel. (I guess it helps the writer to be a producer and writer, right?) <br /> <br /> The actors are outstanding. I cannot explain that I enjoy seeing many actors such as (from Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee to Robert Ri'chard and Bianca Lawson). <br /> <br /> Setting the position ... I Expect to see houses and cottages that I imagine in my heart: what I see on the screen is slightly different. However, it's not enough to make me dislike the mini-series. <br /> <br /> I recommend this for everyone who reads the novel: You won't be disappointed if you have 8 out of 10 stars! <br /> <br />
