Before I start, I should point out that I know the editors of this movie. We have never met before. But we are in the same fanzine group (something that happened before the message) and we talked on the phone so I have a bias here. However ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, it is ridiculous While the "Rat Pack" culture of the late 50s and early to mid-60s came back again in the mid 1990s, this movie from the son of One of the traditional rash packs that do the same thing is a flop. Not only that, it's a major failure. I believe Peter Travers of Rolling Stone is the only person who didn't help this. (He gives mixed opinions as I remember) and while I don't think this is the greatest movie in the world and I'm not a fan of Rat Pack or the "cocktail" culture, I think this is something. Which is worth looking at. <br /> <br /> For one thing, this thing looks stylish and moves together. As for the other main performances, Richard Dreyfus was surprisingly restrained here when the gangster returned from Jeff Goldblum's back to a quietly satirical performance he had given before Blockbuster, like THE BIG CHILL and while Ellen Barkin wants to just piece in this movie But she was fun Acknowledged that it is not a great movie Most conversations contain pun and most do not work (such as "Zen of Ben", all) and Gabriel Byrne and Kyle MacLachlan are scary here. Even though I was entertained and if you like gangster movies, you might be like that.
