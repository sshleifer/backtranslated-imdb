One of the best musicals created one of those timeless and worth seeing again and again. Delicious! The performance, especially Ron Moody as Fagin, was great. Great costumes .... even shabby <br /> <br /> Two children who play Oliver and The Artful Dodger have great abilities. Oliver Reed works great in acting Bill Sykes to the position. That you can't help But hopefully he will come to a terrible end, which he has done. <br /> <br /> Dance is cleverly choreographed and mesmerizing. Oliver can hold himself with My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music. , Oklahoma, movies etc. for the whole family
