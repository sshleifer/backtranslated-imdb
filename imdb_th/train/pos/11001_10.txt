Canadian director Vincenzo Natali joined the band around the house with a storm of amazingly interesting and intelligent Cube, which is my personal favorite SF movie in the 90s. It surrounds the basic idea of ​​a stranger group stuck. In a maze that is shaped like a giant cube, shooting all in one scene and bringing this concept in an interesting direction. <br /> <br /> I am looking forward to Natali's enthusiasm and enthusiasm. Although it took five years for him to mount another project. But I am pleased to say that it is worth the wait. Cypher is an interesting survey about the place of a man in the world and how to go through a completely logical event. Find yourself in the situation. <br /> <br /> I don't want to reveal too much about The plot because one of the pleasures of Cypher is a different channel, disappointing us. It's very refreshing today and age to see SF movies that have more than one idea in its head. Cypher is such a movie. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy North Tam) One of the most formidable people to walk on this planet was hired by Digicorp. They sent him to various parts of America to record different seminars. For his confusion, they are incredibly boring. Covering topics that are common, like shaving cream and cheese. <br /> <br /> While Morgan is waiting for a seminar, he runs to Rita Foster. (Actress Lucy Liu) which is the definition of an ice girl She let him brush out But there is something to her that he cannot find That's not surprising when considering his barren marriage. <br /> <br /> When Rita appeared at Morgan's seminar again, she said that his life was not what appeared. And I didn't say anything more about the story In doing so, there will be less impact on the rest of the film towards us, including the winding paths that are so fun to follow. <br /> <br /> Just like the Cube, Natali demonstrates Can be quite plain People take them out of the familiar and generally see what happens when they are pushed into the unknown. And Cyfer according to similar patterns But it's not a copy of the Cube. It has its own inspiration. <br /> <br /> Cypher is a movie that is more similar in terms of sharing, thriller and paranoid story. One of the great things about Cypher is the way in which these themes creep into the story without your knowledge. When Morgan realized that his false identity was a much larger piece of the puzzle, it was a shock to us as much as he told <br /> <br /> One thing. Making Cypher different from the Cube, ie. Where Cube is limited to a simple environment and a shoestring budget with foreign objects. Cypher is still in a low budget, but Natali saves it as much as possible. It could extend and make his debut in the Morgan amazing journey. Through the maze of his own identity. <br /> <br /> Natalie's direction is great. There are amazing camera angles from the top, such as the dreadfulness of the Digicorp building, which is a large, strong office building with a small spot where Morgan stands outside. All colors seem to be sparse from the picture, which compliments the sound of the film perfectly, like a modern film - noir. <br /> <br /> The performance is consistently excellent throughout Jeremy Northam. Sympathetic from a love-free marriage His performance was excellent because it was adjusted. It seems that he will truly change before our eyes. From a ruthless innocent patient to a confident person who will do everything to preserve his new identity. <br /> <br /> David Hewlett appears to welcome those who affect his Cube. Live in a secret silo that looks like borrowed from a man in black His scene is one of the best because it is exercise in calculating suspicion and suspicion. He is an expert in identifying agents twice, and it is a great work written by Hewlett. What he has to do is just look at Morgan and we enter the game of his complex thoughts. <br /> <br /> But it was Lucy Liu who stole the scene. Often she was screened in the film that her potential was not fully utilized, but in Cypher she eventually received the character that fits her like a glove. Rita is a peaceful and safe woman whose life lives with passion. I looked up every time she appeared because she was always in control and able to reduce the room to be silent with the power of ice, staring at you alone. <br /> <br /> Things ended up very satisfying. Summarizing the ambiguous text that Cube did, but Morgan deserves his happy ending. After he was sent, like this, I encouraged him in the final scene. It was the last perfect moment because it was born from the sun after 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Cypher succeeds in everything, everything that Total Recall wants to be shocking and fun all the time, but not And it is a refreshing antidote for an obsessive and unexplained matrix. <br /> <br /> A good track from Natali and now I'm a big fan of that man. Great things!
