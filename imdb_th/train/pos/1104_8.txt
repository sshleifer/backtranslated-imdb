The film debuted with Bill Coles (Melvyn Douglas) telling a story about how his best friend - for that customer - Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) and his family were packed in a small apartment. In New York the bathroom is too little When Jim's wife, Grandmother Muriel, wants to improve the apartment, advertisers Jim executives fall in love with the ads. (Or fall in love!) For the house when he buys a house, the bill and the difficulties continue unceasingly, because everything that goes wrong from Jim's 'dream house' is gone. <br /> <br / > One third of the cooperation between Grant and Loy. This is A funny, charming little - don't have to pay too much tax without a really great message, but it's a good way to spend an hour or two. Laughter was there from the beginning when the alarm clock disappeared and Jim tried to close it only to interrupt the Muriel every time it was intercepted. Time and delivery of comedy and situations can only be obtained by a professionally selected couple and that is what Grant and Loy give us: beautiful performances, simple chemistry and lots of fun. Myrna Loy In a role that does not appreciate (Obviously, Grant's character received a share of performances and performances, and Grant, as always, pulled the pair out with self-confidence) but she made Muriel colorful, life and bite. Only Myrna Loy can. Let the characters Melvyn Douglas play the most fun for perfection. Never hit a single note. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite scenes when Bill is locked in a storage room and Jim goes to 'save 'He ... just Inter everyone trapped inside! Little problems, everything that appears for the Blandings renovation project - including a little jealousy and an advertising campaign for 'Wham' - seems to be gathering everything that * can * go wrong with building a new house. But makes it believable and fun. 8/10
