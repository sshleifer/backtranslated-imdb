To watch this movie from the beginning to the end without laughing at some point, having to show the faith as it is, must say to yourself, "It's old." Very bad But because at best, it is very good This is an old movie. It is classic if it is dark. In principle, I didn't laugh with others. But I feel more frustrated when others do that In order for the fun of the informer in my heart, it was just a giggle at the idiotic scholars when he fed his orange juice across the tablecloth. Yes, one person said to himself, he was an idiot. But when he was over the game, he was a real wise man. Similar to The Informer, which is sometimes very scary and has beautiful photography, great performances, excellent scores and simple and good stories. In the end, I would not give up politics, religion and psychology, gather in the church in a way that would make the scene look more conservative and superior, and sometimes life is like that. People who do not have a simple education about faith behave differently from us. (People with great talent) and the scene is not very convincing (I bought it, but I know the Irish). Embarrassing. Not everyone who is hip and may not be desirable for everyone to be hip. Are people today superior to people who are seventy or eighty years ago? And in any way I don't think so We are different Now go to the movies
