Wow. One of the greatest movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Absolutely love! Before the opening of the credit is finished, I was caught on the screen. <br /> <br /> It's a sci-fi thriller - and your seat edge. Whodunnit is unbelievable. <br /> <br /> I Hope that it will never end. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is a role that has been abandoned. Everyone can play. Jeremy Northram, the best male actor, is the perfect person. <br /> <br /> This film attracts me who loves war games, sneakers and track down. <br /> <br /> Incredible ! <br /> <br /> 8-22-06 Walt D in LV
