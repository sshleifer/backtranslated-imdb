The undeniable chemistry between Weismuller and O'Sullivan is great and leads to the hottest scenes, and with both stars wearing outfits that are luxurious and quirky, they both have eyes for both sexes. The underwater nude scene shown by the body twice as much as the cute girl still shows many skin types, even threatening to do 'Sharon Stone' at one point when her rib loin cloth flips on to one side!) <br /> < br /> The most exciting moment of this film was in the form of an underwater battle between Tarzan and the crocodile and the crocodile and an exciting final scene where Jane was attacked by lions and natives. But was rescued by the princess, his beloved monkey and elephant friend In full mode on the lion crushing (Again, the violence is surprising sometimes, as far as I am concerned, nothing is as shocking as pygmies, rocks and their gorilla holes from the first film). The cheetahs also have a fair share. Of excitement, dodging the rhinoceros, crocs and large cats riding behind Tarzan as he crossed the river and jumped on the ostrich to ride <br /> <br /> like its ancestors Tarzan and his partner suffer from some bad effects and unbelievable scenes? Avoiding the projection of a few ridiculous monkeys, more Indian elephants who act as African cousins ​​and trapeze swings.
