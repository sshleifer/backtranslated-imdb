Throughout the country and especially in the political landscape, all political ambitions should take time to watch this movie. This movie is called "City Hall" and with a little imagination, the conclusion of this film can happen anywhere in America. It just happened to open in New York. Here we have the story of a popular politician named Mayor John Pappas (Al Pacino) who is skilled enough to manage a large city with very little effort. His right-hand man is none other than Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun. (John Cusack), an equally bright person whose ambitions are tied to his counselors. Everything pointed in that direction until the police firing sparked a modern investigation by Marybeth Cogan (Bridget Fonda), who believed that the wrong point went to the town hall and the mayor. The six-year-old boy and the police officer died, being blamed on criminals who suspected that would lead to political conflicts and political corruption involving union leaders like Danny Aiello, played by Frank Anselmo. Walter Stern (Martin Landau) and the Mafia leader Paul Zapatti (Anthony Franciosa) who are deeply involved Also involved as a party officer, such as Larry Schwartz (Richard Schiff) working for the New York Probation Office But it was a bond between the mayor and his deputy who was accidentally shot Excellent vehicle for Cusack and nominees to bet on as a classic car ****
