When I was a kid, it was Lex Barker's time as Tarzan. I often hear from the elderly that Johnny Weissmuller "is" Tarzan and I don't understand why because I saw the last two movies of Weismuller in the characters and I think he has an incomplete shape. After a few years I met "Tarzan and his partner" then I understand Weismuller is in the picture in this picture and has the appearance and ferocity, the needs of the characters that do not match with other Tarzans such as Barker, Gordon Scott, Jock Mahoney, Denny Miller, Miles O'Keefe and Cristopher Lambert. For this film, I was surprised by the beautiful appearance of Maureen O'Sullivan, a strong woman with an enthusiastic and enthusiastic mind and no restraint in the base. Before the movie was created (Tarzan pushed her into the pool while she was amused, an explorer kissed her in surprise, and although she didn't kiss him, she let him do anything. Something already did nothing.); Such behavior was unthinkable for the upcoming "Janes", such as Brenda Joyce, Vanessa Brown, Virginia Huston or Dorothy Hart. Everyone played women who were too sweet, making it difficult to believe that they could survive. <br /> <br /> The sparkling personality of the character O'Sullivan steals Tarzan's own expression, except of course when it comes to action and Weismuller is an easy leader. Perfect combination Another highlight in this film is the secondary role of Cheeta and not the main leader, as in the later Tarzan image that she often recorded on the day. <br /> <br /> "Tarzan and His Mate" are great products in Its type (Tarzan movie) and perhaps the best, even though I have to admit that I still enjoy "Tarzan's Greatest Adventure" (1959) with a higher budget and strong supporting actors With the perfect appearance "All gyms" of him that are not suitable for rural monkeys) <br /> <br /> Perfect for Jane and her spouse!
