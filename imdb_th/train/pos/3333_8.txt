I saw this on the plane to New Zealand last week and wondered if it could measure both British movies and books. I must say that I was very impressed. If there is anything that is crazy about the Red Sox over the years, the results are better than those originally dedicated to Arsenal FC, which has been successful As an Englishman, I am interested in seeing that you do not need to understand baseball to get what happens. One question that reminds me - the screenplay written by using Sox as a team before they destroy Curse of the Bambino? Or is another team in the framework? As a Red Sox fan himself (Strange, I know British people who understand baseball) I have to say that it increases enjoyment.
