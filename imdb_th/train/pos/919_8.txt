After being a big fan of 'Columbo', I was very disappointed in 'Corky Romano' while being a comedy. The chief character of Falk is a far cry from the lovely lieutenant he played for years, especially The inappropriate language that he used after 'Corky Romano' I was both surprised and surprised by Mr. Peter Falk. However, when I saw it 'Find John Christmas' and the pioneer 'A Town Without Christmas' for the first time within one week of each other. I have to say 'Max'. The fun character of Peter Falk in both films is It is a memorable and captivating 'Columbo', while some parts of the movie are quite predictable. But these scenes did not arise from the enjoyment of seeing the stories that were played out. I wish I could record a warm Christmas movie and both, and I would recommend them whether you are a Falk, Christmas bean fan or just someone who enjoys movies that feel good from time to time in the week. This movie may end up missing in the crowd of movies made to stop the festival on TV, so don't forget to find 'Finding John Christmas' before it's too late.
