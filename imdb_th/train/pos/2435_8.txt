I never thought that old cartoons would make my tears! When I bought Casper & Friends for the first time: Spooking about Africa, I wanted to see the first Kasper cartoon called The Friendly Ghost (1945), but when I saw the next cartoon, that was a good Boos To-Night that broke me Break! I can't believe how sad and sad it was after seeing Casper's fox killed! I never saw anything like that in the Casper comics! This is the most sad one! It's depressing. I can't see anymore. It's like seeing Lassie die at the end of the movie. I know it's classic. But it's too much for our old cartoon fans to deal with me! If I want to see old and classic things, I should see things that are happy and funny! But when I think about Casper cartoon, I miss my cat!
