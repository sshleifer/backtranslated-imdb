But the rest of us who love good emotional and emotional stories are the keys for you to cry .. Enjoy! <br /> <br /> Tom Hulche is as beautiful as Dominic, a trash dumper with a heart that loves professional wrestling and his brother Eugene, played by Ray Li Da, who is a doctor. And working for a long time. <br /> <br /> Due to Eugene Dominic's work schedule alone, many times and tend to make suspicious decisions. He just wants to be a good boy, do the right thing and make his brother proud of him. He stopped at the church to pray at one point and showed his emotions openly and nicely until your character cried before the damn movie began. <br /> <br /> Not about giving. What's here But this movie is very relevant and sad and sad Those who are not afraid of these things will have a day filled with this beautiful story, beloved characters and wonderful songs that I can't say here. But it is appropriate .. but you hear it in the bar. <br /> <br /> I think Tom Hulce will be nominated in this movie because he is 'Amadeus'. He was truly pursued. There is no such luck. Liotta is good, but has less emotional impact. But after that he continued All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis is that she doesn't have many roles here. But it is good that she will give her a small drama in Pittsburgh about the two brothers that you will never forget.
