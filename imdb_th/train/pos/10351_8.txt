Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) saw her child being dragged out of their tents by a bingo pair and then started a test that no one else had.

Sam Neill is excellent as Michael Chamberlain. In the seventh, who wondered about his faith and his wife. It's a good (or bad) thing to see that people are prejudiced and stupid like they are in the United States as well because Australian citizens do not believe this and the media only fans that are flames.
