I remember watching the American Gothic when it first aired. It came into my mind recently. All I remember was the same guy who appeared in Midnight Caller, Gary Cole. I didn't watch TV much but I See American Gothic. I bought the Complete series on the DVD this week, and it's still as good as this. It's one of the best TV series ever. The reason I didn't watch TV so much is because it's rubbish. Where Closed, except Derren Brown Reality TV or all Soaps such as Grease, Big Brother and others. I'm bored with it. I get all American Series Gothic for 16.97 pounds from the Asda website, which is the cheapest price I can find.
