The name just says it all I watched this movie with my father when it came out and served in Korea. He admired this guy so much. The frustrating thing about this movie is that it focuses on the short period of human life - interesting enough that the whole life of that man will make the biological epic that shook his imagination at the cost of production. br /> <br /> Some posters avoid the incomplete nature of the man, which is a cheap shot. Style of film "Country Fame" is not just a word from the mouth of a high-ranking officer - it is a profound announcement of the complete dedication of a man to his country. <br /> <br /> Ironically, it's a liberal that He gained a better understanding of humans. He did a great job showing the general fear of humanity.
