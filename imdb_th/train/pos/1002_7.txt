Just two comments .... Seven years apart? The evidence is almost never proving unceasingly the power of the movie! As it has been mentioned, the status of the telemovie with a low budget of 13 ROAN GANTRY is a mitigating factor in the limited appeal. Awesome outing. <br /> <br /> Actually, the most basic plot is the new work of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR - just no more horror, more interesting cases! This may create a more rewarding impression if she plays Halifax - exploring two unrelated murders "home" as the main suspect. The script is better than the average and the overall production is of a high standard. It failed to attract a particular audience at a critical time. <br /> <br /> When picking up a DVD for $ 3.95 last week at my regular video store, I can't complain about the $ 10.95 cost. Will be acceptable price for movies Don't expect to get fireworks!
