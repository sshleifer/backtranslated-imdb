This is the first PPV in the new era for WWE, such as Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior, Ric Flair and Sherri Martel. New abilities that need to be pushed And all of this begins with Lex Luger, a former NWA world champion, who has been fired for Yokosuna. Lex travels across the United States in a bus called Financial Express to inspire Americans to gather behind him to defeat Japanese monsters (which are actually Samoans) and grab them. WWE Champion returns to American hands As such, there is much anticipation for this match. <br /> <br /> But every good PPV needs an undercard and this thing has something good. <br /> <br /> The night that starts with Razor Ramon won Ted DiBiase in a good match. The story happened that DiBiase chose Ramon and offered him a job as a slave after he was shocked with 1-2-3 children at RAW in July. Ramon was angry with the 1-2-3 Kid Against the Money Inc tag team. Of Ted DiBiase and Irwin R Shyster. To judge their differences, both get one-to-one, DiBiase vs Ramon and Shyster vs The Kid. The razor is able to manage his side after falling to Razor's Edge. <Br /> <br /> Next up, Steiner Brothers placed the WWE team tag. Tag in the line with the heavenly body The intervention of the team manager "The Bodies" Jim Cornette, who hit Scott Steiner in the neck with a tennis racket. They can pull out the winner in a good match. <br /> <br /> Shawn Michaels and Mr Perfect get The feud from Wrestlemania IX when Shawn Michaels faced Perfect after he lost the Lex Luger Perfect, costing Michaels in the Intercontinental Championship. Michaels won the title back and placed it on the line with Perfect. But now Mikael has a powerful ally in his corner in diesel, escorting his 7 feet. Micheals and Perfect have a great pair here. But it is a diesel that proves the creator of the difference. Pull Perfect out of the ring and throw him into the iron ladder so that Shawn wins. <br /> <br /> Irwin R Shyster avenged the loss of the tag team partner. Earlier in the night by making an account easily for children 1-2-3. <br /> <br /> Later, one of Lawler's greatest matches for the position of King of the WWE without issue But Lawler came out with crutches, saying that he was injured in a car accident the day before and he dealt with another opponent for Hart: Doink the Clown Hart and Doink. Moderately, Hart won with a sharpshooter. He then jumped from behind by Lawler. This bought WWE President Jack Toney's ring to tell Lawler that he would be banned for life if he didn't fight Hart. Hart then destroyed Lawler, winning with a gunman. But Hart refused to release his hand and the referee decided So after all, Lawler was named the King of WWE without problems. This match was followed by Ludwig Borda, destroying Marty Janetty in a short match. <br /> <br /> The contestant ended his long race with Harvey Whippman. Beginning in 1992, when Undertaker When Wippleman's The Giant Gonzales' latest monster destroyed the Taker at the Rumble and then again at Wrestlemania with a decisive victory over Gonzales here. Gonzales then opened Wippleman, chokeslamming. <br /> <br /> Next time, it's time for action. Six men as Gun Gun (Bart and BIlly) and Tatanka beat The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) and Bam Bam. Bigelow and Tatanka Pin Samu <br /> <br /> This led us to the main event with Yokozuna flanked by Jim Cornette and Mr Fuji placed the WWE name on the line with Lex Luger and everything was on the Lex Express Lex. Came out to attack, but the Yokozuna took control. Lex returned again as he could avoid Then squeeze play down Yokozuna body before knocking him out of the ring. Then Luger attacked Cornett and Fuji when Yokosuna was counted. Luger won a good match !!!!! Balloons falling from the ceiling All the heroes congratulate him when winning. Yokozuna may still maintain his position, but Luger has proven that he can be defeated. The only question is who can beat him in the ring and remove that name?
