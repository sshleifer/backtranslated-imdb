John Water's ("Pink Flamingos" ...) "Pecker" is the best movie I've ever seen. It makes the image of life in Baltimore surreal. (I'm in the vicinity of Washington, DC) With the use of warhol colors, exaggerated movements and emotions, Pecker is bigger than his city can handle and he is separated from his loved ones (including Ricci Sexy) by his beloved art manager The image left a fresh feeling in my mouth - like a fresh strawberry ice cream on a hot summer day - and although this flavor is quite flat and simple. It is a celebration of life, freedom and the right to receive weapons ... and everything else in this country means -Juan Pieczanski (jpieczanski@sidwell.edu)
