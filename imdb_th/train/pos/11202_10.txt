At first I thought that the ring would be a more normal movie with a normal story. How surprised I am! Of course, the plot is simple - a woman falls in love with two men - but Hitchcock brought it to us on a silver plate with laughter and fear with compassion and anguish. The way he shows the popular crowd of work, the strength of the attractiveness of women to men, the sad element that comes with the techniques that are open to his greatest film (North by Northwest , the Rope, etc.).) You did very well before reaching the thirties!
