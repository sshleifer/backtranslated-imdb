I give 10 points out of 10 points. I love it a lot. I am a child of 80 and are all heavy metal for many years. This is the reason I like this movie a lot. It was great to see those posters in the boy's bedroom (Judas Priest, Lizzy Borden, Raven, Twisted sister ...) and his vinyl collection. Is my business by Megadeth). In addition, the soundtrack of FASTWAY is incredible and fits with the story. If you are a metal, then TRICK or TREAT is your friend. Do not buy or watch this movie for OZZY or GENE SIMMONS because they are in this movie for a few seconds. Watch because of the accompanying songs and stories that will bring you back to the heyday. 80 You won't be the same person after that.
