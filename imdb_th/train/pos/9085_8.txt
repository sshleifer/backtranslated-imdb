I saw a lot of negative posts from those who wrote in August, although the movie wasn't released in the United States at least until mid-September. Perhaps these are unhappy foreigners living in South Korea who see it fast. I am in the United States and just saw it today. I think the special effects are better than the examples. The story is not Western. But I think we are all familiar with this from many other movies. It's not hard to follow. The actors' performances are weak, but others are quite good with humor as well. I give a score of 8 because I have a good time to watch it, which is what I went to.
