I remember when this film was up for the Oscar and didn't win in any category for my life. I can't remember what happened. But one thing I can say: It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. And the fact that Steven Spielberg directed the film didn't convince me. <br /> <br /> Basically it's about the trials and tribulations of black women when she grows up. There is a lot of madness that is disturbing and frightening. But they all need to see how much this woman can tolerate. On the way we saw other women who had to endure hardships and walk with them to redeem. Whoopi Goldberg gave her the best performance. In this film, Danny Glover should be offered at least for the role He in this movie <br /> <br /> And the best part of this movie is that it is very important to humans. I don't like the odd slideshow like the Beloved. I encourage everyone to compete to see this film 9/10.
