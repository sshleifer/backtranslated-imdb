It's a great movie! It's very scary, excellent performances, well written, good plot, interesting character twists, very good directions and surprising endings that will make you smile on your face. This is one of the popcorn horror movies that may not attract fans who are not horror. But still one of the best thriller today! I recommend to fans of: <br /> <br /> 1) Horror type <br /> <br /> or <br /> <br /> 2) Actors or actors are so important <br /> <br /> *** From the star ****! <br /> <br /> PS - I'm sick and bored with people comparing this to other modern horror movies. With SCREAM, you know what? They don't want to be like a script, everyone likes "Oh, they copy SCREAM!" If I don't understand, SCREAM will also copy another movie! In fact, every horror movie about the previous movie. However, SCREAM is a good movie. But still ... stop comparing and having fun with what it is. <br /> <br /> Then rent this one. <br /> <br />
