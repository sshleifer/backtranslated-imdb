ANTWONE FISHER is the story of American naval marines with emotional problems. His problems led him to Jerome Davenport, a psychiatrist who helped him to know that his problems were caused by raising his childhood. <br /> <br /> Got ready to shed tears? Movies can melt the coldest heart. I love stories that change from something that is really bad to everyone. In a positive ending, ANTWONE FISHER is a powerful and most important movie, forgiving. Other important issues that make you think of child abuse, adoption and caring There are many scenes that I like to watch. They include the beginning. (The dream of a little boy. Let's look at the enormous pancakes!) And the ending (the dream becomes reality) which links the story together beautifully. <br /> <br /> Another great scene was born. When the doctor encouraged Antwone to search for his family to find answers to his questions about his family who left him. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene happened when a young man confronted his mother. And react Her actions towards him in the end are priceless. <br /> <br /> All actors represent the parts well. <br /> <br /> In addition to the responsibility of governance, Mr. Washington is still acting. To see why he won an Oscar and succeeded in all his acting roles He has a strong presence in this movie. <br /> <br /> Derek Luke's actor shows why he is right in the Antwone Fisher section. He shows real and engaging work. br /> <br /> Cheryl's character, Joy Bryant, is an interesting love of Antwone, similar to the sun on the screen. Chemistry circulates well between romantic characters. <br /> <br /> Novella Nelson, who plays Mrs. Tate, is a nasty character, deserves special mention. <Br / > <br /> Although we can see you for A few minutes, the actors playing Fisher's mother gave a great performance. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see ANTWONE FISHER.
