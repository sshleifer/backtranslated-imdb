This is an excellent and not very good action / drama movie. <br /> <br /> The basic story about Rob Roy's borrowing of 1,000 pounds. The theft and the problems that caused his family and by the tribe. <br /> <br /> Cunningham (Tim Roth) is an evil character and an amazing character in this story. Mercilessly cold, and if you look at his face, he seems to be able to take his eyes away and see all the evil. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy (Liam Neeson) is also great. But I think the writer uses the word "Chaloem Phra Kiat" too many times. <br /> <br /> The rest of the actors are strong and the whole movie has good performances and filming. <br /> <br /> Exciting action scenes and playing with swords Very realistic But not full of blood The story is good and you want Rob to really win. <br /> <br /> All is just a classic.
