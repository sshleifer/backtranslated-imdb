I am currently studying movies at the level of A.S and "This is not a love song" is a movie that we watch and in my opinion it is a movie with a simple story. But is a complicated story If you scratch the surface, you will find two thriller thriller movies of men running through the countryside from farmers after committing a murder: - "Sounds quite out." <br /> <br /> You have to dig deep Reveal the true feelings of the true type. As suggested, it is a love story between two lovers who are full of confidence, deception and betrayal. We are not told about this "love" directly through the movie. But the events that happen all the time, for example, the way Heaton showed to Spike, almost screaming love stories that had never been touched before. A good example of why British movies should not be considered "junk" just because they do cheaply. <br /> <br /> A good movie with a complicated story. And may not be suitable for the average fans of Hollywood movies
