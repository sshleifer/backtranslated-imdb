I just want to say that among the classic hip-hop movies I've seen like Wild Style, KrushGroove, Breakin ', Wars Style etc ... BEAT STREET IMO is best among others whenever I Ask others about what they like. It seems that BEAT STREET will emerge the most. 4.3 is just a punch "under the belt" (if talking 5 points is a belt). I like music, dance that makes me want to spin, RAMO makes me want to throw pieces ... c'mon, it's classic !!!
