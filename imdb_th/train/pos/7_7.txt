Even though I don't like Stanley & Iris very much as a movie, I admire the performance of Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro. Excellent in this movie. I'm not always a fan of Fonda's work. But here she is sensitive and strong at the same time De Niro has the ability to create every role he represents in the show of gold. He gave a great performance in this film and had a wonderful scene in which he had to take his father to the home for the elderly because he could no longer take care of him to break your heart I don't want to recommend this movie as a great movie theater entertainment. But I will say that you will not see Betts, which shows a lot.
