A very fun time set in the 30s. It is exciting in the exciting classic series, as well as "Raiders of the Lost Ark", just made on a low budget and a very direct director Michael. The opening scene has a number of Gothic art nouveau styles, which Batman was born two decades ago, starring Ron Ely (Tarzan) as a perfect actor and Pamela Hensley, as beautiful as Latina Mona in The area tagging our heroes with gold in Hidalgo, Latin America The best of our heroes goes to Mona, holding a fist on the chin as you expect him to be gentle with her and hug her: "Mona, you're a brick!" <br /> <br /> Paul Wexler's captain and Seabee Lackett and Black Hat are truly happy, expecting a few "Raiders .." which are "Batman", "The Lost World", "Lost Horizons" and a lot of vitality. And you will be correct. Be careful. Michael Berryman, who is a religious favorite, is a small part of the story. Performing and enjoying the use of the patriotic songs of John Philip Sousa, an important candidate for the DVD release. Unforgettable treatments for the whole family 9/10
