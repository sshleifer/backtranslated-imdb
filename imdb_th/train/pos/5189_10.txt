Woo's masterpiece, <br /> <br /> This is the best wuxie movie I've ever seen! Woo - RULEZ Forever (except for some Hollywood moments ...) John Woo - Great Director of the Century <br /> <br /> Maybe hi is not more intellectual than many directors. ... but he is the idol and soul of an independent spirit. <br /> <br /> His movies are like great poems! Woo is Movie Sheakspeare! Woo is Movie Biron! Woo is Mozart of Bloodshet !!!! <br /> <br /> IMHO is violent in the movie Woo is not the director's bloodthirsty But is a work of art The theme of the movie Woo is more sympathetic than a new movie.
