There is much talk about the Shinjuku Triad Society as the first movie "Miike" and I think this type of explanation may be an ancient idea. But like all ancient ideas, it depends on the truth. All Miike trademarks are here. Violence, black humor, homosexuality, forbidden tests and main characters that are hard to like. However, Shinjuku is one of Miike's most complete movies. He said in an interview that if he did it again, it would be different. But not necessarily better I think what he means is that this movie has an attractive energy and a raw edge that looks very fresh, although he may be able to capture a complex, technical or visually cinematic picture. <br /> <br /> As you would expect, the violence has been on the internal organs, blood shed and the heavy beatings being added to the scene. Prof. Chan is a woman with a chair, slammed her face. (Only Miike movies will give you the same sentence.) The film has a great rhythm, unlike the Dead or Alive that started and ended violently and approached in the middle of Dead or Alive. Miike is clearly concerned about the relationship between Japan and China in the post-war era and this emotion is well managed. Here, the main characters arrive. Switching really when you start to understand his past <br /> <br /> I can not sing the praises of Shinjuku adequately. I don't want too much. This is Miike. Before he started using CGI to create his films and almost reminiscent of something like Kitano's Sonatine, the main characters were well received and twisted. Last time, ensure that as soon as the movie is finished, you will be stimulated again to get results.
