I like this show a lot. I watched it from the first time that it aired in the late 90s until the end. In my honest opinion, it is a wonderful family drama that is very rare today. Of course, you can watch with your friends or children. Yes, everything has changed a bit with Joe since the last time we saw her in the book. But it still has interesting stories and good lessons The actor who plays Jo Bhaer (Michelle Burke) works as well as the actor who plays Nick Riley (Spencer Rochfort). Throughout the series, we will see the love between Jo and Nick that have improved. I recommend this item to everyone.
