I just watched this movie today with my children (10 year old son and daughter 4.5) at the 3rd annual Roger Ebert Film Festival. After this movie, children in the audience were allowed. Ask questions to the director of Tian-Ming Wu. He (through the translator) tells stories about his life and filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Touch each other. Enjoy the movie This unit Of course, I had to paraphrase many lectures for my daughter. But most movies describe themselves. <br /> <br /> I won't give up. But the most important thing is that this movie is better than 95% of the crap in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ps There is a King of Masks "real" / original that can / can do 12 masks at one time The actors in the movie are trained and learned to make masks up to 4 times (then they will cut and transform into 4 new masks).
