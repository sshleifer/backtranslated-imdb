Until today I have never seen this movie at all. It was filmed in the scenes of Old Dark House and Frankenstein and associated with a small Bavarian village where the giant bats predicted to suck the blood of the villagers. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this movie is good. Free atmosphere And actors who will not stop Lionel Atwill, Dwight Frye, Faye Wray and Melvin Douglas play as a character Brettschnieder Which is of interest to me since being the grandmother's maiden surname. <br /> <br /> This is a carefully adapted film with a sense of wit and cunning that is slowly created for a short time. Just wandering about ten minutes before the end, they realized that they had limited time to wrap everything. From that point to the end, it ran straight to the end with a little fun leading the page. <br /> <br /> Leonard Maltin and IMDb show the time of 71 minutes and warn of shorter typing. Wrong and in this case I think they are the source that I trust more. Saying that the full working time is 67 minutes (The Overlook Film Encyclopedia). Quibbling about this story. But because most print jobs There are usually runs about 60-63 minutes. The amount of missing material is much less if it is only 67 minutes long. Personally, I think it won't matter much because it takes no more than five minutes and I wonder if it will make or break movies. <br /> <br /> How much time does it work if you like old movies, do it all, watch this movie as a good and dark night movie?
