Rachel McAdams Cillian Murphy Wes Craven Dream Team. This is one of the best thriller movies of 2005. The plot is fantastic. A wonderful twist Great eye candy This is one of Wes Craven's biggest films, in addition to "Scream" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street". This is probably the best. The plot is one of the best things about the movie, and it's very easy. Lisa Reisert (McAdams), the hotel manager who is struggling Red Eye, goes back to LA She knew a little that she was followed by AKA Jackson Ripper, Jack the Ripper (Murphy). They had a couple of drinks and sat together on the plane. Later he revealed to her that he was an assassin sent to kill the Secreteary of Homeland Security in Lisa's hotel and this involved Lisa. She will have to move his room to the top suite so that they can bomb if she doesn't kill Ripner (Brian Cox). The twisting and applying will cause an increase in zing. And the side and side characters added Overall, one of the most exciting things in 2005 is definitely worth watching. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 from 4 stars
