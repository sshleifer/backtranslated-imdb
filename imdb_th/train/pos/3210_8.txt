The soldiers are not as bad as many people have done. I found that the film has humor that is insulting and insulting like that in Paul Verhoven's Starship Troopers. The lack of talk and top action is considered and adds to the atmosphere of comic books. <br /> <br /> No matter. One of the few important highlights for me - Todd has the name of many space war tattoos. Entering his chest and one of these fights is TANNHAUSER GATE. For those who have forgotten there, the Tannhauser gate is mentioned in the last line of Roy Batty in Blade Runner. To imagine that Todd might fight side by side with Android forces Roy is an incredible story to say the least. Maybe the author of the script, David Peoples, is a nostalgic person? <br /> <br /> I'll give this 3 out of 5
