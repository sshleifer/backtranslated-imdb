Possible spoilers - in any way "How to Alienate Friends ...." is "Losers learn to adapt to success and find other things". In the celebrity business - the end of the spoiler <br /> <br /> I don't know the original book. But this movie gives a good time Although I think the ending is flawed. It feels fast and sudden, as if something is missing. In addition, I would say that this film cannot maintain high levels. In addition to this, you will meet with actors and actresses who have sometimes debated acting qualities. Until now, I've never seen Pegg differently. But still he is a unique person. But on the screen, sometimes he might look slightly boring than necessary. Fox proves that she has the ability to play a summer star with her head in the cloud. Do not know if it is difficult to do or not But her performance is hot and better during "Transformers" (Okay ... Kirsten Dunst is Kirsten Dunst a lot (again) and you might like (like I do) or think it's annoying. On the other hand, you will see Anderson proving her acting ability and Jeff Bridges (which is ok, but maybe he has more power). They all fit. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I think it's a good comedy that has a lot less funny episodes.
