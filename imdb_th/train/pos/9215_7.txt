What did Marquis de Sade do with Egyptian archeology and mysticism? Tobe Hooper tried to answer this question in a strange little movie. <br /> <br /> Genie is a cute boy who came to visit his father. Archeology in Alexandria, Egypt Genie next to a mysterious prostitute (And overt lesbian) service providers for paternity Father is sent back to the site where he discovers a grave with what seems to be a mermaid. Genie meets the descendants of the Marquis de Sade and falls in love with the great Egyptians. Eventually, Genie finds that She will have to sacrifice and the highest point and blood blood points will continue. Surrounding this story is a picture of the Marquis de Sade in prison. Talk to a picture like Genie. <br /> <br /> Robert Englund is great, both Marquis and his descendants. His acting ability has always been refined according to his makeup requirements, so he is allowed to shine here. His best performance remains in "Killer Tongue". If you haven't seen it, <br /> <br /> The remaining actors, including the young Genie, are beautiful and ordinary. However, the script has a problem. You will quickly learn that the Marquis scene is not completely necessary, except the filmmaker may have access to a great scene. The mermaid cult that allows Genie to finally feel nothing. The mermaid does not describe anyone and links to Christianity. (Hypnotized throughout the story) There is nothing. This film is very anti-Christian, because archaeologists are the father of the Bible that burst out. But likes to bond with local prostitutes There are many bad scenes and violence. But Hooper may have a little idea about what the screenwriter is trying to say. I know I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Why do I recommend this movie? It's strange. There is an extended sex scene. For an Egyptian lady riding a completely naked horse, Englund is a wonderful person. Do you like snakes? The film is full of them. This is like Roger Corman with more budget. Hooper knew what had happened to "crocodiles". After this, it was quite sad. "Night Terrors" was not perfect. But worth the blinking and unsightly <br /> <br /> This is rated (R) for physical violence, sexual violence Sexual references and drug abuse content <br /> <br />
