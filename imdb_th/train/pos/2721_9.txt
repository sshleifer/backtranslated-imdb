True Story (happened in Kansas in 1959) Murder Case (Perry and Dick, the former two prisoners who broke into a remote house on a rainy night to steal and kill everyone they met) Richard Brooks Directing the book of Capote that is cold and uneasy about the causes that these children have to be in a criminal offense. The crime scene is cruel and haunted by the lack of senses and reasons for what we see. A beautiful black and white movie from Conrand Hall, the best country music score from Quincy Jones, an amazing performance in two main roles from Robert Blake and Scott Wilson and for the first time in a movie that comments on the death penalty. In the final stage before they die, Jones, Hall and Brooks (as director and scriptwriter) are nominated for an Academy Award. One of the best in the decade
