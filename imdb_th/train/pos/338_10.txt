I watched this movie at the Amsterdam International Documentary Festival and received the privilege of meeting with director Tobias Schneebaum, who was all lively and straightforward. The title of this film in Amsterdam is Keep the River. Your right side makes the exciting aspect of human flesh eating quite distinctive. Equally important is Tobias Nebomaruk and Gaidar having relationships with members of the group that he studied as an anthropologist. His integration at almost 80 years of age and the inevitable resignation are moving a lot. I can recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for an animated story that is anything but a footpath.
