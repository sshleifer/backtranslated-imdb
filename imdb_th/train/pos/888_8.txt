One of the better kung fu movies But not as flawless as I expected from a fervent opinion The movie begins well with jokes that translate to language barriers. (Which is harder to find than you think today) and create discrete conversations (For Kung Fu movies, this is a good compliment) which is different from other Chinese action movies, which are often in the modern era or in the police drama Jackie Chan of Jackie Chan's police. current Unfortunately, in the latter part of 1/3 of the film, it requires violence in the tragic tragedy, which I think is not necessary. <br /> <br /> The action is overall good, with a duel between Sammo and 1 / 2 of Shaw Brothers, only 2 stars. Kar-Leung Lau. Then, the final battle with the tall man who always plays the bad guy of Jet Li. There is a 20 minute fight here which is standard But what annoyed me was the acceleration of the camera frame. I received that they had to shoot half the speed to avoid harming each other. But there is a smooth correction and this thing really is away from the fight when it is clearly a messy picture. <br /> <br /> Saying that if you like kung fu movies, my opinion here. Will not offend you and if you don't You just wasted 2 minutes reading this message.
