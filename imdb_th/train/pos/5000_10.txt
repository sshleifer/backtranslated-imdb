The comfort of living things in America should be published in other networks, or at least given the opportunity to have a full episode. Unfortunately this is not the case. States that American audiences (seemingly) are interested in gnats when it comes to jokes that do not include profanity, vulgarity or enchantment with scatological functions (both sound and smell). As such, it is small and far between one of the main problems is that it's great. But it was created for a hard-to-know audience who knows what to expect But received an audience from the audience and the board room without any clue about what they watched Which is sad but unexpected. I like to see at least three seasons of this program, although it was created for direct DVD release The content and interaction between living things is rich in sub-contexts and there are other conversations waiting under the surface. But thanks to political correctness, such conversations only occurred in my heart
