This may not be the best movie ever. But overall, it's a fun and lively game where everyone involved seems to have a good time. Highly recommended for the good feeling factor alone. Okay, so Frank Sinatra's performance is very much needed. But his singing is a great redemption Sinatra continues to make many other films that his acting abilities shine through. But in this regard, his first venture in Hollywood, his voice is not his performance. I just watched it again on the TV and it also raised my mood like the first time I saw it many years ago
