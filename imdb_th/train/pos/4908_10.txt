I saw Martin's day for the first time when I was only 10 years old at home in the movie channel and still remember the impact that had on my life. It makes me feel as if there is no other movie to catch me and I remember my eyes. <br /> <br /> After the first time I saw it, I couldn't find it anywhere else. I would ask around. And no one has heard of this! I think it's one of those rare movies that many people don't know because nobody and I mean that nobody knows what I'm talking about. I searched and checked over the years, checked the shelves of video stores and scanned cable TV programs, but it was often short-lived. In 1996, I found that I could order specials. I made and probably watched at least 50. Since - and it still makes me cry every time <br /> <br /> Martin's day is about Martin Steak Kurt, a man in prison (But a really good man) who wishes to return to the special lake he grew up from as a child This is a special place where he lives outside of nature, spending time with his dog and being left alone to enjoy life. Soon he escaped and began to travel back to the lake. <br /> <br /> Not long before the police found him and Steckert took the kid as a hostage to convince the police to come back. Steckert and the hostages soon His (Martin 2) became the best friend and had many fun adventures, including robbing a toy truck to a high-speed train to a special lake. <br /> <br / > Throughout the picture Steckert has a great past event at the lake when he was a child. <br /> <br /> I won't destroy your ending. But I will tell you that this movie must watch It's the best movie I've ever seen in my life! I'm the biggest fan of this movie ever! I find songs that Martin has two songs singing throughout the story. ("I will go back to where I came from ...) I also plan to travel to Canada to see the lakes and cottages at Martin. The filming day is crazy. I know - but that movie is very meaningful to me.
