Can watch movies only a few years later, almost 60 years, but still this movie Technological advances are not dated to this classic love story. The special technique used was outstanding for the 1946 film. The performance was excellent. David Niven, Kim Hunter and especially Roger Livesey performed outstanding work using black and white / color to add to the movie. It has never been seen on television for 20 years, so there are few people who realize its existence. It's my favorite movie of all time. Waiting and hoping to be released this DVD movie for many years on its own. "The Story of Life and Death"
