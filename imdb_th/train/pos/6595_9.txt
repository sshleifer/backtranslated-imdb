I accidentally borrowed this movie from a friend. I didn't know about it and it became a remarkable documentary about traveling on an ancient ship across the vast ocean. Thor Heyerdahl developed the theory that ancient Incas in Peru could travel thousands of miles across. The ocean goes to Polynesia according to some relics found in both places. Some ancient sea vessels that we know are Analysis of ocean currents and wind currents and the knowledge that the Incas do in reality travel in unspecified quantities at sea. <br /> <br /> To test his hypothesis, Heer Dahl and His crew As far as possible with what the ancient Inca people had to use, only the balsa wood and other materials that existed at that time and departed from Lima, the capital city of Peru, to go to Polynesia. About 5,000 miles away, his theory is like ancient history, it is impossible to prove with 100% confidence, but the coverage of their journey is fully supported. That he is correct This film is more than a description of a picture taken over 100 days, but it is a detailed explanation of what it is and the trials and tribulations they face. I always hope that the Oscar-winning feature film is easier to find, and this story from 50 years ago is still interesting and informative, because I'm confident it was when it was released. first
