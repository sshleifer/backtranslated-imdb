This is a great movie for fans of Hong Kong action movies. In addition to a small story, a weak and funny comedy, this movie is full of action, gun-fighting and martial arts. Help me enjoy from beginning to end. I think Shannon Lee is a great person in the movie. <br /> <br /> Having an action director like Corey Yuan is what makes Hong Kong still strong. This modern action movie is highly recommended !!
