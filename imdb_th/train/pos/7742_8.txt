Intense actors like Bruce Dern, Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward gathered to make the new film noir a winner. In those three people, I don't know who is the most interesting person because everyone has good performances and interesting characters. <br /> <br /> Patric described this story in this noir. Wow, that only one person made for interesting men! He looks stupid, but not a wartime conspiracy, attractive, clever and compassionate for a bad kidnapping plan. Bruce Dern is still in the mix and Dern has never been obsessed with the film Any <br /> <br /> This movie may look boring for the average audience. Do not like movies that fall as normal What I found was a strange crime movie. Check and see if you agree. This is an unknown movie that should not have this status because it is good and well done.
