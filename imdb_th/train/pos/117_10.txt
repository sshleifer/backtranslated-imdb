Lars von Trier's Europa is a valuable resonance of The Third Man about Americans who arrived after World War II, Europe and found themselves involved in dangerous mysteries. <br /> <br /> Jean-Marc Barr, played by Leopold Kessler, a German-American who refused to join the US Army during the war, arrived in Frankfurt as soon as the war ended to work with his uncle as a sleeper on the Zentropa train. It is the war still continues secretly to an underground terrorist group known as the werewolf, which is the goal of the American League. Leopold resists adherence to any party. But was pulled in and tempted by Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukawa), the daughter of the train company owner. Her father is a Nazi sympathizer. But was forgiven by Colonel Harris (Eddie Considine) because he could help the German transport system to work again Soon, Colonel enlists or forces Leopold to be a spy. (Without giving him a choice or an opportunity to think about it) to see that the werewolf might attack on the train. <br /> <br /> Soon Leopold Stuck in an adventure that involves both sides of the conflict in a mysterious way and the movie Noir-Ish, which everyone and everything is not what looks like It was amazing to see Leopold innocent dealing with everything. (His lover, a terrorist, a colonel, an annoying passenger, his unhappy uncle, even a train company officer who came to check his work ethics) before he was in trouble to control. The film is unpredictable. br /> <br /> This film is filmed in style. It usually happens at night in the winter with a lot of snow. Shoot black and white images with random colors throughout. In addition, the background screen displays images that respond to actions with the front image. Add the hypnotic subtitles of Max von Sydow and Europa become a dream place that is different from this world. <br /> <br /> Now it's my favorite movie.
