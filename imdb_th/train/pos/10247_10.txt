This movie has been banned in almost every country that I think of Japanese people (?) Who are stars in this film. I have to despair of working or we are just friends. Three people tortured hell from an unprofitable woman. They used everything to kill her. Finally, they burned her, kicked her, turned here around the chair (more than 200 times!). (By forcing her to listen to the constant sound for more than 20 hours! It sounds bad. But it makes you crazy (Probably from the animal) at her as she knocked out and she was surprised when she woke up And who will forget the great ending of EYEBALL, the greatest torture I have ever seen! <br /> <br /> If you haven't heard of these things before! (Just ask Charlie Sheen) This is guaranteed to make people strange and sick! Like I say pure underground Check if you are a fan of underground horror or foreign blood. If not, I suggest you read the series before you watch! From the shocking and creative aspects, it gets 10 but from the story and what it is 1 underground classic ... <br /> <br /> My final score is 8/10. <br />
