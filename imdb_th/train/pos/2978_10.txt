BASEketball is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It is a film outside the wall starring South Park creator Matt Stone and Trey Parker. They play with two lazy friends who create their street sports. Most jokes are funny. But the most funny part of the movie is when the player tries to "psyche-out" the other members of the opposing team. There are no rules about things that are not allowed, so naturally they do the most crazy things possible. One of the shortcomings of this movie is that the pace is too fast, and after about half an hour, I find myself asking Another hilarious part of the movie is the way Joe and Doug harass Squeak continuously, which is a small man with frustration !
