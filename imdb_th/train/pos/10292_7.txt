Let me start by saying that I'm a big fan of Carrey. Although I admit that I didn't see all of his movies. * Ai * Mage * Ai * Bruce Almighty is a fun person. There are no other reviews that really come in. How wonderful it is to the end. I don't know what writers are thinking. In any way, I can't help but feel that this movie is a bad attempt to create a new Liar Liar. <br /> <br /> In a positive light, Steve Correl from the Daily Daily shows that it is important. And be the rest of the actors. See Bruce Almighty if you are a big fan of Jim Carrey, or if you just want to see a soft piano (funny, piano, piano) funny
