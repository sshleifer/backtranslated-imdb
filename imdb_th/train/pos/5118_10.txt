******** Spoiler - Beware ********* <br /> <br /> What can I say? I'm biased when talking about Urban Cowboy. I love it and watch it countless times - and always discover new things about it and each look. <br /> <br /> I think one thing I like. About it is Urban Cowboy is a matter of working people. Not rich people living in LA or New York It's true, except for Pam. <br /> <br /> Travolta plays a small town boy in Texas who moves to Houston to work in the oil field. And this is when Travolta actually plays in a good drama like Saturday Night Fever instead of being a bad person / stereotype in a big movie This is a really good movie - mechanical bull riding and two-stage dancing may be ridiculous. But you have to enjoy it in what it is. <br /> <br /> Bud meets Sissy (played by Debra Winger with a lot of smartness) - and soon after they married and lived in the sample The road But their relationship became a real life battle of sex Bud wants to be a true cowboy. The sister wants to be with a real cowboy. But in modern times, the role of men is not clear. Bud can prove that he is a real person or not? He can do dangerous work every day and ride a mechanical cow at night - he can be "Cowboy in town", but Sissy wants to drive his pick-up truck and she wants to ride mechanical bulls as well. So this thing will let the shoots When Sissy insists on her independence, she lied about riding a cow and flirting with a former rodeo and prison-real cowboys - West (played by Scott Glenn, amazingly fantastic) Bud Threatened and Bud and Sissy broke up The sister came by the trailer to clean - Pam didn't do that. She wrote a makeup letter to Bud. But the evil Pam tore it up and received credit for Sissy's house work. <br /> <br /> Uncle Bob, Bud of Bud, died tragically at work when there was light and caused an explosion. Bud and Sissy have a chance to be compromised. But too stubborn Later, the mechanical riding race at Gilley's and you know that Bud is going to win, Pam realizes that Bud doesn't love her, but Sissy - he did it for her. West tries to rob Gilleys, but don't you know that the city cowboy, Bud saved all day and beat the girl he loved? <br /> <br /> Of course, you might ask yourself why Bud and Sissy arrived. Go to Gilleys about every night and "There is life like a pig." Maybe that makes their bad marriage. Or why Bud isn't with Pam - she's not bad and has money Or why they have to kill Uncle Bob Or why Bud and Sissy have stupid friends like Marshall and Jesse who always try to separate them: Marshall says to Bud, "You {Sissy} ride that bull better than you!" But part of The fun of Urban Cowboy is making it a little fun - and saying that it's not Bonnie Ratt on the stage!
