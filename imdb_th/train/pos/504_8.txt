Okay, the latest history of Star Trek is still not good. The next generation faded away in the past few seasons. DS9 is in a place where no one has lived before and the world is getting worse and never fulfilling the promise. So when they announced the new Star Trek series, I didn't expect high, and at first, Broken Bow had some problems. But overall it is a stable trek and a good run. <br /> <br /> I'll get rid of the crowd first. The open theme is boring and I don't expect to sit on a regular basis. But that is what the remote is for The really bad thing is the completely free lotion rub that drove my wife out of the room. They have to cut the nonsense. <br /> <br /> But the plot is strong and moves well. Although the characters are still new But it looks harmonious and not as you would expect. The Vulcans have a distinctly different expression in a slightly ominous form. I especially like linguists who are the first Star Trek characters who can't be proud of the face of death. But must cope with her fear and fear It seems that they will remain with the legend of Trek. What is a major problem in the previous series, though they have plenty of time to bring things like shooting through armor, inventing technology that can fix anything. Right away Time travel stories Everyone wants to start the pool before Borg appears. <br /> <br /> All sets have enormous potential. They saw the universe with bright eyes. We have the opportunity to learn that things are going on as in the next series. How can Klingon go from contempt to war? How do we find the Romans? How does the federation form and who makes the world responsible? Why are important commands important? If they talk about these things more than when separating the time travel, this will be an interesting series. <br /> <br /> My favorite line: Zephram Cochran says "No one goes anywhere" ( Not "no one")
