The 1960s TV series Bewitched owes the idea of ​​this movie. This is a movie that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak made immediately after they starred in Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock. This movie is not a fascinating thing. But Novak is a lovely story. <br /> <br /> This movie is Jack Lemmon's 10th movie, and he gives good support as well as Ernie Kovacs. This movie has good things. Much about this, Hermine Gingold is very good in this movie, almost good enough to support her like in The Music Man. The actor is very strong. <br /> <br /> The film has a feeling that New York City during The end Century 1950 & Cat is an adorable cat-like in all films. It's worth watching because it is a love story full of emotions & little magic too. <br /> <br /> It's not Vertigo, but I think because it follows the movie. that Gave a good score as it should be - sure that William Asher was so happy that the series of 1960s were created I'm not happy that Will Ferrell did something about it on the big screen. This movie is much better than that.
