So Fox pulled the plug in the middle through the drama / mystery ... <br /> <br /> So? Do they expect us to invest our time on their new list when there is a real risk that never knows what has happened? Why did the remaining episodes not be filmed when aired in the United States? They broadcast elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Hey Fox! Are you listening? This is a great performance. But you let us hang If you are going to present a new drama / puzzle, at least it must be finalized before ending in the middle theme. Every time this happens (And seems to be happening to you a lot - like Fox) There are people who will "wait and see" more before deciding to take Which means you will see a low interest share and tend to end the series? It is a vicious circle Do not disappoint us again ...
