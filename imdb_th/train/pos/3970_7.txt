This is a movie that seems to be about J.Edgar Hoover, who gave himself a big fight in Klansmen, following an Indian killer chasing the famous thugs in the 1930s, fighting with the Nazis in the United States. America during World War 2 and Commies in New York in the early 1950s. Of course, in 1959, we didn't know about Hoover's obsession with keeping secret files about honest Americans by tricking people like Martin Luther King, Jr. But the worst is If you want to know more about this, I suggest watching the movie Citizen Cohn). Hoover, apart from the story of life in the FBI told by Jimmy Stewart, makes a good movie, but the date Vera Miles as his dedicated wife. It is also good. But Jimmy is the only movie that Hoover controls the production and makes sure that the FBI is without errors. Jimmy Stewart gave the film a human side. The success was quite considerable considering that Hoover always looked at his shoulder. The background score is also good. I have read the latest online articles that suggest that this is a forgotten movie. Jimmy Stewart is one of the greatest movie stars of all time and shouldn't forget his movies. TCM is the last network to be shown long ago and I hope they will perform again.
