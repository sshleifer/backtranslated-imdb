I think this is a very charming movie centered on Mary-Kate's life and the characters of Sam and Emma Stanton! They both tried to make themselves and their parents happy but; Unfortunately it's not easy for them to do! I think this is the most charming and captivating movie, and if you're a real fan of these great women, I'm sure you'll agree with me here If you haven't watched this movie, I said you really missed it. Big time and you should take the time to see it now! This movie is a real winner! Sincerely, Rick Morris
