'' The Sentinel '' is one of the best horror movies created in the film industry! I think it's very scary because there are very few movies. Alison Parker is a famous model. She met a lawyer named Michael Lerman and one of the best friends, called Jennifer. Everything was wonderful in her life until she decided to live alone and rent a beautiful and old apartment. > <br /> The problem is that her neighbors are very strange people. Suddenly Alison began to have health problems and fainted with frequency. She remembers some painful facts about her past that made her have nightmares or illusions. But everything is reasonable and related to the new house she lives ... <br /> <br /> I found that '' The Sentinel '' is a very creepy movie and with '' The Exorcist '' They are the two most scary movies I've watched. When we discovered that Alison's house was occupied by the priests and my blood was frozen! It is also scary to see that she wants to become blind at the end of the movie in order to be a new guard to make the monster out of our world.
