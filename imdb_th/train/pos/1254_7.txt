Ed Harris's work in this film is based on his usual standard of excellence, that is, he stole the screen away from anyone he shared and including the formidable Sean Connery. This film, which is more moral, will be more lively in the scene in which Harris was interviewed by a lawyer for other suspects. It is an amazing story that is a master of art control. <br /> <br /> All other actors, experts and Connery are as reliable as Fishbourne. Evidence that black prisoners will be attacked and intimidated by white law enforcement officers This is the engine that drives the story, whether right or wrong, and makes it feel deceived at the end. <br /> <br /> Still worth seeing Harris in action.
