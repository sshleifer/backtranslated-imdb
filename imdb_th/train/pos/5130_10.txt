... may seem like an overstatement, but it's not. <br /> <br /> What is difficult to understand is - why don't they make these kinds of shorts? Is the beauty of it clear for everyone involved? I guess not. Many shorts are created for commercial reasons only and with some luck there may be artistic value there. This is one exception - only one? - It seems that they are visionary directors and can appreciate music as art clearly. Why doesn't anyone think of shooting Leicester or Charlie Parker in live performances? <br /> <br /> <br /> Unfortunately If you've seen similar qualities, please share!
