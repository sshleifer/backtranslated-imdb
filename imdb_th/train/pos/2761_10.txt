I saw this movie for the first time on my way home from Paris to Newark on Air France in August 1996. This movie I believe is a masterpiece. It's a type of movie that people should do. I still think that Daniel Auteuil is one of the sexiest actors. In this French film, he plays a divorced father and a businessman who has lost all his life for fun until he meets a Down Syndrome man who lives in an educational institution with Down syndrome Actors, including actors with down syndrome, create friendships and a convincing relationship between these two men. Daniel's life and our change forever with Down syndrome men He realizes that life is not just working and not playing. But for life and love and that is what life should be The ending is quite stupid. But I still think it's one of my favorite movies Enough to make your tears
