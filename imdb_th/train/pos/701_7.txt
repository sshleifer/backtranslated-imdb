I don't know what to exclude, so I think it's better than nothing. Don't understand me wrong, it's not a bad short film. Tess Nanavati is a relatively new director and writer, so I think she deserves a lot of appreciation from making this movie You can tell that it's a love for her. The performance (outside the Dominican) is a small matter and the quality of the movie is not as great as well. But for movies with low budget There are times when the story is confused and there are some parts that drag around, even though I don't feel that it will negatively affect the ability to understand movies. If you love Dominic Monaghan as much as I do, I can say it. Fun gag hoops, I will not spoil. But there are some scenes that make buying a DVD worth just so you can watch over and over again. If you like movies, watch The Pink Mirror, a movie made by Jagged Edge. I know that Dominic's fans will enjoy this little piece of paradise.
