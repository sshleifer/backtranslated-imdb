I can say that I feel the movie in the correct essence, which the game of thinking from the dream of reality enters the surreal aspect of Tom Cruise. In the future, I am not very interested in Tom Cruise's performance. But I have to say that it seems that he will make an impression at every point in the movie ... not just because of the interesting story .. They merge and speak and it's beautiful. However, I must say that this movie does not come under "Flick the average weekend" which you choose randomly and look happily; It has strong feelings and characters, so don't wash it with your beer and popcorn. It certainly needs more.
