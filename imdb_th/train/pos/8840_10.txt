Watching before the devil is considered to be one of the best experiences in the cinema. I was fascinated by the various responses to this film, and for me, the extremes of opinion indicate that the film was exposed to something that was either accepted or rejected by the general audience. It is one of those movies that is with me and I ponder and think about it anyway. <br /> <br /> Of course, the DVD will give more clarity about the themes and elements of making more movies, right? Which includes: Sidney Lumet's comeback movie, the time-changing technique used in storytelling, the excellent combination of Lumet and Masterson and why it works well, expert direction, movie Holly Wood, a rare focus on male characters. Struggling to be an open checkbook for their women But the performance of Marisa Tomeang Kong Kong and of course, Hoffman is excellent, with a central speech about the sum of parts - for me, the heart of this film <br /> <br /> Wow! Of course, it is a movie that specializes. Imagine the disappointment of seeing enthusiastic DVDs - just to find no criticism, no background, no special interview. <br /> <br /> Hey - distributor - sort!
