It's an excellent American martial arts movie. The fight scenes are quite impressive for American movies in the 90s. Of course, the fighting scenes are not as good as in the Honk Kong movie. Actually, only a few American movies have a good fight scene, as in the Honk Kong movie. today When you watch America's martial arts movies, you expect to see less impressive fighting scenes. But still having a good attitude, which is sometimes surprising, or at least what I expect from these movies I was impressed with this movie. Some of the fighting scenes are really impressive, showing the direction and plot is good, so it's worth it to watch a movie if you really like American fighting movies in the 90s.
