The world is a scary place. But this movie is funny and fun And if you don't like it ... you don't understand ... and if you don't understand ... it doesn't matter, it's up to you if you want to play Every actor in this has fun. It's just a joke. And that was good enough for me. Gabriel Byrne had no value. Byrne and Paul Anka were doing MY WAY while "Vic" put it "... the best version ever." Ok ... It's not a masterpiece, but Not bad. I was warned not to see. But I'm glad I did ...
