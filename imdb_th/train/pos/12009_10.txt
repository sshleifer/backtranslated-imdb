I think they work. * Excellent * Nothing wrong. I don't know how the first critic said that it was terrible. It caused me to tear. (I guess it makes everyone tears) but I try not to cry in the movie because it's embarrassing. But this one makes me It's a good thing SOOO! I hope they will be released on DVD because I will definitely buy a copy! I felt like I had renewed my faith and gave me hope that I could not explain that I wanted to be a better person. They passed a lot and we accepted it. Compared to that I felt that our own experiments were nothing but nothing, but they were almost exactly what they had to do. I liked it. Who played Emma!
