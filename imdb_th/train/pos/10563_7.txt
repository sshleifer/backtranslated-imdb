Wow ... What ... 30s whirlwind is a decade with all kinds of movies that I can imagine, especially during the first part of the conversation. There are painful and boring movies such as "Dracula" with Bella Lugosi and there are some things that do not rest. Sometimes it is a good way. This is one of the movies that didn't stop for just one minute and that was both a miracle and a shame. Lloyd Bacon, director of "42nd Street", must be the king of the musical era of the economic downturn and he may be excited about the possibility that The sound leads to the world of movies because he fills this image. Must not have a full minute or two without music or people say it is crazy! I think this movie deserves 5 (or 6 ranks) because the pacing is terrible because it's so crazy and sometimes I don't know what happened and what I think. The characters seem to run back and forth, talking about things that don't care about me, and maybe nobody else. I think I will be rewarded with a little headache. I noticed that Lloyd Bacon also brought the actress in "42nd Street", Ruby Keeler and "42nd Street" as a movie with the ending as the best part of it. And you know what? It happens the same way as "Footlight Parade"! The ending is incredible! It has become the most impressive musical instrument I've ever seen. The last part shows us the musical numbers and believes that what makes me see the rest of the movie Impeccable numbers! There are three large bits, and the most impressive is the second. Suddenly the screen was filled with beautiful camera work and creating beautiful people and ordinary entertainment that made me forget my little headache.
