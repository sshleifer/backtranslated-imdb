I almost never met a movie that made me have to talk about it immediately. This film is the best entertainment available and of course is genuine. I accidentally saw the dub version. But now I'm going to grab a DVD remaster with traditional Chinese dialogue. Even so, rebel did not come in and sometimes made a serious funny humor: "Poison Clan shook the world!" <br /> <br /> The storytelling is still true for the Chinese plot. And interpersonal relationships You can expect to be twisted and rotated when revealing the identity of the five toxins and stepping on the pace. <br /> <br /> Dance moves, martial arts are in their own classes and Must believe It's like seeing real animals fighting. But was interpreted from his own martial arts style The level of such talent among the performers is unparalleled in modern cinema. <br /> <br /> Seriously creating ancient Chinese culture and I would like to recommend only the true intentions of the movie. This story tells the story of the fight. The story, art and expertise of the operation ... Of course, if you just want to see people punching with the brutal form of ancient Chinese torture as my guest!
