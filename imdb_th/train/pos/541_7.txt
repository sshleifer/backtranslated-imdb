This is not a bad movie. Actually, I like it more than the first movie. I find it more entertaining. It looks like it's a documentary style that was filmed. At first it made me annoyed because I thought it was low. too But it makes me look better and makes the movie look more realistic. This movie has one dry liners more than the original, which is a good thing in my opinion. I think sometimes they go up on top. With some scenes and characters, it almost became a joke of their own, which may be at least a point, this movie has some skepticism, which first did not have, in my view, it had something as good as together Music from the original, which is excellent. Performing again is quite good for most. But as I said, some of the songs seem to be on top. I still feel that the movie loses momentum until the end. A few minutes, which seems very slow and doesn't seem to flow like any other movie overall. Although I think this is a fairly good sequel, the y rating for "Return to Cabin by the Lake" is 7/10 *.
