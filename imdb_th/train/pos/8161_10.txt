When I saw the dentist, I thought it was great. But this movie is not suitable for everyone, especially those who do not like the scene that is full of blood, because the dentist has a lot of blood-staged scenes. That's why it's got R18 rating. It's about dentists. Dr. Alan Finestone, who found that his wife, Brooke, was unfaithful to the homeless. It's best to go to the dentist "first". You see this, but if you don't like going to the dentist, it's best not to look at it because you may be laid off for life. The dentist has the best revenge I've ever seen. Who ever saw a movie with a dentist (spoiler) pulling the cheating wife's teeth and cutting her tongue out without doping? Great snapshot, flick But not for everyone
