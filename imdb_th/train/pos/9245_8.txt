Jean Harlow and Clark Gable are great screen teams and this may be their best movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, Holdman can smile and anticipate. Can guess But that's not what I love about movies. I like to see Harlow and Gable together and in this movie they are great. Obviously they really enjoy working together and being a part of what makes this movie a great story. <br /> <br /> A brilliant dialogue, great script and attention to detail. Fine is the other thing. Movies. I love this movie for the first time I see it and in each look I will always notice new details at least once. For me, it's a sign of great movies. <br /> <br /> Better dialogue and script than most movies during this period (early 30s). I love classic movies. But I agree that most are just average and sometimes not interested. Hold Your Man is one exception. <br /> <br /> This involves the fact that Hold Your Man is a 'pre-code' movie. (Hays code is not enforced until one year after the Hold Your Man) This movie cannot be created under the code. It can be created But it will be a completely different matter Thank you for not enforcing the code until 1934, otherwise we will miss this gem.
