Someone said about Nathaniel Hawthorne that his failure was more interesting than his success. I believe that the same words may be suitable for pictures of McDonald-Eddy And in particular, this <br /> <br /> Obviously it has many features of the failed movie: it is a kit, script, because of censorship, sounds inconsistent ?? But this movie still has a good score: Rodgers-Hart's good song ("I'm married to an angel", "Tira tira tira la"), a good performance with EEHorton and Reginald Owen <br /> <br / > However, if you don't like it, you can't forget it.

Whether good or bad If you want to see it like you will see the dream
