I saw Saving Grace as soon as it came out in the video. Since then, it became one of my favorites! The story is not particularly complicated. But not away from entertainment It has a funny and impressive quality. The character is what makes this movie very good. They each have their own strange qualities which add humor to the two old women played by Linda Kerr Scott and Philida. Great performances performed by everyone, especially Brenda Bilten. She and Craig Ferguson are very good at pulling out fun moments. If you are looking for a good comedy movie, I would definitely recommend this movie!
