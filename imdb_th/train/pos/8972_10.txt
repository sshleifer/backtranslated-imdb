My discovery of Jan Svankmajer's cinema made me open with all the Czech movements that Jir√≠ Trnka pioneered. His Ruka is one of the best and most animated animated movies. <br /> <br /> Potter woke up and watered his plants. Then he went to make a pot. But in a large hand that caused a pot problem and demanded that Potter create his own statue He threw his hand out. But soon he returned and imprisoned him in a bird cage, in which he was forced to stone He put it in the wind from exhaustion. <br /> <br /> In the order of the great metacinema, Potter uses candles to burn the visible puppet, which makes him excited, fleeing home. He closes himself and is killed by accident. By his beloved plant, when it fell on his head. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't hide the fact that it is pure animation?) For example, the hand is the hand of Someone in the glove clearly the Everything else is clay The string can be seen and is part of the narrative, making it the precursor of the movie string. The creepy atmosphere: that hand after the little potter potter dealt with fear in me more than many horror films combined. <br /> <br /> This film is obvious. It is a story about artistic freedom and dictatorship which cannot help to win the hearts and minds of anyone who holds freedom as natural rights.
