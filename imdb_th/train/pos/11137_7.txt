The Midnight Cowboy was very annoying when it was released in 1969 by giving the X rating. According to today's standards, it would be difficult to draw R ratings. Joe Buck outside the city wants to make it big with women in New York City. He met a street businessman named Ratso Rizzo, who tried to make friends with Buck for his own purposes. In the end, they both moved the bond that was both touching and pathetic. As Ratto, Dustin Hoffman shines. Hoffman is always good. But not more than to describe He is a person who has a habit like everyone else around. Losing the Academy Award for John Wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Director Schlessinger has a good hand in his production But this movie has a rough weakness which makes it taste bad in the audience's mouth Worth to see Hoffman's performance alone
