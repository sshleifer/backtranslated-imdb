One of the most witty and distorted people I have ever seen Christopher Reeve and Micheal Caine is great and I have to go through all the stories. <br /> <br /> The high-level parts and props make sense Reaching the atmosphere of litigation The simple feeling is applicable to both images. <br /> <br /> The only thing I complain about is not on the film. But the lack of widescreen movies on DVD I own the full screen version. (Which proves that I love movies enough to withstand the full screen presentation) but the Deluxe or 'special' versions are great to get the money of course
