When I saw this movie, I was fascinated by what it was a great movie. This is the only film I think I will give you 10 stars. I'm sure this movie will be in my 5th position. <br /> <br /> The performance is great. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett are good. At the end I don't think anyone will work better than Kate. <br /> <br /> If it's a rainy day and you can't decide what to rent, this is a good day. You will love showing special effects and more. <br /> <br /> If you haven't watched this movie for rent or buy now !!! You will not regret. <br /> <br />
