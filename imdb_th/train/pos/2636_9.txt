The Lion King series is a great success in the original Disney Lion King animation. It is the greatest masterpiece in cel Lion King II animation: Simba's pride is BY FAR. Of the best direct videos that Disney or other studios have created for animation features It deserves the drama release. The same can be said for this film. It has original actors, Elton John's songs, hilarious stories, exciting actions and impressive moments. Everything you expect from this series Not very new. But fill it up and expand the background in Timon and Pumbaa and their place in this story The thing that impressed me most was the attention in animation. Often Disney shorts are about the animation quality of video and television efforts. But here they blend new animation with videos from the original movie smoothly. Scenes never appear outside the venue. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella are full of Timon and Pumbaa. Matthew Broderick, Robert Guillame and Moira Kelly repay their roles as Simba, Rafiki and Nala respectively. We have also been returned. Visit by Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin. As hyenas, there are many laughs in this movie. So if you love Lion King, you want this movie. The story is incomplete without it.
