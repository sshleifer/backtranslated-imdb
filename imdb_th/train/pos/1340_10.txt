This documentary is interesting, but it's long (very long, including 225 minutes) like Ben Hur. But if it's yours, this is what you need. But if you have a passion for movies like me Martin Scorsese is my favorite director. (Living and probably forever) this thing is very interesting Because you can understand where he was inspired by many of his films Not the best documentary film ever created But it is a leap for Scorsese, which is always good to watch.
