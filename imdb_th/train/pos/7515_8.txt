I have known Bettie Page for many years. Her pornography in the 1950s has become a portrait and still is a strong drawing. Even today, "Betty Page" still remains highly popular in the world. Different amulet and still stand out today as it used to be. So I watched this movie with a little familiarity to begin with. The result is not disappointing. <br /> <br /> Above all, it's really fun to see the real numbers of movies such as Irving Klaw, John Willie and Bunny Yeager. Consider the trailblazers today. Mary Harron Worked perfectly in creating an atmosphere that required sexual oppression and hypocrisy in America in 1950, along with the sexuality that follows today's standards. I like the use of black and white and color as a visual shorthand for the emotional and spiritual climate. Bettie finds himself. <br /> <br /> I think Gretchen Mol works great in presenting the characters of Bettie in her sexuality, innocence and all her innocence Betty loves to look beautiful, love attention, see what's wrong with nudity and enjoy dressing up in "stupid outfits" for sex-based cameras and the profound fetish needs are all missing from her. To this day, she still doesn't understand "What all the fuss about" when it comes to her pictures or their S&M content <br /> <br /> This is not to say that you are not educated or too easy to Understand that just she doesn't "understand" about superstition and won't do it without harm. Betty Page is the person she is. The film was quite good. <br /> <br /> The social atmosphere of the 1950s written by Ms. Harron and written by her with Guinevere Turner made me really happy that I lived both day and age. I do The hypocrisy and oppression combined with tremendous stupidity about our sexuality all merged with a horrible world. This film captures this well and brings the acclaim like Betty, enduring everything with unshakable faith and unwavering innocence. <br /> <br /> The film is quite slow in sometimes They are very good I would like to introduce this film, even for those who do not know who Betty Page is and what impact it has on American culture. For those who have such interest, this movie must be watched.
