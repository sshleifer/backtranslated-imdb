When I reached the "back" of 35, I found myself shaking my head more and more at the sex-crazed teenage craze of today's influence. It's a great story that has been warned that it's crazy for me today. This film pushes the house into the core. If you are a 70s fan, you will love this movie from KISS posters to Angel concerts. <br /> <br /> Look at the kids. Laura Dern Why don't they have more songs from the homeless people I don't know? <br /> <br /> I have a problem with Randy Quaid's character, causing the 16-year-old girl to leave while he is away. She and her friends have a party that destroys the house of friends. The police came and everything But not to mention the underage drinking and how these children get these things. <br /> <br /> The fox is there with Over the Edge, Fast Times, Dazed & Confused. In an angry teen, <br /> <br /> I say buy it and watch with your children and talk about it all.
