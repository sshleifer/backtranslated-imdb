This is one of the strangest movies I have watched recently. That's because it seems less than movies and others like experimental movies. Kurazawa's experiment is to receive a variety of people who live in the garbage dump and weave their experiences in textiles. Not every episode of the Great Depression But overall, this is an exact tone. Let's see ... We have incest / rape, attempted murder, wife exchange, alcoholism, infidelity, the death of a little boy after eating fish. Stained, men with severe depression (He has never spoken in horrible movies.) A desperate dreamer who is diagnosed with schizophrenia, a mentally retarded young man who thinks he is the driver of a car on the road and takes a waking moment "Drive on his road through the path amidst a garbage dump. (I think I like your character even a little more than rape people!) Tend to deal with mental illness and despair of life Is it strange that after creating this film, Kurasawa tried to commit suicide ?! So i like it No, it's not a fun experience. But it was a very well-made movie that definitely attracted me and as a result I wanted to see what happened to these people. It's like watching a train wreck - you don't want to see all the killings. But you can't help but see! From the whole article, I think the old man is always looking for everyone and doesn't seem to suit anyone. (He is too well adapted and too smart to live in a garbage dump). Perhaps this means being a representative of Kurazawa. Maybe. I look. <br /> <br /> If you've seen movies Kurazawa is a wide variety and has a high tolerance for strange art movies. However, don't make this your first experience in watching his movies - of course, that will make many viewers scared!
