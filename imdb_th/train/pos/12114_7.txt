Obviously, this film has a low budget & filmed in British Columbia, Canada. Obstacles that must be overcome to make this film reliable. (Located in California and the late 60's 80s) Feel good. I believe this is the best and most accurate version of the zodiac killing that caused Vallejo & the Bay from 1968-19 (he never was caught). James Olmos (Det. Dave Toschi) and George Dzundza (Zodiac - at that time believed that Arthur Leigh Allen, since DNA & fingerprints were cleared) played the cat & mouse game. Each scene was trying to motivate others. Entering an emotional revelation, Oman died from some type of terminal disease and knew that Dzundza was still obsessed with the point of losing his family and becoming a full-blown alcohol along the way. Totally forgotten and absorbs himself (Like a serial killer) to the remaining killings in his wake. The only disappointment is "top finish" which ends very precisely if you are tired of general Hollywood tires or have interest. Check it out.
