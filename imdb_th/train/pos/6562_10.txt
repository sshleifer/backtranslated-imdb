It's the best reality show. The first two seasons (one important season) are in Hulu. I challenge everyone to watch the first three episodes of Season 1 and don't like it. I guarantee you will see the end of the season. Then I guarantee that you will see Season 2. <br /> <br /> Other quick reasons to watch: 1. Anderson Cooper is hilarious 2. Great European place 3. The game has a mental challenge. 4. It's very interactive. 5. In one episode, the player responds to other players who are hopeless. "I try as hard as I can!" With equal despair. "No need." <br /> <br /> Do you think anyone is the mole?
