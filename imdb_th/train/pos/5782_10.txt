Internet database shows this item as a TV program. And yes it is the MTV series that is shown in the "Oddities" program after "The Head" and before "Aeon Flux" if I remember correctly But the version that I watch this time is the VHS tape that has all the episodes that merge into movies without annoying credit during or have to wait one week for the next fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> You have The story of Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone Maxx is a superhero or Julie's butt, a social worker or a leopard queen. Sarah, a girl who should listen to The Smiths and Mr. Gone. <br /> <br /> I use "or" with Maxx and Julie because part of the fun is trying to figure out which part of the story is true and is a dream. Maybe they are all real or dreams. Maybe one character may not exist. There may be only one that exists and the dreams of others You have to wait and search. <br /> <br /> I have a comic book before the show comes out and it's one of my favorites. The artwork is beautiful and the story is original - unlike what you will find in Superman or Batman. It will make your mind bend and have a strong adult overtones without being rude or aggressive. And the show uses the same art (Now it's only moving) and it's the same thing ... guaranteed that the beauty found in the cartoon will be re-created faithfully. This is the best performance that will appear in "Oddities". <br /> <br /> If you like cartoons with dark colors or want a good trip, it is "Donnie Darko" before having a story. This way, <br /> <br /> The most surprising thing is that this is never a movie or a TV drama again. But I did not say this with disappointment By making it easy, they sealed the film in gold and made it free from acne caused by continuous failure.
