This movie draws you in and makes you fascinated to watch the screen. The writer / director is great with parts, storytelling and camera angles and creative and interesting views that everyone has Together with you, Insomniac's Nightmare is unique and different from other movies you've watched. Is it a dream or reality? This indie will let you talk about twisting and turning it through consciousness and subconscious. It gives an eerie feeling when interpreting the gloomy illusion. Dominic Monaghan becomes really insomnia. He is a great actor and not too difficult to look at! He poured all his abilities into this role. From the story to the shooting method, this indie is one of my favorites. I highly recommend and look forward to seeing new things from this innovative writer / director / director of photography !!!
