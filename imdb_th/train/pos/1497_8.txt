This movie is a horror-themed poetry movie that provides entertainment. (Along with the story line from the basement) written by Robert Bloch (Psycho composer). It's fun for horror fans and has great actors. This movie should be watched for Doctor Who fans since Jon Pertwee (Third Doctor) has a fun role as a rude and nasty horror star!
