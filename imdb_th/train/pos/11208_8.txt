Oh, where are you going? My little youngster <br /> <br /> Turn back and you both turn back. You will be four ... <br /> <br /> I can remember these items. When they first aired on Disneyland I remember sitting there by the description of Werner Braun's rocket rocket science. I look like history, science and humor all blend in the story of the long-term possibilities. <br /> <br /> That was fifty years ago. And the show will return to the Disney Treasure series and what is it? I watched them last night and tonight with my 8 year old daughter, who at first didn't enter the room. But later changed his mind when she saw that they were alive As she watched, I watched her and eventually she was almost determined as I had ever been. <br /> <br /> Turn back and you are a young wife with your own child ... <br /> <br /> <br /> Of course, some predictions about going to the moon are wrong. But with a lot of information that is still quite accurate and the overall presentation is still impressive I found myself thinking that my daughter's teacher might want to show them not only But is a 50 year old invention, but still a fun and easy-to-understand lesson in history. <br /> <br /> Turn back, turn back. Turn back again ... You wonder how much has changed in the past 50 years.
