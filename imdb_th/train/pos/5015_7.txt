Hardly masterpiece Not good writing Beautiful movie. I don't think This movie is not too bad. But it is not much better than the average The main issues related to teenagers with high morals should focus on the subject of more taboo love and why this is ... should really enter it instead of molting with the ground because "Mom said we couldn't. Some parts should be dropped or reworked to focus on the condition of the two main characters. A few times I wonder if the writer / director is a fan of American Graffiti of George Lucas or not. It's not wrong to be a fan of that movie. But to make your movie sometimes seem to me means coming! The worst part of this story is Madchen Amick. There is a small part. I mean, come twice !! She is alone in one or two lines trying to emphasize the southern accent. (Try to sound good. It's there, even though your character is from California! DOH !!) Maybe if she is a star that others will follow and we will have movies that make more real sounds. Oh, what can you do when you have a director who is just a director and not an artist too. Very bad. Overall, I gave this to B- and that's a little cause that makes me part with Amick.
