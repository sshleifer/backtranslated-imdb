I do not doubt that Victor McLaglen won the film's best actor for the film, divided into three ways between Mutiny on the Bounty, Clark Gable's leaderboard, Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone in the same competition. But the informant is still a good movie because John Ford will not receive his first best director Oscar, if not There are no divisions related to his prize. <br /> <br /> The film and story by Liam O'Flaherty, based on the poor, Gypo Nolan, who was a member of the Irish Republican Army. Showed some of the abilities he had pulled and wanted to come back to his final penance and if he could not get back, he needed enough to travel to America There were twenty pounds for information that led to the arrest of a former friend, Frankie McPhillip, played by Wallace Ford. During the time of weakness, he went to Black and Tan. The word and informed about McPhillip. <br /> <br /> The IRA is quite anxious to know who raped McPhillip and they were quite sure that it was McLaglen. He didn't have the wisdom to conceal his own music. He tried hard to persuade another man named Peter Mulligan, played by Donald Meek. He also picked up the hangers played by J .. Kerrigan. <br /> <br /> All the actions of The Informer was born in 1922 in Dublin from about six o'clock in the morning to the next day. There is a need to be shot in the dark and shadow. If already posted to the Second World War, the informants will be ranked as the great classics like Odd Man Out or The Third Man, which has many similarities. <br /> <br / > John Ford knew that the world was very good. He spent a break between the protests and in Ireland at that time and had a brother in the IRA. His real name, before making it a problem, is Sean O'Fiernan. <br /> <br /> Preston Foster plays the director of the IRA Dan Gallagher. In the book, Gallagher is more serious than Foster. There is him here. I guess John Ford wants him to be a sympathetic character to pay attention to movie fans. He made it clear that Foster had to get rid of the informer because Black and Tan would catch him and get out of him a little more and cause the entire organization to be in danger. <br /> <br /> Experimental scene Of IRA is The highlight of this film When Foster asked Donald humbled whether he accepted the power of their court or not. Justice and writing of the king is not performed here. It clearly shows that, despite the occupation by the army and police But the British certainly lost the occupation of the population. <br /> <br /> Of course, the informants are quite scary to touch John Ford. More than you expected, even when McLaglen spent his money on fun, drunk, but the IRA was still in the shadows, watching him and counting every little bit. <br /> <br /> The storyteller is a good story. About Ireland at a time of horror and depression
