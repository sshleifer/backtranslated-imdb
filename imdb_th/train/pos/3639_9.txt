This movie is for me about the family. Jimmy Morris takes the life of his dreams. But for myself But for his family I can't tell you that I will be able to tell my little girl that my father is going to Kansas City to cover Priest Holmes and the Chief of Kansas City. Living in a dream with family is something that this person is talking about. I think that only a father who has a close relationship with his family can appreciate what Jimmy Morris did.
