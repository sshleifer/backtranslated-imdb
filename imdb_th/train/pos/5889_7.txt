Okay, I have to admit that I have never seen "Rhoda" and only one or two episodes of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show", although I don't know anything about this funny ability. But I still like this movie. <br /> <br /> Mary goes back to work. Rose asks her to be lucky to be a comedian. Rhoda struggles with her photography career and Meredith ... What are you doing again? Three stories that we follow over two hours are fun and fun in their way. When the two friends reunite, it will only make this movie better. <br /> <br /> How surprised I am with writing Little jokes that Mary and Rhoda are funny The script has been collected well. <br /> <br /> I've seen Moore and Harper in other films in the past few years and think they are very good. But I don't know if they work well as a team. While both actresses use their share to fill the title of this movie, they don't seem to disappoint me. (During the screening of this movie) Joie Lenz and Marisa Ryan played as okay. But nothing great The remaining actors, such as Jonah, Cecile and .... Everyone is working together well. <br /> <br /> Being here is a reunion. You will expect the fans from those who are not my fans. Would have fun together A good story for each character and two main characters is what makes this movie very good. (New version of the MTM theme song doesn't cause damage)
