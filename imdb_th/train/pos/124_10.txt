* There are spoilers because I have to explain some movie techniques, so read at your own risk! * <br /> <br /> I love this movie. The use of color tones in some scenes makes it seem that old photos are lively. I also enjoy projecting people on the back screen. For example, in one scene, Leopold called his wife and she predicted behind him more than in the general screen. Her face is large on the back and Leo is in the foreground. <br /> <br /> One of the best things is when a young boy killed Ravensteins on a train. With the front closure It reminds me of the Battleship Potemkin, a steady, intense style coupled with a red spray to convey many horror without much blood. Like the scene in which Katrina finds her father dead in the bathtub ... you see only the red water on the side. It is one of the things I love about Von Trier. Talking about his horror, which makes it look more creepy, <br /> <br /> The use of the text in this movie is unique when Leo is himself. The drama pushed by the word "werewolf". I never saw anything like that before in a movie. <br /> <br /> The use of black comedy in this movie is very good. Leo's uncle caused the snickers Received from his role in the Kingdom (Riget.) This humor makes the outline of the absurd confinement of the train conductor with the bad backdrop of WW2 and all the chaos is easy to use. It reminds me of Riget in the way that hospital administrators try to maintain normal conditions at the end of a part when everything is crazy. It shows that some people truly forget what happened around them. But some people like Leo But do not do anything positive about this. <br /> <br /> The voice that speaks very well by Max von Sydow is also fun. It draws you into the story and makes you jump into Leo's head, which is sometimes a terrible place. <br /> <br /> The movie presents a cowardly point if they don't choose. The same idea used in the Dancer in the Dark that Bjork's characters do not speak for themselves and become her own destruction. In fact, once Von Trier seemed to be against women by making Breaking the Waves and Dancer, but now I know that his male characters aren't as good as well! I found myself in the same place at the end of the Dancer when you wanted the main character seriously to rethink their actions. But of course they never do!
