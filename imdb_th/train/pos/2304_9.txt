I think this movie is very good. Occurs in the mid-1950s. Everything looks precise for me. It is handsome and well believed. I tend to ignore this type of movie very much because they don't have depth. But I feel that this film penetrates into the characters and you can feel how they feel. You have to really know them and pay attention to them. Increase This movie can be enjoyed by both men and women and all age groups. After the movie ended, I wanted to have a second part. I want to know what happened to Dani and her family. This movie must be classic. If you don't see it, you should try to catch it when it's on TV or rent ...
