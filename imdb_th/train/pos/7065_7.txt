A cute movie about three lively sisters from Switzerland. (Often seen in matching sets) that want their parents to come back together (It seems that the mother still holds the torch for her father) - so they set off for New York to stop the father. A golden goldsmith, he called "precious". Father didn't see his daughter in ten years. They (oddly enough) didn't seem to think and thought that he was wonderful and while precious, it seems to lead to most lives. Operated by her mother (Alice Brady), a woman recently Want to see her daughter marry the rich The sisters had the idea of ​​pushing valuable things into the path of a drunken Hungarian count, tricking two gold women into thinking that he was one of the richest men in Europe. But the case of the wrong identity makes the girls think that counting is good. Ray Millland, who goes along with the project, makes him fascinated by his sister, Kay. <br /> <br /> This movie is so fun. Barbara reads when Kay finds it sweet and cute. Ray Millland looks very young and handsome here. (Unfortunately, there is little to do) Alice Brady is quite good as the mother planned - but it is Deanna Durbin, charming and cute, a button that plays with the little sister of Penny who stole the Show a lot With the most beautiful vocals, she sang many songs throughout the story, even though I wanted to see them show her in this story. The story in this movie is rather stupid. However, I found this movie to be entertaining and fun.
