Had the opportunity to watch the filming in the Slavic Village-Broadway area I can't wait to see the final filming. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie at Cleveland Premier on Friday, I didn't laugh so loud in the comedy for a period of time. Long! It hurts a lot Russo brothers work well. All actors perform their best comedy ... No slow or dry segments ... George Clooney is one of my favorite actors. I was most impressed by William H. Macy as a rogue "Riley" and Michael Jeter as "Toto". They put you in "stitches". I believe they have the most fun role in all movies.
