I love this movie. It's strange, funny, scary, scary, playing in the head of a madman, and not your usual joke. <br /> <br /> If you don't find a comedy movie, I think it's not for your taste. It is very difficult to write a review for <br /> <br /> For reference, the other comedies I love are The Big Lebowski, The Princess Bride and Zoolander (that makes me the second time only). There are others. But my taste is something Remove the normal course, and I'm willing to accept that most people are not like that. I do not apologize for having an unusual sense of humor - at least I have one. <br /> <br /> The scenes and characters of this film are well assembled, with verbal humor. The performance is very good. (As you would expect from an actor) Although the acting needs of the actor are not very high. The overall package makes entertainment fun, funny, can be seen but intense.
