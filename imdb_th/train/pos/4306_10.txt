The fact that I still think of movies in the next decade is what speaks of the film. For me, this is to confirm that the Grand Canyon is a movie that will make you impressed in some way. I truly believe that before the movie Crash will have a Grand Canyon. The main difference between the two movies, in my opinion, is the moment of their release. I will not argue which one is better. But I will argue the idea that they share the same message I like to hear from people who have opinions on this issue. I will start an opinion which you can find at http://www.myspace.com/62229249 You may find me there to post other topics about movies that we may share because I have a true love for movies.
