The funny story of 2 people who cross the path as they prepare their wedding. Former writers, police and public school teachers fell in love with each other in this great New York atmosphere, even though they were married to others. Perhaps the little things that "allies" are both personality type A, while our protagonists are more relaxed Not heavy at all But it makes me smile And hey for you - sell the corner of Natasha, Henriksson and Gall - selling romance to all of them to win!
