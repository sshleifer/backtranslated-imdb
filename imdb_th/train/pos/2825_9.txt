This movie is quite a surprise. I didn't expect much to be honest. Greta Garbo's first Hollywood movie? And what may be a rough thing and by waving arms and distortions on the face that often show low-quality silent movies often. <br /> <br /> I misunderstand. Greta Garbo is shocked by the people. The studio is as much as you do me because this movie makes you a star and deserves that. She understands the power of standing still or meaningful instincts for a long time without discouraging to feel and see. I always miss myself. How did this actress get into the horrible silent movie? She is only a year and a year before <br /> <br /> The story is not interesting. It's a story of normal love that is found and lost. It was just Garbo's performance as Leonora, a young woman in a poor village that made good in the big city and returned to get a man who had escaped life. Ricardo Cortez served as a co-worker But his character has never really developed and he has always played At one point, he was wearing Garbo's clothes, leaving him in a bad mood, then returned unceasingly and returned them. And don't even talk about his scary final scene with Garbo, then his wife How too ordinary, he doesn't have much career after this and I can understand why. But he suffices as a rather amazing object of Leonora's fascination. <br /> <br /> There is one of the most amazing things in this film that talks about it all. "Leonora, you're outstanding." Yes, see. <br /> <br /> If you want to know what it is, without watching all the movies, just watch the last 30 seconds or more - Garbo's look as she sits alone in Luxury car of I said, "she must be very happy, she has everything she needs" - the face of Garbo says about that. I have to see this again. Garbo is amazing.
