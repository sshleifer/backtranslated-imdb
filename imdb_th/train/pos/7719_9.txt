If you like Star Wars / Trek, come see how they get all their movie ideas and equipment. It is my 2nd most popular movie of all time. Horror movies and psychoanalysis. The intensity of Shakespeare's (The Tempest) root material is not obscured by the whizbang mechanism (later Lucas) and just because it was created in 1956. Don't think you can 'see the line' at Holding a flying saucer This is the first movie you can't. Miracles happen at the "A-movie" level. The economy and tastes at that time overlap heavily. And director Wilcox's 'hit' earlier was "Lassie Come Home" until I watched him. I think 'Fred Wilcox' is an alias for a famous director or later But at that time did not want to connect strictly with sci-fi, which is a type of "B" strictly at that time. Coincidentally, the 'mistake' of the people of Bank Hollywood <br /> <br /> There is a big matt with almost action scenes inserted in the microscope that Lucas uses extensive There is an intelligent device that transcends Ready-made user interface "Computer" as they have been portrayed in the future in Star Trek's 'transporter' future is there. Roddenberry almost 10 years later does not change and if the technobabble of Trek / Wars closes you, the reference The science of FP is not too active and very accurate to this day. The "ship" series is comprehensive, lively, sparkling and is everything you have ever seen and believed more than the 'Trek'. For TV and movie making We didn't spend as much time as I would like. <br /> <br /> If you ever wondered how good the movie came into space, watching FP will explain everything. Of course, not 'Wagontrain to the Stars'
