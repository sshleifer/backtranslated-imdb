Although this series runs only one season But it has been with me for 20 years. It is my favorite cartoon of all time. I will give almost everything to have it on DVD or anything I can find. If you find a way to watch this set, I suggest you take full advantage. This series is the first movie. (In my opinion) with a truly consistent story that spanned many episodes It really makes me interested in the characters and what happens to them. Goose, character, goose. Actually, scared me sometimes. He was a strange person at that time. The leader of the group reminds me of the combination of Clint Eastwood / Tommy Lee Jones. If anyone has a way to contact the creator / rights holder in the series and can put it on the DVD, please do everything possible !!!
