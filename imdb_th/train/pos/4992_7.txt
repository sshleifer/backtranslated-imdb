In general, I found that Loretta Young was hard to worry about her appearance and was too feminine in all the wrong ways. But in the love of Frank Borzage, which is this lyrical and even though she shows low self-esteem which causes her to be persecuted by Paramour Spencer Tracy, she is straightforward and honest. It is the most bizarre small movie played in a cabin in Hooverville. Unusual about depression. But romantic and quiet Tracy receives the "ordinary" poem that is difficult to pick up, which is a terrible alchemist and a bully according to today's standards, making his character's edge soft and almost making him attractive. There is a great support from Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell (which has never been the most) and Jo Swerling's screenplay is simple and effective. But the true hero is Borzage who likes to show true love in a lyrical drama and Young wants to slap her and tell her character wisely. She's better than this guy. But she's very smart and persuasive. You are happy to see their story until the conclusion.
