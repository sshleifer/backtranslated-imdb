Brothers with mental power (yes, really). But for Debra Viking's love But still a secret from their childhood that makes them more likely than their power. <br /> <br /> There is a real touch. Acting like a Greek chorus singing) but with humor, wit and love The soundtrack is also excellent. And similar to the way in which American Werewolf in London uses the wonderful Wolf song, all the songs they will receive ~ but with the fire and I do not think I will forget Too 'She's a girl' ~ Precious;) <br /> <br /> The best lines disappear from the words btw ~ 'When you have a clown, you won't go back! '<br /> <br /> I love this movie (I just ordered a DVD from America) and if the comments written by any kind of people are happy with Legally Blond 3, don't let you down ~ Try it out :)
