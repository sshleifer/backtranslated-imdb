I am only 11 years old but I discovered the full house when I was about five years old and watched it all the time until I was seven years old. Then I grew up and thought Full House could wait and I had something "more important" to do. There was also the fact that my brother who watched it honestly with me in the last two years. In the past, I started to dislike the idea of ​​being a "woman". <br /> <br /> Then I knew that every afternoon at five o'clock in the morning, it was at 23 and I stuck it again. Full House makes me laugh and cry It makes me realize how good it is if our world is like the Full House world, plus my mother. I've heard people say that Full House is wonderful and unbelievable. But look at the big picture: Three women whose mother was killed by drunk driving Sisters fight and get hurt. Three men who live with girls can come to fight at any time. What's more, <br /> <br /> If there is anything that makes me feel better when I'm down and makes me even higher when I think I'm the happiest. I shrill like a dog in the show and get a lot of passion from Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. (Of course, now Hilary Duff has received that position. But they are the most lovely children I have ever seen. They are great actresses.
