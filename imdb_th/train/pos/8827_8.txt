With the least budget, eight minutes of work and a great imagination, Nacho Vignando gets one of the most animated shorts I've ever seen. The subtlety of the screenplay is really amazing because it doesn't end until the last minute. <br /> <br /> Don't let anyone tell you what this short story is. Able to enjoy more year Pay attention to Marta Belenguer's work. Her reaction image is excellent. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 8/10
