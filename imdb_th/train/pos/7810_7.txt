What is "Cry Freedom"? It was a wonderful and unique experience about the creation of South Africa and blacks in that country were enslaved by white people. The main character of this story is Kevin Kline, the chief editor of the Daily Dispatch newspaper in South Africa. Woods wrote many articles, which he said strongly about Steve Biko's views. (Denzel Washington) Woods soon met Bigo and he changed his perspective about him and he began to understand what the authorities were doing with blacks in South Africa. (From the top, even from the police chief) When Biko died in police custody, Woods decided that he had to write a book about him and whether he had to publish anything. But Woods had to flee from his country to receive the book that was published and he had to put his family in the second place so that the world could find the truth. Good movies about people too. The main message that is black and white is the same because we all The story leading us to South Africa and this film is a great way for the whole world to learn what happened in that land and I was disappointed with only 3200 people who rated this movie. This is a movie that we all can learn something. Although it is quite long But this story cannot be presented in a shorter way because the director wants to show us how difficult it is to publish the book after Biko's death. <br /> <br /> In addition, the relationship between Woods and Biko shows the same greatness as the families of two people and all the problems they are facing. But sometimes have to sacrifice (Biko's death) so the truth will be revealed (Woods books)
