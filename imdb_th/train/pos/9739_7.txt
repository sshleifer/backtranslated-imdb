I enjoy watching this movie, mainly because of Simon Pegg, who became a quick and strong box office for comedy. <br /> <br /> He was hired by his dead end in London. Jeff Bridges is one of his famous writers. <br /> <br /> After paying his fees, he enters a higher level of writing a celebrity. (Room seven) which he received Is a minor celebrity himself The story is very funny and Gillian Anderson has an impressive supporting role as an interesting public relations representative. <br /> <br /> All the way to success, he discovered the true meaning of love, etc. <br /> <br> Formulaic plot. This movie is very funny, mostly from Simon Pegg, Jeff Bridges and Gillian Anderson. Kirsten Dunst is good at love. The remaining actors work well. <br /> <br /> This is a funny movie that is worth looking at at the cinema.
