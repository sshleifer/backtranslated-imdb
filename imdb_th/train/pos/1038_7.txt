Love movies. I like most actors in that too. But for me, Davis tried hard to emphasize her voice and acting, which made the movie look very attractive if other modern actors had the same role as Ms. Davis. Laughing out of the screen br /> <br /> I guess I'm cached can not 'Betty Davis' I always think that she is an actor who 'plays herself', no matter what her role is. That other investigators will explain carefully (And I hope to be a citizen) give details of how I am wrong in this matter But I will watch movies continuously because I like stories / writing / supporting actors. But I will miss many actresses who can always do better.
