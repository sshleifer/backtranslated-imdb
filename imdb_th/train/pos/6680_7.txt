This is definitely different. Just look at the characters! Talking about strange balls. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy and Ben Stiller are stars. Although many actors are almost interested in the spotlight. Paul Ruben plays the most outrageous role in the famous "Pee Wee Herman". <br /> <br /> There is a sense of humor, humor, flashy colors and no lullabies. It's a light comedy that has nothing but stupid characters. Everyone wants to be a hero. Superman, Batman, Spider-Man. They have strange abilities. But the real hero can't (And don't want to!) It's stupid, but you know it's happening. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that you can watch in different sectors and don't miss any continuity. It's a long film for people who Very exciting, so taking a break here and is ok. The language is tame, so children can enjoy it as well. In fact, I do not remember swearing in here except the people in the theater next to me, saying that "It's a very stupid movie." I thought it was fun for two hours. But I want to watch it on DVD and stay a bit.
