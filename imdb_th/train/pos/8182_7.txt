Director Brian Yuzna has an uneven career in horror genre, creating masterpieces such as "Return of the Living Dead 3" or "Bride of Re-Animator", but at the same time he has made horrible movies such as "Faust: Love For the victims "Or ordinary people," descendants ", clearly he is better than the producer, whose work in the creation of Stuart Gordon's film is excellent. <br /> <br />" The Dentist "is one. In less than his work as director Movies and lack of pretense make it a very enjoyable experience. It tells the story of Dr. Alan Feinstone (played by Corbin Bernsen), a successful dentist who one day discovered that his perfect life was not perfect as he thought when he found his beautiful wife (Linda Hoffman ) In relationship With children pool This event disturbed his mind and put him in the fun of killing as he avenged the world because of "dirty" <br /> <br /> Yuzna is a place that can be managed well. Follow Feinstone's revenge. What makes this movie different from most slashers is that we're not in the victim's perspective. We follow Feinstone because he's the main character. How can we testify that he went from a respectable professional to a spiritual killing in one day? Yuzna tried to give the film anxiously. But adding a dark sense of humor to help the film succeed. <br /> <br /> The most successful of the locations is at Bernsen's performance as Feinstone. He can make you feel sympathetic. And hating him at the same time and the delicate humor that his character has is another aspect that helps this movie The remaining actors are not good, and I think their sub-performances make the film more painful than it should be. The notable exception is Ken Foree, as a detective, trying to catch Feinstone. While his part is relatively small, he does a great job. <br /> <br /> With a dentist as a killer, the scene is full. With blood and Brian Yuzna delivers the perfect SFX in the right amount It's a good thing to see that he's not going to do anything about it often, and I dare to say that this is the highlight of this movie. There is a certain amount of blood that is expected, nothing less and nothing more. Yuzna restrains himself from his frequent excesses and the results are excellent. <br /> <br /> While this is not a famous movie At the end of Yuzna, I would say it's one of his best. Of course, it is not a classic material as his masterpiece. But it is a movie that is entertaining and never boring or boring It's a simple, cheap movie. But for what it is I think it vibrates 7/10
