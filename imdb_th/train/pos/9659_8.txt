'Presque Rien' is a beautiful portrait of a person from the experience of a French homosexual man. Abandoning both the pattern and the sermon, it is an excellent natural film, with excellent performances filmed with feelings for the seaside town where action has taken place. If there is anything that is almost too realistic, since there are plans in the same way, just a scene from life. But the lack of traditional tension can be considered less than what may have happened in the world. 'Presque Rien' may not be the most exciting movie ever created. But its simple humanism serves it well compared to the view before the celebration or the bigoted view that often destroys the treatment of this theme. Worth watching
