I love this movie so much! The animation is excellent. (For pokemon movies) cgi looks great I love music in movies It's great. They keep Japanese songs. <br /> <br /> For the story: It's great. It has great friendship. Celebi is a cute and powerful Pok√©mon Ash is very good in this movie and I like his friendship with Sam. The only thing I didn't like was the look of Sui's face. Suddenly he appeared to help Ash & join him a bit. They can make him a little more involved in the movie. <br /> <br /> But overall, the movie is great! Can't wait to be the owner of the USA version on the DVD!
