I must say that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen! I was bored and looked through the TWV and found the "house" and spent about 5 minutes but I was hooked. It's interesting and moving. It shows what can happen in everyone's life. I give 10 more. If possible, the director / writer and performer perform amazing work. I think teens should watch this movie and learn from it. It's great, mysterious drama and many more. I cry for many hours! I think the director / writer should write more movies. I like it! I don't even know about this movie, which is sad because it's very good. I hope it will go in the movie for people to see.
