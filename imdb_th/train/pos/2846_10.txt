I am not a writer or critic ... I was just a student who had watched this movie a few minutes ago .... and I want to thank the people who worked on making this movie! Most .... but it touches my heart ... why ??? I want to understand it myself ... It's easy and accessible ... It's a movie that makes you feel good after a bad day without regret. About the time that was spent watching it about love and concern about the life we ​​had But sometimes we miss because of the content that is important ....... See all the time we have But we miss it ... why do we do like fu * k, we need to live like dying ... pay attention every second And it has a special flavor in New York ... I love this city and the world we live !!!! Thank you very much for the movie and apologize for my mistake. (English is my second language) ...
