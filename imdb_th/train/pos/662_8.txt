The second installment of the axellent that managed well like the first time. <br /> <br /> Handsome again. Excellent. I like the first episode, and the second part has nothing but the intelligence and intelligence. <br /> <br /> The second episode is funny, funny, stupid and very fun. It was the first Christmas episode about a woman who was tortured by a serial killer dressed as Santa after killing her husband as if at first. <br /> <br /> The most funny scene is the relationship between murder. Her husband and her phone
