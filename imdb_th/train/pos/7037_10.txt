This is a great political speech. It is not surprising why it was largely ignored in the United States: it unfolded our foreign policy of murder. <br /> <br /> Another good movie in this era. Rendition was right. Completely dismissed That the United States is a war machine that has tortured, killed and crippled civilians in the pursuit of world domination. <br /> <br /> Clever plans, good performances, some big stars (John Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei, everyone?) And some scenes of fun should make this movie popular. Unfortunately, Americans do not like to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they are complex in the massacre.
