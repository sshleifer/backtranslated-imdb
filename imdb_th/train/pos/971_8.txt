This film reminds of the German movie THE NEVERENDING STORY, because the child is taken to a miraculous strange land to be a hero. However, due to the state-of-the-art technology, the puppet and CGI are used to create an amazingly realistic world that will make your socks free from realism and boundaries. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the movie. this But boys, it's a boring job at first! Unfortunately for most Westerners, this movie is something that you may give up quickly or quit because everything in the movie looks very strange. However, given the opportunity Don't think or try to understand everything you see - just let the story unfold and you will enjoy the most movies. <br /> <br /> In many ways, this is the advice I need. Give to the adults who watch Miyazaki's SPIRITED AWAY because it is very similar and has a lot of yogi. (Japanese legendary spirits) The main difference between the two is the great war. YOKAI WAR is a live action and SPIRITED AWAY is more kid-friendly. While I think THE GREAT YOKAI WAR is intended to be a movie for most children in the United States, most parents do not want to show this to younger children because they are violent, scary and have some adult behavior. D So who is the audience in the West? Children and adults who like foreign movies with non-Western themes and elements This is a fairly narrow audience! <br /> <br /> While you are watching, look for strange little things. In fact, you can watch movies dozens of times and observe different small things each time. Some of the funny references I like are comments about Gamera. The scene that comes with the comment "KIDS: Don't try this at home" as well as using Kirin beer for people to see Yokai really. .. Maybe that scene should have this warning)! <br /> <br /> Director Takashi Miike is a person who is difficult to say, in addition to saying that there are no stories of him that I've seen "normal". Some of his films are quite disgusting and annoying and I Hate them (Especially the selection and ICHI THE KILLER) while some are magical and the best movies I have ever seen One thing is certain, it's hard to watch one of his films and there is no serious reaction in one way or another.
