I have one thing for black and white movies of this type by Will Hay and Abbot & Costello. Especially it's my favorite. I picked up this movie on the DVD because it used the same idea as Will Hay's "Oh Mr Porter", one of the best comedies ever. I just watched this movie less than ten minutes before. (This movie ends at 12:45 pm) I found that this type of movie about Ghost Trains, etc. is the best picture at night with lights. In this way, you will get more stories and watching at night work better with this movie. <br /> <br /> One sub-movie may look a bit old for some viewers. They didn't date me even though I was 28, and even though I wasn't old enough to be around when this movie was first released. (My father is) I still have a lot of admiration for some old movies of this type. Sit in the front of the TV room with snacks and drinks, kick back and relax at night while watching these movies. There are many things that cannot overcome the feelings you get while doing this. It was an escape from reality. <br /> <br /> I noticed that a man in this movie (He has a black mustache) He appeared about three-quarters of the way after the car crashed. And he was looking for a woman he was tracking to the station This man is in Will Hay classic "The Ghost of St Michaels" as well. Just think that I will point out in the case that nobody noticed :) <br /> <br /> The piece set in that movie. Has a very good atmosphere Outside the abandoned station, it looks good and as if there is no spirit in any direction and the inside of the station looks very warm, away from the rain storm outside. I feel like I want to be there in movies with actors. The atmosphere in this movie is missing from many movies now. It keeps you stuck with the time when the movie begins until it's finished. <br /> <br /> We want more of this type of movie in the current market. But sadly it can be viewed in favor of movies with nudity and swearing and rough humor The era of creating this type of movie (The Ghost Train, Oh Mr Porter and others) for me is the golden age of movies!
