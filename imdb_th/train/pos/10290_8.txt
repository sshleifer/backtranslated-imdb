Bruce Almighty is Jim Carrey's best work since The Truman Show and is a delightful surprise after his latest "Hey Hollywood - see how well I do!" Box office disappointed It's good to see Jim recognize and accept his strengths. He will not receive an Oscar. But the movie will last longer "Awarded movie" A lot of institutions He is at the top of his form in the latest film - it's like the return of an old friend. <br /> <br /> Carrie Freeman and Aniston perform very well together - comfortable in the role. Their jokes The time when the cartoons were great and clearly had fun together, but there was no "Hey Mom - Looks funny. I'm a" type of comedy. The real surprise is Steven Carrell, which is Carrey's nemesis (Carrell of The Daily Show fame) walking out with the best and funniest scenes of the movie. I laughed at Carell more difficult than others in the last three years. <br /> <br /> I can predict the religious nuts in The United States will rise Was subjected to the treatment of God But the bottom line of This film is true for all important theological beliefs - we are a group of protoplasts trying to pass our short lives by using our free will. If there is no marriage to the child complaining about this, it should become the goal of those who prioritize the wrong place. (Those who know the type - men decorated with gold watches on Sunday mornings and television at night, selling prayers to God) and about 0.5% of the country are interested and 80% of the media will report <br /> <br /> bottom line : This is a truly entertaining movie. Each audience member laughs with the suspicion of what they will do. And good feelings at the conclusion of the movie Walking along the important roads in America must confirm that God has a lot of humor. It's a funny cartoon that is better than warning us that Jim Carry <br /> <br /> Thank you again. Jim - It's good to get you back !!
