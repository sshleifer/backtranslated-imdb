I saw this movie for millions of years (of course 5 years) for the first time. Considering the recent incident with Schapelle Corby, an Australian woman jailed in Indonesia for allegedly being a smuggler, decided to watch the movie again. I except to cry my heart out. 'Makes me suck for hot girls who want (Just read my comment of the 'stalking of Laurie shows') Some damp escape my eyes. But why is it almost not full of tears? Not because the two heroines do not appreciate and do nothing wrong, not because the film does not make the hearts of these two children stand out in the critical moments of their lives. Why? Why i don't cry I want to cry! When I rent a movie like this, I will be moved to whine as if there is no tomorrow to feel sad and like it. This movie is too short to do this. It's like the script is reduced to the main elements of the plan and while doing this, psychology is thrown away. Claire Dennes and Kate Beckinsale do a great job in conveying the feelings of both friends. But this movie just screamed to see more of these girls when in the environment The mental journey disappeared here for some reason. You will see the important moments of it. (Which I accept very much) may be due to a bad fix Sometimes I feel that these girls are walking around in postcards. Relationships with family members may take a little more attention. What happened to the relationship between girls and parents (Especially between Alice and her father) You see a glimpse of it. But this film does not give a tragic overview (And appearance) of the actress (and music) more than with the goodness of the director To be honest, I almost didn't know who Kate Beckinsale was before I watched this movie (again). Now I'm a fan! Great movie as long as you don't expect it to be a classic movie theater.
