This film came to me, suggested by Matt Groening. In fact, I watched both The Simpsons and Futurama and were mentioned both, so I thought "heck" movies brought home. "No matter what," that makes you realize how lucky we are in this era where we bring things like soap and water. Interestingly, in 2022, men still shave with a single safety razor! The good habit that the responsible person did not load this film with unnecessary special effects, ray guns, etc. 'furniture' that looks good when you understand the meaning. Remember "Tuesday is the green day of soybeans"
