While I'm looking for something new and unique, I watch this movie online. I think it's only a "B" rate movie, but I'm surprised by the performances of the two main characters. All actors in this movie are very talented and well directed. The story is great and unique, with great virtues for the story. <br /> <br /> This movie is not suitable for people looking for sex. Play "Dumb and Dumber" or blood and guts. This is an enchanted film that is astonishing, showing the horrifying reality of life, coupled with the kindness of the human heart and playfulness enough to make it interesting. <br /> <br /> I want you to. This movie is a "A" movie. Many stories have seen a lot with a high box office income. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie.
