This movie has many things going on. It is a "good feeling" story. The characters and actors are delighted with reason and presenting good performances. I believe that the most important thing is that Dennis Quaid knows how to catch and throw a baseball. Robert Redford looks good both throwing and bat in "The Natural" and Kevin Costner in "For Love of the Game" and "Bull Durham "in the" Major League "Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen seem like they know what They are doing, but not many others, and the picture is pure silly - and not very funny. <br /> <br /> So many past baseball movies, even though the story may be interesting. Baseball's ability in the leadership section is ridiculous. In this sense, in "The Stratton Story" and "Strategic Air Command" Jimmy Stewart looks reliable as a professional baseball player while you are overweight, not an athlete. Senior uncle in a softball game that reunited with other strong and strong star families (such as Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig; Robald Reagan is Grover Cleveland Alexander and Dan Dailey as Dizzy Dean). They were in the late round, while "picked up" for the Sunday Picnic game. (Although students and even if your uncle is involved) <br /> <br /> The scene of Quaid's high school team where he coached the scene in which he participated in the trials with the Devil Rays and the scenes he played in the league. Two leagues and in the American League are all true. Participants are confident and capable. In addition, he is also an actor with a personality that is always capable and appropriate. (Except at the level, some "over-the-top" scenes of his scenes and his accent in Jerry Lee Lewis's description) but he definitely set the goal here and this movie is "9" better or better, like Same as other types of movies except "The Natural"
