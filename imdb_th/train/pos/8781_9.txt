I thought of myself as a boxer, a boxing movie and the only thing that made me unable to call "Gentleman Jim", the best boxing movie ever made, was Robert Wise / Paul Newman. This may be the number 1 movie, but "Gentleman Jim" is a similar movie. <br /> <br /> This film is not just an increase of James J. Corbett but also shows boxing. At Important moments of change In the late 19th century, boxing was moved away from the brutal days of bare-legged rule days. "Gentlemen" of wearing the Marquis of Queensbury gloves, rules and sports moved away from the day that it was illegal and continued The time of acceptance and respect. <br /> <br /> "Gentleman Jim" is not a realistic image of those days. It's romantic and yes, even a little hokey sometimes. But always happy. Errol Flynn is perfect as a "gentleman". Jim, who is not a "gentleman" at all, is a fast talker from the working class family. Alexis Smith is quite charming as a woman. High that he has a love / hate relationship. (And we all know that it is, of course, the love to win that event in the end) <br /> <br /> At the end of "Gentleman Jim", the great John L. Sullivan (Which is famous not "I can lick any man in the world." Of course ... seduce again.) Give the belt to Corbett. Is this one of the best scenes in every sport? No. But excellent. Hey, if you want realism, see "Raging Bull" instead. It's a more realistic boxing movie, but "Gentleman Jim" is a lot more fun.
