Rosenstrasse is an intimate movie that is more than one of the epic proportions that may make many movie viewers look for similar pianists. Fortunately, Von Trotta, a good screenwriter, chose to look for feminism in an era with images. The outside is too colorful. But there is very little analysis in terms of intimacy and from the point of view of the typical Aryan Germans from the Jewish perspective, Rosentrasse found that there was a strong burden that was not affected by people trapped in the situation History in which they become victims The pace of this film is a thoughtful, slow, significant story. In addition, the characters are bright, while the transition between generations and time has been created subtlely. Rosenstrasse is not a masterpiece and has some flaws that can be distinguished. Another mistake is that the filming of the trivia movie cannot capture the violence of the drama within which the characters live. However, this film is worth watching. Eventually, Rosenstrasse is part of the latest trend in German movies related to ghosts in the past that are horrific, trends that include great movies like Nowhere in Africa and recently the collapse at Debated I would like to recommend this film to those who know how to read in addition to images.
