I remember stumbling upon this special thing while surfing the channel in 1965. I never heard of Barbra before. When the performance ended, I thought "This is probably the best thing on TV that I can see in my life." 42 years later, that's true. There is still nothing astonishing as amazing as the talent that appears here. You can talk about all the superstars you want. This is the best of them all! <br /> <br /> You name it, you can do it funny, pathos, persuasion, boss, Barbara is a true storyteller. Her ability to pull what she is trying to be a legend But this special thing happened at first and helped create the myth that she quickly became. Despite increasing in a short time, she fulfilled her promise by revealing her abilities more as she walked. But they all came here from the beginning You will not be disappointed in watching this program.
