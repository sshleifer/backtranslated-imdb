I just saw it last night. It aired on the Canadian 'Broadcasting Corporation' 'Passionate Eye' series. It was recently selected (Sep 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival and many more. Is a movie that is quite remarkable The filmmakers stumbled upon the true story there to make a documentary about Chavez himself. They found themselves in the middle of the event when the coup was resolved. They can access events and people like never before, and most of them release the story when it happens. Of course, they have their own ideological views. (Which they clearly see) but they are behind and trying to pay attention to the events, people, backgrounds and history that led to the coup As a movie, it does not have the origin in terms of stylistic or aesthetic, and that is, I think it should be like that. What we get to see what journalism is 'buried' should be. What we have seen is a remarkable story of a country struggling to gain democracy ... a charming leader (Chavez) who cares His people really ... The story about power and greed as a partner of the organization / military / media interests to lead the coup of the elected leaders according to the regime. Each tea bureaucracies ... and access to the historic events that had never happened before as it unfolds <br /> <br />.
