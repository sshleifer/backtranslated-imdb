~~ I can watch this movie yesterday morning through early viewing ~~ <br /> <br /> I am the mother of 2 children from 11 to 6. I am confident that many parents. Can relate to seeing many "kids" movies. This is refreshing for me I don't particularly read this book, so I don't know if it's true to the book or not. But of course, bringing the uncertainty factor to a high level This is the story of a "new" boy in town and how it happened when there was a group of boys who founded a strange club and liked to choose children ... Does it sound familiar? We all do not suffer this time or otherwise. He has a little brother that he can't stand and his parents are shy. The thing I like the most is to see how each character is completely different from each other. They all stand out. Bully (why do they always make the red head always my daughter has red hair ! And she is not a bully! It takes time to twist and change, and you fall in love with them all and find yourself as a path for every character! Even parents still have a good relationship between father and child all around. Fun, sweet, funny, gross, etc. ...... Take your children !!! You will enjoy it as much as they do!
