I saw this film without knowing what it was ... I was a fan of Branagh more than Shakespeare's movies and at first I only saw it for this ... eyes because of the great peace. Popular effects and brave philosophies about Life of Helena's maiden. Recommended for those who are bored with TV programs. (At least in Spain)
