So half of the season, I was engaged in school and activities that I didn't realize that the show was canceled half way, which is boring. <br /> <br /> I think the followers. Should write a fox and ask them to shoot at least so that the season can be released later Maybe they will see how many people are disappointed that the show didn't survive in the first season. <br /> <br /> I like the show and hope to get every Thursday after OC. You can imagine the disappointment When I came back, I watched the show just to find out if it was gone or not? No need to say that I'm not happy with the fox now. Even more after finding that there was no ending being filmed I mean, if you're going to work on a project, at least make it complete to see what happens. Filming half of the movie is like making a half car. It's very useless. Fox filmed the ending of the curse and made the fans of the program somewhat peaceful.
