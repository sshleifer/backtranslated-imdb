Takashi Miike is one of my favorite directors and I'm worried about him who made a child movie because I hate to see him from his movies. I love: Visitor Q, Gozu, Izo, Ichi, Ichi and Black Socioty Trilogy. Recently it seems that he is exploring a new land and I think he is successful. This is my first movie that I saw that he went in that direction, so I was worried. Rough stuff. I bought it without seeing it and I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> Great Yokai War is a perfect movie for children and adults should like it too. This movie reminds me of movies that I love from a very young age: endless stories, labyrinths, Return to Oz, etc. I enjoy these movies because they don't treat children like they are stupid and this person doesn't. Yes. The basic virtues that are dark are there. But it was stupid, like the movie the children should have. Personally, I didn't care about CGI and prosthetics. I felt that they got along well and didn't think that children would notice. <br /> <br /> If you are a tough Takashimike fan, you may not like this person. But I recommend shooting It proves that Miike is versatile and capable, like I suspect he is. He continues to create his unique Miike movie following these movies, which are very confident. <br /> <br /> For those who are new to Takashi Miike and want something that is astonishing or amazing, like this other Miike movie. : 'Zebraman' 'The Happiness of the Katakuris' 'Sabu' and 'The Bird People in China' <br /> <br /> Takashi Mika is so good! 8/10 stars
