Interestingly, I approached I Am Curious (yellow) and it was my companion with great anxiety. I read many reports about widespread controversy and explicit sexuality. What I received is not this. But is a thought that encourages and participates in a movie theater like no other I sincerely believe that most reviewers who feel that this movie is 'lame' or 'boring' approached the movie as if it were pornographic. Perhaps this is pornography, assuming that pornography is something that is intended to make the senses feel like Lena, the helper, threw her into her performance, making it realistic and believable and enduring. Her breasts may be sagging, unusually big tits, fat on her thighs and fat face. But at the end of this movie, the audience will come to identify her and accept her mistakes as humans. This touch gave her more confidence. If the director removes the Briget Bardot shell, the result will be erased. I can't suggest more things to stimulate this idea. Prepared to invest in the very idea of ​​this movie The audience and the humble person will be thoroughly rewarded in the way that most movies can dream.
