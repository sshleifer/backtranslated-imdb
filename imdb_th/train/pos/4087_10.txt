I must say that I think I have seen it all. I am a very boring movie. This movie didn't shock me. In any way I passed that point. But it took me to some emotional places that I didn't know I could go to I don't know if I will find (ick) the idea of ​​the beast. Never, never, never, ever, but you go. He does it. I have to give credit to the director. He pulls out. <br /> <br /> During the first 40 minutes, this movie is all boring. We start with a clear picture of two horses that have sex. After five minutes from now, I began to wonder if buying this movie is not a mistake or not. Then an old man sat in a wheelchair, talking to other old men about two marriages. If so, the nervous person will shave. Then we saw a hot (short) chick with Butler (but very short). At this point, I cursed the movie out loud while trying to stay awake. In fact, I slept for about 40 minutes and forced me to finish it the next night. <br /> <br /> Finally, we got a good thing when a woman (Who knows who you are In this film) had a dream about a Victorian woman who was destroyed by a wild animal The scene continues for some time and is the meat (heh-heh) of all the agreements. It was shot beautifully, edited perfectly and delivered the product. They tried to plot the ending and it was reasonable. But it's not like that. Oh, well. I would definitely recommend this movie. The first 40 minutes made me want to take a picture of myself. (And my TV) but the last 50 minutes is totally redemption
