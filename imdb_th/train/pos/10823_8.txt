I always like Johnny Concho and I hope this movie will be shown on VHS and DVD. Frank Sinatra shows the most unusual performances of his career this time. <br /> <br /> When We met Frank for the first time in this movie. He is a notoriously handsome fighter outside the city right now. The elder attacked with fear in the center of the city and Frank took full advantage of bullying the townspeople safely in his shadow. Only Phyllis Kirk has feelings for him. She is the daughter of Wallace Ford and shop owner Dorothy Adams. <br /> <br /> Two other gunmen arrive at William Conrad and Christopher Dodd and It turns out that Konrad killed Sinatra's brother and he came to his town. They humiliated Sinatra and drove him out of the city. Kirk follows him. <br /> <br /> Overnight, Sinatra turns from punk to a coward and becomes the person searching for the spine. It was a great performance, almost as good as the Oscar nominated for The Golden Arm. Unfortunately for some reason that has never been seen for many years. <br /> <br /> The other two performances are Keenan Wynn as a gunman. The former was a preacher who helped Sinatra find what he wanted to stand up to Conrad and dark. And then there was Conrad in what I believed was his job on the screen He is an unbelievable villain of a walk and talk on the silver screen. <br /> <br /> But what I like about Johnny Concho is an important point to remember. Rad and Dark management Suppose I believe Johnny Concho is MGM's answer for High Noon and the primer for what you do when evil causes the law to collapse.
