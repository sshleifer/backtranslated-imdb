Perhaps the movie may not be Jackie Chan's best movie. But I think everyone will agree with me that fighting in the mall is one of the best fighting scenes ever. There are also memorable stunts that are so impressive that this movie is a classic action scene. This movie has influenced many other action movies, and I think today, action movie makers should learn from this film. (For example, they can create a new chase scene. I use modern technology. There are also funny scenes that make this movie fun even when Jackie doesn't fight. I think they can add more fighting scenes to this movie.
