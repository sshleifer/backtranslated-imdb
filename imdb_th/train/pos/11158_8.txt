A shocking, well-made chiller is a worthless story of a brutal murder and evil forces. <br /> <br /> Doctor Muang Lek tries to find out who or what is causing the murder. Extreme Sex <br /> <br> Incubus is a mysterious mystery with some horrific murder sequences. The murder scene is intense and full of blood, so this is not a movie for nausea! The direction of John Hough, along with the bizarre music score, combined to create a dark atmosphere of fear that runs through the film. There is also a gothic flavor. Good filming locations and stylish cameras are also highlighted. <br /> <br /> Actors are not bad as well. The great John Cassavetes has made a steady contribution like a new doctor in town. There is also a good performance of Kerrie Keane as a local reporter, Helen Hughes, as a city historian and Duncan McIntosh, a tortured psychotic teenager. <br /> <br /> Every round, Incubus is a forgotten horror movie - Was discovered and evaluated. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
