I do not expect that this movie will be understood by the audience from Romania. This thing tells you something about the value or maybe about the lack of internationalization of the movie. But told something about the different history and lives of people in Romania compared to other countries, even in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> The film was adapted from a novel by Marin Preda, a novelist Controversy, which died during the communist rule after this book was published It tells the story of the philosopher who taught philosophy, whose life was crushed after he was imprisoned for false accusations at the end of the Stalin era. In general, the first part of the film tells the story of the fight for survival in the prison. The second chapter describes his introduction of how to regain his life after being released. Asked from him in various forms of compromise and crime But his struggle for survival was morally good like prison. The best Romanian actor, Stefan Iordache, who has a leading role, will be in other times and another place is a star. We can see his great performing art here. Although suffering from reluctant storytelling and sometimes in unnecessary details or cartoon characters But this film is still an important place for Romanian movies, as well as the moral and historical recovery process in Romanian society.
