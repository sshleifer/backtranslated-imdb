For justice, I expect the car chase in this movie. There is only one, but other than that, 'Freeway' is a great movie that I am glad to have on DVD. A really great name in the actors is Richard Belzer of HOMICIDE as a radio psychiatrist and B-Movie, a great villain like Billy Drago. I like the way Darlanne Fluegel gave her character a little bold courage. She may be a character that is helpless. But she was fully rounded when she sought Drago with the help of the bounty hunter James Russo. <br /> <br /> Russo, I was afraid to find a lot of wood. But after that Once again, the character he played Frank didn't help much for the story after Sunny received from the former commander. The sound of the threat is kept well throughout the film and the atmosphere of a lonely freeway LA at night with the killer who swims along its length in his terrifying gray sedan. Composed appropriately I don't know why some people hate this movie. I think the rhythm is different for different people, but I am very happy with the 'Expressway' and I highly recommend it.
