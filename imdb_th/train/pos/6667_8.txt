OK. There are people who shouldn't watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 1) Don't watch this movie if you don't like humor or satire. 2) Don't like if you are attacked by _The Watchmen_ 3) Don't see if you Need serious superhero movies. <br /> <br /> The rest of you run, don't walk to see _Mystery Men_ It's funny. It's weird. It's the happiness sent by everyone who knows human cliche. A superhero with a sense of humor at the Juni level. Not occasionally destroying the extremely low-key fun of Jeanane Garafalo, Ben Stiller and Hank Azaria, as well as fun small pieces by Geoffrey Rush and Greg Kinnear (well, seeing Louise Lasser working as well). Always go Quite strange, but - good -
