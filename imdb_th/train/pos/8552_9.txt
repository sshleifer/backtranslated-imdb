This is one of my favorite things of the American Pie Spin because most of the other main characters (one of the young Stifler) tend to seem unrealistic in nature. <br /> <br /> For example, AP: The Naked Mile You have a teenage teenager surrounded by college chicks that are naked and have one particularly hot on his path to get rid of his "problem". His innocence and he stops the central action and rides back to sleep with the girlfriend. His girl who gave in mind made him "wrong free through" for the weekend. I can appreciate the romantic view of the whole thing. But to be true; Most people who watch these movies do not search for a special romantic story. <br /> <br /> While the last section seems to know who is the audience and Erik Stifler, old, seems to be awake. Came up and smelled Roses, and as always, Mr. Levenstein gives humor about eyebrows. "Perfectly natural" towards the equation and scoring for this new movie
