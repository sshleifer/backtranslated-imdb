I think this movie is the best movie about Mike Hammer with Mike Hammer's performance. Harry Essex's script is great and there are many improvements about Mickey Spillane's novel. His direction. Strong and imaginative, and he takes advantage of the light and shadow well The work of the camera by John Alton is the best, as well as the scores of the actor Franz Waxman, including many experienced players, including Peggie Castle in her memorable performance as Charlotte Manning. The best eye movies ever, Biff Elliott and Haary Essex should get more opportunities. I've always loved this movie
