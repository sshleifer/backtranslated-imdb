There are a few movies that make me feel that Stardust has done everything throughout the movie's path. As a magical fairy tale like the bride's princess, Stardus is the most magical fantasy phenomenon in the 2000s and 1990s. Exciting, hilarious and well-equipped with great images and memorable characters. And Robert De Niro, in particular, I challenge everyone to watch this movie without a smile From the first ten minutes of the movie, you know how it will end. But it is a journey, not a destination that makes the audience impressed from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Ten stars and not less decimal.
