TACHIGUI: The amazing life of fast food Japanese name: Tachiguishi Retsuden <br /> <br /> Director: Mamoru Oshii Starring: Toshio Suzuki, Mako Hyodo, Kenji Kawai, Shinji Higuchi, Katsuya Terada Lecture by Koichi Yamadera - -------------------------------------- <br /> Go back. In 1995, Mamoru Oshii released his animated animation, Ghost In The Shell, which helped compile anime's international acceptance - and also embedded into the overall concept of The Matrix for Andy and Larry Wachowski. For the movie The Innocence (2004)) The original Japanese cartoon that will compete for the Palme d'Or in Cannes and let the head spin together with the style and innovative effects that are unfathomable. <br /> <br / > Always the trend. Now, Oshii has presented Tachigui to us: the amazing life of fast food? Which does not have any involvement with Ghost In The Shell or Japanese anime for that matter. <br /> <br /> Say hello by creating Oshii's "superlivemation": not animation The actors have to endure somewhere in the vicinity of 30,000 snapshots that are digitally processed and recreated in a simple, unbelievable paper-cut pattern reminiscent of the Bali puppet. The movement itself is a style that stops and ceases, which is an echo from the experiments of Tetsuo Shinya Tsukamoto of Shinya Tsukamoto: Iron Man (1988) <br /> <br /> "I can't think of any way. In a recent interview with The Daily Yomiuri, "I know that this project is not suitable for traditional animation." <br /> <br /> Selection options are equally enigmatic. Kenji Kawai - Great soundtrack composer - appeared as a fan While the famous Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki takes time to kill his screen with other bizarre fashions, including Katsuya Terada, who works with Oshii on Blood: The Last Vampire and Shinji. Higuchi - Special effects that work in the movie Godzilla. <br /> <br /> Koichi Yamadera's description sounds like a dry NHK documentary. ?? Which is the character of this cartoon, including Yamadera's patiently animated character, such as Spike Siegel in Cowboy Bebop. <br /> <br /> And the story is a strange picture of the post-war world. The second time in Japan in the context of A variety of fast-food dishes - from Soba ramen to the Yuen-on-Bar. American dogs in the thermal storage trays of convenience stores to the Burger Shane restaurant that was inspired by McDonalds. "Food is the first root of desire." Oshii confirmed by explaining how <br /> <br /> threw Into the ingredients is a new breed of consumers: fast food grifters of names, people who do not like to pay for their tucker and have to thoroughly fine-tune their scams for free scoring. Munchies < br /> <br /> Oshii said that his hidden motivation was to show respect for the "art" of eating on the streets? Something is still considered a prohibition in this country and explains how to use "tachigui" in the name of <br /> <br /> Live action movie director (Avalon, Stray Dog) as well as animation Oshii. Blur definitions between the two media The results of the celluloid here are stored somewhere in the shaded area between the two forms. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, the visual experiment here is as exhilarating as it is annoying. Do not ask what it should mean. Oshii's movie, which has the same components of brain and innovation, is often unclear on which Oshii succeeds, through a lot of black humor. Here you will find Kentucky Fried Rat, death by hula-hoop, the world's fastest samurai burger chef? And in this film is a style of statics. <br /> <br /> This is someone who is against the influence of filmmakers like Godard and Truffaut and may owe to Andrei Tarkovsky as much as David Lynch. So it's not surprising that The B-52 bomber in one step will fly through the franchise that looks like Yoshinoya. The 54-year-old writer seems to think that this is normal. "Japan, which I lecture in this movie, may not necessarily be honest." He suggested <br /> <br /> Of course. -------------- <br /> <br By Andrez Bergen
