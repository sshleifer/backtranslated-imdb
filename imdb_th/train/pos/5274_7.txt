Yes, I love this movie since I was a child. When I grew up I saw this movie many times that my father had to buy another VHS copy because the old copy was broken. <br /> <br /> My family received a copy of the movie VHS when we bought the system. New VHS At first, my mother wasn't sure if this was the right movie for 10 years, but because we just bought a new VHS system that she gave me. <br /> <br /> Like I said this movie Every boy dreams or not? The movie consists of wonderful settings, big muscle barbarians, beautiful nude women, big bad monsters and jokes that you can get when you are older. A few days ago I put the video and watched the movie again after a long time. At first I was bored and began to think how much I liked this movie when I was young and continued to watch. Yes, the experience isn't as great as I remember? The acting is quite bad. The story is quite bad. The joke is not a joke anymore. But women are still beautiful Yes i have grown up Although the movie experience will change for me But I still think it's worth 7 stars for the old times you know?
