This is the worst movie I've ever seen. But it is the best movie Sci Fi's original movie is probably bad. That's what makes them fun! The line "I like my dinosaur meat. Very good!" May be the best quote! In addition, the plot sounded like something out of the dream. I now imagine the writer waking up after a long night and playing the dance revolution and bringing the ideas together in this story: space marines to extraterrestrial planets. Protecting the science team is studying the planet. The best idea! In fact, the perfect sci fi original movie checklist: medieval dinosaurs, terrible space travels, <br /> <br /> So watch this movie.
