"Purple Rain" was never loved by critics. But it is a classic cult - and deserves to be If you are a prince, this thing is for you. <br /> <br /> The main plot is that the prince sees a disdainful parent in him and he falls in love with a girl. Believe it or not, this movie is not just singing and dancing. There are many violent scenes and a delightful story. Sometimes it comes out funny. But when it works, it really works Very cheap and missed. <br /> <br /> No one can really show in this movie. Everyone comes from one of the princes, such as "The Time" and "Vanity 6", but it adds charm to the movie. When the prince was on the screen, he lit up and enjoyed seeing him at his commercial peak. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, and watch this thing if you love the prince like me. If you are not a fan it will make you one.
