Overcoming the path to this important documentary that looks like an interesting feature. Forbidden Lie $ (2007) is just a better version of the book (the movie) of the Norman Khouri book of Forbidden Love and that is a bestseller. The onion of literary fraud and the beautiful woman Lie $ is the best reality television in the world. Editorial <br /> <br /> Cleverly correct and colorful, Broinowski's narrative is played by shadows. Norma Khouri's meaningfully. I disagree (with Variety) that it's too long. One of my minor problems is the nature of key players who comment on other people's recorded testimonials. To see the feelings of your storytelling become mired ..... So I watched it twice. <br /> <br /> Worthy efforts for this Oscar are funny and Not truly satisfied After that A clear attack occurred in Queensland's Australian state through personal fraud of friends and fans of Khouri (!). Obviously, these friends are now "turned" and the most fun line on the camera is Of Khouri's QLD neighbor Rachel Richardson, who talks about discouragement in the flat, without nonsense: "I think it's a burden sh! T. Personally" /> <br /> We need to learn. Know from the experience of So I believe in the spoiler. Anyone who lied to - the spinner who was caught lying to say anything to buy time to lie again <br /> <br /> There are some breathtaking images of Khouri lamenting in repetition. At this documentary, which pressed her (con) "artists" repeatedly for confirmation. <br /> <br /> Since being arrested in the morning in Sydney Herald reporter Caroline Overington and David Knox, one year after publication, Khouri was released but was tempted to return to the director to clear her name. She escaped unexpectedly because a) she was afraid of her crafty husband more than a loud Greek husband than Italy or b) because she needed her passport / visa to clear her name. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The more likely reason is that the FBI regained her path in Queensland before she crossed the country again (Guess: No, not Jordan) Khouri. Stay in between The FBI's investigation in 2007 <br /> <br /> I guess the audience might make Khouri benefit from the doubt when she calls for the most secrecy and secrecy. But the audience that I sat slowly slowly became just as indifferent as those trapped on the screen. When they were caught, there was a lot of retaliation and recent demands. A sigh of stress was emanating from an audience that didn't know how to bring Khouri's developed conflict. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker received a beautiful scene from the beginning to the end - even her own sacrifice. <br /> <br /> Anna launched her movie with a sympathetic book by her own Khouri. Reason Described for writing, it is credited with being credited at first - the key to lying throughout his working life: in half the truth, Khouri is a 35-year-old who is cute and very intelligent and has a formidable charm Surprisingly, the biceps exercised. <br /> <br /> Gradually, we were introduced to the Aussie journal, less and less advertisers. Fans who initially bought the scope of the accusations of killing honor Khouri hook, line and sinker Later, we saw more brutal reactions, self-control, and true stories. If someone might be a bit bitter, <br /> <br /> It's an activist to kill the noble people who killed Jordan. Khouri's failure because of the excitement of the pot, causing them to reduce the speed of change. The killing of honorable people occurred in Jordan. It is only their prevalence that contradicts Khouri's book - plus 72 "facts" in 2003. These activists sent a fax (Australia) randomly, whose houses were carefully objected 73 times. <Br / > <br /> Publishers across all four continents have the opportunity to step up to the first publication that Khouri's author has never tried to examine the facts from any confirmation to deny responsibility for Intellectual author of them, they are fair game. Therefore, this hot topic of fraud is easy to destroy the world while typing on internet cafes. <br /> <br /> Later, we were still shocked to find that "Facts error" extends to the bio of Khouri. D. For one thing, she not only But only a 35 year old virgin (her protection is not only her But does not make other people tame) but she has a lazy husband and 2 teenagers! Sometimes she speaks too fast in her American accent. She seems uncomfortable with mobile phone technology and western clothing. I realized this observation might sound prejudiced against the Jordanian women who didn't want any western father from me, but when even cultural guides didn't care about Khouri's "facts", you have to start asking your source. <br /> <br /> At some point, the filmmakers have the same conclusion. She made an admirable effort to hold Khouri as an account in Jordan. The last three people were used to finding facts, returning to Amman, where one "truth" fell again. Broinowski eventually forced her "artists" to accept the conflict in the decade of She and later Khouri recorded a secret confession that had been brought to her on her own digital camera. The secret, because in Jeremy, has heard "Jeremy, American security guard" of Khouri, heard that there is an Australian accent: he is an actor! (We never knew how Anna was revealed.) <br /> <br /> So this became the filmmaker's victory because she never set a flag with her voice or commitment. The exposure on her camera made her audience learn from the mistakes of others because of reasonable doubts. The FBI document - and Khouri's most startling crime, <br /> <br /> Anna Broinowski ( Watching her program now) is also smart enough to use one piece of art. (The main player unlocks comments on the video) to kill two birds, causing her audience to drink from the same pond again. <br /> <br /> In fact, despite She made me reassure that Overington and Knox won the Walkleys award for their "Norma Khouri Investigation" journalism investigation. <br /> <br /> Broinowski made me see (10/10)
