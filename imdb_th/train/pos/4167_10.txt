The Devil Dog: Hound of Hell is a really good movie. It has good performances by actors including Richard Crenna and RG Armstrong. The music sounds scary and cool to the devil. I like the effects with dogs and I think the creatures look cool With him, he looks like his neck Have never seen The Devil Dog: Hound of Hell before and can find and buy rare movies and do this because it's a good movie and I don't think you will be disappointed!
