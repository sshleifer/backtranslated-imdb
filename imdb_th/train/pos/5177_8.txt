I watched it last night after not watching for many years. It's a really fun little movie with a face that you never knew before. Arkin always shines. Try it. You won't be disappointed. By the way it was just released on DVD and in contrast to the packaging, it was widescreen The transfer is quite bad. But at least the WHOLE movie can be seen ;-)
