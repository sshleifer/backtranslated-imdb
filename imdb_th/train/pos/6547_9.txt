I brought my 10 year old daughter to see Nancy Drew on the weekend and found herself fully entertained. First of all, it's clean and I mean my standards. Most children's movies today are full of humor in the bathroom and jokes that are made to make cheap laughter from the crowd. Before the teen, Nancy Drew was smarter and the humor was smart and intelligent. <br /> <br / > The title role is bright by Emma Roberts, who is energetic and polite without being annoying. Which is different from The Brady Bunch Movie, which is an outdated character that is ridiculed and mocked. Nancy's style is treated with respect and honor. It was a great time when LA "style-conscious girls" with their Paris Hilton street costumes were expelled from the boutique owners while Nancy wore penny loafers. This film avoids the tac we have to enlighten for the many Hollywood movies. Nancy remained true to herself and her value. <br /> <br /> The mystery is quite tense enough to be involved. There were many suspicious moments when my daughter caught my arms nervously. But without a free shock scene It all depends on the tension and emotions and is very fun. The supporting role is good, especially Marshall Bell as an eerie caregiver. There is a great cameo from Eddie Jemison, Chris Kattan and Bruce Willis and many moments that will make adults smile. <br /> <br /> This film deserves a better score that some people give not only I'm glad that I wasn't dragged to another computer-animated movie that talks about burping animals and sending gas all over the place. But i was very fun If I was there without children, I would still enjoy the movie. This is a DVD that will have my daughter's name under the Christmas tree.
