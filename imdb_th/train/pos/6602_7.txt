(And the influence of Film Noir) Christian Walkman and the Renaissance <br /> <br /> It's the year 2054 in Paris. In the tradition of science fiction, the future is a sparkling and torn gem. This is a gem in the setting of misery, inequality and darkness; Bright and beautiful on the top, along with the underarms, one of the "bright" people at the top, a research scientist from a large and influential global company (Avalon) was kidnapped. Captain Karas, who is known and effective (Voiced by the new James Bond - Daniel Craig) has been assigned to find her. <br /> <br /> The story and layout are not too original. It has been heavily influenced by the Noir movie, Gibson's neurologist and other detective stories, including movies such as Blade Runner, Sin City, Fritz Lang's Metropolis and Minority Report. The main plot is surrounded by plot. Other sub-connections at the end It is not difficult to understand at all. <br /> <br /> The strength and novelty of the movie is in the presentation with intense images. Paris has many levels and sub-levels that are complex. At its base is a more traditional industrial infrastructure. As the city grew, the architectural complexity and its glow also increased. But in this structure, the upper part is not equivalent to the ideals and behaviors of human beings. Paris has been elaborately animated and placed in a wonderful black and white color. This movie has a spirit that is close to Sin City (comic). Then Sin City, the movie, is the source of it. This thing is all easier because it is still in the same media. animation In the same manner as the scanner, Darkly pushed the view of the narrative like this. Black and white light and darkness create an atmosphere of difference, including ambiguity of the image. Right and wrong, black and white may lose all meaning at the same time that is right in front of us. This film proves that black and white can be vague and clear at the same time. <br /> <br /> To be in line with the spirit of the film, I can be both a critic and a fan. I can love and hate in the same light. It is an experience that I recommend for the performing arts lovers. Therefore, pour black and tan into other people's emptiness and enjoy sitting.
