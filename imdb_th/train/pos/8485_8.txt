Gung Ho tries to express many opinions and entertain us with comedians at the same time. The result is uneven. But general entertainment Keaton balances all three aspects of his lead character quite well. Wantabedde even better. One warning: George Wendt is very poor in his supporting role. Otherwise it will be a very fun time capsule.
