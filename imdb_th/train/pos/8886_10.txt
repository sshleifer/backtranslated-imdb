I didn't live in the 60s, so I can't guarantee that this movie is the perfect representation of the moment. But it is an impressive and impressive experience There are some great performances, most notably by Josh Hamilton (with honors), Jerry O'Connell (Sliders), brothers and sisters, divided by the war, Bill Smitrovich. Saw the love-filled act as their strict father who was forced to ask his own beliefs and values Beside, while the other side is opposite All in all, this is a powerful and friendly movie that I hope everyone will have the opportunity to experience.
