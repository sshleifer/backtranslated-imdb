This is one of the unusual cases in which movies and novels that are based on both are excellent, probably because Gorris' uses Nabokov's initial ideas and gives different interpretations. The final result is the view of the Luzhin that makes him look more elegant than Nabokov's. <br /> <br /> The only thing in the movie I don't like is Valentinov's influence on the destiny of Luzhin. People like Valentinov and gave him a great influence on the argument of the novel.
