I didn't laugh that much for a long time, although this movie would have a tragic time, especially when it changed from Hyper Funny to honest and serious. The characters look very realistic sometimes, sometimes unbelievable. But can believe I'm not a fan of the program Jerry Springer - I feel sorry for the people who join. This movie is a satire and can be done well. <br /> <br /> Too bad that all the extra words were beeped while the film aired on public TV. I will rent this movie to enjoy it fully. <br /> <br />
