Great performances, stories - amazing, excellent scripts. <br /> <br /> Just a few ways to describe this movie. Yes, it's slow and it's mostly talking. But the whole story of their lives and how to tell events in and out makes you want to listen to every little thing to learn more about haunting and sad stories. I myself am reading a book that this movie created and it made me more enlightened in this story and answered some questions that have not been answered in the movie. I also have to read the songs of Exectioner's, which is the other half of the Gilmore story. This movie made me think a lot about the phrase. "Penetrating into the other side of the mirror." You heard the song in the movie called Gary Gilmore's Eyes, which is a punk band that writes songs about things that require Gary Gilmore's eyes (which is one of the things Gary gives. And when you listen to it, which was the last time after Mikal had seen Gary, you looked at the whole situation a little bit differently if you came here only This film opened my eyes like that, and in many ways I recommend this movie (and the book) very much.
