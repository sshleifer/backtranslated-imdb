Although Lang's version is more famous, Borzage's work is not useless: "Celestial" sequences are better than the metaphor of the train. (May borrow from the end of Abel More persuasive <br /> <br /> Borzage's tenderness for his character shows in the character of Marie and the love above the grave is one of his favorite subjects (ending The "three companions") The park seems to be everywhere: we see it, even when we are in Marie's poor home, I don't think that those scenes are wonderful. The way almost makes sense Science Films <br /> <br /> Borzage never forgot his social concerns: in a heavenly train up to the rich, unable to mix with riffraff, but as "Chief Justice" said: "There is no place here. The difference again. "<br /> <br /> Not an important task for Borzage (not Lang's version) but having to find out who you are. Interested in a great director's career
