Often over many years we can look back and see those stars that are truly stars. As a French film critic named I escaped, saying: "No Garbo, no Trish, no Louis Brooks only"; And that is thanks to heaven! Louis Brooks! This is the third time of her European masterpiece. But it was a great movie for being one, if not the first French radio talker for the follow-up of the script written by Ren√© Clair, famous for the finished news. How many talents in work and in movies can become a masterpiece! And that's what this movie is It is a shame. Louis Brooks was hit by Hollywood Hall when she returned to America. In this film, in addition to watching Louise Brooks, in practice, it is good to see a picture of Paris, California, 1930 and hear the small voice of Piaf. I never bored this thing!
