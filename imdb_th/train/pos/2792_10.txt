I love this movie. It is a great film that combines British and Indian culture with feminist issues, such as women who want to play sports that are reserved for men before. It shows the struggle of both Indians who want to break through the cultural barriers and women who want to violate the gender restrictions found in sports, especially in England at that time. I feel that cultural fighting is more important than other issues. <br /> In contrast to other opinions, I don't think this movie is like dirty dance or other chicks. This movement is loved by many types of men and women, children and adults alike.
