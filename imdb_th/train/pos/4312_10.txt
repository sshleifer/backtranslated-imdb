If you haven't seen a great movie about life in the 90s (in L.A.), show that you missed special care. This film is one of the most powerful and amazing movies that has ever been about the lives of Americans in the 90s, and it also leads to the current world in which we live. It covers everything from raising children to prejudice. (More than one method) love, fornication, empty ovaries, selfishness, etc. and the items that occur This story was created for the ultimate climax when there was nothing important. It returned to love with friends and family and the love of life It helps us dig deep inside us and make us search for what we want from life. Makes us ask our own questions We have done enough for others. Are we like this? Sit back and enjoy the amazingly crafted movies and emotions that I'm sure others will enjoy throughout their lives. <br /> <br /> Take notes, Mary Mcdonnell, Kevin Kline and Danny's great performance. Glover through all this movie These actors are amazing and show the glow and the true meaning of the message sent to all of us. These three of my favorite actors for life after watching this movie 10 years ago now. I still enjoy it again and again. Enjoy the great soundtrack as well and don't forget to count how many times you see a helicopter flying and think about whether it's a symbol for this movie. Hmmm ... I almost forgot that this might be The first time Steve Acting in every movie he had done He also did a great job in this movie. This may surprise you a lot. Lean back, relax and enjoy a truly good movie creation .....
