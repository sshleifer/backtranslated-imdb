This is an action movie that is almost impossible to follow after Jack, who is insomniac as he goes through hallucinations, visits a dead friend and throws himself out of the building and many times can't tell the truth from the picture. <Br> <br /> Dominic Monaghan as Jack truly believes Confused and frightened But drowsiness and sometimes accepting what he saw emptyly, we followed him to try to classify what he saw and find a way to sleep. <br /> <br /> Guide dogs to talk. (Other hallucinations) and children who appeared in Jack's bathroom and bedroom without any explanation of how they got there. (More hallucinations) and you have an interesting, trusting heart 43 minutes and the shower scene is enough
