The old horror movies are interesting, many screams, shouts and lots of humor. "The Blob" is a classic in his own work. Steve McQueen (1930-80) plays a teenager who tries to be a hero in his city. Dating to women is normal for all teenagers. But when the old man discovered the same falling object in the sky, he became a victim and Steve helped him as best as possible. When it comes to the power of a teenager, this movie really gives it. I know that most teenagers have their hardships when they do it when they arrive. They must learn to forget the past and start doing good things to save humanity. When adults in the city learn about the difficult ways of "Blob" that run rampant, they have to learn to trust teenagers and refuse to give up their behavior. The juggernaut is cute in the daytime and in the minds of Me, I think it's JELL-O! When everyone came to stop the threat, this city was safe again. Thanks to good old cooperation. I also eat Jello and watch this movie all the time. If you don't like Jello, TOUGH! Rate 5 stars
