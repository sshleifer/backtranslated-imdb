I strongly agree that "nothing" is a great movie! I didn't laugh a lot when watching movies for a long time! And David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are great in this matter! They work really well together! This movie may not attract people. (I can't say why without losing!) But each story is my own! I like it very much and recommend it. <br /> <br /> The governance is great and some shots are very smart It seems that they may enjoy shooting. <br /> <br /> Although there are only 2 main characters in the movie Makes the movie look fun
