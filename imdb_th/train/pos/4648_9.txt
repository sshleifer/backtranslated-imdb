Hilarious movies bring confusion and greatness. Remind me of L'Age D'Or of Bunuel or the holy mountain of Jodorowsky - many strange characters that are pretending to look ..... what is it? I laughed almost all the time while watching the surprising reactions of the audience that surrounded me in the theater. Entertaining through and passing from the beginning to the brave and poisoned internal organs all the way to the end if it is the end. I just wish I could remember every detail. Sometimes it haunts me. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I have the best memories in this movie. Seems not ready to go home and watch. I think I will have to wait a few years until Crispin Glover will come to me again with his Big Slide Show (and later "What is?") ... I saw this film in Atlanta almost immediately after being involved in a car accident that was quite serious, so I felt a little baffled at that time, which could be a very good mental state to watch the articulated animals. The predicted and those in. A superhero and Glover gods set in the proper burly-Q setting of his scantily clad, rising from the ground like DADAist's drenched dream. <br /> <br /> It's a living statement. Do we know? Of course, everyone will receive art works. I think the truth is clearer than in the absence and in the space. What you don't tell us is what we have to infer. But is more accurate than lying that others feed us all day and day Quite one "What is it?" More than 5,000 movies, such as "Titanic" or "Sleepless in Seattle" (shivering, gag, groan) <br /> Thank you Glover (also a fun person to Look on the screen or at Big Slide Show - Smart, funny, quirky and hot.) Create more movies, write more books, keep nightmares alive.
