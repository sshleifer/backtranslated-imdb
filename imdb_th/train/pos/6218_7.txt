79/100 Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers have never done anything except great movies together. Although this is not one of the best But it is a great musical drama There are a few outstanding musical numbers, good support from Randolph Scott, two notable appearances, Betty Grable and Lucille Ball, making the on-screen display memorable The ball is especially good and blond hair too. "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is one of the best numbers of double music. Harriet Hillard knows that Harriet Nelson's "Ozzie and Harriet" plays Ginger Roger's sister. The plot is quite familiar. But with this great actor it works Great direction and art score
