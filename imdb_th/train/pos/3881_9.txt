This movie gave me an incredibly open scene which gave me a completely different perspective. The theme of this movie is that everyone is acting, trying to invent new ones. But not in a complicated form such as Identity or The Usual Suspects, but in the way that we all try to do anything that is normal At one point, Jorgen (the owner of a chicken farm) attended a seminar on laughs, which he was the worst student. His inconvenience in this thing makes you see the strong desire to change himself. This movie surprised me about the hidden mysteries hidden behind the surface of the most ordinary people I see every day. There is not much plot here. Guessing the secret of the old man is quite easy. But that passion lies in trying to guess what other characters will do when they figure it out. This movie attracted me in the same way that Sideways do, although the characters are not very different.
