I love and admire the Farrelly brothers! Why do I only see this great movie after 3 years? It makes me laugh. It makes me cry and it makes my heart warm. Big time. It's hard to explain in my rotten English - but I have to try anyway: <br /> <br /> That actor Excellent throughout - from the leading role to the role that supports the show is very good. The film is completely directed and edited. <br /> <br /> I think the movies of the Farrell brothers are often underestimated - they are not light comedies - they look good! What are they talking about life? (I won't tell you!) <br /> <br /> In my case, this movie confirms to me that all relationships are related: <br /> <br /> If you love someone: let Be free, let them be - try to share love and pain and always be true. <br /> <br /> I'm not a person who hates sports. But in this movie - the feeling will get you. I smell the atmosphere of baseball. Finally, this movie explains to me how being a sports fan might mean to you, and the cool fans must be there. <br /> <br /> Thank you Pete & Bob! <br /> br> PS: If you haven't seen it yet - check out KINGPIN!
