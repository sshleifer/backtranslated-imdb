Actually, I like what I've seen in this cartoon. Of course, animation is not the best. But frankly, I would like to see this style of cartoon that is faster and cheaper than the old style that is fast and cheap. (Which happens more often - is a style that looks good when wearing time and effort). There is nothing wrong with corner lines and tiny black eyes - in fact, I think it's really cute. As a child, I never thought that the design of Scooby-Doo was particularly cute. But I think I should like it more. <br /> <br /> However, Shaggy is a character that I always like and believe or not, but I think he has the highest potential in depth. Of course, acting doesn't focus on "Unraveling the mystery", but it's an old formula that is outdated. Don't understand me wrong - I'm sure there are writers there that will be able to attract the attention of Mystery Inc. (which has been out of line), but at this time it's a fun diversion from the standard. Shaggy and Scooby are still funny but not Just relief the cartoon They are still cowardly. But eventually had the opportunity to use what appears to be (shocked!) Ingenuity, but now it seems that their lives will be helped by the succession of Uncle Albert. <br /> <br /> I used to find Scooby-Doo's traditional jokes before being the best pure and hilarious cheese. But this show really does exercise the ability for true humor In addition, I never liked Casey Kasem like Shaggy anyway, so new actors didn't bother me as much as everyone else (I still think that Billy West is the best) <br /> <br /> Overall though. Not a great cartoon in the scope of all comic history. But still succeeded in other branches of Scooby
