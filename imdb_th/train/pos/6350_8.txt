I waited and waited for this movie. For example, it seems that for many years it was worth it. I'm not a big fan of watching movies over and over again. But I can't wait for it to be bought! Not a big fan of Jim. But it fits him perfectly. There is so much to see and 'Good feelings' are out of bounds, suitable for Christmas. I think Ron works very well, makes it into a movie. If you don't see it, do it. If you have a look again, I know you want!
