Wonderful surprise of Spanish movies I never thought that Jordi Molla would be a great director. I didn't care about his choices in the movie. However, this movie is great and cannot be predicted ... the thing that I always like! It's not that much fun and I don't think it will be marketed in the United States. We must be satisfied with ourselves with a DVD or VHS. If so ... I don't want to say anything about it because I don't want to lose you. But basically this movie is about the homeless. Became a newcomer just to kick and receive money from it (such as sooooooooooo many) before he knew he was immersed in a life he didn't count
