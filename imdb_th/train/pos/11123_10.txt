Greetings from this Portuguese man :) <br /> <br /> I believe that the soprano is one of the best works I've ever had. It is both true and mixed. It has the same quality as GodFather! James Gandolfini puts paper into gloves! I will love the soprano. I won't finish it. It's perfect! It should be a school subject :) I saw the Sopranos as a child. But I'm too young to wake up until the end, so now I bought all the Episodes in DVD format and I watched all the episodes at home. And after dinner and I was stuck like I had done with the Prison Break. In my opinion, Prison Break and The Sopranos are the best series ever on television. The arguments of both were excellent and the actors were perfect. Congratulations on the work. <br /> <br /> Sorry for my English. Thanks for reading.
