The main reason for watching this movie is Warren William, which is in the best form as a campaign manager. He is an electric shyster. Find a way to fool the people and beat the opposing party amid the biggest disaster. Great - I feel that he never received him. Betty Davis, as his girlfriend, has a role in writing. Personally, I found Guy Kibbee quite wrong as an incompetent candidate that William and others are trying to attack. He seems to be an empty canvas rather than a person. I want to see the real characters appear more than the characters that are not characters. The story is unbelievable, ridiculous, nonsensical, and ancient. But Warren Williams and Betty Davis are worth watching
