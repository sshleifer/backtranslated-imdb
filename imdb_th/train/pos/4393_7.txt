Ang Lee clearly likes to relax in this film to catch the action, character and hoof setting, covering the haphazard endgame of the American Civil War through the haphazard actions of young volunteers, not in the heart or being Man, this is an ideal way. This film is about the formation of personality, age and relationships. Lee also shows beautiful panoramas of the South Central region as a quiet character that stands fiercely like a strong parent. James Schamus's script is probably the standard bearer for this film. In the end, it is a well-decorated and impressive performance. Jeffrey Wright's name alone can bring this movie to me. He's very smart here. But has a slower role: instead of getting a very good performance (If not revealed) from a large and often known band. <br /> <br /> Good movie. One to see that you don't like the fancy Cold Cold or the Claim mountains that are harder. 7/10
