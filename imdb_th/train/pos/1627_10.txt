Blonde and Blonder have Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards in almost every scene, and if you want more from the movie, you will be utterly illogical. It feels like the end of the Carry On era when the series is no longer eye-catching. But it's still funny than you think behind or English Can say The supporting actors are powerful, although some people in the team are not good. I can't see Duff turning to see a forgotten movie that makes a huge difference to anything. So just smile. I think Blonde and Blonder are really ace and I hope you hate me.
