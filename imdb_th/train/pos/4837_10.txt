I am a small movie student in the year 1979, when the Soviet filmmakers union came to Sofia, Bulgaria and launched the "Siberiade" of Konchalovsky; Tarkosvky's "Stalker" and Danelia'a "Autumn marathon". After that I saw "Siberia" 4 and 1/2 hours that were great and could not speak. The better way is Bertolucci "1900". At this point, <br /> <br /> hope that Andron will be adversely affected and make "The full-length version of the revival director" Someday! Of course, DVD! In addition, I fought hard to protect this film with most of my colleagues who were comparing Soviet movies with bad taste! Time is by my side
