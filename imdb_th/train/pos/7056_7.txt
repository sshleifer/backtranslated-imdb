The sequel of the popular Cinderella story reminds me of what they did with one of the beauty and beast movies. It's three short stories that are combined together. <br /> <br /> Okay, cute. (I love Gus! He's so cute!) And Lucifer is great (as usual). I like some new characters as well (Pom Pom is cute and I like Prudence). Yet the story is quite limited but still very cute So I voted 7/10
