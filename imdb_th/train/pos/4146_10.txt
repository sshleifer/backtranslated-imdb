Everyone who lives in the age of revenge of Nerds and Girlpower will like this movie. It's one of the movies that gives you everything you need in the movie "Spring break" PLUS. It's fun for college movies. It's funny. There are actors that will die instead. (Amy Pohler! Rachel Dratch!, Sophie Monk!, Parker Posey! Jane Lynch! Amber Tamblyn! Missi Pyle!) And guaranteed to make you laugh out loud. Rachel Dratch is a cartoon genius and Sophie Monk is a great villain. Wilson Phillips! Oh God! (I am now doing myself over and over again ...) It will be with women who like Miranda July but feel like eating ice cream and pretending to be stupid.
