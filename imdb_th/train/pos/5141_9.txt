I must admit that I did not expect to see this movie much in my Japenese movie class, but this movie really disappointed me. The director has done a great job after receiving the title of this film, which shows the true image of madness. I think the fact that this film is silent helps increase the resemblance to madness, allowing viewers to experience the characters in the outside world rather than the outside world. This film just added my feelings about foreign silent movies with American in which foreign movies work more to exercise your mind and make you think instead of going for a fluffy movie always with a happy ending.
