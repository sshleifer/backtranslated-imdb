This is what I expected. When the star trek DS9 premiered without the DS9, it was a great performance in its own right. But it never gave the fans more than what they wanted That organization shows While similar to the original trek, it is different enough to be original in its own form. Makes the exploration idea exciting for us again And that is one of the main ingredients that make the original to be loved The component that leads to success is the relationship developed between the crew members. The audience cares very much about the crew. The organization has many contracts in this area as well. The chemistry between Bakula and Bloc seems to have a high possibility. While sexual tension in the show often becomes a prop, I feel that the tension in the organization can lead to more and more talk than usual. I think that when we deal with great characters such as different races or races, we get interesting ideas and television. In addition, we should observe the performance. Blalock is very convinced because Vulcan T'pol and Bacula have a strange and strong character that gives great performances The remaining actors give good performances as well. My single Grip is as follows. Theme. It's a good story. It's different. But a little to be comforted for my liking We need something a little bigger. No need to be a band. Perhaps there is something that has more electronic sound than enough. And one more complaint of mine They sell too much They can be resolved by selling less advertising or making everyone show two parts. Otherwise, we will end up seeing the final show ending too soon, as well as my complaints about Voyager.
