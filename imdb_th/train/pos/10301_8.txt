Bruce Almighty, one of Carrey's best pictures since ... well ... for a long time, it has one of the most fun scenes I've seen for a long time ... Morgan Freeman plays God well It has a romantic moment, one or two boring moments. But it's a great movie with a funny scene The best scene is where Jim is speaking the voice of the announcer. <br /> <br /> My score: 8/10
