"Fraidy Cat" cartoon 4 of this story is a good game. At least I like it, so I was surprised that this is a mixed review. <br /> <br /> This is a disgusting story rather than a joke, even though it has a funny time. Dark and scary atmosphere Suspense is another strong element here. Most humor is dark. <br /> <br /> In the short term, Tom listens to a creepy radio program at night and is terrified because it's about ghosts. While Tom is afraid of death, Jerry is watching everything and can't help. But laughing all the time In fact, Jerry hurries to find more ways to torture him. With the help of white shirts and vacuum cleaners, he creates a "big ghost". <br /> <br /> Tom lives the most terrifying life. Throughout his life, though, Jerry made Tom afraid without reason. But how to make the story become a joke Again, there is no violence here, because this is one of Tom & Jerry's oldest cartoons. However, I didn't get Tom's jokes for the nine lives that were almost sucked into the vacuum cleaner. <br /> <br / > Finally, when Tom discovers that it is the entire project of Jerry and Jerry fooling him. Jerry was «caught by hand in a cookie jar» (he deserves discovery), but Tom showed incredible patience before reacting. He watched Jerry furiously for about a minute. The funny thing is that Jerry invites Tom to laugh with him and takes about half a minute to realize that Tom looks at him with a very serious face. Jerry tries to joke, but Tom doesn't laugh. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is A different, strange and amazing Tom & Jerry experience.
