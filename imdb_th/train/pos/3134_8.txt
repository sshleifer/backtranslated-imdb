This is a well-written story about the creation of Batman Sitcom and actually combines our heroes on a fantastic quest and presents their TV history. Unlike the documentary films of the Brady Family and Partridge, we not only But looking into the past and present lives of Adam and Bert only But still saw them return to work again, filled with Kapow's and catwomen and Riddler (Batman). Batman returned to tell the story well. But made us very popular in the Batman series But still add modernity to the fans, never heard for 35 years. <br /> <br /> Glory !!!
