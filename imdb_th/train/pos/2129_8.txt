A sweet romantic drama / comedy about Stewart and Sullavan. Write a love letter without knowing who it is. By nature, they work together and cannot stand together. You can guess the rest. It is performed beautifully by all actors (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan). There is a clever script that looks absolutely amazing. It happened in Budapest and was shot in Hollywood. But I found myself believing that I saw Budapest! Everything looks perfect and like a dream. One type of movie, don't miss!
