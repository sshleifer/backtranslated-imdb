This is what movies should be when trying to capture the essence of things that are very surreal. It has a lot of noise that is rarely taken on film. It feels like a dream, respectively, and brings you into the darkest memories. Children are very much convinced and I expect to have something that will happen in the future. The show is very natural for children. I don't know if Bill pulled it from there or just that. But nothing less wonderful Bill scored as much as I was concerned and for KevNJeff's comments about Paxton's bad performances, one thing that could be done in that role He played quite well in my opinion. This is from someone who says Hamlet is good (Ethan Hawke version?) Wow ......... Do not listen to his comments. A wonderful flick that will make you feel really uncomfortable if that's what you want? The movie received a higher score than the average.
