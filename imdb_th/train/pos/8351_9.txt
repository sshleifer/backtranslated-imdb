I remember walking to Spain at the age of 25, raised from what appeared to be two robbers fleeing from Italy. They are doing a lot of things outside of the rules, but from the other side, holding pictures of Jesus in their pockets to protect them ... just and unjust, good and bad, criminals and right here in the new outfits. The category that I used to know 'Les Valseuses' for me, even though movies and non-real life images are close to my experience: the intensity of each moment as soon as you leave 'behind the scenes' and go on to important moments, no matter what happens. The state of mind and the form of 'danger' of life because, as we all know, there are people who are not ready for this matter and are willing to bully you for 'stealing' and more ... This movie has value ' It's a story about 'Right and wrong': morality. It is the resurrection of the person who fought with him / her to be free from 'False morals' and reconciliation ... are dangerous all the way, because you can go with your own 'freedom', how far and across your own moral border. People? What to do with people who are willing to hurt you in jail or even shoot at you for what you do, such as "stealing" gasoline from multinational oil companies for five-hand cars. Les Valseuses awakens these questions again in me because of moral conflicts. And 'general' media messages are quite complex ...
