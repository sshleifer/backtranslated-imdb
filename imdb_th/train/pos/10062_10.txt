Wow. It's a great movie. The script is almost perfect. It appears that this is the only film written by Minglun Wei. I hope he has a story in him. <br /> <br /> The performance is noble. Renying Zhou as a doggie is amazing. Very natural and Xu Zhu is a delightful person - can believe as a boring old traditionalist. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is very powerful, guided without being overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> If there are more movies like this Whether in Hollywood or Hong Kong - being friendly with the family, performing well, writing well, directing well near the gem
