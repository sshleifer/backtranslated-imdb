This movie is not surprising that this film has never appeared on a big screen in Denmark, so I have to wait for the video release. My expectations are high. But they are not as disappointed as Ang Lee, who has a great performance, an intelligent and exciting plot that lets you guess until the end, and a great filming with Unforgiven. This is one of the two. The best west of the 90's. <br /> <br /> Some of the expected people along the lines of Mel Gibson in The Patriot (corny) or Braveheart (acceptable) are sour, disappointing everyone else who admires such qualities. The above will have a peak time. Great to watch 9 out of 10
