This film is a documented transformation experience for young men and the viewing experience is on its own for the audience. There are only a few movies that desire this level of superiority and I think of other films, whether it's a documentary or drama There is no other movie that I both laughed a lot and cried a lot. Yes, it's about DMD and accessible travel. In those issues alone, it is a worthwhile investment. But more It's about friendship. It's about your own life, about living every day you live. And it is a fun and exciting storytelling This is the reason God created the cinema! Watch this movie !!!
