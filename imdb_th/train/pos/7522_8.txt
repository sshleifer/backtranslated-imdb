"The Notorious Bettie Page" is about a woman who always wants to be an actor. But became one of the most famous women in American history. Bettie Page, played by Gretchen Mol, is one of the first sex icons in America. Types of modeling Bettie Page participates in nudity and slavery, which led to the investigation of the United States Senate in 1950. <br /> <br /> Walking out of the movie, all I can think of is How far have we come In terms of pornography since the 1950s, you can now get to the internet and find the most annoying and frightening images ever seen. The pictures asked in "The Nettious Bettie Page" seem innocent and innocent. Most images, including slavery, do not have nudity when Betty Page is involved. But today we have a sick image where we can see women having sex with animals. I found that perhaps the envelope was pushed a bit far since the 1950s. Because watching this movie in terms of pornography today is done with taste. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was impressed. With "The Notorious Bettie Page". I found this movie to be very good and interesting. This movie is an example that makes you believe that it will be and is a very interesting look at one of the first female icons in America. Gretchen Mol looks like Bettie Page and gives a very good performance. I also thought that because this film was filmed in black and white, it made the movie look realistic because it convinced the audience that they were watching a movie created in the late 1950s. <br /> <br /> I'm just a person. The only complaint about this movie As a working time, there seems to be some cut scenes and seems to be shorter than they should be. I searched for it and it seemed that 10 minutes would be cut from the movie since the original performance at the Toronto Film Festival. The ending is quite tame and I hope there will be a lot more from it, or maybe there will be some paragraphs coming up on the screen to tell the audience about Betty's life in which the movie was dropped. This is just two of my complaints about the film other than the director being the director. The performance is excellent, especially Gretchen and writing well. <br /> <br /> Mary Harron Director "American Psycho", one of my favorite films, is the director and writer of "The Notorious Bettie Page". I feel that Mary is a very talented director who knows how to create a scene and make a movie. Which is excellent according to the characters, for example, "Psycho" Betty Page is a study of the characters and things that were good at that time. Harron captured the 40's and 50's as easily as all the characters. She is a very talented director, which I hope to receive in the years ahead. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: "The Nettious Bettie Page" is worth watching. It is a very interesting story that shows how far America and the world have come in terms of pornography. The film also works well by Gretchen Mol, who emphasizes the role of Bettie Page on the head and above all with a talented director who can capture and feel the previous era and you have a good movie in Your hand Sadly, this film may fail because there are not many people who grew up in this era to show interest in this film. But I think it should be worth considering. <br /> <br /> Final score of MovieManMenzel For the movie The Notorious Bettie Page "is 8/10, an interesting character study about one of the most famous women and sex icons in American history.
