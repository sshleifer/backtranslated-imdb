Recently, I met this movie about TNT five minutes while on a vacation in Florida ... (Hey, must have time to stop in the hotel, right?) At first, I was surprised to see Melissa Joan. Hart in everything. TNT. I mean "Drive Me Crazy". Not old. <br /> <br /> But I'm stuck with it and am very surprised and entertained. Melissa plays an excellent role in Jennifer Psycho. Supporting actors (Nick, ex-girlfriend, Karen, her best friend, and parents who control her life) all add great confidence. Finally, it is a good closing for this woman who seems to be one step in everyone. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, try to see <br /> <br />
