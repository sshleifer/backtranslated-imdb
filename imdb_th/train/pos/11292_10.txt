I used to watch this movie once as a child on the late show and fell in love with it. <br /> <br /> It took 30 years, but recently I discovered it on both DVDs - in the car. Catalog specializing in war movies We watched it last night for the first time. Sounds good, but it's grainy and there are trailers between the wheels. Even though it's better than I can remember. I was impressed with the fact that it was like playing. <br /> <br /> The catalog is here. If you are sincere in finding the fire, I miss it and I'll see if I can get the information. cartwrightbride@yahoo.com
