Downey, others will see! If you're a big fan like me, you have to watch this movie! He played Alec Finch, a 22-year-old Yale graduate, who realized that the life he had just entered was the life he had left 26 years ago. Alex is the incarnation of Louie Jeffries, an absurd lawyer Married to Corrine (Cybil Sheppard) happily. Louie was killed on their one year anniversary when he was hit by a car. He wants to go back again, this time in Alex Finch's body, into Robert Downey Jr., a lot of confusion and laughs. <br /> <br /> Although this movie will be 15 years old, but still Makes you wonder whether or not this kind of thing really happened. And if so, how often do you find the same spirit life after life? I don't know the answer But i know you have to watch this movie It's a riot and Downey looks good in a tuxedo. This movie makes you believe in true love and love, never die. It has just been recycled.
