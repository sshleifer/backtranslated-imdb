Although I admit that it is a good movie But not very good for many reasons that other posters talk about But i still enjoy it One reason is music: I would like to pay attention to the cool appearance of the Candoli-Conte and Pete brothers - in a good scene in a nightclub. These guys are the two best jazz singers each day and they can convince Jimmy Stewart by playing a pair of trumpet, which is one of Stewart's ears. Candolis also plays well, even though I wonder if The real song for that scene was later dubbed by the two of them. I don't know much about George Duning, who gets credit for music. (Besides that he seems to have worked with the Three Stooges more than once) but the selection of Candoli's brother as a jazz musician is Real good touch
