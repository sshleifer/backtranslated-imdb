This documentary by Marian Cooper is absolutely amazing. I saw it tonight in Turner Classic Movie. I think I will see if I can order a copy on DVD. This movie does not look blurry and absent like you thought in the silent film, 1925, located in Iran in the year. Fri. 1925. The nomadic tribes in the documentary left the desert house and crossed the crazy river. Men, women, children, animals ... Then go up on the snowy mountains, passing Barefoot. In search of grass for their animals, they have cows, goats, dogs, horses, mules. In one scene, a man holds a mule which is too sick to climb a mountain. Children in the documentary, everyone looks happy and healthy good They have a difficult life. I wonder if the nomadic tribes of Iran are still alive like this? Make you impressed with modern life in the United States.
