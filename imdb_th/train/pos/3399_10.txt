This is 101 movies of Eddie Robinson and his last film, and he died of cancer nine days after the filming was completed. Which all makes his important scenes in the movie even more painful. <br /> <br /> Although some hair styles and clothes may be outdated (Like recording video games shown in movies) but the story of the film is immortal Many things make this movie a classic movie. The story is stable. <br /> <br /> The performance is excellent, especially the interaction between Heston and Robinson with good performances from Cotten and Peters. <br /> <br /> The perfect music. Beethoven, Grieg and Tchaikovsky combined with the composition of the monk make the scene truly moving. This is the icing on the cake for the movie. <br /> <br /> And the theme (or "point") of this movie is important. Yes, it's a movie about overpopulation. But on a more important note, it is a warning about what might be wrong with the protection of the human world. It is in the subtitles that you find the true text of this film. Pay attention to what Seoul said about the "old days" in the past (which is our present) and observe that Thorn couldn't understand what Seoul was saying. Is one of my best Sci-Fi movie all the time
