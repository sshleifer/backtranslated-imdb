During the one year that people pretended to be "Synecdoche, New York", the movie caused by Charlie Kauffman's own indulgent release came to a movie that was hard to look similar. "Frownland" is a work of love of the crew, actors and filmmakers who have been filming for many years by friends. It is a trace of men who cannot truly communicate through his true world of Brooklyn The person you see is a step above even the "mumblecore" movement. They are actually trapped in their own nerves painfully, unwilling to change, unable to. The real world for them is their own set of delusions, and since this is a movie about people who can't deeply touch it, it's hard to watch. It is a 16 mm movie creation without any light, money or other factors that will make the movie "slippery" but its honesty cannot really say the fact that it will make the room full of people to abandon it. And Richard Linklater rewarded as he did at SXSW. This reminds movies like "Naked" or "mumblecore". The best, it's a movie that isn't for everyone. But it is a challenge that you watch and grow
