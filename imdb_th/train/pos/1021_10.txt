The first season and the second season started shaky, with good episodes separated between normal times and sometimes turned to the use of ancient thought stories. But when it began to set up the universe that it had and began to develop more characters, it became more fun and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The main reason for this performance was successful because four men were Richard Dean Anderson, Peter Deluise, Joseph Malozzie and Paul Mullie, Richard's dreary humor makes the show much better The joke interesting /> <br /> When you share, understand <br show is all about and get to know the characters, I suspect you will not like the show. For those who come to the program, I recommend the 'The Other Side' episode, which is a very good episode and 'Window of Opportunity', which is a classic cartoon episode.
