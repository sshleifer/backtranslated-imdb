This is a strong film from an historical and epic perspective. While the story is simple But pure and straightforward In fact, it is a standard story of a simple, respectable person whose dignity is in conflict with those who are educated and rich in that era. <br /> <br /> The poor, but the story tells Without the luxury of Hollywood causing the screen to stink up <br /> <br /> extra points just because you almost smell the people on the screen :)
