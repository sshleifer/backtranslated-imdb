This is a strange movie about archaeologists who studied the culture of the ancient Indian Hohokam. She took a mummy. (Looking at a fake item) leaving the burial cave and bringing it home to study Soon she began to show strange characters and talked to this mummy. And soon after, her son was possessed by the spirit of the mummy Even the events that happened to strangers while the spirit tried to destroy the family of women. This is really boring, overall, and it will make you sleep the first few times you try to watch. But if you keep it, you may end it. <br /> <br /> Ah! What is the secret of mummies? Is the angry mummy spirit that has been removed from the cave? You may not be able to confirm what the spirit of inspiration is, but if you like shenanigans like ghosts in a low budget (and 70's hairstyle!), This will have an attractive charm. <br /> <br /> The way I have explained the story more clearly than the chaos that the movie put on the story. Is boring movie really a fascinating thing? Hmm ... Anyhow, this one was successful. Perhaps this is a good movie at the heart. But proceeding in a way that is quite uncomfortable. I don't know. What I know is that I don't really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Spider Baby" will be interested in knowing that music is used in This film is two stories. (Including the soundtrack of the accompanying song) <br /> <br /> Presenting a scary and quite good sequence that shows the stones and stones rolling by themselves and eventually attacking some people. In the camp, other scenes in the movie are just creepy or strange stories. But this scene is really scary. <br /> <br /> Look here! It's strange and worth your time. You may want one on your shelves.
