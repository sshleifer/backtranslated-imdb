I saw this movie for the first time about 20 years ago and never forgot. It was beautifully filmed and the story was always fascinated. It's hard to believe that this was created in 1946 because the story is still fresh today. I don't have much knowledge about movie techniques. But the special effects in this film are great when considering this. In addition, the performance is excellent and the use of British and American actors is quite surprising. I just bought a DVD, so now I can watch it whenever I want. I would recommend to anyone interested in British movies after the war. See this story.
