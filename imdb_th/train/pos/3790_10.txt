I accidentally adjusted this in the independent movie channel and was stuck with that. I am a professional actor and I am confused about acting. They feel that they have been completely adapted without any impact. I can't tell if it's being scripted or whether it's shot and wait until the end to see the credit and spend half an hour on IMDb to search. Do not miss this movie. I saw that the director wrote a very good movie called Everyday People, which I like it a lot. The shame of the movie business is that this great project is not published and the advertising they deserve and live under the radar. This film deserves to fly high and proud. I ask people to search and see
