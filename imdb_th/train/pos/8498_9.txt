This film is a great movie with a fun story, clever and dynamic of cultural differences and the theme of the work of important things in life, making this movie very popular. Don't let the cynicism of the world hinder you from seeing this. Keaton had a great time, and I wondered if the fact that comedy had never been appreciated because actors like Keaton were made from humor to serious things. Great movies around!
