A qualified gentleman, Cuba Gooding Jr., in what seems to be his best performance on the day he played Carl Brashear, a brave man and a towering hero. He is a poor farmer from the south who wants to be a diver in the navy - but there is a problem due to his competition. The head of the diving school, played by Robert De Niro, is a racist intolerance that grows to respect Bra This film is about the way that Bashchor agrees with the odds that are almost unbeatable, not just once, but twice. The performance is what makes this movie special. Gooding is great and DeNiro is The best show in film history. Delivers excellent performances. - His greatest work in many years. Charlize Theron once again gave good results as a wife. The DeNiro film is laid on a little too strong patriotism. (Although there is nowhere near the level that is in THE PATRIOT) and only a few characters are terrible. Is a rare thing in movies today It's elevated and meaningless. Great movie
