Every time there is a movie release, no one has heard and shot in a short time with little money and resources. But everyone is crazy about it and turns into a surprisingly wonderful movie. This happened in the 1950s with little movies that no one ever heard. There were surprising little little gemstones from the 50s that should be worth digging. "Panic in the Streets" is a movie. Another story that caused the idea Both are movies that do not like the usual time and made with limited resources. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised how much I liked this movie. It is a movie that is getting better and better as it progresses. Like all movies that tend to start slowly But when you enter the story and be the character that you will get with this movie, <br /> <br /> This movie has a really wonderful story. Related to espionage, even if the movie doesn't start like that It started with a typical crime thriller with a film noir, but "Pickup on South Street" is not just a movie by numbers, so it begins to turn its direction shortly. It ensures that this movie will still be surprising. But above all, being refreshed by watching. <br /> <br /> I like the characters in the movie. None of them are really good people and they all have their flaws and weaknesses. Really humane There is also a great performance, especially from Thelma Ritter, who has been nominated for an Academy Award. It must be one of the greatest female roles I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Despite the relatively low budget But it is a great, original and original movie that should be seen! <br /> <br /> 10/10
