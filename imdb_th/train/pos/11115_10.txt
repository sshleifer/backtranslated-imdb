I believe that The Sopranos is a great program because there are all the supporting characters in it. I have bought every video until now and are waiting for the rest to be released in all 42 episodes. The best thing is Episode 3, Reject, Anger, Acceptance. Now relates to the character that I like best. Forever in The Sopranos, his name is Brendan Filone. He was killed because of a wrong truck hijack and accidentally killing a truck driver. Brendan is great because he is one of the few characters who stands against Tony and his gang. In the end, he was shot through the eyes while bathing and that was the scene I liked the most in the history of The Sopranos. Brendan Filone is # 1 for me and the second favorite character is Matthew Bevilaqua who was killed. After trying to kill Christopher Moltisanti, Tony and his pussy shot him in Hucklebarney Park after they caught and tortured him. The third most favorite character is Sean Gismonte, who was killed after shooting Christopher. And finally, my favorite character, 4th place, is Chucky Signore, one of Uncle Junior's followers. Tony is killed on board by Tony. All the wonderful characters are dead. That's the only bad thing about a soprano singer. Every young man must always be killed. How do you know what will be good in changing about Sopranos? They should have both when they show the characters that are dead in hell and they're trying to torture Chris Tony, Uncle Junior, Silvio and Polly because they want revenge on Brendan. Filone will hit back !!!!!!!!! 1
