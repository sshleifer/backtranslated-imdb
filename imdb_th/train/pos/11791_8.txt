This is an interesting short film by David Lynch and speaking of David Lynch's name may be enough for a lot of people. This is Lynch in general. Blonde and brown are in a dark room. Blonde is crying, Brown is talking about a way that threatens to blonde and about it. <br /> <br /> With a very quiet moment. This surprisingly short form feels like 'Mulholland Dr.', the movie I like and so I like this too. It may be especially for Lynch fans, but there is a chance that you will like this.
