Oh, what fun is there! <br /> <br /> Amy Heckerling has a flair for directing comedy (Fast Times, Ridgemont High, Look Who's Talking), but here it seems that she told the actors to have fun. Micheal Keaton touched the role of John. Joe Piscopo is great because Danny Vermin is the right thing that the shameful director didn't get in this story. And I also mention Richard Dimitri who plays Moronie and the character's unique vocabulary I do not think it was an accident that the name of the majority of the characters spelled MORON. <br /> <br /> There was a good line in this movie by Peter Boyle Griffith Dunn Marren. Stapleton. Even the actors with sub-chapters like Dick Butts and Alan Hale get along well. <br /> <br /> Suggestions to friends.
