I just watched this movie accidentally. Little gem The film, created in 1956, looks and feels like a seventies movie. And in fact already better than restraining and fixing it over, says Blue Soldier Environmental Anthropology undertones is a way ahead of time The humble movie shooting is great and more realistic than Dances with Wolves, The Last Hunt manages to convey the look and feel of a buffalo. Probably because the people in this movie are real killing fields. This film was filmed during the legal forest, forcing buffalo to pick up buffalo, so the animals you see are really being shot. In summary, the masterpiece of the Westerners who have been humblely rated and acted as an excellent shot and shot.
