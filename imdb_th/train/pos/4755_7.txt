There is a passenger bus full of passengers caught during a snow storm. The police closed the bridge - saying it was unsafe and stuck in a small cafe until the road was cleared. However, after a while, their boredom became anxious because it appeared that one passenger was not on the bus and could be an alien !! This leads to a ridiculous conclusion. But it is quite funny with the low eyebrows. <br /> <br /> This is another fun episode of The Twilight Zone, instead of being distorted or a general social explanation. However, it is also a matter to watch. What happens, you have to look at yourself. <br /> <br /> In this way, one star, John Hoyt - your face will mostly recognize from countless TV shows and movies In almost every case, he played the truth roughly. (Like Charles Lane in the same era) but I love children who have seen him - while he is completely unattractive and funny at the same time
