Great adaptations, most internal collections of Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus and Molly Bloom by Joseph Strick to create Dublin's beloved person's image on 16 June 1904 - Bloomsday - the day to celebrate Director, Bravo Strick, screenwriter Haines, including the selection of director and director in creating this masterpiece. Gunter Grass's novel, The Tin Drum, filmed by Volker Schl√∂ndorff (1979) is another good movie Where Converted from an internal monologue, which I like to compare it to a movie <br /> <br /> of the Strick has an important place in Dublin. And in this film, there are characters that can be remembered even with different names in the novel For example, Buck Mulligan, whose Dedalus lives, becomes one of the most important Dublin surgeons. <br /> <br /> This film for total excellence is made more complete with more viewing. <br /> <br /> Brian invinoveritas1@AOL.com 15 June 2008
