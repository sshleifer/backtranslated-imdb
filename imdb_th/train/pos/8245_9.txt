Despite not saying anything, Billy Connolly is great like zombies ... Carrie Ann Moss as "Mom"? Zombie fans? <br /> <br /> "... My father wants to eat me ... I never try it. Timmy" <br /> <br /> And I think Dawn of the Dead is good. It's like a plane. With the meat? Night of the Living Dead supported by Zomcom .. <br /> <br /> And don't forget my coffin <br /> <br /> And Fido in the aloha shirt is cool. <br /> <br /> And yes, the social opinion is too much to start to comment. <br /> <br /> Suffice to say that it's all practical!
