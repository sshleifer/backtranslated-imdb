I went to watch this movie on the show. The actors and crew made my friends who were producers in the movie invited me. Forget what you see in the ad. Forget what you hear. Go watch this movie yourself. I was more surprised in the world of The Grinch, Charlies Angels, Day 6, Broken, Here comes the movie that is worth the money you earn! Glorious scenes, fantastic cinemas and actors you want to eat with your heart. I found that this movie was one of the films of Robert Deniro, deserving an Oscar, nodded. If you can give the Oscar to everyone involved in the package, this will be a movie.
