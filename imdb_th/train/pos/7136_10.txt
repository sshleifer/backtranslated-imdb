I saw the movie before reading Michelle Magorian and I enjoyed it both. This movie is more than a book, causing me to come close to tears many times. This film touches the deepest point of the human spirit and never let go. I recommend that many people see this masterpiece as much as possible and the fastest I give ten stars
