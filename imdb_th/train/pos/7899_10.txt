This is a great movie. I don't understand why many people don't like it. There is a lot to connect with many beautiful images and very sympathetic in what is not spoken. I was thoroughly entertained and was left with a sense of joy as I was when I finished the story. Tom Robbins, almost everyone Now I haven't read Robbin's book, so now I don't pair this thing together. But I can't imagine that this movie could be a terrible interpretation. This movie has lots of things for you to define yourself, which is the best part of Tom Robbins novel that dreams of detail. <br /> <br /> Everyone who says this is the worst movie I used to have pity on the rest of your heart. Far from the worst ever, this movie is famous. Try using the pertussis crane.
