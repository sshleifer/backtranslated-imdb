I was very impressed with the story, and since I had to go through something similar to my parents, I was really connected. It's easy to forget that people who are physically unhealthy, ever lively and passionate And there was a mistake they made and had to live with I love the performances of Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne. Who is it? She's great! Finding the real thing may be the most erotic scene I have ever seen in a movie. But nothing shows - it makes it very beautiful Overall, the look and feel of this film is amazing, which is a true emotional journey. Cole Hauser is very good in this picture. I like the way the filmmakers approached the life of this woman, never being too grateful - enough to ask us. But not enough to sink
