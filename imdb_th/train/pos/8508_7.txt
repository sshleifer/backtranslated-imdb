Richard Dix decided to retire and Michael Duane took over as Ted Nichols, who met a French woman named Alice Dupres Barkley (Lenore Aubert). The couple had known each other for two days and they decided to get married by a judge. Of peace (judge) and the rain fell when they pulled up to the judge's house and found that he was not at home and would not return until the next day when both of them were inside the house. Some comments raise the hood up and auto parts from the engine. When you see this happening, you know that this pair is a surprise and a story that will reveal a mysterious event that surrounds Alice Barkley and Ted Nichols, who are beginning to have problems. Lots and no marriage. A good secret, but I miss Richard Dix. Have fun.
