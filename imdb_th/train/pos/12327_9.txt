In 1987, Hong Kong gave the film world, such as Sammo Hung's 'Encounters of Spooky Kind' Chow Yun Fat, in the symbol 'A Better Tomorrow' for John Woo, 'Zu Warriors' and 'Classic Vampire'. Jackie Chan achieved international success. In the video, but because of 'A Chinese Ghost Story', the Hong Kong cinema has been very popular in the West for many years. <br /> <br /> Western movie actors have never seen anything like it. Is a movie that uses various ingredients at the cinema Users Kong for many years. (Swordsman, flying, art, choreography and supernatural) and incorporating them to create films that are unique in appearance, feel and executions. Forget the unnecessary and unnecessary continuity that has happened in the traditional and the best. <br /> <br /> Director Siu-Tung Ching (also known as a choreographer in the movie Such as Woo's 'A Better Tomorrow 2' / 'The Killer') under the watchful eye of the legendary producer Tsui Hark, creating a masterpiece of fantasy / horror movies and with a team of experts in management (no less than 6 Martial Arts Coordinators) The occasion of the film will be anything. <br /> <br /> Edited by David Wu, an astonishingly rich / directed 'bride with white hair 2' and edited the classic name like 'A Better Tomorrow 1/2/3', 'Hardboiled' and 'The Club' Hit Cultures are just a genius job. Creating the perfect climbing sword, fighting swords, climbing trees makes them the best Hong Kong movie theater ever created. Fast, strange But never confusing, even today, the highest point of the art. <br /> <br /> The crew of the filmmakers also performed miracles. This is a movie that every shot is a fine painting. In the presence of a terrifying nightly blue sky backdrop that is horrifying today is an amazing platform for our story to unfold. It's a movie that everything is used to weave a dream-like beauty. Even the robes and dresses worn by Hsiao Tsing became part of the movie, whether in a romantic scene or a fight scene, a stream that used to flow through the screen. Even the ordinary scenes that Hsiao Tsing transformed into a beautiful, energetic beauty, because all the skills in the set combined to create the most memorable scenes from simple actions. These scenes are breathtaking, giving the world a sense of forest and temple and the cruelty of burning the wilderness flag of hell for an amazing final scene. The production design by Zhongwen Xi deserves the highest praise. <br /> <br /> Another important factor for the success of the film is Romeo Diaz's music and James Wong. Hong Kong movies provide excellent music and songs. We add a lot to the success of the sequence, but in the 'Chinese ghost story', this song is especially important. From the debut song, etc. The song is as important as the character. <br /> <br /> The score is a perfect combination of modern and traditional instruments. Drums, bells and guitars are far from the action scenes to A. Great effect But it is in a slow and annoying romance that it comes into itself here; The string flute and the female choir effect create what might be the best song heard in Hong Kong movies. Add to the vocals of women, amazing melodious songs played over the love of Tsau-shen and Hsiao Tsing (never seen anything before, but the effect is great. This is an innocent love movie.) The movie's music can be had. <br /> <br /> And of course we have the talent for acting. Leslie Chong (`Better tomorrow on day 1 and 2 ' And popular singers) are distinguished as pure tax collectors His work in the cartoon series (Thank you sweetly) Never ended up on the scene and his scene with Joey Huang playing with love and purity in the right amount. <br /> <br /> Joey Huang (who will later be relegated Most In order to support the role in movies such as Chow Yun Fat / Andy Lau, the classic "God of Gamblers") never looks brighter than you do here. She is the perfection of beauty that does not exist. The depiction of her tragedy, Hsiao Tsing is amazing. She expressed the sadness of the characters in what she had become and what she did. But also giving a profound sexual feeling in the scene in which she tempts men to die horribly Veteran actor Wu Ma (`Mr. Vampire ',' Swordsman ') is a great fun as a brave intellectual. But was not satisfied with the yen He explores the differences between unusual and annoying things that are easily trained. And anything that is a character that can be easily dangerous is really great entertainment and memories. <br /> <br /> But the monster and the beast? I hear you cry They range from zombies that are quite rough. But enjoy the movement / animation of zombies that live in the temple (Resulting in a joke that ran continuously to try to chew on the suspicious Tsau-shen) until Lord Black Complete with an arsenal of evil flying heads and quite outstanding line work Most of which have not been there before. <br /> <br /> But the most remarkable effect and creation is the killer tongue of the spirit tree. We found this for the first time with the `Evil Dead 'camera effects as it strangled the victims to send dead French kisses that turned victims into zombies. But later it was shown in the madness of glory It can grow large and long as it fires through the forest after the victim tears the tree apart, surrounded the building and the longest winding around the male before picking it up. It can still be split open, revealing a mouth full of canines! It is an evil idea that gives a deep romantic plot that should not be used. But it has great and memorable results. <br /> <br /> So all of this combined is a classic example of Hong Kong movie creation. A true team effort that allows us to see a new movie It is a movie that is full of flair, invention, action, monster, martial arts, ghosts, brilliant ideas, lush images, beautiful music and most importantly, it has a lasting charm.
