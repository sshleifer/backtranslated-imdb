In the end, I knew that it really existed. In addition to other supporters in the UK here, I see this as being something that is only being screened in the UK in the 70s. I can remember the name but nowhere when I talk about people. It scars me (that is, 2 years), but when you go to bed with the striking punishment about your brain and listening around for fear, that is not a true horror movie. with I can hardly remember the complexity of the movie. But what I remember was the vibrating and higher senses of the flesh. Can anyone confirm my suspicions that this is black and white? Again, if anyone has information about how to get this copy, please contact ...
