I watched the first movie on HBO for the first time in 1981 and 15 years old. I think this movie is hilarious. I remember not seeing the Alfred E. Neuman depiction as shown in the movie trailer when MAD magazine mocked the film and immediately halted by apologizing from the "normal gang" for the reduction to satirize the parts of my Ek. Just think that they mock themselves, which I'm sure they are, but to find them seriously. (And Ron Lemman) was embarrassed to remove the name from any credit. I was very surprised. Of course, there are many bad movies involved. Watching the movie in the video right now (at the age of 32) with the recovered MAD reference. I still benefit from it. And a fan of Ron Liebman (Hot Rock, Where's Poppa?). I think it's a gem of his performance (SAY IT AGAAAAIN)
