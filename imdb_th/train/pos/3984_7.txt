As part of the celebration of the launch of Casino Royale, this film with a new bond starring director Roger Michell (Notting Hill), I almost closed because of a little boring. But I'm glad I stuck with it. In general, May (Ann Reid) is the only mother of Helen (Anna Wilson-Jones) who barely sees anyone and has never had a girlfriend for a long time. many year Her daughter said that she might want to marry her new girlfriend, Darren. (Of course, Daniel Craig) After only a few days of acquaintance, May and Darren had a secret story, and with her age there were 30 things and new bonds. However, they want to keep it secret. But might regret and wonder how Helen would know this When she did so, Darren would have less difficulty than May. In fact, Helen asked her to hit her. Starring Peter Vaughan as Homo Danira Govich plays an au pair, Harry Michaels, Harry, Rosie Michel, while Rosie and Johnny Oliver Ford Dale. Very good!
