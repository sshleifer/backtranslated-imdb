After watching a rather spooky WW1 spy thriller, Madame Lily (1969) starring Julie Andrews on TV this afternoon, I thought I had seen the great WW1 spy movie so far. All I can remember is that it was produced by Dino De Laurentis. Use a short search on IMDB to find Fraulein Doktor. When I remember the title, the memory came back. It was time for a well-crafted story revolving around the real events, such as the death of Kitchener and the German attack in 1918. There are also more convinced female spies than Julie Andrews! As with other investigators, the first and strongest memories are the well-built fighting scenes of men and horses in gas masks. If you are interested in war movies and especially WW1, it is a movie that should be worth watching if you have a chance.
