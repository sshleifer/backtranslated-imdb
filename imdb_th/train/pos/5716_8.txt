Never seen the movie Grudge of Japan before. But i enjoy it a lot I rarely get points when watching movies. I can jump if the effects and sounds are shocking enough. But getting fear from movies is a rarity for me. But I was afraid of regret It may be because I didn't expect anything when I watched it. I didn't expect to be scared. I don't know anything about it as well. That may be a good thing. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you obviously love or hate. Most people seem to compare Japanese Grudge movies, but even though I didn't see them. But I believe it is not right to compare any movies. This movie is my own. <br /> <br /> The story is weak. Most people say that I do not agree The story is simple and fulfills the purpose. Used narrative techniques - such as time frames that are lacking - perfectly done. The director knows what he is doing and I believe that he has the vision he wants. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 8 out of 10. It's so easy
