Ti% s and As *, many breasts, great characters, funny characters, full of fun and combine teen action together in this spin from this Amercan Pie franchise. Like a really old school It feels like the Porkys in the 2000s. Some great funny characters combined with very funny situations make it a surprise for me. <br /> <br /> While the real actors But lost all except one In order not to get too excited, you have to act as a funny teenager on it. But for what it is, it's excellent The characters are cute and funny. Girls are hotter than hell. Fun and games are hilarious things that I have never seen before in the drama. They make me cringe. But laughing at the same time <br /> <br /> So don't be interested in hating you. Don't expect American classic pies. But expecting something that will make you laugh and spark your interest for an hour or more
