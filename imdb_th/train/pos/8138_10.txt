CB4 is terrible, but it may make Cundieff a better concept, like Spinal Tap. Everyone who saw it surprised in the Middle Ages. The show is for laughs. But not so much for them to be cartoon characters like Marx Brothers These are real and slightly diverse. They respond to situations like we might. We can't throw a tantrum when our hat is slow to reach a gig or pull a gun and beat the record company executives, but you get the picture N (n *** as) W (ready) H (hat). Enough to make you go Rent or receive this in every value, even if you are not a rap song. Comparing this to CB4 is comparable to comparing George Lucas 'Star Wars with Gil Gerards'Buck Rogers.' I think you see my point.
