One of the best true crime movies ever created and faithful to the Truman Capote book, which invented the true crime fiction. The haunting performance of Quincy Jones and the great performances by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake as Dick and Perry. The killer. Why Wilson is not a celebrity after the movie is a mystery for me. <br /> <br /> Movies and monochrome editing in this movie are the best. The creation of a new murder is frightening and when letting the murder happen in your imagination is even more frightening if they show that the shotgun is going out. This film was filmed in an actual Clutter house sold to other people after the murder. This film has a lot of documentary feelings - apart from the scenes that happen in the house. Actually, other scenes filmed at the gas station and the murderer with Nancy Clutter's beloved babe, even in the movie Will Geer, are very interested. As a prosecutor in a short trial scene that not only was filmed in the actual courtroom But there are still many real Clutter murder jurists who act as juries. <br /> <br /> This is a horrible stable movie every time you see it.
