"Still Crazy" is no doubt the greatest rock comedy of all time It was wrongly compared with "This Is Spinal Tap" which is not relevant. "Spinal Tap" is a satire (and quite frankly, not a very good thing, even though it is "Outing" of many rock clich√©s) Unlike "Tap", "Still Crazy" is populated by excellent actors, wonderful music and a good situation of human beings. Pay attention to people in "Still Crazy". That is all that is important. Oh, yes. The song is quite good, written by foreigners Mick Jones and Chris Difford of Squeeze. American audiences are familiar with Stephen Rea (The Crying Game) but later familiar with Bill Nighy (Underworld, Love Actually, Pirates Of The Caribbean II) and Timothy Spall (Harry Potter movie)
