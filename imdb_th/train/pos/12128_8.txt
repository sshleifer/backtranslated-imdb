I just saw "Of Human Bondage" for the first time a few days before and wow! Is a mysterious and scary movie I like music that steps Philip's foot every step. It makes me feel chills for some reason ... <br /> <br /> One of the greatest aspects of this movie is that you will see Bette Davis coming in front of you. She is a wonderful person, not necessarily because this is her best work. But because it is common to have fierce, ferocious and unflinching as an actress in 1934 ... Betty is a risky person. This is correct when she starts to realize that she may be as disgusting and brave as she wants and people will love her because of this. If you are a true lover of the movie, it is wonderful to see ... <br /> <br /> She has a way to send the script and the movie for that story is yours, such as "the mass of music and lights. Is me ... old Kazu and Parker "or" but you are Blanche, you are in that chair! "Or" with all my heart, I still love the man I killed !! " ..That are from a few films of yours. But you got my drift She is brave, brave and looks strange with those beautiful big eyes. After seeing this, I couldn't believe that it was remade twice ... <br /> <br /> Leslie Howard is very beautiful ... calm and resentful, needing to be loved. I think he's cute and doesn't understand that everyone doesn't fall in love with him. But then again, everyone is ... except Mildred He's doing very well ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I don't like is something similar to writing in the first movie. They created an incredibly ugly character that someone would fall in love with them at first. Great performance But in real life Philip would never be interested in Mildred. That's just a simple truth ... Look !!
