This movie is a fantasy. Some story lines But serves as a structure that has some wonderful songs that sing and sing beautifully (I still can't believe that the handsome and attractive person can sing this song well). Some conversations are amazingly clever. The costume makes me feel like watching a high fashion show from 1942. <br /> <br /> The film is designed to meet a variety of purposes. This one is designed for entertainment and of course it does. If I have one negative opinion, it may be that Eddie Nelson is too young to be handsome. Some close-ups make me feel uneasy. But he can still sing and sing beautifully. However, Jeanette MacDonald is as amazing as ever. She created a beautiful angel. <br /> <br /> This type is good before my time and I'm new for the movie Jeanette MacDonald / Nelson Eddy and related dialogue. The music in this movie is beautiful. As far as I love classical rock music that complements most modern movies, there is no question in my heart that this song is easier and more memorable, creating happiness and creating better. The stars in this film are more capable than the stars I see in today's theaters, and Jeanette MacDonald, who has not benefited from Beverly Hills plastic surgeons, is more beautiful than the stars I see today. I'm not clear why many posters are so sorry about the liking of this movie and in general, this group of movies. They said it was the day and tried to explain why it was like that. And people who don't like it say it's not very good But compared to what I think this movie will no doubt be able to entertain people when other movies have been forgotten for a long time. There are too many qualities in every aspect of this movie to not remember and enjoy. I recommend this movie without having to book for everyone who admires great talent, great beauty and great music.
