"Match Point" and now "Scoop" makes me believe that not only Woody Allen will make a successful movie in England (and Scarlett Johansson is a valid member) but insists on things I have known for years: he shouldn't Not focusing on New Yorkers who are nervous Which is a serial killer Users told her that Was determined by Hugh Jackman, so she would know him and ... well, I don't know how much I can tell you without letting it go But I can say that this may be Allen's most fun movie in many years. His style of humor is unique. (Especially about his religion) <br /> <br /> So you're sure to like this movie If nothing makes you fall in love with London But mostly it's just hilarious Even if you don't like Woody Allen But you have to love this one
