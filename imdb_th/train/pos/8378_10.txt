It's a great movie. The concept of a country that sends people to fight with giant robots is tacky. The ending is not just a joint, it is more inspiring. <br /> <br /> But I was intrigued by the characters. It is a shame that we have never seen the relationship of Achilles and Athena develop beyond the kissing and fear of Athena for the safety of Achilles. Their love is so fun. <br /> <br />
