I watched a movie with a friend incriminating my wife and her female friends. So I have a view from all directions. Most of the movies made me laugh. Sexual tension was not there and the only outstanding actor was Tudor Shira Hunt and Maria Popeza. Yes, I think she plays her role well even though the script is not appropriate. There are Romanian actors around. They don't have complex roles. I applaud Paya for entering the movie business. I do not know why But I think he is a good person. I just hope he will be a good actor. <br /> <br /> My wife likes this movie and I think there may be chords. Playing and I don't have ears If the film tries to present unusual sexual behavior and their consequences in Romania today, it fails miserably. There is no effect. Just think that women are children, men and women. Actually, the same story becomes boring and unattractive. <br /> <br /> I don't know why it has won all BAFTA awards in the book. My reward should be "Good luck next time" (Bafta = Good luck in Romania)
