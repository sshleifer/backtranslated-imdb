I will say it's time for this movie to be great ... and yes, if you don't have the desire to be a Christian then why come? I saw this movie after I was recorded and found it very well moving. I see now that they have taken these movies to the next level and have created the Left Behind ... series. They make comparisons more closely and more modern to reach people. I really think that in judging this movie, you should see it. There are 3 or 4 stories in the series. If I'm not mistaken ... don't use our opinions to judge the movie yourself! ! God will bless you if that's why you watch them.
