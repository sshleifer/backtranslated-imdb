Although DiG! Regarded as the closest to the music industry The director made the audience misunderstand that the Brian Jonestown massacre had disappeared from the ground-98 and the rivalry between Dandy Warhol and Jonestown was milking. The truth of this story was not revealed in this film. <br /> <br /> That said the film has endless possibilities and an interesting clock when we watch two talented musicians who create their art. One of the best things for this movie is that it is a unique perspective between the indie music scene and the large corporate scene. <br /> <br /> Recommended for use with two bands and marvelous music.
