I like this movie a lot. The reason for my interest and enjoyment is not related to anything other than myself. I have heard stories from my mother and grandmother about the life and attitude of the working class north of England that used to be (This is their experience) and this is an interesting image that seems to represent honestly what they tell me. Especially the father who is the father But had the patience to "know" the best thing for his family, along with his stubbornness when this paradigm was challenged (Nothing has changed !!) <br /> <br /> People who have seen the drama may be disappointed with the film because the story is not easily transferred across various media. History and I enjoy it personally, if only because it represents social phenomena.
