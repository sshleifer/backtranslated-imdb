And that is why movies, history / biographies are important to all of us, moreover, when they do this very well <br /> <br /> Before I saw "The Young Victoria" I knew a small matter Little Queen Victoria, but eventually I get more knowledge about it. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is great as Victoria. (Who can guess!) And she may be nominated for an Oscar this year Personally, I'm cheering for you ... <br /> <br /> For technical problems, I'm happy to say that this is a very successful work with an artistic direction / decoration. That it is Expected to be a great costume designer! <br /> <br /> One drawback is that I want to see more and know more about this interesting queen. But the most important is the amazing woman and mother! <br /> <br /> BRAVO: 9 out of 10!
