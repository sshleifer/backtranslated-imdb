Winchester 73 is the story of a man (Jimmy Stewart) is obsessed with possessing his precious treasures. The rifle produced by Winchester is repeated. The gun continued to change hands and stewards unintentionally. The B&W effort in 1950 by Anthony Mann was a crime movie rather than a traditional western film, and the cowboys tend to look more like gangsters today than the old cowboy gangs Shelley Winters plays a virtuous young woman who is suspected of heading to a ranch with Charles Drake, whom she may marry. She fell for Stewart. But not before she passed a bit Winter is the most complex character in the movie that is full of unusual characters. See Dan Dureyea, a young woman as an enticing killer and Tony Curtis in a very small role. Will Geer, a meteorologist who plays Vai Earp
