This movie is really great. Time and culture in advance have been beautifully recreated. Urmila offers great performance again. What I truly admire about this film is that it does not use Pakistan's bash method that is rampant in movies such as Gadar and LOC. When the partition breaks into a backdrop, the movie will not detract from political issues or focus on Severe or right and wrong This film has always been a tragic story in Urmila's life. Her fragile relationship with Manoj Bajpai is described as excellent. This movie shows how both Hindu and Muslim people suffer from this scene. The only religious theme that is prevalent in this film
