The 1st season is amazing. All their thoughts that adapt to the island while the mystery is being explored (and seen) is amazing. Full of suspense, cliffs, tons and amazing plot I mean, I like all the ideas that see them familiar with the island. And then before seeing the monster, smoke at first really attracted my attention Since then, I was addicted to the second season, always correct with the 1st season, only slightly better. I like the idea of ​​the door and the DHARMA initiative, the story and the sequence of Season 2, all mysterious, creepy and exciting. I like the suspense that surrounds others on the island, but the story of DHARMA makes a really amazing season. <br /> <br /> Season 3 isn't as good as 1 and 2 ... But still Good I like to see the stories behind other people, seeing their camps and exploring additional mysteries ("Tricia Tanak Is Dead" is one of my favorite episodes) this season, although not that good. But still exciting and fun But the most exciting! Now, Season 4, I have hope for this season and Episode 1 is good for us, but then it's getting boring and boring. I mean, I insult The new "savior", such as Miles and Daniel, the old plot after the first couple, the episode ... and the most .... Season 4 was removed from something that made LOST the perfect series. : Mystery, thriller, joke mixed in (Charlie disappeared) and overall excitement In addition, some of my favorite characters are still left.
