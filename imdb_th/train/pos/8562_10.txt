I like it! The strange plot Drew Barrymore and the DC that were created were uncomfortable for both of them. Drew's performance dodged in the place. But this may make her life at that time Dennis Christopher, when the contraction is quite cool and he always makes the best - I'm already a big fan of Dennis. That's why I bought a DVD. <br /> <br /> I don't. Get the ending! What a red skeleton, the strange anime, looks like it is out of school. The movie, which is ok, I think. <br /> <br /> .... and all the knives - if it's uncomfortable, why don't they get rid of it? <br /> <br /> It's very confusing when it's a strange thing or when it's a DC- or is it Dennis all the time? Because Doppelganger did with Dennis and Patrick on the scene with Patrick. If Dennis is Doppelganger, I think Patrick will notice. <br /> <br /> The song is ok, but annoying. Revolving around the theme, but this theme is too active. <br /> <br /> The combination of a lot of blood and Drew bare gratuitus shock. <br /> <br /> All in the movie GPM-Guilty Pleasure. Don't read too much. Don't look for great secrets and scripts because you Not find it There are some moments with diamonds and many goofs - see it and just have fun with it!
