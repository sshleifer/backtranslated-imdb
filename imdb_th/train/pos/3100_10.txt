At the end of the first hour, my jaws were comfortably located between my feet. This film has never been done and I mean never let it be true. May be a mild action But is an act Every member of the actor fits perfectly. The explosion is real. The chase scene is possible and the battle is incredible. Matt Damon will be Jason Bourne forever. <br /> <br /> All I have to say is that every movie of Bourne will improve and this Not an exception, action, bet, plot. How will I never know? I applaud the people who wrote the screen, playing with all these movies. Because if he didn't do such a great job with the first film, we wouldn't have this story to talk. <br /> <br /> So don't watch it in the cinema. If it is still where you live But if not on December 11, Bond will come back to you!
