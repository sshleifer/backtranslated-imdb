Eglimata (= Crime) is a story about a small crime in everyday life that people admit that in a crazy situation can lead to disaster. Of course, one of the smartest Greek series ever! Actors like Ketty Konstadinou and Maria Kavogianni and make us unbelievably 'laughing' moments. All viewers seem to remember their own bad side in one of the characters or at least on the side of They they want Actors of all ages playing large and small parts get equally large space in the hearts of Greek viewers. My personal favorites (In addition to the first two I talk about) is Vassilis Haralambopoulos, Athinodoros Prousalis and Stavros Nikolaidis from time to time. Anyone in the world who understands Greek should find a way to watch this drama, even if it has been more than 5 years already on TV in Greece. They still repeat the series (ANT1) in every opportunity that is like. Summer or afternoon. We will never forget Eglimata or any actors!
