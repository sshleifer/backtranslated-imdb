True black noir movies and good graphic movies featuring good human beings that follow redemption which may make it too late. Visually, there are some very beautiful scenes that are amazing in art, what can be done with a small budget, full points from Gareth Maxwell Roberts and the team. That will be better again Lisa Ray looks cute that has never seen her before and hopes to see her again in the future. Sex stories, drugs, and violence are all interesting. Bring it on. I'll tell you to rent for sure and make sure you're in the mood for a noir, noir.
