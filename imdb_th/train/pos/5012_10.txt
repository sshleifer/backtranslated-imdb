In April 1965, CBS aired Barbra Streisand's first television special. But succeeded in ranking only But also received 5 Emmy awards as well This was one of the most memorable moments of television in the 1960s and (as a pity) special television that they no longer produce. Full of great music and spectacular performances by Barbra, this special is a must see for Streisand fans and everyone interested in the early television.
