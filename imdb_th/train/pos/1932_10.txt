I think I often approach the actors in the film festival with low expectations that they will be "Wacky" and the humor intended to receive only the cost of the character's simplicity in a complex context. The great thing about Big Bad Swim is that the director can maintain the integrity and development of his character in his film while still finding humor, laughing in the background Is complicated, perhaps because of DP's sharp work. I haven't seen it in indie movies and rarely perform in comedy. Special note here: Paget Brewster to Amy as a math teacher After seeing this show, I couldn't understand why Brewster was not "discovered" by a large audience. She brings anger and passion to combine with the role that helps this image to have potential. This is a great job that deserves from a large audience. I hope to get more from this director and actor!
