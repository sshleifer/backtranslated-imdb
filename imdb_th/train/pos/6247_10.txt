Examples of this movie may show scenes of violence or non-mainstream sexuality. But these scenes are only a fraction of the rarity that has been chosen to attract viewers. Of course, they are showing the main message of the movie: <br /> <br /> People who kick their heads in work and life by using their powers, which they may have elsewhere to enslave others And at the lowest point of the majority of the oppressive chain is women. <br /> <br /> The movies that show this story mercilessly like Hundstage are difficult to face. Short Cuts but consists of a documentary when someone like your neighbor plays the way they are. Without the most flashing and disturbing light without any hope, its documentary style makes the movie look even more annoying because you know that those people go out and have many of them. Even though our society focuses on images Beautiful exterior Somewhere where the indecent industry has to do business, domestic violence that has not been reported has to happen somewhere where hope has to break. I'm sure you know these people. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch movies that don't have funny scenes. (Some people may think that women with disabilities that repeat Top Ten supermarkets are a joke. But this actually happened) and without soulfulness, going to see this movie However, it will disappear when you focus on the words that I fear because the subtitles cannot emphasize the sound of the transport.
