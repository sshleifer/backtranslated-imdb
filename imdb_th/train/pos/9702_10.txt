Royston Vasey is a strange but wonderful place. The characters are wrong and too disturbing. But amazingly wonderful writing means it works and works very well. Most people will know others with the touch of some characters. But hope that no one will know that the person with extreme personality, such as Tubbs and Edward, the owner who hates strangers in the local shop With a lot of hatred, that is only a few people who live in strange ways. TV work consists of 3 series and special Christmas. There are many references to horror movies such as Vickers. In addition, recently, during the performance of the movie is the League of Kitti Gentlemen, which I will not say much, but I recommend all in every league of gentlemen, a hilarious comedy show with brilliant writing and excellent characters I will definitely say it's worth watching while you won't regret!
