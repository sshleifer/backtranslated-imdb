Kalifornia is the story of his girlfriend's writer and photographer looking for someone to help pay the gas and take turns traveling across the road to the famous murder scene. Ironically, the serial killer and his girlfriend responded. Post Kalifornia is a diamond in a very rugged and interesting journey with serial killers. Great performances around the side, especially leader Pitt. Try it !!
