Dear story ........ Vote ten on average for my age and sex ... not all very funny. (Compared to the movie that I almost made myself wet), even though it's funny, not a musical drama fan, maybe a bit too much for me But they give you time to grab a drink or soda without missing anything important It is the fifth generation of When Harry Met Sally? Ahab really can't. But if it's in your top ten, it's mine. You will like this movie. Actually, it makes you feel warm and vague. Remind you to think of romantic things and should be like something to be filmed. My conclusion is best explained in a few words ... quite charming.
