"Who do it?" There are many laughs and jokes. It is not just one of the best Stooges movies with Shemp. It is one of the best short comedies produced in Colombia. The original director Bernds wrote the screenplay in 1946 for Stooges, but when Curly Howard suffered a stroke. At the end of his career, it was suitable for the Columbia comedy team Schilling and Lane (their version was released as Better than the Stooges will pass and finally it was filmed by the Stooges at the end of 1947. <br/> <br /> Goodrich's old man called the detective Ace Shemp, Larry and Moe in fear that he would be Killed when they arrived at his home, Goodrich had disappeared and his niece and followers tried to get rid of the Stooges. Will they find Goodrich and bring his niece and followers to justice? <br /> <br /> Shemp is funny, especially in this movie. His reaction after receiving Mickey by Christine McIntyre was excellent. He gave his trademark sound. (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb) and Miss McIntyre try not to laugh clearly! Other funny scenes: Moe's close-up look through the camera lens. And fighting in the dark with all the members of the actors involved. <br /> <br /> Nikko the goon (played by Duke York) is one of the most strange characters that has ever appeared in the movie Stooges by me. His kink, he almost passed away for the stooge if he didn't tower above everyone else! "Who do it?" Is a gem in the movie of Stooges and Shemp. Even the curly fans that are fixed also enjoy this game! Truly classic stooge 9 out of 10
