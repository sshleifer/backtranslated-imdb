Bill and Ted's journey is forged as the best movie I've ever seen. Although the performances and other scenes are bad, but the story is great and funny and the words they think are the best. The idea is also great. I recommend everyone to watch this classic. The best part is obvious when they die. 'Melvin' I broke down for 10 minutes and missed the next part of the movie. This is the first thing that is much better, which is excellent as well. Maybe the most fun movie ever !!!!! I think the best part of this film is when Bill and Ted shouted great and played rock guitar on Rock, Bill, Ted and Eddie Van Halen presented the 3rd movie !!
