This one is great! Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding collaborated to create a powerful and influential movie. This is the true story of the first black US Navy diver and the obstacles he faced in getting the certification from the racist diver's hand. On the way he had to face the old stubbornness from all his classmates. No one wanted him in class. They moved out of the military camp when he arrived. Finally he was certified and had a great career as a US Navy diver. See this! It is a wonderful story of courage and honor. When the story is resolved, we will see racism slowly and everyone begins to respect men one by one.
