I watched this movie without knowing anything and found that it was similar to Billy Elliot (2000). Both films are based on a father-son relationship that is suffering. In both films, the son does not want to follow his father into the mines and dreams of having a better life away from their home town. Both sons face mockery from their classmates and both have a strong female model that teaches them. <br /> <br /> The main difference I found during the movie was Oct. October Sky is an interesting movie. Laura Dern shows the movement and Chris Cooper plays the father who doesn't agree, just as he did in American Beauty (1999). Joe Johnston surprised me with His delicate directives differ from his other director qualities, such as Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001). <br /> <br />
