One of my friends suggested this film by referring to my similarities with my voice and resonance with Des Howl, the main character of this film. I can guess that I can see that and maybe more. I'm not sure if the picture is cruel. <br /> <br /> This is a unique job. There are more than similarities that are attractive, True Romance, not for the content or style of filming or for conversations (Whale Music is much more relaxed and comfortable) but both of them represent modern love stories. <Br /> <br /> In general, I'm a big fan of Canadian movies about music and musicians. (For example, I recommend a hard-core logo) and especially this film It has an innocent charm. Des is not always the most lovable man. But there is something about him that attracts attention
