I always tell people that "Enchanted April" is a movie for adults that has no insults, no sexual relations and no violence. Some people may think that it is "The best chick", but I bet that there is one enlightened man who loves one or two. Don't invite children to come. This movie is a very low key. <br /> <br /> See. " Enchanted April "is a very good therapy experience. Beautiful audio tracks and scenery, along with the gentle manners of women, reminds of the peace and beauty of painting before Raphael. <br /> <br /> Lest anyone interpret the meaning. The line I heard again in "Saturday Night Live" and said my two favorite movies were "The Deer Hunter" and "Enchanted April".
