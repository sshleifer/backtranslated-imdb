First, this is a brave movie. I've seen irreversible and able to understand comparisons. However, I can't begin to understand the people who dumped this trash. I can see that the end may end extensively. But I will lie if I do not say that I hope all men who have forced women to have sex should receive Jared. On the other hand, it doesn't solve anything or make things better and the fact that this movie doesn't pretend to be something that makes me feel thankful. <br /> <br /> Previous comments called Pathetic movies and claims No one will stick Of course I do and intend. I am 24 years old. The way the movie dragged me to reality. People are accustomed to cooking eyes and quickly converting on the screen that if you ask them to focus on a single brick on the foundation of the movie, not only But they lost interest, they destroyed what was created and called it solid waste, when in reality it lacked patience and understanding that needed thorough adjustment and not a product of creative minds such as Talia Lugacy's <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson shows the numbness of impeccable self-destruction. I think she can easily draw the illusion before and after the attack, and the transition between the two is an act that I rarely see. Very often, like the movie "Aimed at teenagers" mentioned in the previous comments, the effects of rape were shown to be extremely crazy and impulsive or depressed, lonely and lifeless. Dawson, in my opinion, managed to balance, so many survivors fell victim to: the existence of a buzzing voice in the waking hours, some work that had to die for survival. (And divert attention) then smog from using drugs instead of facing the sobriety. <br /> <br /> I think this movie tells the truth and I admire it for acting. People see rape on the other side. Many people let the end of this movie swallow the middle and the beginning ... I believe that Maya's face during that performance ended ... not my own actions ... not revenge. Or the meaning behind ... just your face ... <br /> <br /> thank you
