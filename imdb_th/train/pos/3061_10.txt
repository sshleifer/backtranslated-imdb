This film shows the type of dress that everyone wants in every movie. Barbara Ben and Donald Sutherland (The player, husband and wife) is calmly talking about "Family business" as if it were a grocery store or dry cleaning shop. Macy, Campbell, Ullman and Ritter are great as well. They play each other like members of the elite theater groups who realize that quality products require individual actors to help others unselfishly. And finally, Sammy (David Dorfman) is an amazing performance from a child ... and he is similar to Ullman, which he plays with his son. Who in "Panic" and that is rare today? Formulaic shit is tired. The conversation is sharp and intelligent, and this short film has the power to draw emotions from the audience fully. There is a place to laugh, shocked, shocked, scared, being angry, being awakened, angry and loving. It's not a movie that makes you jump for joy. But at the end, you will be more satisfied than knowing that you spent the last ninety minutes with a good job. <br /> <br /> We are more Go to the cinema if we are treated for this quality fare. When will the power in Hollywood wake up? It is truly a shame when this great thing fails to get over the festival and the household is lucky enough to have a cable.
