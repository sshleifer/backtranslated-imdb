One of my favorite movies for many years is "Last Action Hero"; Unfortunately, Arnold Schwarznegger Decided to make me fun by being a corrupt politician So now I can't tolerate any movies that he may have. <br /> <br /> Jake Speed's adventures are actually toys that have a theme similar to Last ... Hero; So I'm glad to find it on the DVD, so I can see these themes very well. <br /> <br /> Despite the "plot-inside-plot" associated with skin slavery White during the African Civil War This is not an action movie. The plot that "Plot-Inside-Plot" is in fact about the question of whether this movie has no intention to fix: Is Jake Speed. A real man who helped the heroine save her sister from a white slave trader; Or is he really a character (which means that the heroine has only entered the real universe in the pulp fiction series)? I would suggest that this is not all that is clearly defined in the movie and Wayne City, Oxford and Andrew Lane know this completely. The film became a presentation of what the audience might want from the universe of "adventure" that was wearing a theme that was full of heaviness that could occur from the humor of a cute and humorous movie. <br /> <br /> There are weaknesses of the movie - essentially it's a movie that makes the movie look like a TV show. And the rhythm is sometimes reduced. <br /> <br /> But I like the characters For this hunt, and I enjoy the adventures they lived. And I just discovered an interesting idea that this adventure actually happened in the novel. <br /> <br /> Held under multiple views - good performances!
