I stumbled upon this movie when I was the owner of Caesars Palace eBay because I was fascinated by the rich history of Vegas because the last original luxury resort remained in good condition. (Unless you count Bally's, the original MGM Grand) in this respect, this movie gives full power You have been visiting the Caesars property, which, despite all the improvements and additions that they have made over the past 40 years, is open to service. In the overall picture, this film is quite difficult to follow, thanks mainly to the horrible editing. And when I said that it was scary, I didn't use that word lightly. There was a traffic break in Vegas for two seconds. The casino crowd and even the scene where the character Robert Drivas was talking to his father about With the number that he grew up and without any explanation (Drivas) changed from being himself as a baby to a little boy and came back to himself while talking to his father (That doesn't give any details about the plot, if there is one thing that can be prepared and maybe they are not as baffled as I received from editing). The natural difference between his father and his son that most people can relate in some form or fashion.
