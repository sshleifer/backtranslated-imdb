I remember watching this thing in 1970 - then I just borrowed a few episodes from our public library. <br /> <br /> With the disappearance of nearly 30 years, I concluded again. Most employers interviewed in this series, some of them at the center of power, such as Traudl Junge (Hitler's secretary), Karl Doenitz (Germany's naval leader) Anthony Eden (UK) - long gone but first hand Their will continue The generals and generals of the Russian civilian generals, survivors of the concentration camps are all on record here. <br /> <br /> I remember the Lord Mount Batten interview. (Died in 1970) <br /> <br /> This is a real gem and I believe that the creator of this series has been praised by Queen Elizabeth for this work - deserved. <br /> <br /> Seeing a few episodes from the library made me want to buy a set. <br /> <br /> This is the only "10" that I have given to the review, but I have discovered such a good wine bottle. More with less time ...
