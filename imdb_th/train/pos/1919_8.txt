I haven't read books that are based on / inspired by This is the last work of John Ritter (RIP). One hope that it will be a joke and it is. Almost every time he is in this story as a reality. Most actors who support as well as regularly play well and the material tends to be good. He played the role of Paul Hennessy, the father of three teenagers, including Rory, a typical man. In that age, middle-aged Kerry, depressed, struggled to find the cause and awareness and Bridget, who Sagal's love for fashion is back as a female lead in the sitcom and her character is far from Peggy Bundy. The show changed slightly after Mr. Three Company passed on, and while they couldn't decide if they wanted to laugh or have pain and make sure to show respect. Who will wonder how long it will last or how? After that: It is still quite good. Some of the additions are lucky. (If you like David Spade, most of him consists of him doing schtick). Personally, is in the previous season. Humor is a good combination of jokes "fool" (mostly related to high school students), ignorance, humor and raw materials. This story is related to sexuality and other adult topics, but never in graphic form. The language is not severe and sometimes it is quite violent. I recommend this to the fans of those who created it. 8/10
