This movie is one of the people who sleep all the time. I give 10 stories. Missouri's famous 'Bushwhackers' that fought on the south side during the interstate war The clothes that they wear are genuine, history and the reason they fight is accurate and well researched. Actually, there is one battle that doesn't happen as it appears ... but not bad for Hollywood. The actors have been carefully selected and are both the best performer or director, knowing how to get the best from them. I think it is a combination of excellent governance, a selection of excellent actors to find the right people and great performances from actors Not just one or two ... It has action, romance, suspense, good people and bad people. (Sometimes depending on your personal view) and all history rolling into movies Even with the future of Spider-Man and Gems and she's good!
