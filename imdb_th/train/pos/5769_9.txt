All of you will please the hell from Todd! Give you $ 30,000 to make a movie and see what you think! That guy has 735 zombies and regular performers for free! Of course, the performance is sometimes ridiculous. Yes, makeup is not as great as you have seen. But it's not the worst thing. If you want to see it, go see the Zombie Nation with Rackoon Zombie Todd is a complete professional and a good person. There is a hole in the story. Yes. The story looks profound. But what the hell I still love this movie I hope Todd sheets will come out of the hiding place and do this that he is going to do. If anyone who has ever tried to create a movie, they know that they have just finished it as their own success.
