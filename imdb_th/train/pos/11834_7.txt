I love horses and hand-drawn animations, so I expect no surprises from Dreamworks. Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron I guess you might say I'm a bit disappointed You have wonderful animations and at first, what seems to be the perfect story. A story about anything but a horse in nature. Animals do not sing cute or even talk - important advantages Sadly, this film was not mentioned by Matt Damon; Happy soundtrack by Brian Adams; And enough action scenes to compare with Jerry Bruckheimer's production. If the filmmakers are with simplicity, we will have a masterpiece here. This is not a great movie. But is good entertainment for young children I would like to introduce this film to the family because it has a heart in the right place and the only thing that is now that is not offensive for children is not bad but probably much better The picture is very beautiful though.
