And may be the closest to the ghost story Although I found that the Ebenezer boy was hard to see (who had thought that it was my time, of course, they could do better!) Scott worked incredibly as Scrooge. Delivering some of his lines from Dickens finally brought it to me. Edward Woodward is everything we expected and presented from the Ghost of Christmas. I found GC Scott's Scrooge as a miser who believes more than the current version by Patrick Stewart, Christmas morning scene, when Scrooge realizes that he doesn't 'miss' is enough to convince Scott to know how to act as well. He is phenomenal here. Almost all the actors are unbelievable. The Tiny Tim in The Christmas Carol, this version looks too hard, too sweet. Music and scenery still have to watch every holiday. Enjoy!
