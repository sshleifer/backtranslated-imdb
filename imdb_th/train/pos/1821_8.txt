When I was a little girl (and my father owned a video store) this was one of my favorite movies. Since then I have never heard of this before, and I can't remember anything at all. It has been forgotten that others may be better. I managed to follow it down a few weeks ago and was surprised again. time Located in New Orleans in the 1930s. The animations are happy and the music is memorable. There are a few silly people that are contiguous if you look hard enough. But in general they do not distract from the story which makes you smile The character is convincing. (May be too old for younger children) as well. Hands up twice and for those of you who haven't seen it for a while
