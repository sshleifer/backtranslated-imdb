Have you ever been? You have a pet that is with you through thick and thin that you are missing by whom you love. No matter what? Betcha never thought they would feel the same way as you. <br /> <br /> Great and wonderful family movie. If you have weaknesses for animals, this is guaranteed to make you cry no matter how old. I have watched this movie all the time when I was a kid and I found that now at the age of sixteen I love it as much as I can. I can't decide about my favorite character and I still don't think I can! I love all three animals The conversation seems real and comfortable like a loving family. But there is a feud. I love Chance and in the end he says he has a family. Finally, Cheesy, yes, but must remember that this is a family movie and it fulfills that role perfectly. Shadow is the perfect leader / role model for Chance, an adventurous man. <br /> <br /> Animals that shine through humans That will be there during the interaction with them (eg. Help Molly and the end) do not have to mention the incredible soundtrack that gives each moment more emotion and the feeling that makes the heart swell / 10 that will be compared to (And better scoring) Cats and Dogs and Babe
