This movie is excellent. I didn't expect it to live on all the hype, but it did the same as all Bourne movies. Action, fast, realistic and intense. If you like two other movies in the trilogy, you will love this movie as well. The story of the movie is straightforward and there is no twist. The map is not realistic. Okay. The character Julia Stiles, who appears in the Italian safe house, looks good, especially after what happened in Supremacy. The only character in "Treadstone" that Bourne knew didn't want him to die and he May trust and be the only person to lead him in the right direction Actions are driven by the characters and their reactions to what is happening around them. What I always like about the Bourne movie is that Bourne can kick the buttocks, but when paired with a good person as he is fighting, and he receives a lot of damage in them. They never treat the audience like a fool. <br /> <br /> All actors are strong in their performances. I believe that Damon was able to play Bond in his sleep and received excellent support from Joan Allen to pay for her role from the highest position, David Strathin and Scott. Glenn I recommend this movie and the ending. Even if I miss Franka Potente
