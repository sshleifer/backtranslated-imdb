It is always satisfying when the detective concludes the case and the criminals are booked. In this case, the important point makes me more happy. To see the smile of a woman wiped out by Abigail Mitchell's face when she realizes that her victim has left "Testimony of death", which makes no doubt that her fault is very satisfying cry She got her own way by playing the role. Embarrassing 'little girl' in an older woman She formed a judge, a jury, and a death sentence for her niece's husband. <br /> <br /> When Columbo came too close, she tried to make him feel guilty. Speaking to the audience of high class women He flipped the table perfectly by speaking warmly and humanely about the reality of police work. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that can distract Colombo from seeking justice. Abby's final appeal to his good nature was rejected because he had too much self-respect that would not work well. This is a situation that you can't struggle from Ms Mitchell!
