The first time I saw this sensational documentary in its first release in 2001, and it had a huge impact on me until I bugged many of my friends to watch with replay. Bottom line: No, my friends walked out. Disappointed (ever!) This film is a film about Scottish conceptual artist Andy Goldsworthy, who created beautiful art using natural materials. (Water, flowers, flowers, stone, etc.) to create pieces that eventually return to the natural form Can we see Goldsworthy create many temporary artworks, including his long-term installation in important galleries around the world, including works of art in the natural world with Thomas Riedelsheimer? German filmmakers ordered photography and corrections in the real creative process for both eyes and ears. (With the music score surrounding the song written by Fred Frith, in general, his music is often frustrating Guitar that has the same texture as the talented band), although the film will be available on DVD for many years. But if you can find a movie theater that focuses on the revival of this movie, try to find it. (It's a movie made with a large screen easily. The sound system that specializes in touch with the film correctly) has no MPAA rating, but nothing to offend. (Unless the live birth of the sheep on the screen is determined to be invasive or disturbing)
