I just finished watching this film in GCSE's history class. It is exciting and has a deep understanding of what happened to Steve Biko at the time of racial discrimination. No one can say that this movie is the most boring or the most boring 2 and a half hours of their lives. I don't know because it makes me attracted from beginning to end. It was a good thing that Denzel Washington showed his image and showed that he fought against apartheid laws and received equal rights for blacks. In part, Steve Biko said to the police that we were weak It is a human being that you are. This is to show them that he and other black people in South Africa are no different from whites. Donald Woods inspired me because he struggled with what he believed and didn't believe in completely apartheid. He and Steve Biko became a very strong friendship that trembled throughout South Africa and continued to awaken the world. I am very happy with this movie and recommend this to everyone. It helps me to see that racism is not right and everyone is equal. Their fate should not be determined by someone's skin color.
