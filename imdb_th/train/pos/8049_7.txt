Overall, I have to say that I like movies. Some fighting scenes are very good. Especially the fight with Liang Yan One issue that really bothered me was the fact that they used Asian as a black man. I mean really Talk about bad tastes. During the fight scene, you see a fighter on the floor laughing. Otherwise, Sammo perfectly copies Bruce Lee's fight. 5 out of 10 stars.
