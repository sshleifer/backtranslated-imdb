And my children like it now! Granted, I can see now and realize that the animations are not good and the plot is repeated. Hey, if every village introduces itself by saying "I ammmmm DAAAARRRKK HEEEEAAARRT" I think they might laugh at But for young children, it is a moral story with an ear of music. <br /> <br /> A song that is attached to the ear. I would like to recommend this one for young children.
