Haven't seen this movie since its debut But it was a memorable performance by Rip Torn and Conchata Farrell. Excellent, excellent photography, moving stories and everything else about it is the highest standard But it seems to have been forgotten. <br /> <br /> Perhaps because the UK is a strange market for it. But I do not watch TV movies or videos which are sad It has been more successful in America where it may be seen as a historical drama that is precise. The title theme is a simple single clarinet. But the movement of "What we have friends in Jesus" This film proves that! Am I right or wrong?
