As the director of this film has gained popularity in Asia It is quite difficult to bring Hellmale's movie because most of his movies are filmed with limited budgets. There is almost no USD at all, but it is amazing to prove that Mats Helge will eventually do things. The so-called action movie Mission Ninja is - I think - the best of the movies directed by him. Some special effects are quite fun. This is not a movie "B" or "C". It is a movie "Z" - but it's a fun and fun "Z" movie!
