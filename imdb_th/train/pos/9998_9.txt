Seeing that the average vote is relatively low and the fact that the video shop clerk thinks it's "just ok". I don't expect much when renting this movie. <br /> <br /> In contrast to Above, I enjoy it a lot. This is a charming movie. It doesn't have to grow with me. I enjoy it. From the beginning, Mel Brooks gave a great performance as a lead character. I think it is quite different from his general in his movie. An amazing joke or something like that. And overall, this is a very fun and easy-to-see movie. <br /> <br /> Very recommended.
