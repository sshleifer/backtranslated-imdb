At first I got Sarah's performance rating with obesity. 8 But I struggled a little with her humor late at night and some 7 was what I judge. <br /> <br /> <br /> You will like Sam's humor. Oh, or you won't. If you can't, I wonder if anyone can persuade you. You know who you are and it is normal. But you know as well Moving in the first season gave us an amazing story about Sarah, her friends and family, and the pursuit of her life. In one memorable episode, she was "pulled" by staff member Jay, who she first met - "Do you know why I stood here?" He asked. "Because you have all C in high school," she replied. Strangely, it seems to be a genuine question - that's a joke in my book. Sarah can come to you from a strange angle. At other times, the relationship between her and God is very funny. God is the helper and envy It's a wise story. It's a distorted view. But she will show the truth in a joke and we laugh. <br /> <br /> Then the second season arrived. While it's not without having a new and creative joke, we seem to slip down quite funny, poop and funny fart quite easily. I get good laughter here and there. But it seems that most fillers while she and the writer try to incite original content Complexity and boring are the feelings that I had in the past. But I dug it out to find the gems that I found (Tao) and waited for her to turn around. I was a fan of her "Jesus is Magic" routine and wanted to think that I understood what she was capable of. Let's go back and see.
