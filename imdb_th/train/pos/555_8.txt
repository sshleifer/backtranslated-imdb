My comments will be added to the published date. But I can't find a place I was really surprised to see that the film was released in the United States in February 1955. I saw it in the theater. "First Run" in Washington, DC in March 1958. Wondering whether it will be launched again or have problems? In my opinion, this movie has very little entertainment. But there are some classic characters. John McIntyre works as a judge / entrepreneur who steals corruption. Walter Brennan performed the same duties that he had done last year. And in my opinion, James Stewart gave a good performance as he had done I've watched this movie for half a dozen or more and never feared seeing another part of it. Photography and scenery are excellent and offer amazing entertainment in one hour and thirty-six minutes.
