Movies created for this TV are great movies. This may be the best and favorite chapter of BAFTA, who won John Thaw (Kavanagh QC and Inspector Morse). The widowed man Tom Oakley lived in a village alone for a period of time from his wife and son. He died and now he landed with an immigrant called Willaim Beech. When he got to know this boy, he began to develop friendships. Until Willaim's mother (Annabelle Apsion) wants him to come back After Tom worried about William not contacting him, he went to London to find him. In the end, Willaim returned home with a loving family (or father) during World War II. Nominated for BAFTA Lew Grade and won the National Television Award for the popular drama John Thaw, ranked 3rd in the 50 greatest stars of the TV. Very good!
