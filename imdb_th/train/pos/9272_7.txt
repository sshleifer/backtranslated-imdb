This is Panahi's first film that I saw. I saw it at the Melbourne Film Festival. I was totally absorbed by the various characters he created and how they responded and behaved differently from the Aussie children and on other levels. I think maybe if a lot of people can watch movies like this, they can see people as individuals and avoid racism that is often fueled by fear of the unknown. There is a clear political difference between Oz culture and Iranian culture. But I found a more subtle difference between the characters, which the film successfully projected on the movie screen. There are strange habits in the characters that seem to me unique. I find it makes the characters look interesting.
