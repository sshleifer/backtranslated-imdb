This must be one of the best comedies on television at the moment. It uses the sweet, sweet thoughts of the show to revolve around a family that is close and becomes quite realistic. But the jokes of the general family, along with the siblings and parents, quarreled, the siblings, the rest of the father, the defending father and the sister bimbo. I was almost surprised that it was Disney! That it's funny and doesn't try to be more Too many performances (such as 'Sister, Sister' and 'Lizzie McGuire') think just because the characters bring it as a teenager, and then they should deal with social problems and end up with a sense of humor by hitting too hard. The inevitable '8 Simple Rules' trap It solved some problems. (Like being expelled from school) but having fun while doing so In fact, only once is it really serious. It is understandable when it handles John Ritter's tragic death and his character. <br /> <br /> And I think The creation of the '8 Simple Rules' sign can still do well if it recognizes humor and does not make Kate's father the second generation of Paul Hennessy.
