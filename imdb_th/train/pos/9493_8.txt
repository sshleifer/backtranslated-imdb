White Fire can do a lot with Larry Bird, which looks like Robert Ginty, bringing the cost to go out with his great hair and the best male mustache. The special talent he had at this time made Tom Zelleck look like a fool. When Ginty beat everyone, this movie appeared surprisingly when the story of the diamond was tricked into play. Then add in the Fred Williamson front bushes, saw attacks and a great incest pattern .... this flick ends at the delivery of all cylinders. If you are looking for a great B-Action, this is where it is. Now, if I keep that soundtrack
