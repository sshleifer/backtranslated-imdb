One of the movies "My favorite country" I don't know if there are people in our country who don't watch this movie! It's funny and sad at certain times ... I don't know people around the world. (Those who have the opportunity to see) accept this film because you have to know the time in Serbian history and the characteristics of Serbs in the first half of the 20th century to be able to understand! But as I see here, there are some people from Canada who watch it ... and he likes it. <br /> <br /> I think I will try to put all the good words from the movies on this website, but first of all. To see how to do ... <br /> <br /> Bravo
