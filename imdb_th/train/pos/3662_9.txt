This is a really strange movie - and that's not a bad thing. It is a combination of new, realistic movies about homeless children and fairy tales. I'm sure some people might find this movie a bit strange. But i like it Again, this director gathered the best performers of people in everyday life. (Not an actor) and received all the wonderful performances Although not as sad as Umberto Dee But both movies have very similar points - this film is made in a very ridiculous manner. No need to pay attention to the magical effects because it was created in the early 1950s and that special technique is not very important. (Or at least not in the movie) just sit back and enjoy a strange and ridiculous ride You will have a ball. <br /> <br /> You also have children. <br /> <br /> Since I watched this movie for the first time, I saw another movie directed by DeSica. miss Kids are watching us Although it is not a fantasy or a light in the spirit like a miracle in Milan But excellent movies
