Yesterday I joined the world premiere of "Descent" at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York. I have a good time. It was sold out and joined by all the big stars, including my friend Marcus Patrick. <br /> <br /> I gave the movie 7.5, starting with 10 possible stars. <br /> <br /> The movie started. Beginning with Maya (Rosario Dawson) at college, you can imagine the general college environment with partying and flirting. The shooting in this movie is great. She meets Jared (Chad Faust) and they become lovers. It looks like other relationships. At first, the man is in the pursuit of the interest and affection of women and women playing hard to get. Both played well. A very naive lovemaking between these two He invited her to his apartment and everything broke down. <br /> <br /> The apartment was boring and very dark. They eventually ended up in a very dark basement and lit many candles. This reminds me of the real dungeon. This is where he shows his true colors and how to rape her. This is a dark and aggressive rape scene. This scene is not suitable for young people or vulnerable. The rape scene is a little long and difficult. But it is necessary for the rest of the movie to follow. <br /> <br /> Maya now begins to lose her soul to drugs and sex. She falls into her own depth. She began to join the party overly and woke up one morning in the room without having to remember how she got there. She told me to see Marcus Patrick. The first thing I remember about this character was that they said "He is the one who helps people who want to save." They began a relationship of dependency which came into play later in the movie. The scene of the club at this point of the film was taken with great expertise. I think they did very well and I noticed that the director of photography was appreciated at the end of the show while the audience received the credit. <br /> <br /> Yama Maya returned. Come to study at the college again. Her class - Jared, her villain !! You can see the confusion and emotions on Maya's face. What should I do? What can I do next? The image of her face and emotions is priceless. <br /> <br /> The next thing that is resolved is not what happened. She's interested in Jared. She seems to be looking to revive her relationship and become a lover again I sat there by saying that this could happen. It wasn't. Nothing was far from the truth. <br /> <br /> She invited him to her apartment and he certainly appeared. Now her apartment is dark and sandy. She makes him completely undone He thought he would get "good luck". Then she pretended him like every woman could. She caught him everywhere and he was excited. Note :: For those who plan to watch this movie, this scene is full of nudity, front-facing, may not be suitable for younger audiences. <br /> <br /> Then she Will change the situation around and become a beast and rape him again. The dark and harsh scenes <br /> <br /> If you are going to watch a movie and don't want to know what will happen next, skip this paragraph. And go to At the end of the paragraph <br /> <br /> This is where Adrian put the picture again. Maya has Adrian to help her by showing very rough sex with Jared. She thinks this is the last revenge. Adrian continues to use Jared's manhood. Marcus, while Adrian plays this scene to believe that anyone can do it, he is a strong actor who plays strong characters and strength all over the screen. Marcus explains that this scene requires a lot of trust between him and Chad. Maya believes that this revenge will help her. But I don't think it will be like that One of the last scenes has Mays's face nearby and you will see tears flowing down her cheeks. This is a great close-up scene and encourages continued conversations from everyone who goes to watch this movie. Did you get the revenge you wanted? Is it as satisfying as you expect? In my opinion it is not It makes matters worse. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie that will do well. I will be a little hesitant if under the age of 17 should commend Rosario, Chad and Marcus for a job that works well. The director and the photos must be praised as well. It was the night I was happy.
