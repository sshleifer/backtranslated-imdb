I am very glad that in this movie, Othello himself is a black person and Des De Mona does not have a fair hair like almost every time. The actors played very well as well, and I like the script that follows honestly Shakespeare's original text. But I have to say that some of the scenes are too horrible for characters such as Desdemona. I always thought that she was very polite and that was the reason why it was not suitable to show her in bed with Cassio - although it happened in Othello's imagination. At first I was slightly surprised, although the love scene between Otello and Desdemona was openly expressed. But overall I like this movie and especially Desdemona who cries in the dying scene.
