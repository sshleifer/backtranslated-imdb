This movie is nothing missing from the dark masterpiece. I may have prejudices because the apartheid era is the area that I always feel. But I will say that it is ranked with Cry Freedom and Cry the Beloved Country. Sadly, until a few days ago, I never heard of it at all. Inside is one of the lowest-rated movies of all time, probably because of a small movie company. I have never heard of this before. Eric Stoltz, one of my favorite actors, is incredible and amazing. Norn has a cowardly role. Don't look for humor in this movie. It is true, cruelty and bravery to the end, and for those who are sensitive, I will say that bring the tissue box. But the great movie that makes you wonder why is the greatest movie that has never been heard before?
