Evidence of a simple matter: an old man who lives alone in the forest accidentally stumbles upon the murder of a young child and tries to convince the police that the murder occurred. Although there is very little talk in this movie But the storytelling with the eyes of the camera alone makes this movie charming. The setting of the gray forest represents the feeling of loneliness that complements the character's tranquility. In addition, we can feel the power of the old man to not be able to convince the police to kill him, causing the detained child to not be able to tell her story. <br /> <br /> The real fear is in Feeling of hopelessness. This film was successful in managing these elements only with images rather than using cheap sound effects or blood and blood. The horror on the other /> <br /> The lecture weakened wisely story <br unfold slowly. In order to create tension during the creepy and shocking times The ending is unexpected and convincing. Reminiscent of Japanese horror movies such as "The Ring" and "Dark Water" or British horror movies such as "Lady in Black" and "The Innocents". This film allows viewers to experience the horror experience in a true atmosphere. I encourage everyone who is happy with the fear of making this movie. Try it. <br /> <br /> If you haven't watched the movie I just mentioned above, you might want them to try. also
