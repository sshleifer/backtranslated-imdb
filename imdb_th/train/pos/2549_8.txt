Ronald Coleman, a polite male actor, has performed here like in all of his other films. He is in every scene truly, and this animated film is still fresh because he is not him. He is a handsome, witty and very intelligent person, as he continues to be the next step of his beloved and beloved wife played by Anna Lee. This film is based on French play and applies the best qualities of that story. Most of the supporting actors are well-known, at least in front of them, if not the name ... and are especially suitable for very funny movies. The amazing Mr. Coleman is a combination of Sean Connery and Clark Gable as he steps Go ahead of other characters. His diverse talents can be admired in the classic "Lost Horizon", where every movie has to be watched.
