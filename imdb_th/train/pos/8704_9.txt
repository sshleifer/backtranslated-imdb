There are many scandals coming out of Hollywood recently. <br /> <br /> Friends send me movies that are surprising. It's great. <br /> <br /> I'm open. Can't stop watching it as a drama But with strange Imagine if Romeo in Shakepeare has magical power or not It is sad and poetic. At the same time, Hollywood should observe a new Russian cinema. They are telling a story that is not about explosions and great cgi. This is like an Asian movie with a dark Russian spiral. Get it incomplete But nothing is You know what power is But it was never explained and was not fully realized It became secondary to the mood of the story. I do not want to see a new creation. It's too cool, as the Hollywood system normally does to make it messy. That show is the most important thing. The supervision and operation of the camera is superior to most nonsense. I would like to admire everyone involved and I will turn many people into this independent epic. +++++ <br /> <br /> If you can find me, watch it.
