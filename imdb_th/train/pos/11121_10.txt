As a man who saw every season, I can say that JG surprised me all the time. I mean, after you saw him change from laughter to paranoia immediately in every season, and after he did everything a little, you believe he was a gangster. He can go in. But after seeing him open his eyes and struggling for his life, I mean I almost feel the pain he "makes". Will pass I was impressed with his performance so much that I immediately thought of Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. These are the best models and more than that. But today they are both old and dead (Brando) and it's okay that they make movies less and their performances are "lighter" than they used to be. I can't wait to see Gandolfini in other films that he has a completely different role. Can you recommend his old movies that he gives memorable performances?
