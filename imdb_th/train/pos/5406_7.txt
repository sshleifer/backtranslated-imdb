The 4th Pokemon movie makes me cry when Celebi dies. You dare not say Pokemon suck! I do not like when someone says .... I like Pokémon for 5 or 6 years, so everyone should enjoy Pokémon, including this movie and other Pokémon movies. That Pokémon are excellent and should be enjoyed by people of all ages And why those who hate Pokémon give low rates for all or almost all Pokemon movies? I don't understand .... They shouldn't do that ... There is no reason why people should vote without proving that Pokémon is sucked aside from the fact that: 1) Pokémon for young children only Pokémon is stupid and 3) People should not like Pokemon. I think this is the reason people don't like Pokemon.
