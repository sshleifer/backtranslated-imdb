This was the first time that Columbo filmed, but still aired as the second episode after Steven Spielberg's "Columbo: Murder by the Book". At the same time being one of the better people. <br /> <br /> Bernard L. Kowalski is a creative director! It is not surprising that they asked him to direct Columbia's three films. This movie has a really creative and creative shock sequence, and the overall film is created in style, passionate and detailed. Every shot is connected and is the reason why this movie is better and looks better than the average. It is one of the best Columbo movies. <br /> <br /> It's a traditional Columbo program. Who quit because of two reasons The murder has more or less accidents and is an impulsive act. Therefore, the killers at this time therefore do not have any time to plan the 'perfect murder' in advance and he must clear any traces after that and must rid the body. The killer in this film not only But managed as a crime But still more than men who helped the Colombian lieutenant to solve the murder problem It makes the character more interesting and layered, and also helps the way that Columbo solves all crimes that seem more interesting as well. Of course, Columbo began to doubt him before time and he often solved the problem by Make yourself weak and look stupid than he certainly is to be trusted by the killer. Obviously there is no spoiler as this is the way every Columbo movie will be established. I like the story of the movie and its progress. <br /> <br /> It also helps the film to have a good performer as well. At the time of this film, Peter Falk made his own Columbo character, and the characters in this film were fully developed. Robert Culp was truly fantastic as Brimmer had a short temper. The funny thing is that he will perform in the next three Columbo movies "Mrs. Columbo" in a completely different role. He also played as a murderer in two movies as well. He was not the only actor to do this in the Columbia film later. In addition, the great Ray Millland also appeared in this film as the victim's husband. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a great early Columbia movie. <br /> < br /> 9/10
