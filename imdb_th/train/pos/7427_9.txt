I saw an example for this film in the 70s when I was 16 years old. I rarely watched another movie. How excited am I and my best friend? We can't wait a month or more until it happens. I watched this movie 17 times a year at the theater. I love love love it Chris is perfect for this movie. He is a radical and kind person. But was shy and unsure with the Babs and it was loved to see again When they sang the Evergreen at the studio and he sang with his voice different from the perfect note from her But I always thought that this was the best scene in the movie. The way he looked at her and he was very proud. I could watch this movie every day. We tried to dress like her. She also had sweaters and long hats like she was wearing. This thing comes on TV on time and I have a daughter to watch them as teenagers and they like it a lot. Maybe it's just that I'm caught up in it when everything isn't known. The ending has tears. I'm always even today.
