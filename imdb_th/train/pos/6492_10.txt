I'm not a very good writer, so I'll keep this short. World at War is the best World War II documentary I've ever seen. I've seen different World War II documentaries. (Not just English / North American) and this documentary appears to be the most complete World War I documentary I've ever seen. I think it can talk a little more about the Great Depression and why / Hitler reaches power. But it works very well that covers the war Seems to be complete and objective / fair to everyone It does not exaggerate or reduce the role of various countries. There are many original images, including many color images and eye witnesses. (It was created in the 70s when there is more life.) It has great music and narrator. All in all, I gave this one 10/10 because it was good (I didn't see the special DVD version, so I couldn't comment)
