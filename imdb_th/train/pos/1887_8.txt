Arthur is a 'middle-aged' child, a rich man who drinks like fish. Arthur does what he feels and speaks whatever is in his heart. He likes to brag about his riches and knows that he is a spoiled brat. He spent money with people he didn't know and found everything funny. Arthur must marry a high-ranking young woman to receive a great heritage. But he fell in love with the poor sister Liza Minnelli (she looks really strange) <br /> <br /> This is a nasty funny movie I watched this movie because the famous Indian movie 'Sharabee' is based on Arthur's character, although 'Sharabee' is inspired by 'Arthur', but I think they are two different films. 'Arthur' is fun. It was repeated many times There is one great torpedo in this movie. It's not a laughing riot. But it has a great time My favorite scene is when Arthur meets his fiance's father and he talks about 'Muddy' Duddley Moore. Of course there are some comic moments. He is very good in both speech and body language. I like the scene in which he talks about standing with a couple sitting in a hotel about a 'small' country, and he continues to talk to his husband and wife in two different directions. I don't know that actor I don't think he will do a great job. But maybe if I watched his work that I might agree in the future The movie has a flat patch, but not for long, looking forward to the sequel.
