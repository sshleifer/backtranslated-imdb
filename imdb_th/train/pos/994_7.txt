I watched this movie once and probably watched again, but even though Jamie Foxx is good in the movie But I feel that they can use the 'funny little' character as Alvin Sanders, the scene of Foxx in prison when he encounters Edgar Clean (David Morse) too funny. Drawing a wonderful picture of the police Difficult features But most of his quiet is suitable for his role Morse meets Doug Hutchinson (Bristol) again at the movie theater. Morse ended up hard in Hutchinson. They are both perfect for this situation in each movie. I also like that quality in the movie that the actor ended up in the same situation as the previous movie, the second one made in The Green Mile. Overall, it's a good movie.
