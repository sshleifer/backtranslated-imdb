Let me be the first non-Australian to comment on this topic :) I received the movie Hugo Weaving and I watched it until the end. It was one of the films "Drama of Life" while my mother used to call a movie that showed real life stories without special events and that was the most explanation. <br /> <br /> I like the light and Women. The rest is not too wrong. But not too much merit I am pursuing something like an interview or at least having a villain matrix element here and there. But nothing is wrong The story teaches how to confront your own destiny and escape from the environment that others create for you. But this happens when the life that the peach factory in the area is near is over, so there is no effort to change things. <br /> <br /> The song "American Beauty" that sounds like in the background may be Part of a larger soundtrack But just playing it over and over again becomes annoying after the 100-minute movie. <br /> Finally, I think it's his duty to present a part of Australian life. But for me, it doesn't look particularly Australian. (May be placed anywhere) and it doesn't look as interesting as it is <br /> <br /> I think it must be in the mood to like the movie
