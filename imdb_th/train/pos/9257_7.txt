Is this your typical woman in the navy's love story network? Maybe hell, do you know how the formula works? Now, there are beautiful women brought into the picture. Some people have to fall in love with you. <br /> <br /> I think this movie follows the general story. But that doesn't say anything about the content. There are wonderful scenes with Crispen Glover, Dennis Hopper and Gary Busey. Despite being short, some things don't make sense, like having to join a random fight. But it's fun to watch the fight. Well done. <br /> <br /> This is the most important joke. There are many good feelings. The humor is well balanced, you won't get sick. But you can smile. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of raging, so not for children.
