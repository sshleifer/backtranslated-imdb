Back in 1994, I had a very long holiday, about the fourth of July - sometimes stopped for 17 consecutive days, two holidays, weeks and holidays. I was in the city at that time, went out to visit my parents' house. <br /> <br /> I don't have a TV in my apartment, so I used to watch my parents tube. I just watched the part of the X file. When the program came into being called Personal FX, I was immediately hooked. I am fascinated by the things in our home that come from the parents' house and passed on from the heritage of relatives and often wondering about history, values, etc. <br /> <br /> After a long weekend me I used to go to someone's home at my lunch time just to catch a personal FX. <br /> <br /> I can remember one time while Claire Carter co-hosts the announcement that the apartment. New York at The series is being filmed, which has been updated and once said that the renovation is complete. Personl FX will return to the air. <br /> <br /> It's never been done! Personal FX is the first and best item in the accumulated list. And it disappeared from the air! Almost fifteen years later, I'm still hurt. <br /> <br /> How to go to FX
