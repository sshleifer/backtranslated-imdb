I agree that I am a vampire addict: I've seen many vampire movies that I lost counting and this movie is ranked among the top ten. I was very impressed with John Carpenter's original vampires, and when I descended from the sequel, I went out to buy. This movie does not obey the same rules at first and it is not very dark. But it was close enough and I felt it was beautifully built on the original <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi is a very good person. As good as Derek Bliss: His performance is a favorite and is still hard enough for the audience to believe that he can actually survive in the world in which he lives. One of my favorite parts is after he meets Zoey and walks into the restaurant's bathroom to check if she is more than she looks. His comments are not respected and can still be used, in contrast to other scenes as he solves. <br /> <br /> Other actors were chosen very well. It is not just a new update of the first film. But it grew in a way similar to the way that Fright Night II grew from Fright Night. There are different elements that make this movie a similar theme. <br /> <br /> If you like vampire movies I recommend this If you like movies that have less blood, choose something else.
