As summarized in one line, said that two movies left my words when I walked out of the cinema, one was "Stir of Echoes" with Kevin Bacon and the second was "Vanilla Sky". /> It is one of the movies that you sit in the theater seats and stop thinking about whoever is around you. Stop wondering what the final movie will be and let this film reach you quickly, wherever you want ... Walking out of the cinema looks a bit strange, like the feeling you get when you're sick and Don't think anything One of those movies that you are one with men and feel that there is nothing that moves around you better than things in the movie. <br /> <br /> One thing is for sure. Best actor, great audio track, and everything in the movie is 9+. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen and the best and most shocking movie. My life and purpose in this world
