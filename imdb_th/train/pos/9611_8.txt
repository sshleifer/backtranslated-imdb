This is a surprisingly smart story for television movies and true to my experience of bulimia. It's a really good research and I can conclude that it was written by someone with similar experiences because it has all the little details. The characters are quite good and the performances of Mare Winningham and Alison Lohman are excellent. I think what I like most is that they make them more specific and intelligent, and there is no reason for Beth's bulimia to be reduced (not "uncontrollable dietary control caused by pressure From various media The pressure that we are not talking about ... ") Her mother is not naive - often on TV. They have problems that everyone is aware of and try to tell us that their protagonists are The last remaining person on the planet without ("Diabetes? Oh, my world is all wondering the doctor, please explain to me all as if I was a small child "etc.) It was great that her mother was a psychologist and even though she didn't see the signs and scenes that Beth was throwing. Watching over the greed and scandal and focusing on the need to maintain bulimics' secrets and out of control that Beth told her mother that she was a shrill that would make me cry. No other /> <br /> In a Okay, I <br like those bits. The thing that is not working for me is the ending, which goes back to the land of television movies that we know and do not especially love. But I think they have to wrap it "You can treat your child's eating disorders if you have a lot of money and live in America ..." <br /> <br /> And I would like to say again that I like Mare Winningham. She's good.
