It may be the best image that the manufacturer Releasing Corp had created. This small horror piece received attention from beginning to end. Director Frank Wisbar knew that it was a good thing when he wrote one chapter and what was more important was that he knew how to realize his shocking potential on the screen. Not only the story involves the characters that attract attention only But that scene is completely different from this world! All actions occur either at night or in the middle of dense fog. This cool atmosphere was filled by Wisbar's creative direction and the credible performances he received from all of his players. The lovely Rosemary La Planche makes the heroine in a beautiful, lively but fragile way. Robert Barrat presents His usual nonsense image in the bigwig image, although it is hard to believe that the good and elegant person who plays his son is none other than Blake / writer. Blake Edwards
