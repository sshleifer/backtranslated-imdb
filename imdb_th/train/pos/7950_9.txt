First of all, I love Bruce Broughton's music score, which is lyrical and this adds charm to the movie. The best aspect of this movie is the three animals that are brilliantly voiced by Michael J.Fox, Sally Field and Don Ameche at the end. While the fox has the most fun line, Ameche plays quite obsessed with other characters (The sound of reason) and the field add intelligence as a character who often sees the opportunity to tell it out. Humans do not participate and sometimes the movie is dragged. But that is my only complaint I believe this is a movie with a beautiful look with beautiful Canadian close-ups. Although this movie is quite long But never had a boring time, and this is a great advantage from sound and screenplay work Overall, it is a charming movie and may be underestimated by 9/10 from me, Bethany Cox.
