So being a fan of a horror movie that is quite deep for a long time, I've seen people who make me jump. <br /> <br /> Of course, when it comes to coming out ... it's a better hell than the ring. What I didn't get was that many people we talked to after the movie thought it was scary. If that's what you think, then whether it's ... I know what I like and spend time. Fair amount to make me feel really scared, so I have to say that this is worth watching. <br /> <br /> Now you may be disappointed in this matter if you want everything in a neat and orderly manner. Because the story goes a little further to help create the story (I think if acting in the order of time, it will destroy all things.) <br /> <br /> I'm really happy that this movie has a little bit of blood ... maybe the rest of the writers' studio. You may feel that you don't have to splash red all over the scene to make people scared.
