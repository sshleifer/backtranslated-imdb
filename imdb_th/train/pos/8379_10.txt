I remember this movie when I was 12. It was amazing .. I remember until the day, unlike what I watched the most. At that time I tried to buy it. But it's like sh * t! However, the show is quite gentle. But the story is amazing, considering that it is a real B movie with a low budget and the fight scenes are amazing to watch. I have to watch it for about 20 times. Fight with a robot controlled by a giant man. Unfortunately, they have to destroy it by spinning crappy. "Crash and Burn" Don't watch that movie as it is! If your real sci-fi movie fans watch this, if it's being rebuilt today, it will be a winner .. I love to see remake or even release the DVD of it.
