"Le Locataire" ("tenant") is one of the most important horror movies that has never been seen before, making Polanski perform as Trelkovsky, a shy file clerk who lives in Paris. Advertise the apartment only to find that Previously, the tenant tried to commit suicide by leaping from the apartment window. Trelkovsky was forced to visit her in the hospital and there he met Stella (Isabelle Adjani). Fisky moved immediately when the tenant died. Found that it was a good apartment, his happiness was replaced by a wave of paranoia when he began to doubt his neighbor more, which seemed to try to provoke Trelkovsky to commit suicide by the previous tenant. Very wonderful A terrifying and paranoid atmosphere. A wonderful time, like the classic scenes that Trelkovsky discovered, the tenant's teeth earlier in the hole in the wall or the dream he walked into the building. The bathroom to find the walls covered with hieroglyphics. Photography by Sweenekvist is truly beautiful. "Tenants" are abandoned gems that can be difficult to follow. But it is worth the effort
