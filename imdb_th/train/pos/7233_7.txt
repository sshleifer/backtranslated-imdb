I haven't read all the comments. But at least one poster said that there may be a short 30 minutes. I was curious about myself because the next part of the film didn't make me feel anything even when I watched them again 30 minutes. That would be very short for the movie in 1917 "Poor Little Rich Girl", which is the next movie of the Tourneur, takes 65 minutes and "Pride of the Clan", his previous feature, is 84 minutes loud So I was relieved when I saw that I was not crazy. There must have been a part of the film missing and that is why the resolution is not very reasonable. <br /> <br /> It's hard to check or comment. in The movie you can see only half of ... but I would recommend this film further because the view is really interesting that it gave us the inside of the East Coast movie studio of the time. It was the first movie. I have personally seen that based on the movie industry itself. The main character is a movie star played by Robert Warwick, who later became a stellar Hollywood actor and appeared in almost all of Preston Stirling's films. He plays the Western actor, perhaps a model of William S. Hart, which Warwick has some similar characteristics After an interesting scene in the studio, we saw them in the filming location, where he discovered a girl in the countryside. (Doris Kenyon) and convince her to come to New Jersey to test the terrible screen. After that, the point that the movie seems to have disappeared in the form that we have now. <br /> <br /> Once again, I will recommend to everyone who has an interest in film history for a documentary. But in the form that we It is not much as a movie and is not a good example of Maurice Tourneur's work.
