I think the context of the story is covered by other posters, so I want to write about the impact that this movie has on me. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time in 1987. I arranged a trip to see a movie to see the RE project. I think of course that we are all excited because we go on a trip to the cinema! We know little about what we are going to experience. To this day I still remember the feelings it has in me and I remember crying as much as most of my friends. I think that when we find that it is shocking and quiet at the age of our own, it affects me as I join the anti-apartheid movement in the same year. <br /> <br /> I Think that serves as an objective in my case
