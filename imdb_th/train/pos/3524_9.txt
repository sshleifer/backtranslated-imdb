For the interest of Chuck Davis and Emefy: I saw PHANTOM LADY years ago when I was not a jazz. There is an exhibition until the end of June in the new MUSEE DU QUAI BRANLY brand in Paris, named LE SIECLE DU JAZZ, which should not be missed with special entertainment copied from jazz movies including the famous drum sequence of PHANTOM LADY. I've seen Gene Krupa - and Elisha Cook Jr - in almost all of their films and I can confirm the following: 1.Elisha Cook Jr has been dubbed in the movie. That is some progress due to his other characteristics. He was killed. (Most are in Howard Hawks' big sleep.) 2. Krupa may be called Cook in PL. I can remember his style because he graduated from Tom-Tom who used (and was abused) in the early stages of his career. He - in the year 1937, in a Hollywood hotel, singing in the singles and at the end of the Hollywood hotel - and finally there was everything possible. Call in French "la caisse claire" 3. The order from the PL, at least as shown in the museum, is not censored. Harry carasso, Paris, France
