This is "B Series" Film Noir and my vote reflects membership in that category. Last night I watched this movie at the left theater in Paris, where the film was released two weeks ago. This film has some drawbacks. Yes. But there are many interesting elements that can be overlooked. <br /> <br /> According to the previous reviewer (B movie can step on the movie A is forbidden!) And interesting story However, for Franchot Tone, I do not agree: for me, he is a mysterious person. Only the correct shadow is creepy. We have to remember that there is a German facial expression going on here (director Robert Siodmark is a German who came to Hollywood during the war) and the air is too true for this movie. <br /> <br /> However, it's a beautiful Ella Rain, who only has her third performance that makes this audience to watch the "Girl" category. Which is similar to Gene Tierney. It is surprising that she did not become a household name. But she's very good here. I just ordered her new movie ('IMPACT') from the internet and I can't wait to watch as well.
