This is the best of fairy tales! The villains are completely evil and the heroes are pure, refreshing. Danes, Deniro and Pfieffer are great, just like the new actors who played the role of Tristan. Great performances, delightful magic, funny and amazing, and a fairytale ending Perfect, making this movie absolutely fantastic! I'm not sure that all the content is suitable for young children. But for older audiences, there are hilarious sub-content! For example, not making this movie fair! My fiance and I are quite skeptical. But very excited that we used this opportunity in this film, which I hope will be confident that anyone on the fence about this movie will try
