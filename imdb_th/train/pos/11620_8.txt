A little shock I expect some stupid horror movies. But what I received was a short film that was thrilling without wasting time. Most of these movies have to go behind the characters so we can feel sympathy for them or hate when people start to be killed. O Folly here. Yes, you see a few characters. But they only interact with the principal Such as husband and wife at the motel where the room was canceled We see them, so we can only do how the Lisa character is effective and how new hotel staff are not effective. We saw a little girl just because she had a small but important role later in the movie when he broke the flight of the Atrendants because we wanted especially to move the plot forward. The bad guy in particular needs her to start the flight. People who are rude on the airport are also important to movies. Only 2 characters that are just 5 liners that are not useful to the plot are two young men on the plane. That is a wise matter because I think they will have a story related to the story. From the first scene to the last female character, the hotel manager named Lisa is responsible. Even when Jackson showed his true color, she didn't have to panic. She thinks she can do anything to stop time. Other films that women, senior executives, will act like stupid people. But not this one It was a short film and I waited for a normal plot device to kick in because this movie seemed to end quickly. Thank you for not using The new hotel staff did not do as usual, called and told her what to do, which was a phone drop and ran out of the hotel without saying anything or asking your boss and telling her that she had to drink a lot and chase. Craven should make this movie more Another recent comment is Brian Cox in the movie. But I don't know who he is I have to come here to see if he is Lisa's father. He can't remember completely.
