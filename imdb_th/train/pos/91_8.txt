In general, it's a good movie that has an ideal ending. The performance was excellent and the characters didn't stray from their people. I especially like this plot, even if you know what will happen, it will still surprise you throughout the story. However, I found that coming to an end may be a little longer. (May be a bit long) - for me, it seems like it's a little hurry As if the author tried to remove the sheets before the rain fell. For example - What happened to Hayden, Tristan's brother? For what we know, he died in the hospital. Maybe he was the one who installed all things! Who knows! Maybe there will be a sequel? maybe? If there is .. I can't wait to see it.
