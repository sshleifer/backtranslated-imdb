Dudley Moore is wonderful in this immense classic that This movie is a very witty film that relies on the talent of many actors. Without Dudley Moore, John Jill Kut, Lisa Minnelli and a few others, this movie could be a disaster. It is not always shot and sometimes there are monotonous songs that try to force emotions. (The song is like "Psycho" in a wedding fight), but the show defeats it. Arthur, the character is hilarious with his drunken comments. But he developed the character to become more mature and better rounded as he learned to live his own free will. The end is quite repetitive. I will not give it away. But it will improve Appreciate many times
