Fay Grim is a real example of what I call a complete puzzle movie. It has everything about showing direction, story and entertainment. They all together and when finished, then create a masterpiece Fay Grim. <br /> <br /> The film follows Fay Grim's mother alone, trying to raise her son until she is not her father and healed Soon, the CIA contacted Faye in the hope of finding her husband's eighth journal. These journals are filled with confessions of his long past in the CIA and his involvement with the country and government actions. Angels were sent to find these journals in response to instead leaving her brother out of prison and being sent to hunt cats and mice throughout Europe to recover these journals and learn the secrets hidden in their husbands. She's in the past. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey is my favorite actor. After I watched her in The OH in Ohio and the Best in Show, she brought vitality to her two comedy roles. But Fay Grim is a different role from the other two movies. Posey made me believe that what was happening on the screen I felt to you, I was deeply rooted for you and I wanted to know more. She grabbed you while she was on the screen and when she closed, you couldn't stop thinking about what happened to you. <br /> <br /> I didn't see any other previous work by the writer / person. Director Hal Hartley, but I believe I will consider watching his previous movie if they are half as good as Fay Grim. <br /> <br /> If you decide to choose a smart movie next time You decide to rent images. Or buy DVD, I want you to choose Fay Grim. If you have a common sense that the movie should be, you will enjoy this movie very much.
