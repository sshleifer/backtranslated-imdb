One of the best comedians ever I have seen this program for about 10 times and may see at least 100 more. My friends and family refer to this DVD. Often you think that we do nothing but watch The beginning of Alcatraz is a bit slow. But wade through or pass to the part where Eddie is on the stage Explain just by watching) The best part of the performance may be Eddie's facial expression. He can speak a lot with his eyes. (Mascara, eyeliner and eye shadow should help, right?) Fair warnings: Eddie tends to throw four large numbers of words.
