Not true, but this is a very good movie and a forgotten gem. Black and white is suitable for movies. <br /> <br /> The recipe is straightforward. A man is plagued and the staff must follow everyone he contacts before they die. <br /> <br /> Very directed. Well, and a great performance. Richard Widmark as a talented actor But there is a shadow over the scene of Paul Douglas's performance as a police captain and Jack Palance (never better) and Zero Mostel is a bad guy. Sadly, Palance plays a similar character in some second-rate gangsters. Or war movies
