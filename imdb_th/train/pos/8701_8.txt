For everyone who expects to be a traditional superhero movie, it may be a surprise. It is more drama than action movies. It focuses mainly on emotions and like the Greek tragedy - no matter what the main character is doing wrong. <br /> <br /> That's because Sasha likes each superhero in his hand. And Society does not appreciate Sasha became a criminal He meets a beautiful girl and falls in love, so things become more complicated for him. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the plot itself is really amazing. It reminds me of a little subtitle in the latest movie by Ram Gopal Varma. Everything happens very slowly. However, when there are action scenes, it will be very lively before you know what has happened. But the director doesn't want to impress us with flashy and flashy actions The more important thing is the result of Sasha's actions, which are mostly very severe. The score is very rare, which makes it difficult to concentrate on this movie. Basically, you have to be very patient in order to see <br /> <br /> movies worth having? That is a very difficult question. I don't think this experience makes me very rich. In any way, I still think about this movie and feel like watching again. Most of them are caused by the atmosphere that is really dense, but not suffocating because all the time Sasha and Katya have hope after they are young people with all their lives to live. So no matter how hard it is, it will be a little happy when together
