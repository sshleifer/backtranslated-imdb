This movie is very good and I would recommend renting for everyone who has a video store in the area owned. Or even better, you can buy because of the chance that you will see this again and again I remember watching this movie since I was young and it was great. But after watching again yesterday, I found it amazing. <br /> <br /> A good mix of funny. (Although not as good as "Mr Magoo" - is one of my favorites) and action. This thing deserves 10/10 and I hope they will create a sequel shortly. If you are a babysitter or have to take care of small children to do anything, I recommend renting this movie because it will keep them entertained for hours :)
