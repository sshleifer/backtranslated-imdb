Now, my friends, movies like "La BÃªte" (aka "The Beast" or "O Monstro") can only be done on the old continent :) In this movie we see all: dirty sex horses, kind of gorilla, not gorilla, not Conversations, feelings, etc. etc. In serious terms, it is now a symbol that men can sometimes be wild animals, internal organs and cruel. Walerian Borowczyk (director) shows us the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape and Brutal, it was an amazing experience in a strange movie theater and filled with strange scenes for all the fans of shocking exploitation. I recommend this movie if you like this. I recommend: "Orloff Against the Invisible Man" and "Alterated States"
