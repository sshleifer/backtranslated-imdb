... and if you are a very good person, it will be similar to the Moon Over Parador. <br /> <br /> This film has a little stupid story, but it is a fantasy after all and casting. Can be seen clearly! Dreyfus is perfect as an actor / impostor, full of little nerves and false fantasies that you must act on. You will see how the actors are behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> This is one of Dreyfuss's best roles, as well as his character who plays the best role in imitation. Dead dictators! And separate scenes: like some things from Casablanca really! <br /> <br /> Raul Julia is great as the secret police chief of Paradorian. Other matters such as "Round the suspects as usual!" <br /> <br /> And Sonia Braga is great as a girl friend, in addition to being a very hot figure: "You should get an Oscar tonight!" <br /> <br /> Don't forget Johnny Winter as a CIA spy and many guest stars play by themselves: Sammy Davis Jr., Ike Pappas, Dick Cavett - Complete <br /> <br /> Summarizing the memorable run under the Paradorian moon <br /> <br /> -R
