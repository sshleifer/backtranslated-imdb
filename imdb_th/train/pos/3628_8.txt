This film has many basic values ​​of family and love. It shows human emotions and is an inspiring story. Clear script (It's very easy to understand, making it perfect for kids) and having fun and humor sometimes. There are symbols that charge a small fee to search. Movies accepted There is no sense of experimentation that many movie photographers are doing today. It was clearly filmed. But has good soft quality Although the editing was better, I thought it was a good movie for families to enjoy. And data storage is sent to you which is something I don't like But it is a good movie
