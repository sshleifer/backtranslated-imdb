Like everyone else who commented on this movie, I was just wondering why this story never appeared in the video. <br /> <br /> I can remember when I was about 12 years old in "The Late Show". Around 1972, I remember the attacks of toxic gases and strange looking horses as well. (I can't remember the more terrifying piece I have seen here. It should be cut for TV viewers.) But the scene I really liked was the scene related to the death of Lord Kitcher 90. Last year, the scene of the cruiser was no longer close to the minefield in the storm, as I remembered. <br /> <br /> Don't remember musical scores. But now the opinions of others make me curious. Remove this video!
