Eddie Murphy spent his time looking for missing children, so when a special magical child was kidnapped in Tibet, Charlotte Lewis sexy asks for help from him to help this child from the clutches of evil. > <br /> Although the story is quite stupid, it never feels repetitive even though it is funny throughout the story; Charles dances off a comedy show with his deadly and dark appearance of evil that captures the child hostages. <br /> <br /> The golden boy is very funny, action-packed and very interesting in almost magical charm. The <br /> <br /> 7/10 is great for all models.
