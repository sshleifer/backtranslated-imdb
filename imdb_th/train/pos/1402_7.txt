There are spoilers. <br /> <br /> "Hollow Man" may be the weakest movie that Paul Verhoeven, the great film director, such as "Total Recall", "Starship Troopers" and "Robocop" have ever created. <Br /> <br /> That may not be his fault. For some reason, Verhoeven is stuck with the most mediocre script and he does it the best. <br /> <br /> The first part of this movie is quite good, with a lot of humorous jokes, great special effects and even the Skunk Anansie. In the accompanying song, unfortunately, this film fell into the second part, if the movie deteriorates or is "terrible" about the terrible ending. The ending is ridiculous. <SPOILER> especially while Kevin Bacon came back. Life again after the events that should (in terms of logic) kill him. </ Spoiler> And all things are quite shallow: the matter of invisibleness has never been completely examined. > <br /> But overall, Verhoeven can handle above the average with this movie. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 from the star ****
