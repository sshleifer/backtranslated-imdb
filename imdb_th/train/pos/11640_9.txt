The thing that I like the most in this movie is like Hitchcock's movie. It is a thriller that is not serious about it. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock understands that people go to the movies to have a good time. Some things that Hollywood has been forgotten in recent years This is a thriller. But there was a lot of laughs and one eye blinking at the camera. <br /> <br /> Rachel McAdam is great. As always, Cillian Murphy is more awesome than he used to be in Batman Begins in Before, there are always men who play bad guys. Today we didn't see much because I wondered if the Hollywood representative thought it was a bad career, but Cillian Murphy was good at being a bad guy. <br /> <br /> The director is stylish. The story is good. But the conversation may take a bit of violence. <br /> <br /> "Red eyes" are very fun movies and people admire when the closing credits begin. If you are in the mood to be thrilled with the adventure, "Red Eye" may be your ticket.
