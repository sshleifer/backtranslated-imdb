I was surprised that we saw that there was one critic criticizing the film. Usually we don't get good opera movies and this is a truly great show. Can understand that the image is not good It's a day But as an opera it is not wrong And i am a movie opera I can't detect sync once. If we don't know that Tebaldi is in the voice, nothing will make me believe that it's not Sophia Loren. She does everything with talent! Her dark makeup is fine. And she brought the script to live a beautiful life! The rest of the actors are great, just like the amazing ballet. Most of the actors are fantastic. Loren is truly amazing. Her opponent Amneris is also excellent. Anyone who is not interested in this work in 1953 will be shamefully released. Verdi will have fun with it! By nature, Renata Tebaldi as Aida is the engine behind I love this old movie!
