As a biographical film "The Lady With Red Hair" (the story of how director / producer / playwright David Belasco changed the famous social divorce, Leslie Carter was a star International stage) Similar vintage "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (what is it), but "Lady" is a fun movie of its own - and share some of the same characteristics as Cagney classic. <br /> <br /> Like "Yankee Doodle Dandy," "The Lady With Red Hair" Filled with the taste of old-fashioned performances (above all, both films have staged a delicious theater, including scenes that are inevitable at the backdrop and in the theater manager's office). "Lady" as in the biography of Cohan And the actor who is a beloved character in that era, everyone has done great work that we can remember. <br /> <br /> I want more like "Yankee Doodle Dandy" "The Lady With Red Hair" No Allowing the truth to come to tell a good story? But just like the "Dandy" "Lady" deal - glorious! - To show the greatness of a personality that is greater than life. Everyone knows that Cagney Co., Ltd. Cohan is constantly drawing his beautiful and cute pictures in "Yankee Doodle Dandy" - but only a few movie watchers. Realizing that Claude Rains acted similarly to David Belasco in "The Lady With Red Hair" - and it was almost as beautiful as Cagney's <br /> <br /> Rains-as-Belasco Capturing the perfect personality of Galvanic in the hands of legendary actors. Rains offers great fun, strikingly noticeable and amazingly realistic performances, while all men on Broadway have been called "The Wizard" to watch Claude Rains (see every shot as if he were having a good time!) In "The Lady With Red Hair" is to see David Belasco jump on life as if he waited. Wai on the main stem again. <br /> <br />
