Blade Runner (deck is a replica!), <br /> <br /> City of lost children (Increased feelings or things that are used and abused, and most just give us less than we can dream about) and <br /> <br /> Dark city: <br /> <br /> Should Add these things really. <br /> <br /> At this moment, I am waiting for an animated movie that may affect. As far as Miyazaki's items are This person is the 1st person. <br /> <br /> Oh, scratch the "movement" part of it. <br /> <br /> I have a relationship that hates serious love with Film Noir. Do not leave, it must be love for the most part, right? But there are many sci-fi and noir themes that are submerged in this movie, which is surprising to see. <br /> <br /> These people work incredibly!
