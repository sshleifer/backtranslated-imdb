Wrestlemania 14 is not often regarded as one of the great Wrestlemania, but I will put it in my top 5, if not 3rd. It has many wonderful things and it means the birth of the attitude era. The best era of WWE. In my opinion, HBK has the heart of a lion and he put Austin just as he did while he was traveling. It was a pure class in his part. It is one of the hottest crowds you will see and it has J.R and the king in the best declaration! <br /> <br /> Match <br /> <br /> 15 ?? The battle of the royal team is loud, pop. For the return of L.O.D, I'm not a fan of the royal battle, and this is another average. Very predictable, even if you see it for the first time, it's clear that the LOD will win the Sunny for 8 minutes or more. Of course, <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> WWF Light Heavyweight Champion <br /> Taka Michinoku | C | Vs Aguila <br /> <br /> Taka gets a surprising pop with his entrance. Fast, high flying and very exciting If the two had more time, they would have to tear the roof out with the Taka thing to win with the Michinoku driver. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> European champion WWF <br /> Three H | C | Owen Hart Stipulation Vs Here Chyna handcuffed to the Nice Pop Slaughter for Owen, a mixed reaction for travel. The competition with really low valuations, which is ranked number one in my favorites for Wrestlemania. Both are very well mixed and Owen can go with anyone. Triumphs with Chyna's intervention. <br /> <br /> 4/5 <br /> <br /> Marc Mero & Sable mixed tag match Vs Goldust & Luna Pop assignments for Sable. Had heard before for women Sable seems to be hot and the crowd just eats her! The song Sable fixed and they erupts almost every time she wears a ring. Not bad for matching mixed tags. But there are funny performances that are fun and time-consuming. Sable's team wins when Sable attacks TKO. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Intercontinental Championship Ken Shamrock Vs The Rock | C | Before I checked the competition, I wanted to know that The Rock showed his great potential with his interview with Jennifer Flowers before his match. A good pop for shamrocks. Great for the rock. Too short, disappointing, and I think the end is stupid. Although Shamrock's comedy looks very good and the crowd is crazy about it, Rock still maintains the title when The Ref returns the verdict. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Dumpster competition for the WWF Tag Team Championship <br /> <br /> Catcus Jack & Terry Funk Vs The New Age Outlaws The outlaws are not over yet. As it should be at this time The crowd is actually dead. For this matter But I think it has some hard-core bits that have bad shocks. Cactus and Terry finally win the competition. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> The Undertaker vs Kane, the big applause for The Undertaker is better than outing at Wrestlemania 20 and for the big man against the big man race, this is really good. It was a great fight. The Undertaker made the patient look through the smart WWE table by making Kane look strong despite being defeated. After kicking 2 tombs, Taker eventually brought him to 3rd place. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Championship <br /> <br /> Special guest order "Mike Tyson" <br /> <br /> HBK | C | Vs Steve Austin is hot for Tyson. The crowd going to ape sh * t for Austin is definitely one of the greatest pops I've ever heard. Mixed reactions for HBK. This is a truly special match, which is one of the main events of the greatest wrestlers in history. You can tell that when JR suffocated, HBK gave him everything that should be arranged. His last and Austin wasn't that good. Hate and electricity from the audience is amazing and it is as exciting as it gets. Austin won by stunned by Tyson, joining 3:16 by knocking Michael. Austin's celebration of victory is a miracle seen by one of the most annoying crowds you have ever seen. King speaks correctly. They are crazy. <br /> <br /> 5/5 <br /> <br The bottom line Wrestlemania 14 is one of the greatest games. It has everything you need in Wrestlemania and the beginning of the Attitude era. This is really something special for me because it's the 1st wrestling I've seen back in 98. "The Austin Era has begun! "<br /> <br /> 9 1/2 / 10
