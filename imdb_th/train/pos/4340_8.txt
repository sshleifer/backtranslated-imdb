I enjoy this movie, probably because I have never seen any reviews, etc. It's a delightful thing, and quite a 'play'. I don't know why it doesn't cause more splash than it does. As far as the story goes, I can relate to some aspects of the character Paul Reiser and I can "see my father" in the character of Falk, making me remember many times when I was a child and listening to my grandparents such as together If you like movies like Grumpy Old Men or On Golden Pond, this is your movie. In my opinion, "sleeper" and one of the stories that feel good, Peter Falk and Paul Reiser have many wonderful verbal tussles. But nothing too much I will say that the rate of at least 8 may be higher.
