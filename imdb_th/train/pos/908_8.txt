I can't believe that this movie received a score of 6.9. However, this movie may be one of the most impressive Indian movies I've ever seen. It's really refreshing when watching movies that show traditional family movies. For the story that I thought was great, it was about Chahad Kapur being held in a marriage arranged with amrita rao. He was lucky to be happy while Amrita Rao was an Indian girl. Ancient that helped her uncle But the only problem is that her cousin doesn't seem to get as much attention as she does. Amita with passion This makes Amrita make her angry because she just wants her aunt to love her. It is also very impressive to see that although the family of Amrita may not be the rich that may be just the middle class to the lower classes while the Shahids family is quite high, they still treat their families with respect and do not ask Straying with me Because I have seen people who are rude to people who do not think below their standards, which I feel very shallow This film shows that the shahids are willing to see the great value that Amrita received while ignoring the fact that she is not the daughter of a wealthy businessman or anything. All in this movie deserves 8/10. I want to add more movies of this type.
