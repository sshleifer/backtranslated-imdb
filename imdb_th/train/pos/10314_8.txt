This one and "Her Pilgrim Soul" are my favorite two episodes in the new version of Twilight Zone. As I mentioned in my opinion in the new series, there are some things that are lacking in this new series. Sometimes they may focus on lessons that need to be learned too much. It looks tastier and more cheerful than the version of Serling. However, it is now considered too sensitive. I think the appeal is that no matter what they do, couples cannot gather. I remember I was not surprised at the Korean movie "Il Mare" (later changed to "The Lake House". I think it was because I saw it now.
