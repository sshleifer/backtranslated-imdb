Not a bad movie Somehow I was made as a root for Iranian people to win games played in movies, even though I don't know anything about football and are not fans. The ending on the bus is exhilarating. <br /> <br /> This film deals with the problems of women in Iran and how they are not allowed to enter the stadium among men because of their vows. Suitable for women to hear. Despite this law But some women try to sneak into But many of them were arrested and detained It is really surprising that any society still has an ancient sexual concept. In the interview, Panahi said that his film is a document of history and injustice, and one day in the future we can watch these movies and see how Iran has lived. One hopes that the future will come sooner than later.
