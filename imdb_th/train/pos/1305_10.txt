This film made me careful when it started in an Arizona-based coffee shop and Richard Grieco (Rex), "Dead Easy", '04, decided to eat anything and was hot and very hot Sexy waitress While Rex stepped out of the cafe, he saw a state soldier and asked him And then all the hell broke apart in more ways than one Maggie ends up in a hot tub and Rex calls her to tell her that he wants to show the western style with the top police in town. This is a different movie. However, Nancy Allen and Richard Greene are just two actors who helped this picture at the same time!
