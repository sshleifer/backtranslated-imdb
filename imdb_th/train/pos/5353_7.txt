In 2017 (although some people may easily misunderstand it for the year 1987 by judging from the hairstyle and clothes) Running Man sees every good man. Ben Richards (Schwarzeneggar) is a framework for crimes he has not done. After a brave prison break, he was arrested and participated in a brutal TV competition, The Running Man, along with some friends who had escaped and a beautiful woman named Token Amber (Maria Conchita Alonso), <br <br /> <br /> Used by authoritarian governments as a way to control crowds, showing holes with colorful opponents. (And quite often at the camp) Each pair has its own unique killing style: electric power dynamo from the special Buzzsaw series. Use saws, Sub Zero, have ice hockey sticks, knife edges and Fireball. Like to blow fire to finish. competition But these killers cannot be compared to Ben Richards, who each horrifically separates themselves. (Followed by compelling acumen) <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, Ben joins the group of freedom fighters in The fight with the authorities and the exact revenge from the hostile host Killian. <br /> <br /> Twenty years ago Arnold Schwarzeneggar Being the ruler of the universe, action movies and for his fans. Wrong. Austrian cupcakes have a formula that guarantees almost every box office success: violence in comic books and stories. Do not use logic plus beautiful close friends, plus one of the witty. Running Man adheres to this blockbuster formula for viewers of T and Arnie (mostly male Model) Beat it (myself) <br /> <br /> Now, two decades later and just finished watching the movie again For the first time in years, I found it a strange movie: one of them has no technical advantages, good performances and convincing effects, directed by Paul Michael Glaser (better known as Det. Dave Starsky from the 1970s police show, Starsky and Hutch) and adapted from a short story by Stephen King (Written under the name of the feather deity, Richard Bachman) The Running Man is a wonderful, 80s TAT ​​that looks incredibly cheap and outdated. But despite (Or maybe because) the horror of this movie has a special charm that is hard to explain. <br /> <br /> Without trying to create realism - setting in the future, the film to laugh. Unintentionally by many See the scene in which Ben discovered Amber's secret cache on the taboo (!); Surprised by the 'future' graphics of crap that is used with billboards and running board games. (As a graphic designer, I find these things especially amusing); Be amazed by the lack of reliable technological progress. <br /> <br /> Running Man may be full of garbage, generally.
