I saw "Breaking Glass" for the first time when it was launched in England in 1980. I liked it a lot and just caught it in August 2005 at the Canadian station. The only thing I regret is that I can't find the soundtrack or DVD in the store ... Anyone interested in shining or I have to order it from an internet company that is too expensive. But when looking back at the film that the music stood for to test time That is "Thatcher" and what she did to the country at that time Please, if you get a chance to watch this movie, you will not regret!
