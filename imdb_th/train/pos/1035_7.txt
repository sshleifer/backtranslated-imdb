This film was nominated for the best picture. But lost to Casablanca But Paul Lucas beat Humphrey Bogart for the best actor. I don't see why Lucille Watson was nominated for the best actor. I just didn't think she was doing well. Betty Davis and Paul Lucas and their three children are leaving Mexico and traveling to the United States in the first scene of the movie. They are traveling by train to Davis's relative house. Davis and Lucas are in the underground to stop the Nazis so they are tired and want to rest. But when they returned home, the Nazis lived there and they couldn't do anything. It turns out that the Nazis were interested. But about money and willing to negotiate with Lucas They are more than a plot. But you can search for yourself
