I'm really surprised with this movie. Going to see an example that doesn't know anything about the movie, except for the one example I have ever seen. I think it will be Dude Where's My Car. Laying in the end because that's just how the movie works. But I have an original and astounding original movie about an ordinary good man who has never had sex. <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie is full of jokes and rude stories that are full of stories. Sex-Nipple !, but can do in the spirit of Bad Santa over the Sorority Boys. Every character is someone you might know in real life. A friend who can redeem it, trying to get help from his brother and use Their lives <br /> <br /> I think this movie is nonsense and I was very surprised. Yes, it's beautiful. (C'mon It's a movie about a 40-year-old girl!) But it's done very smart. <br /> <br /> In the end, you really pulled this guy. That would have been put, which spoke a lot about the movie, because honestly, are you really interested if Ashton Kutcher finds his car?
