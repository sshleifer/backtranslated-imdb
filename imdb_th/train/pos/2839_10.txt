I saw this film in advance screening and found it great. <br /> <br /> New York I love you. It's a real spin on love stories that explore clever, funny and shocking situations. Sometimes in the most powerful emotion. <br /> <br /> The big actors are actually in the ocean. 11 with Andy Garcia, Ethan Hawke, Shia Labouf, Natalie Portman, Bradley Cooper and others. Show that one way or another. <br /> <br /> No Must mention that there are those who oversee matters in a clever and interesting way. Brett Rattner, Shaka Kapur, Natalie Portman I mean-WOW! This movie is not romantic, straightforward or romantic comedy, although it is both romantic and funny. There are also serious stories and notes. But that's a good thing in my opinion Go see for yourself and reply to my review. I want to listen to what others say.
