I'm glad that this DVD is available now. This film is a wonderful example of the success of the content and style above the blinking lights, empty and constant noise. <br /> <br /> Essentially, if you have a short concentration or lack of wisdom and imagination in participate in Literary lectures, you will not like this movie. The reason for this is quite simple. Unfortunately, rarely succeeded: Matthew Jacobs did an excellent job in conveying the story of 'Marianne Dreams', a novel by Catherine Storr. A job that nobody wants, like anyone who has ever seen a movie in a book, must know. <br /> <br /> The best performer makes director Bernard Rose use the actors in The style that is rarely seen at this time They immerse themselves in the craft show! I know that I know that actors work and act instead of using the mockery at the camera lens, which has a kaleidoscope of car chases, explosions and fires from the fire around them. It's a rare treatment. Ring But it actually happened in this movie. <br /> <br /> This makes me the last reason that this is a movie for fantasy thinkers, not a tabloid reader with a spoon - in addition to the screenplay. And a stable performance Suspense and implied horror If it is classified as a horror, the presentation of 'Paper House' will be in the veins of Sophocles rather than Tobe Hooper. <br /> <br /> In summary, if you like loud sounds, explosions, constant sounds Cutting and bright flashing colors, you should look better. 'Transformers', but if you like a suspicious story that shows through the use of storytelling skills without insulting without insulting your intelligence, things.
