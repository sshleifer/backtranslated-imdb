"Fox" is a serious picture of rapid growth in the 1980s and is different from the obscure teen comedies (Porky's, Fast Times at Ridgement High). The film can resist time. <br /> <br /> Teen Angels themes are related to each other today, like 25 years ago and Jodie Foster and sk8er boi Scott Baio (can you remember him?) Starring a remarkable young actor <br /> <br /> This film follows women. The people in Southern California as they move through the sexual and drug-free teens, parents spent the day and night school, both inside and outside the party, a concert, or go outside. They barely lived at home because of the instant gratification of drugs, parties or boys. <br /> <br /> But instead of condemning them, this movie is sympathetic, unpunished, punishable, lacking, adults forced. Teens grow up alone. And the charming performer is impossible to dislike. <br /> <br /> Film debut? Long and cute pan - set the sound for what follows We saw a young woman sleeping at dawn amidst the material that defined her as a teenager, from the twinkies to the image of John Travola, who was a small child, while Donna Summer of "On the Radio" scored lower than <br /> <br /> From there movies Get speed while young women head to school and for life. Annie (Cherie Currie rocker rocker) is a wild child who lives in a party or next tablet. (Marlilyn Stroh) is a shy girl who is in her head. And Foster is one with the plan It was her duty to keep this crew together long enough to finish high school while still holding her divorced and hopeless mother, respectively. (Sally Kellerman) <br /> <br / > It is an almost impossible task. <br /> <br /> Despite being very old, "Fox" is still happy to see me, clothes and references to Dorothy Olympic skaters. Hamill didn't hurt the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is just amazing. Just taking pictures that are filtered by LL in the morning, evening and at night. Giorgio Moroder added a 80s soundtrack like Donna Summer and Janis Ian. <br /> <br /> Maybe the greatest disappointment. The movie is a new star around Foster, never broken like the drama "St. Elmo's Fire" (1985) or "Empire Records" (1995) "Fox" shows why they should have But maybe like a bowling song for "1985" soup, they just hit the wall
