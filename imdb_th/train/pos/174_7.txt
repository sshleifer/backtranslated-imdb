Sunny, a cocktail waitress in the DC area is a bit dim. She drove an old man and rented a small room from a gay couple. However, she saved the famous Arabian life by shooting the rear shell which was intended for officers. She has a national media fascination with her funny words and her sweet face. When given the opportunity, the presidential assistant took her to install in the protocol department for the US government. Even though she does things from time to time But she tried hard and learned a lot She also attracted romantic interest from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials as well. But there are other sinister plans to do with Arab men who want a wife again? Blonde or not. Hahahaha. This movie looks like Goldie like a picture and is dumb. "Like a fox" as they say Sunny learns her path around the forest of the US government very well. She also has important things to say about honesty and lack of this in her protocol. Perhaps the Arab community may be less excited than this event. But for those who like to laugh for rent today
