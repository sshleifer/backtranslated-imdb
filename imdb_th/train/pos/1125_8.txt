Michael Cacoyannis has a long career. But there are a few credits that are surprising for his name, including the actual use of clothes, such as the cold warfare that is not worth watching. The Day of the Fish Came Out However, Iphigia is featured adapted by Cacoyannis from the play of Euripides. An excellent show of classic tragedy and recently appeared on television for the first time in many years in the United States. Flix Channel is courtesy. This film was filmed at an epic level. But not the movie 'big', with a simple focus: in the plea to God, King Agamemnon (Kostas Kazakos) was forced to sacrifice his daughter. The Papas are both outstanding, but it is an amazing Papamoschou that brings the most interesting elements to the screen, which is a combination of childhood innocence and awareness that she is a character. In the political game Highly recommended for fans of international theaters.
