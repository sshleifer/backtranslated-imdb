<br /> <br /> If you're interested in pirates, movies, pirates, New Orleans / early 19th-century American history, or Yul Brynner, watch this movie yourself and decide this by yourself. Don't be postponed by many boring reviews. My reaction to it is that it provides entertainment, acts well (mostly), has a sharp conversation, and it works great to convey the charm, charm and legendary passion of Jean Lafitte personally, even though all the events in the movie Will not be correct according to history (Can you show me a successful historical film?) But I feel that this film is accurate in keeping Lafitte's role in the history of New Orleans. Hate the relationship between "respectable" citizens of New Orleans and the outlaws, who are the city's favorite sons. Do not worry that this movie will not do anything. But watch it for what it does, for example in one of New Orleans studies and America's most interesting historical figures
