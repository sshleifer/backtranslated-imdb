Many years ago I saw this. But I felt compelled to protect this gem with the owner. <br /> <br /> It's interesting and strange to notice the variety of comments here. That's what I think of humor. it is personal It charges you through your funny bone at 60,000 volts or makes you cold and wondering why you are giving it. <br /> <br /> This show has some of the best British comic actors. Together in silly stories and Disrespect and the result is hilarious Conversations and funny pictures are beautifully delivered and both leaderboards (Cleese and Lowe) are great together. This thing was created for them. <br /> <br /> I can't say anymore unless I ask you to search and see it. You will not be disappointed and in a world without a sense of humor, this is a classic that is crazy and innocuous of comedy.
