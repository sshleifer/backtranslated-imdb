This is a romantic comedy movie that focuses on jokes for change. As usual, couples - Sally Field as the TV drama queen Celeste Talbert; And Kevin Kline as a talented actor and Jeffrey Anderson is working across the aim, seemingly not knowing that they are madly passionate, etc., due to Margo Channing of Bette Davis in All About Eve (1950) and all very much with the slapstick drama tradition. Sally Field goes top to hilarity as she malaprops her way to love and be happy. Kevin Kline, one of the leading male actors Score lower than the threshold in The past few years are very good people and have won a lot because he is a handsome person, weak, selfish and cute at the same time. <br /> <br /> Around the fear of Celeste, who lost the audience as she entered her forties, and reached a critical point with the arrival of an aspiring niece Cori Craven (Elisabeth Shue), who became a niece Her Cori manages to get a part. In a TV drama, a deaf, deaf, homeless, before discovering her true relationship with Celeste (and Jeffrey Anderson) - but that's ok. <br /> <br / > The foil that led to Robert Downey Jr. (opera director, David Barnes) and Cathy Moriarty (Montana and Nan nurses) David Barnes was very hot for her. But she cares only about one thing: get rid of Celeste so that she can shine in the bright light For this reason, she made Barnes do everything to destroy Celeste's career. But with the events and / or the logic that is perverse, all his efforts are distorted for the enjoyment of the audience. <br /> <br /> Whoopie Goldberg plays Rose Schwartz, the screenwriter and Celeste, ego and partner, while Carrie Fisher has a rather polite part as a producer of difficult stories. <br /> <br /> I think this is more fun. There was just a dummy in the world of the TV series that I saw (Young Doctors in Love 1982, a general and very good hospital hospital). Soapdish was more fun with crazy scripts and solo performances, torpedoes and performances. Excellent by Field, Kline and Downy, Jr. but see this for Sally Field that is outstanding.
