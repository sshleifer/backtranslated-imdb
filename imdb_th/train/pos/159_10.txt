This is just another great movie of the Berlin Festival. But unlike "Yes" by Sally Potter, which I had seen many days before after leaving the cinema, I felt a strong desire to embrace the whole world and be happy to live this time. Conversely: There are some things that drag me down and the air feels cold and hard to breathe. As if suddenly nothing was left, all hope in the future was taken to the dead place. <br /> <br /> Nina's life seemed to be dismayed and imprisoned. The lovely day appeared to have a glow that opened up the horizon and convinced her to fulfill her dream. No one is beside you But suddenly she met a friend. There was nothing. Someone who could share the hidden feelings in her life. That person is Tony, a homeless girl who seems to have no roots like her. <br /> <br /> But the title of the film is "Ghost" and the ghost appears and disappears as they want. How to treat them ?? Ghosts also represent the hidden imagination of people, strange thoughts that occupy your thoughts and are only self-aware, hiding from all others. Françoise, a French woman, is a victim of these ghosts. Once she had lost her daughter in Berlin, which seemed to have been robbed of her in a supermarket during a time of lack of intention. Over time, Françoise returned to Berlin, still looking for missing children. <br /> <br /> Nina may be the child after she receives the same scar on her ankle and heart-shaped mole. During the shoulder blade that seemed to prove her true identity <br /> <br /> Nina used that idea after she not only But only want a desperate friend. She still needs a mother But in the end, she is a bare-handed person. Toni has disappeared with a man and her mother should become a sick woman. "Marie is dead," Francois's husband concluded and the statement could not be confused. Nina is just "Nina". An unnamed young woman has no hope for achieving a sacred goal. No Marie in this world will come with our lonely life. So in the end we see Nina alone, everyone is walking down a wide open road in front of her into a future that looks unhappy and unpredictable.
