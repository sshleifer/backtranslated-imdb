For Urban Cowboy, John Travolta plays one of the strongest alpha boys who have performed on the big screen. He was a good boy who left his parents' house and attacked Dallas's big city, where Barry Corbin, his uncle, promised to find work in the petrochemical industry in the 1980s that began to flourish and Texas. Is a growing place in the United States. <br /> <br /> Travolta works very well to make our audience pay attention to his character, which, when you arrive, is a pig girl. Married to Debra Winger who has The same background But she had some ideas that women should not be shadows of men. And when she beat him at Gilley's mechanical bull, that guy's game was for him. <br /> <br /> Scott Glenn, a former prisoner, worked at Gillley and this film is a script. His breakout He is a real snake in Urban Cowboy. He received Travolta's goat with a look alone and he moved into the wing. Travolta returned to the wealthy Madolyn Smith Osborne, who was attacking Gilley's. <br /> <br /> Despite the character, Urban Cowboy is a huge ad for the most famous big singer in Gilley's world is no longer there in the Texas Pasadena community in the suburbs. But various memories And the best thing about Urban Cowboy is the excellent score of the national / western music that is shown in the movie. I'm not sure that some songs are not specifically written for Urban Cowboy, but it's the only reason I can think of why the Motion Picture Academy ignores the musical aspects of this film. I like John Neely looking for love. If it's written specifically for this movie, it's a shame that it's not being nominated for the best song. <br /> <br /> I like myself. Debra Winger's best drama in this movie She does not lose femininity. But she stood up to Travolta and did it in style And this criticism is devoted to women who still do not know who will be the first female bullfighter in Professional Bull Riders
