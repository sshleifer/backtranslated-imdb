This little movie has been on my "Keeper" list for a long time. Do people realize that women are stressed, menopausal, emotional abuse? (As well as mental retardation) is actually treated by doctors at the turn of the century? The serious attitude of all serious Christians at that time is deadly in exploring TRUE's emotional feelings that will help us embrace the spirit of suffering. You can imagine (According to today's standards) that Walt Whitman's book was banned because he acknowledged that women have great feelings and emotional responses like humans. The sensitivity of this film still makes me and I give credit to the director to capture this through his eyes.
