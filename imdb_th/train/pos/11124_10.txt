THE SOPRANOS (1999-2007) <br /> <br /> No. 1 - Forever Television <br /> <br /> Everyone thinks this is a stupid thing that won't go through the pilot scene. The soprano has become a cultural phenomenon and is widely regarded as one of the greatest television shows of all time. <br /> <br /> James Gandolfini plays the mysterious soprano Tony, the leader of the bandit. New Jersey, along with the protagonist actor Edifco is a great person because he is a loving and loving mother. Tony Sirico is a gray superstitious person who is always funny. <br /> <br /> While The show was criticized because of the negative attitude of Italian-Americans as a mafia, and in areas that cannot be denied, I can see many positive results from the show. Descriptions of family values, friendship, friendship, love and compassion Will this appear on a rough TV show about gangsters? Yes. In addition, other burning issues are discussed, such as terrorism, social inequality and injustice, homosexuality, drugs, etc. This is not a superficial story that shows strength and strength. severe There are many things. Many problems that we see on the list are very real. <br /> <br /> Great writing makes the current problem successful and embeds it in the life of the character, which makes everything more interesting. < br /> <br /> Credit must go to David Chase, who has created great television treasures and James Gandolfini to imagine the most complex and mysterious characters of television. <br /> <br /> Just wonderful. br /> <br /> 10/10
