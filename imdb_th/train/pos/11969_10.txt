I like this show more and I still watch the first season DVD at the age of 19. What can I say today? I grew up in a house like a full house. I have a father, two sisters and a dog. I guess the only difference is that I am not with my father and best friend. In addition, I grew up with my mother in the house. I don't know what I would do if I didn't have Full House on television. I think Stephanie (played by Jodie Sweetin), DJ (played by Kerry's sister Kirk Cameron) and Michelle (played by Mary-Kate And Ashley Olsen) are the characters I like I can relate to each of them because I am the middle child of my family, such as Steph. I am a sister like Michelle and I am a sister like a DJ. I like the way the list is always morally valuable because I don't like OC shows like any nowadays, I like Full House comedy with Uncle Jesse (John Stamos), Joey (Dave Coulier) and Danny (Bob Saget) are hilarious people like the uncles of girls, friends, father and father respectively The story happened after the girl's mother died. Danny's best friend Joey and his brother-in-law Jesse moved to help raise children. Three men tried to raise three girls = hilarious each character. In Full House, full of heart, funny and truly believable, Joey is a comedian with a heart and soul of a child. Jesse is a cool motorcycle rider who is a strong, sweet person who is sweet by his three grandchildren and later his wife Becky. (Laurie Laughlin from Summerville) Both children and adults will love this show.
