Possible spoilers: Unsure <br /> <br /> While watching The Lion King 1 1/2 I can't help but feel the whole film. It's a good way to spend about an hour and 15 minutes, but there's nothing about it that gives the same feeling that The Lion King makes stories for those who haven't read other reviews. It's about how. The fact that Timon and Pumbaa meet and how they affect the events of the original Lion King. <br /> <br /> Actually, there are some jokes in the movie. My favorite part is when they show it. Opinion from the pair raised a lion. However, for me, the worst piece must be when they show Timon and Pamba intervening directly with the original event. I can't see the same "Circle of Life" or "Can You Feel the Love Love Tonight" sequence again. (I'm ok with the sequence "I just can't wait to be a king." <br /> <br /> The voice-overs are excellent. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella did a great job, like Matthew Broderick, who made Raphiki and hyenas. Even the young actor Simba still sounds like Jonathon Taylor Thomas for me, but why do they include the voice actors for Zazu? Indeed, he has only 2 lines and is not very necessary. Even if you haven't heard of Timon Mom and don't miss Marge Simpson, <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that don't seem to match. The original version, which is thought of when they are proud of the stone at the end. How do they have time to fight with hyenas at first? <br /> <br /> For the DVD, you can't help. But felt that in 2 disc sets, special features were missing especially They can easily enter comments or other aspect ratios on disc 1. I enjoy the game. "Who wants to be the king of the forest" Although it is the most embarrassing example of cross promotions I've seen Some questions are really difficult. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good movie. But not as good as TLK or even TLK2
