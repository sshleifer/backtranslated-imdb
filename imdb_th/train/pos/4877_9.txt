Actually, one person / character can't "There", but my summary line refers to the power of the movie. And this is all accomplished without fancy cameras and / or large production sets But has a wonderful and very reliable story (And believe it) and a good actor who broadcasts the story (arc) <br /> <br /> Piece together with Japanese movies / great cinemas (such as Tokyo Story, etc.) is not wise. But there are more intelligent emotions! Great performance, the difference in acting that is truly a gem. If you are keen to experience impressive stories and want to watch movies that are more emotional to you than to be As you noticed (As with many of my reviews) I didn't get the story. There are many places in IMDb where you can look for these things. I'm not the one who makes the story corrupt!
