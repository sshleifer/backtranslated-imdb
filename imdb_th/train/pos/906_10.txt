VIVAH is in my book, Best Film of the Year 2006! period of time !! In my book, it is one of the 100 best movies ever in Bollywood. It's sad that this movie doesn't have many reviews and is not very popular. <br /> <br /> VIVAH is another true success from the director who can do it again after HAHK and Maine Pyar Kiya Sooraj. Pull out the bright VIVAH again. <br /> <br /> This is the simplest and most lovable movie I've ever seen this year. After seeing Don 2, which is a CRAP and later Dhoom 2, which even hit Don in that story, I finally saw a movie that was close to my heart and culture. <br /> <br /> I don't know why Bollywood. Moving away from the beautiful culture that we have and creating Hollywood shit-style remake movies like Dhoom 2 and don <br /> <br /> The story is beautiful and related to the Indian wedding system which I want to A part of Our system that teaches us to obey the old elders, follow them, and of course they obey their thoughts, showing great in this movie! Of course, there is no power to choose your partner and it should be a short meeting between couples and it is up to them to decide because it can be played out perfectly in this film. <br /> <br /> Come back. Come to the movie ..... VIVAH is a story of traveling between the beautiful moments of engagement and marriage. The time when the young man met a girl! .... Both understand each other .. Both of them try to evaluate that they will love each other for seven generations. (As our system speaks) and things that happen during marriage <br /> <br /> Amrita Rao is great in movies ....... Shahid is ok ..... and Alok Nath And Anupam Kher is great !! Bright music! Especially I like HAMARI SHAADI main HAFTE REH GYA CHAAR and Do Anjaane Ajnabi ...... <br /> <br /> Overall, must see for everyone who still believes in Indian culture and traditions and Of course I will do! <br /> <br /> Go see this movie ...... I have to say only one word ....... <br /> <br /> BLISS!
