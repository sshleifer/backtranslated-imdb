I think this movie is well done and very realistic. I am accustomed to watching Hollywood's "action" movies and using this as a benchmark for scoring this movie, you will be disappointed. This movie is close to real life, more than 95% of what Hollywood can produce and that is what is raised above the general action movie. I have never had any experience with the Swedish army, so I cannot point out any mistakes in the way they do. But when I saw a special "done", I was sure that there were many things to avoid any mistakes. Realistic stories and high quality movies
