This film is excellent in every area. It touches the complexity of love relationships in a meaningful way. But never described The script never shows any respect for the character, even the unfortunate Johnny. In addition, it also benefits from the directional direction, design, production, casting and display. The fact that the chat is perfect in the movie and is different from "chat" than she used to be a miracle for me. I watched Moonstruck at least once a year and I watched it again on this Christmas with twins. Their year and they love it too It has something for everyone with heart and will make you full of happiness in the end.
