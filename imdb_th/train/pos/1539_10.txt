I saw this at the Mill Valley Film Festival. It was hard to believe that this was the opening of Miss Bum's director. It was a beautiful rhythm and action. A large character may come from Anne Tyler's novel, that is, they have a story behind and the future that may occur, there is no false record, surprising humor bursting amidst the conflicting and uneasy anxiety Very true. If you see "The Best of Youth", you will recognize how well the characters attract attention in a short period of time, even when the story moves quickly.I hope this will be published in the United States. I live in a fairly complex movie market. But we rarely get all kinds of Swedish movies
