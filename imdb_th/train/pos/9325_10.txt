I found that this movie is ready for streaming on Netflix and I think I'll try it out. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Feore and David Cubitt) who met. Together after Their father died At first, Ryan and Theo argue about who did what. But later, Theo discovers that his brother, Ryan, is not only gay, but he is dying from illness. So Ryan and Theo take time to fix the difference. <br /> <br /> This is an amazing movie. I have only seen Colm Feore in Season 7 of 24, but he is a phenomenon in this story. David Cubitt, an actor I have never heard of before, has worked wonderfully. <br /> <br /> I want to Recommend this to those interested in gay and lesbian genres This is a movie that you shouldn't miss. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 10 stars out of 10 great movies!
