Back in 1955, England created a comedy film called Simon and Laura by Peter Finch and Kay Kendall, which is excellent to this day. It is one of the best examples of British comedy and especially about television sitcoms. Popular It is and is a wonderful example of cinemas referring to themselves. <br /> <br /> So, Soapdish, a movie that I have never heard before until a few nights ago. At first I was quite skeptical because the jokes were difficult to do as well as you know. <br /> <br /> However, I was surprised and pleased to see a very smart satire about American TV during the day. In fact, it was time for me to laugh fully. So if you like satire, I'd recommend you to see <br /> <br /> main actors ?? Sally Field, Kevin Kline, Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty, rather doing great work, revealing that the business of The show is absurd and shallow. When I watched it, I thought to myself, how bad is this in real life? Is that if the actor has a real life? As you may know, such as Peter Zeller's seller is famous for hiding his true identity behind the characters so much that no one really knows his true identity. So while I watched Sally Field playing Celeste Talbot playing Maggie, I thought again about previous British movies with Kay Kendall playing Laura as a character on the sitcom TV with Peter Finch ... <br /> <br /> Wonder if some actors are nervous? And that feeling finally crystallized when Celeste confronted her daughter (Laurie is played by Elizabeth Chu) and during the time of the repeated emotions that she had used in the previous episode of the soap of her daytime shows that! are you confused? But the conversation is amazing for originality, humor, badness, anger, depravity, repetition and even ... love <br /> <br /> Story? There are many stories in this movie, all the combinations and all come together at the end (of course, but not like Robert Altman's movie, okay!) And not being resolved at all. Life isn't like that, right? That rhythm is almost crazy and you have to watch and listen carefully in order to see jokes and jokes. Take 97 minutes from your life and watch it. You won't regret spending time. <br /> <br /> All the remaining actors work well, even though I'm not filming with the Whoopi Goldberg. Perhaps the most fun exchange is between Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty. And for my money, people after stealing scenes from many others, she received my vote as an outstanding player I don't like you. She even gave a new face.
