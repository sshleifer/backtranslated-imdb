If I can go back even as an adult and go back in the summer time at my camp ... I'll be there quickly. The camp that I can't go to is so big. They are in Texas, where the mosquitoes actually take people, but we have horses and fishing. This film surprises the funny and convincing characters, especially Perkins, Pollack and Arkin. Sam Raimi's characters and sub-comedy performances are valuable. So whoever thought that this movie was a lame person ... I had a lot of pity because they could not suppress their unbelief long enough to imagine life in the camp again as adults or He never was a child. All issues are that these people have the opportunity to regain and return to become children and youth again, so they do it at every opportunity. I want to do it. It's funny, intelligent, beautiful scripts, great actors and art brought me back, so I want to watch it over and over again for the scenes, even Sorta, like Dances with Wolves and LadyHawk ... good movies. But the wilderness became as much a character as the actors Rent, see, buy and see it over and over again ... never old; 0)
