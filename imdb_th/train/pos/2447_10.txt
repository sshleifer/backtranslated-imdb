George Lopez never paid attention to his comedy and he still couldn't. But this performance is a work of art It never shows that jokes make you laugh every time you remember. (And the memorable comedy that time) This performance looks like that and the characters range from old, drunk characters to dyslexic teens. If they continue to perform, I'm sure it will receive feedback from critics of this great country. If you are looking for traditional comedy movies, George Lopez is the show for you! One bad thing is the name George Lopez? Really? Imagine the Prince of Bel-Air as "Will Smith". C'mon! But otherwise this show is a genius! 10/10
