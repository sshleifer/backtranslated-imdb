I picked it up in the box set of 'Danger After Dark' and watched it just because of the interest in the performances of Hyde and Gackt. I expect to have a monotonous horror movie that is a great festival and a bad conversation. A student Which is what it should be if it happened in America But I found myself interested in character development and how Gackt developed through movies as individuals. The performance of the two stars is surprisingly good because they are not professional actors and directors do a great job in the future, minus the flying cars. In the note of Taro's performance, Yamamoto was very surprised. Another film I have seen in this movie is Battle Royale, where he plays Shogo Kawada and in this film he seems to be the opposite of Shoko Toshi. Bright, cheerful and hyper serves as a comedy with his comedy. Shoko is a big, strong man on the island which kills without thinking anything. So watch out for his performances. If you are familiar with the Battle Royale, you will be very surprised. <br /> <br /> But don't be summed up at the back of the box. Because this is not a real vampire movie It's just a movie that has vampires in it. The characters of Hyde are vampires, almost a real background to what actually happened in the foreground and you will love the final scene. It is a real animation. At some point, shooting is very good. It is something that will be given the next time you are at Blockbuster.
