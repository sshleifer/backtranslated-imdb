I am a parent of a child with special needs and I enjoy the movie a lot! It is love, warmth and fun. I learned a long time ago to see humor in things. I thought it was particularly cute that all other characters were worried about Frankie and who would take care of him after Grandma died I participated in the screening of this film with other parents and siblings with special needs before being resolved. Everyone is happy with this movie and it inspires a great conversation. We talked about how our children make us laugh, and we also talk about how we are concerned about them. The scriptwriter talked about how she worked with autistic children and children with other special needs as volunteers for many years. She uses the character as a real person. Our family is blessed with humor that makes us through a very stressful time. I lift my finger for two things !!!
