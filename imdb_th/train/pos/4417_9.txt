This film is a lyrical and romantic memoir told through the eyes of an eleven-year-old boy living in a rural Cuban city in the year of the Castro Revolution. Is a work worthy of true love. <br /> <br /> CUBA LIBRE and CUBAN BLOOD's name is just an attempt to market the movie action wrongly. Julia's dream makes more sense. It has in common with European theaters rather than with RAMBO and the revolution is just the inconvenience of everyday life and the pursuit of people. The only truth that makes this film more faithful than most of the work related to this period in Cuban history. <br /> <br /> Using the narrator with too much sound destroys the story. A clip from a Hollywood movie that speaks more than a narrator's picture. <br /> <br /> Comparison with CINEMA PARADISO and a fair game, because this film has grief about the movie. The way of life beyond the lost love <br /> <br /> The revolution like the movie Julie seems to never end.
