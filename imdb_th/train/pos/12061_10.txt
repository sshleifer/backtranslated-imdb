Every time in the world of great horror, diamonds are created and diamonds become extremely shocking by their true abilities. This is no less than a diamond !! This is a movie full of excitement, cold expectations and a dark atmosphere, and I think it's safe to say one of my favorite horror movies of all time! And of course it would be one of the scariest scenes in horrible history! Every time I watch this movie and it's up to the point where you know what will happen inevitably, I try to remember exactly when I was afraid of the idea. But never failed I never made it right and I found myself threatened for the first time I saw it !! Now I have to say that it will scare fans of horror horror like that. Nothing lacks pure perfection. Unlike Americans, the Brits know their finer details. They are proud of the performing arts. They don't want any special effects to convey the atmosphere. They rely on the power of powerful stories and horror (in this case). Of suggestions and expectations Every element is flawless, from a set piece to a story show to a frightening atmosphere. Pauline Moran can make the devil whimper for sure !! As a reminder, at the end, if you have some reason that you don't like this madness, you don't really know what horror is and shouldn't know what it is. Thank you!
