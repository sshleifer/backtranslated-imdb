One of the best movies ever made! Why is it scored? 7.6 is a puzzle. This movie is a window to the world of black experience in America. Should be viewed correctly for all white people and children who are over 10 years old. I recommend watching "The Long Walk Home" as a contribution if you think of Whoopi Goldberg's work about "Homer and Eddie" Or "Hollywood Squares" to think again Don't miss this movie, which should win an Oscar. (And also read books!)
