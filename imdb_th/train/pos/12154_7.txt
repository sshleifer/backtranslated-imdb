Yes, horror thriller, dance story ... with Shelley and Debbie! Good things, good things This is fun, reckless and full of camps and is part of the 60s cycle that leaked into the 70s. It was launched with Bert Reynolds, FUZZ joke. This horror movie. It is very ridiculous as well as the combination of the day of the lot, others and Jenny's children. I suggest that prospective audiences follow the idea that this thing is almost distorted and sitting with anyone. Someone you can cut and elbow Actually, drunk while you watch ..... in cheap champagne Again with many ideas in the 30s movies, they also have misunderstandings as well. The struggles of time for a better life have been bitter and distorted from the emotional craziness that has been in murder. But this one is all crazy It also reminds me of BLOODY MAMA at De Niro - Winters shlock fest that makes this film look good in a positive way.
