This is the three stories "Shakti", "Devi" and "Kali" about the experimental community. (Or something like this) is called a group Taylor-Eriksson Which led people to travel within themselves and into the kingdom of I didn't know and left a little damage here and there. I would say Some years later, some of the damage still lurks and waiting for the right time to perform. Shakti tells the story of a woman whose husband had died mysteriously. In fact, he was torn apart and the suspect was a man. That may not exist It seems that this woman was able to project an image of an inner demon or meet a male sister who was killed when she tried to talk to this woman while posing as a reporter. The deity tells the story of a young man who wants "Jumping out of the skin" He was a fast-paced skinhead and was sent to a psychiatrist who was just a member of this community, which resulted in a good doctor helping the young man realize his needs. This may be the best of the three groups. Kali tells the story of the keeper trying to "cure" this woman who is part of this congregation and releasing some kind of demon that lives in this woman. But wondering if he did or if she released it because It cannot survive in her anymore. These three tales are creepy and suspicious because you are not sure what to expect and the location and settings are different from the typical horror movies that add to the strangeness. This is a low budget model and gives a feeling. But it can create an eerie atmosphere and give credit I watched this thing with my mouth hanging open a good part of the time and when the real fear (and blood) came it was quite difficult. I found this movie interesting and annoying and really liked it. Looking for a little good, this one I will give 8 out of 10
