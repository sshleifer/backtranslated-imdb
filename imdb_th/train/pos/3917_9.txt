I saw this movie for the first time when it was released in the United States in 1984. I saw it many times. What impressed me about this film is the combination of the art of rehearsing with the lives of the characters and visas in return. Throughout the two thousand films, and sometimes unsure about who is watching the life of the character or the scene from the rehearsal This story depends on the focus of the movie. Many years later, my friends and I still like to debate whether "Carmen" has been stabbed at the end or not. From the reactions of other characters to the murder of a stylish, open to debate The passion for dance, the quality of acting, the love of art and the ability of all performances combined to create a wonderful film that combines and distorts between life and art
