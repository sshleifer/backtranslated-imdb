I feel confused and have a different personal taste in the reaction to this movie. Yes, there are vampire stereotypes. Yes, there are scientific schemes covered here. Even the martial arts pattern Everything is fine and good and definitely not done perfectly. However, I felt one important point about this movie that was being overlooked ... the cultural significance of the location. The film is based in Pensacola, Florida and doesn't try to avoid saying that. That is a brave movement in the film world today and is a rare treat for fans of indie movies. And of course it may not be the last time Pensacola is world-famous as a city of naval aviation, a city that is made of wood and sometimes a breeding ground for political controversy It is rarely seen as a growing film city. But now has changed, there is a film company to shoot And more Pensacolians are discovering the power of movies on their own This film is part of the growing trend of indie movies that use Pensacola and many others are working. Pensacola creates a loud voice in the film industry around the world, and around the world is increasingly observing, watching and listening to the world.
