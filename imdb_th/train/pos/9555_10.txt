I saw this movie 12 years ago. At TNT, it's Susanah York's birthday, and they have screened this movie twice as Tom Jones (1963). I haven't watched this movie on TV since. I'm interested to see this movie because one of the stars that Jim Dale, funny and talented, so I think now, Del writing Harry Potter at Casette, but now he was funny. Much This is a fast-paced comedy, not on a VHS or DVD. Columbia Pictures should go through their movie collection and consider recovering and releasing this movie into the Christopher Plum DVD. Mercedes is a cheerful person like Lord Fofington. Ian Bannan is a somewhat funny person, like Ramble. The sailor. This is a funny movie that no one can see anymore with great production costs *** 1 / 2 stars from ****
