Virgin, 40 years old, is about Andy Stitzer, a forty-year-old man working in an electronics store and not having a very social life and a very awkward woman. Some of his colleagues at the store invited him out one night and they found that Andy was still innocent, so they planned to help him lose his virginity. One day in the shop, Andy met a woman named Trish, who gave her the phone number and eventually Andy had the courage to date her and they started to like each other very much. About sex and he must tell this to Trish to give him a lot of trouble if he can be brave enough to tell her before something awkward Actors both movies and A montage of great movies The film, starring Steve Karel, who has written a great screenplay and his screenplay is also very good. I was very surprised with this movie. It's sweet, funny, fun, fun, fun, smart, good-natured and a good time. This movie is as good as the Wedding Crashers this year and both films are the best comedies I have seen in a moment. Virgin, 40 years old, shows many special abilities and can be used. Good and works as a comedian and romantic and it's very sweet and fun. One of the greatest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year
