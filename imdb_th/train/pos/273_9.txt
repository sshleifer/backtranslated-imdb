It is difficult for me to criticize what Mitzi Kapture made. She shed light and grace on the screen and was a great actress. Although there is a plot, it can be predicted. I think maybe if Jill had slept with Richard, it might make him weird than he used to be. It would be nice to see Jill and her husband discover Richard's little problem with his ex-wife. I'm a little disappointed with the ending of the movie. I like to see more blocking with Zack's death and may close with her husband. I must say that I will not be able to look at the gun that is burning and I do not think of the image that she stood there. It's the perfect end for Richard. Of course, Mitzi ROCKED! I wait for your future project.
