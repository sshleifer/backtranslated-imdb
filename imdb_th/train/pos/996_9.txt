This movie surprised me. Some things were "repetitive" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie "Enemy of the State" starring Will Smith, but most of the entertainment was mixed with Jamie Foxx. And comedian Mike Epps and two gangsters, Julio and Ramundo. This is a movie that you can watch again - say ... Wednesday night. When nothing happens, I give 9 as entertainment.
