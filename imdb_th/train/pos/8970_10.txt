I researched this movie a little and discovered a website that claimed it was an internal joke about the world of gays and lesbians after World War II. Except Stewart and Novak and the witch represent the alternative way of life, John Van Druten, who wrote the musicals, was gay and familiar with Greenwich Village. First in the theater when I was in grade 5 or 6 because my parents took me It's hard to take me to a movie that doesn't have horses, machine guns or alien creatures, and I plan to get bored. But I remember the time when Jimmy Stewart embraced Kim Novak at the top of the steel building and threw his hat away while the camera followed it. When George Duning's love theme jumped, I felt that it felt like falling in love. The first stirring of romantic / sexual love made me dazed when I left the theater. I'm sure I'm not the only pre-school boy who was tempted by Kim Novak who was shocked and staring directly. It is ridiculous that gay parables can jump start the opposite sex of teenagers in many of us. I am now in the late 1950s and have watched the movie again yesterday and this same feeling made me excited when I saw that hat touching fifty years later ..
