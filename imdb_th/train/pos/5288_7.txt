This comical Bugs Bunny cartoon sees the return of Marvin the Martian, who has no name and his dog K-9 friend, a green dog. <br /> <br /> This time, instead of trying to destroy Earth Marvin in the mission Realm Capture life on Earth and bring it back to Mars. Of course, the creature he chose was Bugs Bunny. At first, Buck thought that Marvin and K-9 were tricked or healed. But knew that it was wrong when Marvin severely extended the bug's hole with a ray gun Bugs tries to lure him out of the situation in two ways, including Marvin's persuasion that K-9 is planning a rebellion. Eventually he was caught using Acme's cramped jacket, which was amazingly ejected for the Acme product. It worked as advertised and Bug's was forced to use his intelligence to let K-9 release him. Open soon and the two disgruntled Martians are bound to the world. <br /> <br /> I like this very much, although the ending is slightly weak compared to the rest of the story. Marvin's voice changed a bit here and he was able to see the emotions when he was angry. But this doesn't make me like him or even a cartoon
