Pierce Brosnan may be the only thing familiar with Richard Attenborough's new biography. The rest is new for international audiences: Canadian history and the culture of the first country. <br /> <br /> "Gray owl" is A test showing that a man was used in Ojibway, north of Ontario. For decades before it was politically correct to do so. This film has a moral love story and a man who was tortured in his past. Although torture does not always happen with the amazing effects that may occur. <br /> <br /> However, it is a movie that allows viewers to watch without any violence. Deep respect for Canada's first country and presenting them in an elegant and non-traditional manner. Brosnan's performances are quite stiff. But I think that's what Lord Attenborough wants him. <br /> <br /> Thank you from the proud Canadian.
