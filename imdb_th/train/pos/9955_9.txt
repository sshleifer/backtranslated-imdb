Watch this movie twice in the community and love it a lot. I work in the Jane Finch community and feel that this movie has really influenced and tasted the community. The writing of the dialogue and performance is strong, and I find myself attracted to the story of Raya, as she struggles to pursue her goals and not lose herself in the process Wonderful dance sequence and not just But the body that moves smoothly and has only electricity But the camera is still moving smoothly and has great flair Every character has many dimensions - not all that is good or bad and the female character is very strong. This is a movie with a heart beat and celebrates the irrepressible spirit of hip-hop teenagers and communities like Jane Finch.
