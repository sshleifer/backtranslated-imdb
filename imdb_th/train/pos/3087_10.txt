Six Degrees is a great show! I watched the entire season online since I just met and was very disappointed to not have Season 2: '(and above all, ABC has now taken offline so it can't be viewed online anymore. Why did ABC create a great performance with a great story and a great character, just pulling it out into the air without causing the story to end? It seems like it's a fantasy. us Actually connected characters, I feel that at least ABC can put online programs for the viewers who are attracted to them while they continue to broadcast the six-minute reality television program Six Degrees. We will miss you.
