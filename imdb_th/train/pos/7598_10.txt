"Lost", "24", "Carnivale", "Desperate Housewifes" ... The program will continue. These and other high quality shows show that we're in the golden age in television history "Lost" is a pure genius. An incredible layer of personal and psychological stories that emphasize with great movies. (Incredible to use this word when describing TV programs) Killer ratings, great performances Everyone who is not attracted to this story is one of the most important creative expressions on television. There may be problems when viewing only once per week. But the DVD format is an incredible way to watch Hope that they will keep it (As I'm sure they do)
