Just finished watching the movie and would like to give my own opinion. (And justice) with movies. <br /> <br /> First of all, to get things straight, this movie doesn't pretend to be anything other than a comedy action. It's not intended to revolutionize the industry. Movies and collect important reputation and do not want to be seen as one. If you want to enjoy this movie fully, I suggest you leave your critical thoughts and wishes for a good plan because you won't find anything here. When established, ask us to go to the next movie. <br /> <br /> I have low expectations for this movie just because it doesn't have a strong plot. (Yes, the movie watcher I insulted this movie too) but I never expected myself to enjoy this movie very much. I still enjoy this more than Stephen Zhou's flicks. (Which I think Kung Fu Hustle is his best effort and will give the 9th score as well) tight action and epic, while comedians go to the right place br /> Spoiler Alert I think the action may not be true. But why do I want to watch serious basketball movies? There are other sports movies (dramas) that are doing well. Why should you create another story about spoilers? <br /> <br /> I'm not even sure why you read this. Go ahead and watch it. Remember, don't think of anything, just watch, enjoy, smile, laugh and <br /> <br /> every time they (Film industry) Create masterpieces such as Pulp Fiction or The Godfather movies and sometimes they create Better movies in the garbage dump I'm not saying that Kung Fu Dunk deserves recognition that the previous example already exists again. If we are talking about Stephen Chow-ish's comedy, this top ten, <br /> <br /> recommend Great if you love: no simple movies that have really good action. -Kung Fu -Death Trance - Kung Fu and comedian - What the hell? Look here. <br /> 9/10 for actors of Kung Fu Dunk ^ _ ^
