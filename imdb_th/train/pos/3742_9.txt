I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. But nothing new. <br /> <br /> Everybody here is grouped with other war movies. This movie is wrong! It's not a war movie. "One fly through the cuckoo nests" is an asylum film or "cold hands Luke" is a prison movie. This is a movie about individuality, inconsistency, self-confidence and the cost of that personality. <br /> <br /> The story is the same as "One fly over the Cuckoos' nest" and "Cool Hand Luke" in a good company and it's their own. It is these movies. It should be counterproductive and not "Apocalypse Now" or "Platoon". <br /> <br /> Eric
