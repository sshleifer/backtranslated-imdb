I checked this as an impulse when browsing through the movie store and not surprisingly more than this! My mother and I watched this movie together and we enjoyed it thoroughly. It's not a typical "chicks" that has a heavy love story and tears all the way But it can touch the nerves at the end It's the end, even though it's unexpected and sad. But the overall picture of the movie was not harmed by it I think Reese Witherspoon is a great actor, even in this film, her debut and this is worth watching! I don't know many actors supporting But they all have important supporting roles "Men in the Moon" is a convincing story about a teenager who falls in love for the first time. Most women can absolutely relate to everything - from Witherspoon's words, her subtle eyes and her subtle emotions. (Angry like a typical teenage girl) while she plays the character, confused about love But she did not meet stupidity and underage
