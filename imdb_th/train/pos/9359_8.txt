The feeling of this movie is excellent. Adam Sandler's performance was very inspiring. While he plays a fragile and fragile character, he uses his abilities to the top and act truly. His character is really interesting. I saw myself reading this movie and didn't care about this, as Sandler made me. For those who play a funny role primarily, he draws a serious role with what appears to be his quirks and opinions. I like the scenes where Adam and Don's characters ride motorcycles throughout the city. I am familiar with this time because it seems that Don will testify of one thing Adam can do to escape from everything. With video games, music and many more that he did to prevent him from thinking about the past, riding his scooter with his headphones, seeming to escape from the idea This movie is definitely worth watching.
