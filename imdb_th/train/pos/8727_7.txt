Buck life is a good movie. But for me it doesn't compare to movies like Toy Story and things. Don't understand me wrong. I like this movie. But it's not as good as Toy Story. This movie has both laughs and other things that Toy Story has, but this movie doesn't feel like ... I don't know. br /> Buck life ... I don't want to say this is a movie that I can't remember. I saw it many years ago. Of course, I haven't seen Toy Story for many years, but I still remember. I shouldn't criticize this film, but I am lifting my finger, even if it's not the best work that Pixar does. <br /> <br /> Insect life: *** / ****
