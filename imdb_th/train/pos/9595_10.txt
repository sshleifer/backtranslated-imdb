In the beginning of the film, one of the critics said that he had been told that he had two meetings with him: he was a black man and a man. But besides that, he has a third match: he is gay. "You must be stronger than you have ever imagined," he said. "Paris is Burning" is a documentary about gay black men and Hispanic people who are tranvestites Transsexuals <br /> <br /> The miracle of "Paris is Burning" is directed by Jenny Livingston. A strange show and helping people in their humanity We learn their views about homosexuality, men, women, hope, disappointment, their dreams. Some of these dreams are unattainable. It's sad. A lot of people are seriously denied. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for everyone. There is an image in this nude transsexuals. If you have problems with homosexuality, this movie isn't right for you. But if you see this movie, you will know that "Paris is Burning" is not about men who wear women's clothing. It is a group of people who are often degraded and make society worse and what they can do. The feeling of the community in their lives. <br /> <br /> I've watched this movie four times since its debut in 1991 because it says many things: it's a materialistic description. In our culture about gender roles About the rich and poor about the media and what celebrations about fame and praise "Paris is Burning" is one of the most humane movies and one of the saddest movies I've ever seen.
