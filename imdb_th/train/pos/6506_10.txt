The best Effective and bring The most interesting documentary film ever made about war The tone offers a completely different approach to the attitude of Kung Fu towards World War II, where the media is exhibited. Instead of letting screams about the horror of the war, it makes the voice of Sir Laurence Olivier bring the back seat to the true image of the war: the corpses everywhere, the explosion, the terror of the citizens Of life, the suffering of the innocent Most of all, bringing home truly, where humanity is capable. When all the general rules of "politeness" are removed, there is something clear about humans. Hobbs in the true state of nature, he will return to form. Of the beast that has the ability to commit crimes that will remain shocking and passionate in the 60 years. Perhaps there is a follow-up series called "Century of War" for the twentieth century is a truly terrifying century. I feel that it is the irony of the greatness that has caused 50 million deaths to create such an interesting and wonderful series.
