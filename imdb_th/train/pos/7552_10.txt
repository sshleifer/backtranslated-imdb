CAT SOUP is a short anime created by the legendary manga Nekojiru. It won the "Best Short Film" at the 6th Fantasia Film Festival and was awarded the "Excellence Prize" at the Japanese Media Arts Festival. < br /> <br /> When Nyaako's little kitten's soul is stolen by a dead spirit and Nyatta hyung begins a strange journey to bring it back. They find many wonderful characters and incredible adventures that often disturb. CAT CATUP is an anime that has never been seen before. Hello Kitty is acid! It is very original, beautiful, outstanding and has a good sense of novelty and lyrics. CAT SOUP looks very surreal. (Without dialogue) and sometimes cruel and bloody So it is an anime for adults rather than children (they may not understand at all!). A wonderful journey for those who have the opportunity to see this perfect masterpiece. Must see!
