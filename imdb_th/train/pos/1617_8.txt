'Moonstruck' is a love story. No love, only at least three people. But they all relate to the same family. Loretta's family Loretta (Cher) is about to marry Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello). She doesn't love him. But he is good and sweet When he visited a dying mother in Italy, Loretta met Johnny's brother Ronnie (Nicholas Cage). He and Johnny didn't talk in five years and Loretta wants to invite him to the wedding. Of course, they will fall in love immediately. <br /> <br /> How can the story and love story of parents and Loretta's aunt and aunt develop? Everyone saw it as a pleasure to watch. Cher is a bright star in everything. She really won and deserved an Oscar that year. Cage is a good and stupid person as well, and Olympia Dukakis as Loretta's mother and Vincent Gardenia as her father is great. This movie is funny, fascinating and fun.
