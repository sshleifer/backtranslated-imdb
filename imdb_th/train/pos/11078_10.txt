I watched movies today and it made me feel dissatisfied. It's a real masterpiece of art and I don't understand why most people think it's garbage. The main concept of the movie - take your ego away and you'll have real power! This is the main battle at the end of the movie and Guy Ritchie shows that in a spectacular manner. "The greatest enemy will hide in the last place you will look at" - Can you remember this from the movie? Because our true enemies are in us - it is our ego ... a voice that tells us that we are important that makes us proud of us that tells us not Wanting to control which creates all negative feelings and thoughts Your private away Great movie!
