This game is really amazing. You should get it if you don't have one. Although it is ancient But now it's amazing when it comes out I believe that this game is always classic. It's as good as Super Mario World or more. When I was a child, my friends and I would sit and play this game for hours trying to overcome it, which we eventually did. It's not very close to the Super Mario Galaxy, but if you're a Mario fan, it's important. It's fun, fun and challenging. Everything you need from a fantasy game, except for good graphics. (It came out in 1996) ROCK ON 4EVA MARIO LUIGI and YOSHI !!! Nintendo is the best!
