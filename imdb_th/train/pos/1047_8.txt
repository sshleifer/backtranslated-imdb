Probably (or may not be considered) interesting. The only reason I watched this movie at first was because I wanted to watch the performances of men who beat Humphrey Bogart in his CASABLANCA (10/10 role for Best Actor, Oscar (I still give Oscars to the bogeys But Paul Lucas works well and deserves the nomination. At least) I'm glad I watched this movie because I really enjoyed it. I think this film is a little sermon, but not only did I not mind me happy with speeches and never bored with them. <br /> <br /> The performance is outstanding in this movie. I like it. Paul Lukas is a special, Lucile Watson (nominated for an Oscar correctly), Bette Davis, George Coulouris and Eric Roberts, a young middle-aged player. What some the Of the sages, he just broke me. Even the character's name (Bodo) was funny. <br /> <br /> The ending g, in which Lucas's character is forced to do what he thinks is wrong, even if he does For the right reasons, it works for me as well. I agree with the reason he feels that he does what he does and I understand why he can't explain it. The message that this movie created was good and honored. (Meaning home) is beautiful and the performance is excellent Watch this movie if you have a chance. <br /> <br /> 9/10
