For everyone who likes the series, this movie will be something to watch. However, it also makes you want more. I like the way every character (detective) appears, at least with the ending of who is the fourth chair for them, leaving reason for other movies I guess that is a Bayless. Of course, this is a scene that consists of various scenes. This is a series that I hope to live. Thank you to the actors for a great TV program.
