Vivah is not classic. However, on the day of hardcore actions, special effects and complex conversions (Bollywood is not an expert) It's quite refreshing to see a simple movie like Vivah. The story that we all know is the journey from the couple's first meeting to the wedding. Test time Nothing more, no less than this Music is not in the same league as MPK or HAHK, but it doesn't make you feel as well. Two notable songs for me - Mujhe Haq Hai and Do Anjaane, while Milan abhi aadha & Hamaari shaadi is humble. Shahid shows sincerity and shows a lot of potential. It's a good thing to see him play something else. But usually, Amrita is very cute and plays a small young woman who is tame for perfection. Alok Nath, Anupam Kher & Seema Biswas is a great supporter and the rest of the actors are able to act reasonably Suraj is simple. But effective The major flaw of this film is the slow pace which may test the patience of a large audience. But overall it is a good, clean and good family movie
