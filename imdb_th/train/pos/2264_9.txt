Vonnegut's words have the best experience on paper. The story that he weave is a gentle silk gossemar of words and expressions that are not easily translated into the world of Marilyn Manson or Jerry Brahmur. His words were treated well in an amazing slaughterhouse. <br /> <br /> Mother's night may be one of the three novels that Vonnegat wrote. I can take to the desert island with Slaughterhouse-5 and Bluebeard <br /> <br /> The movie version deserves 10, but the book is part of my inner landscape permanently until I can't ... Some scenes left from the movie are one part my memory ...
