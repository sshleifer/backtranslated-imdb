Three horror stories based on members of the deceased Hindu who returned home But changed in some way In the first issue, our former cult members are now in a crazy hospital and are reported by visitors who want to find out about what happened in the cult. Somewhat slow as he tells the story of the incident as they sit on the chair and face each other. Journalists have a special interest in what led to the deaths of participants. Something that seems to be quite boring is exciting. With surprising stories, things start to bleed. <br /> <br /> The second story has violent young criminals visiting psychiatrists. Receive treatment Patients seem to have some type of agenda. But the psychiatrist depends on the mission Again, things slow down a bit and get weird. Then there are strange stories that are written and surprisingly very much. <br /> <br /> The last story involves a spiritual therapist who claims to be able to get rid of those who are sick from them with his hands One of the patients is a former cult member. Therefore, successful treatment will be more complicated. Again we were surprised with the twist. There are scenes that are full of beautiful blood. <br /> <br /> There are nude pictures of a good woman's forehead, including a nude picture of a man's forehead for some reason. I find the story to be very well written and the director has been very successful in creating each story with surprising stories and bad consequences. <br /> <br /> Note: German DVD review
