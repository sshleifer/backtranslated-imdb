This is an old movie that is very attractive. The place is great and the situation is one of Preston Fi's old movies that you want to watch movies that don't need much and sit back and relax. The performance is good and I like Michael Rispoli. He is in the rounders as well and while you sleep The remaining actors are fun. What happens when two people are getting married, meet people they really love on weekends that they are planning their own wedding? I know ... sounds scary ... But it is and that is what makes watching fun It will make your girl friend hug you or leave you. But at least you will know
