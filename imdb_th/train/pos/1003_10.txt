Another Aussie masterpiece presents the story of an unknown and supernatural world and is very well done. It does not turn to special techniques that are too large, such as American flicks. But will focus on the emotional impact A rather simple story that Rebecca Gibney & Co. brings to life. It follows the story of a couple who bought an old house that should be the home of an old woman who never went outside and her husband disappeared in mysterious situations. Adam became a man who disappeared, which was actually a mass murderer. Highly recommended. 8/10
