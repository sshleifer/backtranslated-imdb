Plotwise, this is a foolish, somewhat deceitful as the era / biography. <br /> <br /> However, the only reason I want to see it at first is because I want to know how great Henry Fonda is Like at his peak I am not disappointed - he creates a truly warm and charming performance. <br /> <br /> In addition, I can honestly say that I never really get bored in every 2 movies. * ****
