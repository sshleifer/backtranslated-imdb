Spoiler ..... <br /> <br /> I have seen the original on TV recently and remember that this production is less interesting than the Beeb series. Most of the time, I watched the DVD again. This week and still have the same impression At first it was good. But weakened when the heroine became oh, brave and very noble and returned to the most vile husband when he was sick and I was frustrated with her saint. I think this is "The right thing to do" when the story is written, including many suffering and it is difficult for a woman to be free from her husband while the marriage makes her no more than his possession. Conducting a scandal with lovers like I expect many modern audiences will like to watch. But today it is difficult to use frigidity and especially when this heroine has a strong and brave girlfriend ready to protect her from anyone and everyone. So the story in my movie is clear. It did very well as a novel. But quite annoying for the present life. <br /> <br /> A stable hero, Gilbert, is an absolute saint to deal with his lady's variables and is often a hidden behavior. To support continuously So I was very ashamed that when Helen was with him freely, eventually the script did not allow him to fall in love for about a minute to hug each other quickly before the name appeared. This is a complete nonsense when we wait all the time through the things that bring confidence to an unworthy husband to get a good conversation and embrace between the hero and the heroine. But the ending is like a filmmaker who has timed or financed or doesn't have to pay attention. "You are here - one minute, do what you can do and cut as the director wants to go home now ....." I feel totally dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> However, very high. Praising Toby's performance, Stephen's hero, who is perfect and very handsome, and Rupert Grave is a disgusting and distasteful villain Depressed and quite respectable. <br /> <br /> Saying that I love these classic dramas and almost all of them. Look better than the drama "modern" on TV. Today, 7 stars, because despite the irritation But still a good watch
