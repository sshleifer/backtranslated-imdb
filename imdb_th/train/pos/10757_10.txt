** warning! Brave forward! ** <br /> <br /> (Yes, I know it is difficult to destroy historical documents. But I will reveal some stories and methods) <br /> <br /> This is a special documentary, not only because of the outstanding image But also because of the story behind Naudets not intended to tell the story of the 9/11 day, but as a rookie firefighter, the emotions of men and the audience's relationship with them are more realistic and powerful than them. Will look back. <br /> <br /> In terms of creating the movie "9/11" is a textbook. If the event is a real script, they will be excellent when the character is created, then throw the curves that they must respond to. This is all the more amazing considering the pain and emotion of the raw image that the director must wade through this story together. <br /> <br /> The first part of this movie will give you a picture of inner life. Fire station Especially the method in which the novice swallowed himself as a veteran crew That part alone is quite good and if the documentary is allowed to use the intended course The brothers seem to show the process of being a real New York firefighter. <br /> <br /> Of course, all hell is broken. The chaos behind WTC's attacks is clearly visible, as the characters that we are aware of are pushed into a dreadful situation. Looking not only But the attack only But the first reaction is an animation that shows the extreme emotions of human beings. <br /> <br /> The aftermath of the firefighters was discovered that it was lost and discovered, that is the highest human drama. Life and death hung in the balance. Unlike many movies, not only viewers But do not know who will live and die <br /> <br /> The only negative thing I have to say is Robert De Niro. (People I like) blurbs without enlightenment, no need, no need and no postponing. They may be added only to attract more TV viewers. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: The best documentary I've ever seen. Nonpareil of raw human emotions and drama, 9.5 out of 10.
