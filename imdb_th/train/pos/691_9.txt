I will come clean The only reason I discovered about this DVD is because Dominic Monaghan is my favorite actor. When I heard the title of the movie, I thought it would be ... different, perhaps not a good way. <br /> <br /> But I was wrong after reading a short review and I was excited to see it I sent it to my copy as soon as possible and received it a few weeks later. No need to say that I am not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film follows Jack's insomnia that is often disturbed by the conditions that make him wonder what is true. I will not leave what happened. But I will tell you that sometimes this movie may be a scary story in reality. <br /> <br /> The director is a miracle. Lose entertainment or moments that stimulate thoughts. <br /> <br /> All in all, I gave this great movie 9 stories from 10 stories far more than I thought.
