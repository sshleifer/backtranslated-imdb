The sleepwalker is a creature that drains the life force out of man completely for survival. But they can only use virgins (It doesn't explain why) Charles Brady (Brian Krause) is one of those who want to feed his mother Mary (Alice Krige). After that, he likes Tanya (Madchen Amick). Can you escape? <br /> <br /> In one hand, this is a great horror movie. There are many blood and gore and distorted humor. There are many funny references for horror movies (Castle Rock is mentioned only once). Krause is also great. (Who would have thought he could follow "Return to the Blue Lagoon") as well as Kirge and Amick, but I found this movie annoying. <br /> <br /> It was written for the screen by Stephen. King and it is vague. The sleepwalker is not fully explained. Are they from? Why do they call it Why does the son have to give mother food? Why do cats hate them and can kill them? What is their power? (At one point, Krause lost the car and changed the color and style!)? Why do they need to get rid of people's lives? Why should be a virgin only? Why does the son have sex with his mother? These things do not explain how to make the story confusing. It's too bad because those questions are great horror movies. Great makeup and special effects. <br /> <br /> Fast, full of blood and lots of fun. If only the script is better. There is also a clear edit of the sex scene between Krause and Krige (you can tell) to get only 7 points for my R score.
