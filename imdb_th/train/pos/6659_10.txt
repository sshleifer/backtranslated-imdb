Having used the courage to create a film about Gandhi in India, which he did not show as a person who could not do anything wrong, this movie showed that Mahatma was not a good father. (At least in the eyes of his son) <br /> <br /> The performance is excellent, great movies, great directions. But this film is interesting if the intention is to create this movie without having to expect the box office, which I think is the case here. It's a great effort. But if the creator expects this to be commercially successful, then the fate of this movie is the day they choose this topic. <br /> <br /> 20 years from now, this movie will be remembered. For the magnificent portrayal of Harilal by Akshaye Khanna, he deserves an Oscar nomination for this story .. and in good faith he is not only an admirable performance Regarding his father's death, he had no dialogue, no screams but shot by Khanna, one of the best scenes ever in the history of the cinema. <br /> <br /> My father Gandhi couldn't. Stay Thrilling movie theater But yes, it's a great movie theater and must see great efforts ..
