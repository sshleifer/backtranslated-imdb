Fido is a cute and deserving comedy movie, especially when considering the mainstream that should entertain us today. <br /> <br /> As has been pointed out Sweet words that use the dead to point to the finger While the need for some bloody scenes was almost without blood, and the way that the film was presented (50s style was good) > <br /> Although the actors are good But I feel that Moss and Nelson stand out. Humor is not in your face. But quite quiet There was a lot of attention to detail and I caught myself smiling kindly many times throughout the story. Of course, this is not a movie masterpiece. But it is not determined to be - Tanger has succeeded in delivering a warm black comedy
