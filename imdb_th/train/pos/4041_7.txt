Tenshu was jailed and sentenced to death. When he was alive by using electric power, government officials gave him the option to choose to use electricity at a higher level or agree with some experiments. He chose the experiment and placed it in a large metal cell with criminals, bad asses, survivors of electric shock. They can have what they need in the room. (Within reason) but they can't leave After a few days, the meal was reduced to once a day and set the room temperature to 100. After that, the alarm would ring periodically so they could not sleep. One day, the 'witch' came into their cell. (Even if it's the mirrored part) What will happen next? I'll let you know. I may be in the minority here. But I like the collection. It is interesting for me. Now, if the half return is as good as the accumulation, I will give you a much higher score. <br /> <br /> My grade: C + <br /> <br /> Media Blaster 2 DVD set. 1) Director of cutting; Movie Trailer "Versus", "Aragami", "Attack the Oil Pump" and "Deadly Outlaw Rekka" Disc 2) Theatrical Cut; Commentary with Hideo Sakaki, Ryu Hikita Gourd, Sakaguchi Taku An Tsutomo Takahashi; Interviews with actors and teams from; Original sample; And promotional development toys
