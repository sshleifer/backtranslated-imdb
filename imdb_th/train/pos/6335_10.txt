I am from Bulgaria, which is almost impossible to have a tornado. But my imagination says I'm "very scared". "This person (Devon Sawa) works very well with this movie! Don't know how old he is But he didn't act like a child (well). Now, about tornadoes - it's not very realistic. But you're afraid if you want to have a good time in front of the TV - this is a movie!
