This movie is quite good. I'm not an avid baseball fan. But it's a movie created to help understand the meaning of love, commitment, heart, etc. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brenda Fricker, Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza And Milton Davis, Jr. join with actors with a wide range of abilities and understanding of sports. The plot is reliable and I love the message William Dear and they combined into a great movie. <br /> <br /> Most sports movies revolve around real stories or events and they often work. not good But this movie has scored 10 points at the perfect level, although there are a few mistakes here and there. <br /> <br /> 10/10
