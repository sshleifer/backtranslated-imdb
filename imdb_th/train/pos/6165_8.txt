Yes, some plans are difficult to follow and The Bill tends to get violent. But actually it's an interesting show that I try not to miss. Most of the episodes are exciting and quite tense, and the performance is quite good, although I think of Roberta Taylor as an inspector for Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent. The shame that the program is now a watershed is because I find it easier to watch Episode 8.00, but why do I like The Bill because not only But it is dominating, but the excitement at the end makes the next episode not to be missed It is true even though it is more fascinating. But I like this program a lot because it is a program that doesn't try too seriously. 8/10 Bethany Cox
