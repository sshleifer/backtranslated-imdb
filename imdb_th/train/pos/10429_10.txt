I'm not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies. But heard that good, I was easily shocked, the most romantic thing I have ever seen in my life, beautiful, wonderful, sweet, funny and full of heart The chemistry is flawless like writing and directing. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy look natural and sweet together. <br /> <br /> The movie grabs you right away and won't let go. You can't look out and can't stop listening. Even a small moment will melt your heart. <br /> <br /> This thing has entered my favorite ranks. Masterpiece.
