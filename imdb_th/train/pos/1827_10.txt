Every dog ​​to heaven is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I saw the first time when I was like 3. Now I am 12 years old and I rent. It makes me think about things and bring many memories back. That's "day." I love music. I love when Charlie comes to heaven. I love music "Let me be amazed." How do I like Charlie Dee and his voice? Bert Reynolds can only play Charlie's great voice. I love this movie. The 1st person is the best because it's original and excellent. It really brings back memories that no one can explain, even me. If only I could go back to those days. I love characters If this was the way the memories came back when I was 12, imagine how I would feel when I was 19 years old. I hope I can see this when I get older. When I saw this thing for the first time, I never knew that I would look back and feel like this. I am very happy that this movie was created and the amazing thoughts came to my heart and heart at level 1-10. I will give it perfect. 10. It's an amazing movie. It's hard to explain the feeling when I grow up and if I have children I hope they will experience this feeling.
