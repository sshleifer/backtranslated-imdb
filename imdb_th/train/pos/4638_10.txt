I saw this movie when I was in Israel for the summer. My Hebrew is not fluent, so the subtitles are very useful. I don't feel lost in every movie. You are often used to subtitles after about 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie made me disappointed !!!!!! It represents the two most notable taboos in the Middle East today: the homosexual relationship between Israel and Palestine. Allow people to enter both boundaries of conflict simultaneously. Dilemma, emotions bring The film climbed in a tragedy when anger and anger drove one of the lovers to the other side! Must see for sure !!
