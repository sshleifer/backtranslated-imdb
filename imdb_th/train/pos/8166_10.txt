This movie is great! The performance was well done with Corbin Bernensen's excellent cast as a perfect dentist who had released and tortured patients. At first he saw his wife with Pullman and then he was crazy. He also avenged his wife and the bully beside the patient he tortured. The most special effects are beautiful, even though some are fake. (Like a piercing tongue that was placed outside for 1 night and still was red in the morning) but the torture scene was doing very well Although this movie has a very slow weakness Between the heavy parts, sometimes it is just a very boring part. But for a real horror / thriller, this is something to watch!
