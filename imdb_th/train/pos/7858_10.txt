TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY may be the best movie of all of Mary Pickford's movies in two hours. It's quite a long time for the silent film of 1922, but still paying attention to you for 80 years after filming. Mary gave her one of the best performances at times. It seems like the show "The Greatest Hits" with the performances of innocent Mary, Little Devil Mary, Mary Little Mother, Mary who must open, Romantic heroines, etc. were used throughout the film in the past The film is surprisingly straightforward about the illegitimate son of a character who supported the character in 1922 and at one point our Little Mary thought that the mother who was not in question! If the Oscars were won in 1922, there was no doubt that the Academy Award for Best Actress would be Mary's.
