The story and characters are the best I've ever seen. The graphics are good for PS and the cut scenes and voice-overs are amazing. I won the game at least 3 times and loved it every second. I felt that the problems that the assistants faced were reliable and true and I believe it deserves a sequel. Or at least create a new one If they rearrange for the ps3, I will buy the system for that game and maybe mgs4 is amazing with the idea and functionality of the dragoon system that is enough to guarantee the rental and on that ad is an invention, although sometimes cheating. In addition, the battle system and plot make this game a definite purchase.
