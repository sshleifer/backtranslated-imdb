I saw the second half of this movie about a year ago and was very happy to see it on DVD. Recently, I watched many reality series on PBS about ranching and others. They don't have anyone close to telling the story of this movie. Based on the fact that REAL has no punch, coldness, happiness, sadness and clarity, this is a movie that should be shown to students or those who are interested in early life. Both Rip Torn and Conchata Ferrell add to the script well. The opening credits indicate that it's done even though the National Endowment donations for the humanities If this is the type of product tax, can go where I will be happy to see more. I highly recommend and will encourage people to tell friends if you see it and enjoy the movie.
