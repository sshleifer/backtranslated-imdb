Indeed, Domino is a breath of fresh air, which is a new thing for the movie world. I enjoy the movie a lot because of the complex plot, various characters and intense camera effects. I've seen some people complain about the camera's performance and, in fact, as the creators do themselves, the flashy and fierce images are the pinnacle of mistakes that happen over time. Everything you see is the desired effect. Maybe some people complain because there is something that has never been done before, even if it is something that makes a difference. What you see is the way Domino sees things through your eyes. Think about it. <br /> <br /> When talking about this, I don't see anything bad. Despite being a "busy" nature as specified in reality, it is just a quick storytelling. The plot of the story is not difficult to follow if you pay attention to what really happened. It may be because I see movies from many areas, such as plotting, etc. I am not "interpreter "Or whatever separates the movie from each other, it comes to me. As mentioned above, I believe that this is a really great movie, even though in the future it will be a classic blockbuster or whatever. <br /> <br /> And the character is good. I believe that the actors are great because they work well, showing their characters effectively. That is what makes women and gentlemen in the movie. All characters are unique and the advantage is that you will see a small piece of each person's life. Essentially, I like actors and characters primarily. <br /> <br /> Everybody who beat and burned this movie might not see it as I do or ignore them. Regardless of whether it is a great movie in its own right, it's a great movie.
