I love this movie and I am one of the seniors who shouldn't enjoy it or that way. Not this movie is not deep - Who cares? This type of movie has never been But strange, there is a message in it We all have the potential to be what we want. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey is a great person in this movie. I always thought that she was similar to Katharine Hepburn. So it's good to see that both Hepburn and Posey made movies about librarians. (Hepburn is a desk set) Every librarian, especially those with a sense of humor, should see Party Girl. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 8. Movies in there. But it is incredibly charming and entertaining.
