Everything was beautiful in Suburbia when a small family moved in because Dad got a new job in a computer company there. But heaven would not be complete without a snake The strange thing happened while the family joined the local country club without a husband because it was a secret. Father is not a participant But pressured him to join because everyone in the vicinity and working as a member Robert Urich's good man is quite enthusiastic. But Joan Cassidy is a good-natured housewife who turns to make a loud noise. A trustworthy cold water maker and well done with Susan Lucci, the bad guy as the club president. Look for Michael Berryman, a religious lover. The movie captures paranoia and the final effect is worth the wait. I've watched this movie many times
