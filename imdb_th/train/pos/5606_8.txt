This is a very difficult movie and almost impossible to understand what happened. At first it seems to be a movie about a man (Trelkovsky) who wants an apartment and rather invites himself into it when the current tenants (women) commit suicide. Then twist and turn. Start Is the neighbor trying to kill him? And why the tenant's clothes died in the apartment One of the most amazing things if Trelkovksy _is_ first tenant. <br /> <br /> Spoiler, spoiler, spoiler, spoiler, <br /> <br /> One of the tricks. The Polanski draw is used to lie to us. We think that when we see things from the point of view of the characters that we see in what the characters do and may be misrepresented. We think that when the camera shows things from an intellectual perspective that we see reality - but Polanski has a camera lying to us.
