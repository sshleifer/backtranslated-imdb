Reading all the comments is very exciting. But can someone help tell the name of the real artist who is drawing to broadcast at a good time? I know everyone means j.j. As an artist in the family But there is a real family that has real artists and he has not received any credit in this eye This image is for good actors. But will you disagree whether or not he has touched the hearts of all of us? I want to know that he is still painted or if he is still alive. I want his work to show in my house.
