I read all of Nancy Drew as thirteen and collected books as adults. I like the effects used at the end. (And the beginning of a small part) of the movie that has drawn the line in the form of a book that is transformed into a movie scene It's a neat way to point out the connection between situations in movies and books. For example, the scene with the Oriental dealership reminds me of many situations that I remember from the book. I think Ned has been perfectly selected and Emma Roberts is a great interpretation of Nancy Drew in the 21st century (as with Betty Crocker's picture of her time!)
