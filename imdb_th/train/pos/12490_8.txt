Allen and Julie moved into a mountain hut after the daughter was killed one night. No one knows who killed the little girl, but that's why they moved to the mountain. So the couple moved into this cabin and it was haunted by those who committed suicide there and no one in the nearby city wanted to talk about it. Many disgusting and have There are many parts that make me jump. Some can be predicted But there are times that I did not expect It's a good movie that isn't the most scary movie in the world. But it is still scary enough to make it good. <br /> <br /> I like the ending because it lets the audience decide what it is. But it's a horror movie that works well
