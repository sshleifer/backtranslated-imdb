I believe that Sarafina is the great effort of Whoopi Goldberg. In addition to her, there is no other star in this film, and her role is smaller than the character Sarafina. This is an important film that shows the history of apartheid in South Africa. Sarafina is a film about education and the relationship between teachers and Sarafina students. I bought this video because there is nothing in the video at all. I watched it and forwarded quickly through the musical numbers. But I would like to recommend this movie to educators and their students to understand Now, while I do not know other actors and actors in this film, I think they are very popular in South Africa and I'm glad that they were filmed with actors and South African teams except Goldberg in a small role if it makes people watch this movie
