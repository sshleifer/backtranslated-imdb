The sequel almost never lived with the original. This proves true in this case. However, if you are a fan of the original rather than giving this watch Even if the camera does not work But the character of Brian Krause is annoying and the story is boring. But it's more fun than the first episode, and that's what I feel fun. <br /> <br /> I don't see this movie that is expected to be as effective as in the first movie Quite frankly, it's a little different. Instead of sitting in his film room, Stanley is in Hollywood trying to direct the dream project Cabin by the Lake. This film has a very different feeling. But still good to see Stanley come back again. <br /> <br /> I give 6 out of 10
