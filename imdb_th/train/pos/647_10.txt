Of course, not all women are sensitive and needy, which is an interesting image from mother to prostitute. Unlike many of you, I've seen La Maman and La Putain twice. It's a good movie. I noticed that my opinions improved after the second look. All I know is what I have seen and haven't delved into additional exploits until I get a DVD. I don't even know why I enjoy this movie so much. But what do I really care about? Although I'm sure I can and will create a wonderful explanation. Okay, so you may not agree. Maybe it will be boring sometimes. I'm not an expert. Blonde reminds me of the lovely Grushenka.
