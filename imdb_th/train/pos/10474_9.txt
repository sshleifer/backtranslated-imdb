I am amazingly impressed with this movie. It has the basic elements of depression, grief, loneliness, despair, hope, dreams and friendship. It's not about genius musicians who come to the bottom. But it is about a man who is caught up in grief, trying to find comfort in his music He found a friend who came with her own problems. Claire and Des can give each other friendship and love. But more important is the conclusion of the event that made their lives the worst Still, he has a musical talent. He also had events in the past that made him tired, while things around him were truly ruins. His interest is to create a whale song. In fact, it became a passion for him. <br /> <br /> Claire is a child. She found a hidden talent while in the company Des. She also found a companion who accepted her. She learned to trust him for a period of time. <br /> <br /> Both find love. Not the idea that blows the heart, sex is filled with love. But the love that friendship and understanding has meant more For two people who have been injured, they find trust together.
