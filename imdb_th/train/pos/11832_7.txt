It's time to rant. Eh: I think the spirit is a great movie to watch. However, there are a few things that make me unable to score higher than 6 or 7 (I'm quite generous with 7) <br /> <br /> Point # 1: Matt Damon makes it worse. 'What have they been muttering to be the main character?' When I first heard him lecture, then I realized that it was Matt Damon. The man made me terrible - his performance in "The Departed" was terrible and destroyed the movie for me. (Before the movie has a chance to destroy itself But that's another story at other times) as if it were almost "Spirit". I was able to pass on this truth because of how much the narrative ... Thank you. <br /> <br /> Point 2: Brian Adams sucks ... All scores are terrible ... not as original and generally poorly executed. I never found a song that fits; And the lyrics are terrible Every time one of the lame songs came, I was closed. I almost thought that I began to hear the patriotic propaganda that sneaked into American freelance lyrics. (I can't help thinking of the terrifying patriotic songs that were played on radio after 9/11) in terms of aspects of Native American movies. They should go with the right music using the right tools, not Subcategory radio hits. Teen pop. 14 year old girl. I think I went back to junior high school. I do not want to believe that it will be better than this - I refuse. If not for this, I will rank this movie more with Disney, which knows one or two stories about the initiative. (Okay, don't worry about what I know that some people might be thinking). Unfortunately, they can't hire a better musician. <br /> <br /> I like art and animation, except for something that Here and there ... Sometimes the corners look too sharp. And the lines are too thick or too dark on the body (most thick / dark lines are close to the end). Often, I think they try hard on emotions and facial expressions and fail to draw the true emotions. But there are times when mood swings However, there are many scenes that are lazy and clear. <br /> <br /> Ok, I'm sleeping here, so I'll put it together before I start to feel less ... <br /> <br /> Try epic movies ... but it turns out it's normal. Matt Damon, you suck!
