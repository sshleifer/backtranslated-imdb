My first exposure to "Whale Music" was the Rheostatics album with the same name that I bought around 1993. I was reading the liner notes and the band said that the album remained in a prominent place in the neck. My collection Paul Quarrington's author <br /> <br /> I picked up the book a few months later and ate it! Amazing reading! I read many times, many times, every time I found a new element for Desmond and his desire to do Whale Music. <br /> <br /> I found the movie in 1996. In the video I never had a good experience with Canadian movies before But this is right for me Claire's role may be different from the original. But overall, I think that Paul Quinton's vision has been well conveyed from the book to the screen. <br /> <br /> Maury Chayakin demonstrates intelligent movement. Movies involve family relationships, love and finding people who understand. I would recommend "whale music" to not only music fans But anyone who has lost something or someone and tries to find a way back to the world
