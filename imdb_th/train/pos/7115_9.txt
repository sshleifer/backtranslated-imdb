A wonderful and witty war movie that focuses on the internal torture of the Al-Schmid fleet Although it is difficult and unpleasant But in the end it was a victory - Schmid's victory over disability and depression The fighting scene is great. But must choose one bone No matter how many shots they fired in the bullet. 50 I never saw any water or dirt being affected by the impact! It hurts realism. But I can live with it Good performance by Eleanor Parker again as his young friend
