I've seen this movie back in the 80s and almost forgot when I noticed that it was TV again and watched it. I remember like this little bedding when I first saw it and I liked it a lot more in the second look. <br /> <br /> Every actor, especially Robert Duvall, Glenn Close , Wilfred Brimley, Frederic Forrest and Jason Presson (as a twelve-year-old boy who was responsible for the death of his brother's unintentional firing) Story Peace movement and the profound pain of the family with grief. Light conversation But tell and show nonverbal language is outstanding The order of ordinary people, simple rural version is a psychiatrist. But with equally impressive family dynamics. <br /> <br /> Stone Boy is worth the time and emotional energy associated with watching.
