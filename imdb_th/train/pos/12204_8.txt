Who can imagine that the movie Mr. Welles may finish without the intervention of the studio! This film is a pit with bugs. But worth every minute because it can see the greatness of America's best film director at all times! <br /> <br /> We can see the filming at Orson Welles filmed in this movie. The story has a lot of holes, probably because of the needs of studio executives who don't trust directors. <br /> <br /> Curious by reading some comments sent to IMDB to compare Orson Welles. With the Coen brothers, Roman Polanski, even Woody Allen. When it should be all the directors that must be seen as followers Of the big boss himself Nobody is original and inventive in American film history than Mr. Welles. Fortunately, we still have his legacy, both in retrospect, such as one in a film forum in New York, just ended or his movie in the form Tape or DVD <br /> <br /> Rita Hayworth has never been photographed with love than here if she is a beautiful person with her red hair like a blonde. She is amazing beyond description. Everett Sloan and Glander gave great support for the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that made this film a piece of masterpiece added to it. Orson Welles' work If he concentrates on directing and another actor interprets Michael O'Hara, other films may be all successful. Orson Welles must be regarded as a pioneer in bringing cameras from the studio to the street. The picture in this film is amazing that we left the theater after seeing this film, truly impressed with the work, vision and talent he gave us.
