Medieval movie era sexploitation Of the late sixties and early seventies, beginning with the allowance of free nudity in mainstream movies and ending with the legality of hardcore porn. It is the year that has the most people between 1968 and 1972. One of the most passionate and talented actresses of that period was Monica Gayle, who had a small cult. Unlike many who are full of the leading roles of these flicks and the credit that follows, she has proven it. And it seems that her intentions fade away in confusion when her career is causing a mystery. <br /> <br /> Gary Graver, the director, is also capable. May be too capable of being a type sexploitation And his abilities, combined with Monica Gary's on-screen appearance, make Sandra the creation of women as a fun experience. This film never draws lines and you won't have to press your finger on the fast forward button.
