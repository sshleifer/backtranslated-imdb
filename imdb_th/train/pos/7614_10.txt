I'm obsessed! The story is amazing and the show is very interesting. But i like it very much I am in Season 2 disc 5 and I told you that I am now too attached to the character. For the bad things that happen to them will seriously affect my vote in the performance. And Michael is on my list right now, joking ... I'm so glad to see that there is Season 3 because I'm too scared to go to disk 6, thinking that it will end. I can't wait to see the rest now. Thank you to the director / producer / and the actors from Lost ... I enjoy watching TV again. Before wandering, I went through all the channels to go to bed because of disappointment on the TV.
