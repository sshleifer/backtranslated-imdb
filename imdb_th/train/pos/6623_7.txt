Firstly, this movie is stunning. People who work with 3D CG movies as a songwriter / lighter than every second that I'm shocked with what appears on the screen. It will not cause the world to fire. But if you like the story of Blade Runner - a cutting-edge story (And who is not like that) You will be fine. <br /> <br /> I must say that I Felt that the acting with the voice was unbelievable and that it had broken the whole movie I saw it at the cinema in English. But I hope to have a French version floating around. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth watching.
