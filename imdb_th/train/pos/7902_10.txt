This film is notable for its gay adherence. Throughout the movie, there was a surprise as a child, as seen through the eyes of the main characters. Her joy in the world around us is funny and beautiful. In a way that is a lazy movie for women Look, this is what you imagine as a relaxing nightlife movie. Buy this if you like the difference in the media world and the love that blends together (?)
