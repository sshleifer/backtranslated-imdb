... came to the Romeo department to change the paradigm. <br /> <br /> Let me say that I was blown away from this short film. I saw it randomly when I was in Boston at the film festival and I thank God for it every day since then. I really believe that I am part of the occurrence, such as reading the Tarantino script before others do or seeing Mean Streets's first screening. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if the short festival is heading. Still what Or what the creative team has for future products But I wish I could have it. <br /> <br /> Again, creating a truly amazing movie.
