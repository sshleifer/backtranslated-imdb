"A really good story with virtue about my love for brothers and sisters" explains David Lynch's film. This is a "strange" thing, especially because it's not a Lynch movie in the last 15-20 years. Those films are dark and shocking (Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, Mulholland Drive) and this is what contrast I know it makes his fans very disappointed. Others feel very pleased. Counting me as one of the last scenes and I own those three movies "dark" those. <br /> <br /> This is another real life story that should be. This is the details of the journey of the elderly man in the machine. Mow sitting from West of Iowa went to Wisconsin to see his sick brother, which he had not talked to for years. But want to see before dying I guess the evidence - an old man driving a 400-mile lawn mower - still making this movie "strange" strange. So Lynch still has a character in it! <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth has a role as the subject. He is a type of person with a clever face, low voice, clever personality that everyone likes. The wrinkles on his face tell many stories. It was very sad to hear what had happened to him in real life. One year after the film was released <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes of this movie were not as much and not as satisfying as the show. An adult character and a child with psychological problems (Sissy Spacek) and her tragic past But when Alvin Strait (Tentsworth) begins his journey, his story begins. I played this game with many friends and they think that this movie has never been used. But I am more generous with it I think it's a hidden gem. For them, it's a sleeping pill. <br /> <br /> I found his journey very interesting. But you must know in advance that this will not be Lynch's suspected crime. Slowly and if it's okay, you might be like this. The spell came into the picture. In some people, Alvin met on the way, like a girl ran away and a lovely young girl who helped the old man come out when he was in trouble (Henry Cada in the name "Daniel Riordan is great In that matter) Harry Dean Stanton received a third charge. But that was a joke: He only lasted a few minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> The Iowa scene was pleasant. I lived there for many years and were able to confirm it to the hills and fertile soil. Is a good state with good people .... like this movie
