Not to mention the best performance of Pierce Brosnon easily. Of course, Greg Kinnear is always great. In fact, when was he not really bad? I think this movie is underestimated by incredible truth! The use of color in this film is very different in the film world. Today, every movie has a blue payback filter. I like the way they use music from Asia as well. Prove that even what was once thought of as a kinda cheesecake can really cool it correctly. <br /> <br /> I created my first feature when this thing came out. Since that my movie is a popular movie, I have to check what kind of release it is. After seeing it, I'm sure it has affected me throughout the process. It's quite cool when my movie is on IMDb, which will suggest this movie. If you like my other people, how are you involved? I have no idea how to create more interesting coincidence. <br /> <br /> http: / /www.imdb.com/title/tt1337580/
