I gave A + for the movie's cheer! While Maria Ri's daughter Trish wrote in her mother's book that "If anyone can see Allah's garden in the context of a high camp!

The viewer who has read the story of Boyer toupee (it is still stuck in the heat) will laugh every time he appears. <br /> <br /> Ditch and Boyer rarely look at each other when giving a call - But they stared far away like a dream, presumably themselves, so their faces were able to shoot at the best angle and with the most advantageous light (If you perform in a turkey, it may look good!) Trish's costume leaves this world as Riva recorded in her book. Dietrich tried to steal Paramount's Travis Banton and let him design some sacred outfits like dresses.
