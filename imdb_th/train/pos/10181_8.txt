At first I bought this DVD because it has SRK and Aishwarya Rai on the cover and I think hey! Another movie starring Aishu and Shah Rukh. I know a little that Aishwarya will appear in the last quarter of this film in the songs she shared with SRK and helped introduce his character in the film in just 15 minutes Shakti is a movie about mother's love and patience. It is a film about changing folly, stepping into knowledge and embracing the cruel reality of life. The numbers that SRK and Aishu appear to have no connection to the movie. Actually it was a dream scene that occurred while SRK's drunken character was unconscious by drinking. He dreamed that Aishwarya Rai was this sexy street girl who appeared in a hangout place. He liked one day, dressed politely and began to persuade him. The song title is 'Ishq Kamina' (loosely translated as "Love's a bitch!") And it is just a hot cigarette! Do not miss
