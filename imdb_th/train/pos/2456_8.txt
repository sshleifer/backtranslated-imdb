When I go to watch this movie, my expectations are really low. But I was surprised. <br /> <br /> I thought I would watch a boring teen movie. But in truth, the plot is interesting and well performed, the acting is quite convincing and the fight scenes - for movies with low prices - do very well. <br /> <br /> I think the movie This deserves a wider audience than received. It's a movie that everyone in the family can see - probably not the smallest child because it has a rather rough scene. Movies about love and problems that may arise when you conflict with family traditions. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is like "Bend it like Beckham" but I think this movie pulls it out better.
