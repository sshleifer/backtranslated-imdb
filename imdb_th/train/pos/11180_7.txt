Making a movie as a movie by following the story one page at a time is something that shouldn't be done. When people read books, they will start to create "Mind Movies" automatically determines what the characters look like, the places they have, the progress of the situation. And the compositions of everyone's minds are different, which is why when the movie 'REAL' finally comes out, you have to have a segment that is ticked out by the audience who is watching the movie, which is disappointed that it doesn't measure up < br /> <br /> Every writer and director hopes to achieve, no matter what their vision is, and hopefully it will be as close to what the audience expects to see. /> <br /> There is no better case for this situation than the movie from Stephen King's novel. When the creator has captured his story at the very least, the results are amazing and truly scary (CARRIE, 'SALEM'S LOT, THE DEAD ZONE) or they may be something that fans think is a mess. (Kubrick SHINING version; miniseries for IT and TOMMYKNOCKERS) <br /> <br /> Although it is not close to adjusting to the perfect king, PET seminary has a lot of time to feel. Comfortable on the skin and deep bones that appear to be sparse on the screen directly from the book. You can forgive its shortcomings. For this, we have the director Mary Lambert, the movie that made the music video for thank you (she also directed SIESTA, not a horror movie). But it's a horror movie that must be watched. You should be on your list.) Work from the screenplay by 'Man-ster' himself and maybe one of his better roles. <br /> <br /> Because people Most know this, I will not make you sleep with too much detail. Dr. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) has moved his family to a perfect home in the country. Almost perfect, except for the nasty little details: roads, dangerous interstate highways and large pet cemeteries in the woods. Because Louis is a veterinarian and has a toddler for his son ... okay, even if you haven't read the book It is the story of the king, so there is no mystery to be headed. <br /> <br /> It is not the destination that counts here. But the deuce will stop along the way Some of the familiar scenes from this book bring life that shakes the screams here: Rachel Creed's (STAR ​​TREK'S Denise Crosby) The terrifying memories of her seriously ill sister. Louis faced a serious injury to jogger Victor Pascow (Brad Greenquist) before and after his death; Getting to the "other" cemetery located above the pet cemetery And the third action ... If it doesn't give a nightmare a few times, you might try to see your pulse. <br /> <br /> A good performance from here, especially Fred Gwynn. Good neighbor, Jud Crandall, who received the best line in the whole conclusion: "Sometimes death is better." <br /> <br /> About the only issue of the movie, the version is the cast of the son of Louis Gauges (Miko Hughes) knowing that it would be impossible to receive the desired performance from an old boy who would close the deal. Lambert and the team continued to try their best. And unfortunately Hugh at that time was too scary "sell" his intended role as an evil demonic zombie This will take you out of the movie every time he appears, even if the scenes that he is featured still staged expertly. (Especially the scene of the death of Gwynne) <br /> <br /> Other than that, everything else is as good as it has been. CARRIE continues to occupy the position of adjusting as best as I am concerned, but SEMATARY is there. In Top Five, <br /> <br /> There is still something that has been adapted from the screen of the King book that is scary like reading the story? Not likely ... now
