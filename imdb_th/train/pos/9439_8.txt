Before watching this movie, I heard a lot about this and some scenes in this movie. But listening isn't done for me, so I plan to watch and wow! Ned Betty, Ronnie Cox, Jon Voight and Bert Reynolds create a group of interesting people who fall into the Cahulawassee River and all the events that happened to them. Character development takes time to encapsulate the audience with a better understanding of each person. But in the end you know that these people are like they are your friends The acting dialogue is very true, as close to the reality that you will get from the Hollywood act. Reynolds "Lewis" characters are interesting as men who come out very hard. But under the manly veneer that is soft and broken (I'm impressed with his performance!) Jon Voight seems to be the most prominent character. The unfortunate situation that seems to meet him at every corner, forming and caste, makes him a different person at the end. Ned Betty and Ronnie Cox seem to be a silly story that likes to play gags and doesn't seem too serious unless they are too much and they do ... I was very surprised at the vision of Director Boorman was very impressed. You can't go to life if you don't watch this movie. I gave eight out of ten stars very impressive.
