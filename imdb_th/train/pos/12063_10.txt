The Woman in Black (1989) is a film adaptation of Susan Hill's modern classic ghost story, published earlier than this film a few years ago. Sadly, this movie has not been released on DVD and as far as I know it has been deleted in the VHS, its availability is contrary to the popularity among those who have knowledge of horror. The story revolves around events in the seaside community in the early 20th century, where his lawyer company was sent to summarize the affairs of a widow who had died recently. What he thought would be a routine and perhaps a boring job became a nightmare while he discovered that the old woman was haunted by her death and the ghost of her past was not satisfied. The story has been told in a delicate form. But tighten, never being a person to indulge themselves, being flashy or being a problem person Clearly obvious budgets may contribute to the method of absurdity. But it is what the story needs and why it works well It's something that you don't see as scared. Having said that, there is a special scary scene that requires pictures and it works perfectly. I watched this movie during the day and it still made me a nightmare almost a week later. If you love to be afraid, do what you have to hold and see a copy of The Woman In Black.
