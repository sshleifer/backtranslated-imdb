Another good 4 channels can be long before the time Interesting performances from Phil Davis and the rest of the actors, sexy, intelligent and funny. I remember watching it at that time, and even when asked around, no one really heard this But trying to find someone now that can remember that it is even more difficult. Maybe Channel 4 doesn't work well enough to hit the desired enthusiasm. Whether it is general public or interested in TV, vomiting is the big brother. I suspect that after downloading Garth Merengie's Dark Place was informed by Channel 4 to release the DVD of that series. Hope that this same thing will happen to North Square
