The One and only is a great movie I just finished watching EncoreW on DirecTV. I am a freelance wrestler and I think this is a good picture of life like a professional wrestler Now this movie was created 4 years before I was born. But I don't think the hardships of professional wrestling fighting will change a lot. Sad, funny and excellent !!! **** 10+
