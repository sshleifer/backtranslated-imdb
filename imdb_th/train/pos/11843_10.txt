Spirit: The Stallion of Cimarron is an excellent movie overall. The combination of the animation genre is unique, the story is amazing and the music is excellent. <br /> <br /> The animation that draws out is something special about animation. many How do they show characters, especially horses, through their animation? While the way in which the horse communicates with body language is easy to understand, small children and people who do not learn horses may not understand. Without any words, I would imagine that it must be challenging to convey those words through qualification. For this reason I understood the 'eyebrows' that were added to the horses. (While the real horse does not have those thick lines) One of the few things that I noticed about the horse habit that may show strangely is the spirit bringing the herd of cows. In the flock of wild horses, the male horse will often chase the colts out. <br /> <br /> In addition, while some people may think of drawing a white soldier while the 'bad guy' is a pattern, think that All movies in Which Native Americans received images like that Sometimes back then; They treat Mustangs very badly. For example, in real history, the Appaloosa species were almost eliminated because of the army officials. Imagine what would happen to one of the most beloved horse riders in the world if Native Americans didn't help them. <br /> <br /> I think it's amazing that the truth isn't right. Removed by making the horse talk to each other But mostly through music (By Brian Adams) The song shows the story very well, and Hans Zimmer and Bryan Adams do a great job in telling the story through melodies and lyrics. <br /> <br /> The mood that I get when watching. Movies, whether for the first time or the twentieth episode (Yes, I watched it a lot) You probably don't believe it. Some scenes of your breath take away while some scenes seem to tear into your eyes. The opening sequence, which shows the birthplace of the soul, enters you into an impressive action scene. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why some people hate this great movie. Overall, I rate 10/10 - it's something to watch out for.
