The comedy that has many pain and sadness succeeds in the place where most others fail. There are many movies in this genre that have more outstanding actors trying to succeed in a difficult mix that doesn't come close to the depth and agility of this movie. This is because of the great actors with outstanding performances by Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy. They look so natural that the reality of their characters attracts your attention and emotions quickly and captures them throughout the story. At first, the action seemed to be quite out of the wall and only people gradually realized that these poor people were pathetic people and had made a great effort to heal themselves even though they were not willing to go through each other. Rogers' facial expressions that were hurt by Sheedy's numbness and the angry outbursts were so sharp that he felt their observations. You will care for two lovely people. But deeply and hope that they will succeed because they have doubts and all hang in a light feeling Hopefully the audience will see Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy more because this movie proves their goodness as an undoubtedly successful actor.
