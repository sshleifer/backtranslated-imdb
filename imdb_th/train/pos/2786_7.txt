The thing that surprised me most about this movie is the audience that it attracts. Similar movies like Anita and Me have never caused an ad to be as true as this film, although I think it might be because of the mention of 'Beckham' in the name more than anything else. <br /> <br /> It's great. Movies that deliver great messages - what can you do if you are determined and pay attention to it, which is a positive message for everyone watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I think this is one. From the better movies of Keira Knightley and I think she is a great and wonderful actor for this role. Parminder Nagra is also great. Sadly, I couldn't say this to Jonathan Rhys-Meyers because I didn't think he was a very good actor and said in his eyes a little scary. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a movie. Excellent and a wonderful story
