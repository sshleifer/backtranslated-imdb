Here on IMDb.com I have read that Gray Owl is the best character of Pierce Brosnan that has been shown. I do not know if he has a better or worse role. I am not his girlfriend. But this one is really wonderful. <br /> <br /> Another thing - the impressive hand of the film director. I respect The peace, beauty and spirit of the wilderness were shown extensively. I have never seen such intimacy in any movies before. <br /> <br /> The other thing left in my mind. After the movie - this is the closest movie Original books and the atmosphere in it. <br /> <br /> And a little more I respect the original Gray Owl.
