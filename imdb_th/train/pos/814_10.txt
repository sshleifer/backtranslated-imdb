Thanks to Kevin Smith, a group of crazy people who ran away saying that the Return of the Jedi is not that good because it looks really fun and not! Fools participate! That makes it terrible! Everyone likes Return of the Jedi until someone in Kevin Smith's film shows a negative opinion about it. Now everyone, as soon as people look at you like you have some diseases, if you talk about how much you like it This movie is better than everything that Kevin Smith had thought of creating in my heart that the man would think it was condemned. This movie is fun! It's great as I remember when I was six years old! Enjoy this movie to stop Kevin Smith's comments! He's not right. <br /> <br /> And Ewok song at the end is ruling! I bet people don't enjoy "Ewoks: Battle for Endor" !!!! I will make you burn!
