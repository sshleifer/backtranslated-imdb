Viewing the Midnight Cowboy is like learning a Masterclass in acting / directing / filming / editing / writing. I'm still too young to watch since the first release and saw for the first time a couple of years ago. Come But it certainly passed the test and I have watched it many times since then. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is great from the fierce performances from Voight and Hoffman (although I know the movie. This story is good But I still find myself better every time Voight flashes his pure look or Hoffman coughs madly and ominously) to an amazing movie and a wonderful dream sequence. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that our contemporary filmmakers. Not ready to take risks in making movies that are interesting both visually and through the ears. There should be a midnight cowboy watching in every movie school. <br /> <br /> 10/10
