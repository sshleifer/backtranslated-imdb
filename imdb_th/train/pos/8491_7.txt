I saw this movie when it was new. Later, I rented it in Japan after staying here for three years, afraid that I would cringe when I watched in the intense light of my extended international experience. This film surprised me with the precision that depicts the cultural conflict between Japan and Pennsylvania. (Where I come from) Not everything that is true. But that sound is perfect. <br /> <br /> I still live in Japan many years later and I continue to enjoy this film for two aspects of treatment in an interesting story. Japanese-American speaks Japanese in the original But the conversation will be redubbed in the Japanese version to cover the problem of clear second language delivery. <br /> <br /> I noticed one reviewer used this in a Japanese class. I think you can learn more. About what to expect from encountering Japan by watching this movie by reading "serious" books on this subject (mostly written in the 80s and getting scholarships Companies from Japan) br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the drag caused by the critics, who found it impossible that Japan wants to build cars in the United States. (Of course, Japanese people work in many factories in order to be close to customers and to avoid trade friction.) This is a very warm and funny movie that I will give a higher rating because it's not just a few 80's Dancing around the wonderful electronic disco music Michael Keaton has never been more fun than before.
