This is the first movie that I saw Ashley Judd and Victor Nunez's first film I ever said and I'm glad I did. 'Its tranquility' is a relaxing step. 'The realistic image of a young woman who has just begun in life. It is a' great depiction of the struggle that she must pass to mark in life. Everything people find - there's nothing wrong with this movie. It's close to the movie magic, as I've seen outside of the movie "Star Wars" and because of those movies, that means that the movie deserves a high score. Ashley Judd's performance, Mr. Nuneen wrote and a simple story But its value makes this a memorable story and a great movie
