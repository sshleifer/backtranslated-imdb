I caught this film to test the screening. Was very surprised to find a sweet and fun story Acting well, Natasha Henstridge is Julia Roberts, the next person to lead a scary male. Very funny movie Happened in the best places in New York. Made me want to go there I just saw that "You received a letter" I think "It's your story" is a much better story The audience I agree, love it, clear instructions!
