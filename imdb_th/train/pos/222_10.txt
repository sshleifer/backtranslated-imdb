Neil Simon's hilarious comedy, which laughter from the beginning to the end, Walter Matthau, who passed away, is a former disgruntled comedian who was persuaded to join his former partner (George Burns, winner of the late Oscar ) For the final reunion on stage, <br /> <br /> Benjamin Martin is Matthau's representative and nephew, and both have as much chemistry as Matt and Burns. I love Matthau's bad-hearted character - he is always the same and still very different. <br /> <br /> Burns as an old man who lacks a joke like Matthau. <br /> < br /> Matthau: Need a cracker? I have coconuts, pineapples and graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: then a normal cracker. <br /> <br /> Matthau: I'm not normal. I got coconuts, pineapples and graham. <br /> <br /> Burning: OK. <br /> <br /> Matt: They are in the cupboard in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> Bur A: Maybe later. <br /> <br /> Or about this: <br /> <br /> Matthau: When I'm black, I know what I say! <br /> <br /> You have to see it in the movie to understand! <br /> <br /> All in this story, funny, hilarious, sweet, heart, warm, cute and cute with the heart and the most memorable words of all time. <br /> <br /> They just Don't make them like this anymore! During the time when the latest comedies are stupid and stupid young people, they return to the gentle core of funny things - funny characters, clever dialogue and funny and great entertainment. br /> <br /> One of the best friend comedies of all time there too "Aircraft, trains and cars" "Lethal Weapon" and "The Hard Way" <br /> <br /> You may have trouble finding this for Rent or watch TV But believe me, it will be worth your time. <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 5 stars <br /> <br /> - John Ulmer
