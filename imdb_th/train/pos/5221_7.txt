I was not very interested in watching The Flock.Andrew Lau co-directed the masterpiece of Infernal Affairs, but he was fired from The Flock and he was replaced by an emergency director named Niels Mueller. I felt Lau made a good movie. But was dissatisfied with education, so they fired and hired other directors who often did not work well (remember The Invasion) but The Flock gave better results than I expected Great movie But it is an interesting and fun thriller. Character development is very good and I can recognize the characters very well. In addition, the relationship between the two main characters is natural and reliable. Richard Guere And Claire Danes to go to one negative element that really bothered me (There was a time when it made me frustrated) was an excess of typing techniques to make the movie "attitude" and style more Their appearance is arbitrary. Plus, I think this movie is more ambitious. However, I recommend The Flock as a thriller. It's not memorable. But it was fun
