I have mixed feelings with "Les Valseuses" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier. When I started watching But i like it I will not call it rude. ("Stupid and stupid" is rude. "The most lovable thing" is both rude and foolish, unpredictable); I will call it shocking and disgusting. I can understand why many viewers, especially women, don't like or hate it. It is the best thing of hating women. (Or so it seems) and the way that the two antiheroes treat all women that they want to find seems to be impossible to describe But the more I think about it, the more I feel it becomes a delightful little gem. I am amazed that Blier can get rid of it. This movie is very entertaining and entertaining: it is well written, everyone's performance is first, and the song is sweet and sad. Actually, when I thought of it, two friends did good things for the women they met: they prepared women in the train (Brigitte Fossey, a cute and tame blonde who started her acting career. With one of the most impressive creeds in "Forbidden Game" of RenéClément (1952) at the age of 6) to meet her husband, whom she had never seen for two months They found a man who was finally able to receive a cold and pleasant Marie-Miou; They were enlightened and educated young and reluctant children. Isabelle Huppert (in her first screen appeared). The encounter with Jeanne Moreau elevated this level of humor. In short, I'm not sure I want to meet Jean-Claude of Gérard Depardieu and Pier Dewaere's Pierrot in real life and invite them to dinner. But I have a good time to watch movies and almost two hours flying - it's not boring.
