This movie is Halloween. "Christmas Story" is a joke for Christmas: both are low budget movies and there are no famous stars ... and both are the greatest and funniest movies of the two seasons, CLASSICS !!! "The distance of the invaders" comes with a warm and humorous beginning and a great actor of the character ... All five are funny. Martians, Klembecker the Realtor, Russell, Vice, Vern at "Pay Fuel "and much more! You have to watch this movie to believe and, like "Christmas Story", it just keeps getting better each time you watch and you will get a little fun each time !! Ten most determined !!!
