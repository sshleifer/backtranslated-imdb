Admittedly, I don't know anything about baseball. I'm not a fan of sports. But that didn't stop me enjoying the latest movies of the Farrelly Fever Pitch brothers, a respectable romantic comedy. This movie isn't really about baseball. Rather, it is about the relationship and emotional disconnection that often occurs. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Fallen? Give his best performance to date ?? Dao is Ben, a stupid teacher. Ben is a kind of boy who, unfortunately, never grew up before and he supports the addiction for the Red Sox baseball team, almost frantic. Ben devoted his life to the team and did everything from pilgrimage to Florida to spring training to finishing every inch of his apartment on the equipment team. <br /> <br /> Day One while studying honors geometry On a field trip to her office, Ben met Lindsey (Drew Barrymore, the wonderful). Lindsey is a professional girl and a company, but she has a cute feeling that Found that it was truly loved At first he was hesitant to ask her, thinking that she would leave his "class" and Lindsay didn't see a potential partner in Ben immediately. <br /> <br /> The first day of They started from a disastrous beginning when Lindsey was shocked with a serious case of food poisoning. And her resonant voice gives us the first clue that we are actually watching in the movie of the Farrell brothers Instead of accepting Lindsay - quite urgently - requesting a new schedule, Ben confiscated the nurse in an orderly manner and the janitor So Ben then scratched the toilet and the dog's teeth while his love was interested through the bucket beside her bed. <br /> <br /> When Lindsay woke up in the morning and found him asleep. On her sofa A time-consuming and appropriate process for dismantling the web of status, anxiety and ambition that she thinks is her standard. Soon they fell in love with Lindsay, admitting Ben's deep passion for his sport. <br /> <br /> Getting an alternative season ticket from his beloved uncle. Ben managed his life throughout the season. He never missed a game. But their relationship, which progressed without a hitch in the winter, affected the beginning of the season. <br /> <br /> Lindsay wants Ben to do other things like the day. Stop with parents and party with her friends, but Ben begins to have trouble adjusting his interest to meet Lindsay halfway. Lindsay can allow him to sacrifice for children in the summer so that their relationship can work? Can she support Ben's passion for sports? Can the Red Sox fan be serious and innocent find true love after all? Of course, Lindsey and Ben come with friends with a wide range of opinions. Lindsay's most strict friend, Robin, is thin, rich and blonde (KaDee Strickland) insists that there is something wrong with a man if he is single at 30. However, Sarah (Marissa Jaret Winokur) at With Skye curly hair) gives a more positive and positive view to Ben. <br /> <br /> Ben's peculiarity can be used with any fanatic fanatic while disappointing. Lindsay may represent women. Fallon is great when Ben shows the true potential of the big screen, overcoming the insignificant challenge to prevent Ben from being sympathetic while Barrymore has equally charming as a person. Lindsay's madness, especially when she struggles to get Ben because he doesn't see her needs. <br /> <br /> Fever Pitch actually works. The film also discusses the serious problems of addiction, sports and the difficulty of negotiating to negotiate this fragile land. <br /> <br /> This film was filmed at Fenway Par. C of boston Add a good sense of authenticity to the operation as well as the atmosphere of the game, although fully appreciated with what happens to the team may be limited to baseball aficionados. Even so, Fever Pitch received a funny and intelligent poem that even a new baseball fan could still meet. Mike Leonard September 05
