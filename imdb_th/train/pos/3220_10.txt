The military may not have academic performances or special effects of Lucas. But it certainly did for me I won't tell you what it's about. I'm sure you have read the summary. This is an action movie about the future / excellent science fiction anymore. Kurt Russell doesn't say much. He usually has a scary look or a drone But it is suitable for the character With action scenes and great fighting scenes Some scenes are unrealistic. But that makes Hollywood believe that the land that we should escape from our normal life I didn't see Soldier 2, but this one is one of my favorites. I'm lucky to have a wife who likes to dig out movies. Both of us love this movie and recommend to everyone who likes tough movies / sci-fi movies.
