A very courageous painting and part of the history of World War II that most of us in the United States had previously thought of. I like to have this in a video showing only on t.v once I know back in the 89 or 90. I've asked around for this movie and most video stores don't even know Excellent actress all over, hopefully I will see it again, top notch dress.
