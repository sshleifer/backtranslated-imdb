Lost in 60 seconds / (2000) *** (out of four) <br /> <br /> "disappeared in 60 seconds" is a powerful, slick, stylish action movie with high octane power And cars that look good. If you are an audience interested in cars produced by the manufacturer Jerry Bruckheimer ("Aircon" "The Rock") is something worth watching. To touch the vehicle, oily skin Although this film creates weakness in many ways, but the precise feelings of action and excitement make for an exciting, successful summer ride. <br /> <br /> The film starred. By Giovanni Ribisi ("The Mod Squad"), a young robber named Kip Raines, who was the film's launch, failed to deliver the many expensive cars to the powerful criminal Raymond Calyri (Christopher Eccles ton) When the life of the hoof is threatened for this reason, the brother named Randall "Memphis" Raines (Nicolas Cage), his brother, who is a good car thief But a retired skilled worker was called to work in exchange for his brother's survival: fifty steels. Model, color, year and just four days of action. <br /> <br /> Memphis paid the first three days of the selection of the robbers to help him in the robbery. The crew includes Sara "Sway" Wayland (Angelina Jolie), a deceased sexy detective. But teasing Memphis through his previous business, a friend named Mirror Man (TJ Cross), aged and wise, Otto Halliwell (Robert DuVall) as well as Tumbler (Scott Caan), Atley Jackson (Will Patton), Toby (William Lee Scott) and Donny Astricky (Chi McBrde) <br /> <br /> The participation in the drive and the tension of the film is a subplot involving two policemen, Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Drycoff. (Timothy Olyphant), who suspected that from his past experience that Memphis and his team Be good and keep an eye on them. <br /> <br /> There is not much time for character development here. The audience will get to know these people, even if they have a fierce lifestyle and have a difficult personality through hard core movies, stylish atmosphere. To make matters worse for the movie, the dialogue cannot determine the character with the cultural tone. I did not specify that I thought that vulgarity and vulgarity was necessary for thrillers. In fact, I respected the director's decision to keep from the vulgar language in movies that could easily rate R. I believe in movies such as "Gone in 60 Seconds" to improve the character's knowledge. The conversation must be reliable and genuine. <br /> <br /> In spite of problems The drama is powerful because leading actors responsible actor perfectly. Nicolas Cage's beautiful performances are intense and reliable. Angelina Jolie's unbelievable characteristics are perfect. Delroy Lindo is durable and reliable. Giovanni Ribisi, Scott Caan, Robert Duvall, Will Patton and Christopher Eccleston give a persuasive support role. <br /> <br /> This story has a standard structure with satisfying first actions that describe the character and motivation of the characters. Define the theme of fast action. But lacking depth and introducing strong characters In the second scene, we found a few more problems: this story wasted time during this segment, never creating the third scene. While the film in the middle takes a long time and the sex scene gives a stable central plot The third scene is an adrenaline scene filled with the excitement and excitement of chasing the most intense car ever. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of the movie "Gone in 60 Seconds" dealt with the action scenes. Inspiring action It is a scene similar to a car chase that makes this movie work despite many shortcomings. Dominic Sena, whose career mainly consists of advertising, has an attractive style and decisive attitude in "Gone in 60 Seconds", which will give the audience excitement, excitement and excitement for two hours but not much. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
