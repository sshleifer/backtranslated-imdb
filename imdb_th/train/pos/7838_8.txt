If you are a T-Rex / Marc Bolan fan, I suggest you take a look. It shows the strange side of Marc Bolan and Ringo Starr, which obviously has a very good time in filming scenes that are not part of the concert. But enjoy watching, make you know Just people and when the concert shows talented musicians, both playful and professional, will shake the industry and seem to impress the girls who scream watching him in concert. You will never know how As a rock star is a job But just having a great time playing great music with good friends like Elton John and Ringo Starr that appeared in live performances Actually, there are some missing songs that I want to see there. But like any album that doesn't have everything I just bought it in 2006, but if I knew it came out in 1972, I had to buy it for many years. Sad and strange, people with many songs about love in his car will never learn to drive and will die in a car crash!
