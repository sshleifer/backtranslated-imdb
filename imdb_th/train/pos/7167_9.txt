I can't comment after reading the short description. "Not bad." This movie is better, not bad. The protagonist is even from a child in a drama that doesn't play cute or else but acts like a friend of my son. This film is clever and expects viewers to be as well. Double reverse story lines are creative and contribute to the story rather than fulfill the time. I watched this movie with my children. Then I watched myself again a few days later. If you have children and die from the movie that inspired the diabetic patients with the sweetness of the syrup, I am 6 years old. Enjoy it as much as 11 years old and my husband and I enjoy it as much Two People How many movies can you talk about?
