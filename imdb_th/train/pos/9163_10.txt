When my school-age daughter was in kindergarten, this drama appeared on the A&E program from 8-9 every morning. My neighbor and I made an agreement that we wouldn't miss one minute of Jane Eyre and our children. Come late before school every morning throughout the week. Good choice. <br /> <br /> I forgot how much I liked this movie until I received my old VHS copy. Timothy Dalton is very handsome. But still perfect like Rochester The dark and harsh face, vile behavior, good mood, humor and tenderness in front of the book page Although Dalton had eaten a small meal, but I couldn't sit through the adaptation starring William Hewitt or Villa Ciaran Hinds, who was not happy with the miracle. <br /> <br /> I want to know how Zelah Clarke is. She died as a quiet, informal, but shimmering eye in her eyes. See The strong and lively nature, which allows Jane survived the abuse she faced in his youth. The criticism of her performance as "wood" is misplaced by the proper English household servant to maintain behavior. But she spoke with love when overcome with emotion Unlike other Janes screens, she looks simple enough to be Jane, but it's beautiful enough for the audience to buy Rochester's attraction to her. <br /> <br /> Bronte's conversation is a big part of The reason this book is durable Its the same Dalton and Clarke capture the interaction between Jane and Rochester with intelligence and tranquility. Although Jane looks simple and sweet like vanilla custard But she refused to be roasted by darkness Both bring to play beautifully. <br /> <br /> This is the most perfect adaptation of the best love novel ever.
