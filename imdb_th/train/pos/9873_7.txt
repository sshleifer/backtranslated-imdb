Lily Mars, a young girl who lives in Indiana, dreams to make it a big story on Broadway and her inspiration has been raised when John Thornway, the successful Broadway creator, comes back. His hometown for a visit Lily tries to do everything he can to make Thornway notice her. But he was frustrated with her comedy when Thornway returned to New York to perform a Lily show. (I don't know John, of course.) And in the end, Thornway made her a small role in her next performance, just to benefit her family. Girls and romantic flowers, which make Isabel Rekay the leading woman of jealous performances. When Isabel was tired of John-Lily's love, causing friction with the performance, she set off and John decided to make Lily a star. Returning from Isabel later, and Thornway is forced to say that she will return to play her little role in the drama, which may be harmful to love. A very charming movie and a refreshing change to see Garland make her comedy play a role. (Lady Macbeth's reading, while she should have a sense of humor, not threatening her singing career) I like Helfin's character. Lily instead of a romantic person This movie has to be quite difficult to predict, and the scenes are not assembled together. But is a very fun movie, ranked # 7
