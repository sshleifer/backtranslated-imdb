I am glad to hear the rumors that finally there may be a DVD release. When that happens, I don't know. But I'll grab it when it is released. <br /> <br /> According to my humble opinion, this is Errol Flynn's most entertaining movie, especially when the ring "Gentleman Jim" Corbett started in the movie Then started from a good movie to a great movie. <br /> <br /> There are a few people who can play the arrogant men and still come out as good people as cute as you. Lynn and this film are perfect examples. This news is Flynn's favorite role and I believe You can experience the fun he has here. Ward Bourne seems to have enjoyed playing the famous John L. Sullivan. Bond himself was never better than <br /> <br /> the right amount of boxing action, and they did well as well. Corbett's family is also a remarkable person because they still stand during Jim's competition. The constant controversy and shouting of the Corbett family caused a bit of noise and annoyance. But they set the stage to find the right conclusion. <br /> <br /> And when talking about the conclusion of Sullivan's words to the big Corbett The battle is impressive and is the highlight of this film. Some critics have an average courage. Do not like the ending and the fact that most movies are fictional, but - duh - most movies are fictitious, whether or not they like it. And in this case it makes a good story and a good ending (In real life, Corbett is a gentleman who speaks softly, unlike Flynn's image. But Flynn also made him a good man) <br /> <br /> This is one of the more entertaining classic movies I have. I've watched and I'm waiting for the DVD enthusiastically.
