Another detailed work by Dr Dwivedi takes us back in time to find the pre-prepared Panjab. Dr Dwivedi chose a difficult subject for his film debut. He worked in a meticulous detail to bring the story to life. The treatment is very delicate. <br /> <br /> Even though we have never been to the region at that time, the dress and costume look realistic. Unlike most movies made in partitions, this movie does not focus on the full details of the violence to attract viewers. The characters come to life. Priyanshu Chatterjee has impressive results. Manoj Bajpai shows merciless thoughts. The rest of the actors did well as well.
