The only thing about this movie that made me disappointed is that the DVD is very expensive. It's too much for my budget now or I will buy it because the film is a good example of Film Noir ... and I enjoy. See Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter. <br /> <br /> Good DVD production criteria. But sometimes the asking price is a little This is the case for a good 80 minute mono mono movie, but there is nothing special that is smart to shoot movies. <br /> <br /> The story is the story here. (As opposed to the actor's image), voice, set, etc.) as a pickpocket (Widmark) unintentionally, along with a microfilm of intelligence in his possession after stealing Peters's purse (Say that three times!) Everyone, but Peters is a convincing character in this movie: Widmark, cops, representatives in the United States and Communists, and especially Ritter as "Moe" who gave her information and Widmark is The stars of this movie <br /> <br /> Peters acted well in playing cheap dirty girls. But lost her credibility in the beginning by "falling in love" with Widmark in her first meeting. Only in the movie world !! Unfortunately, because of the ridiculous love, part of the story is taken away from this story. <br /> <br /> This noir movie, which means good. But not good and not worth the ownership for $ 25 - $ 35. For that price, we can do much better in the film noir market.
