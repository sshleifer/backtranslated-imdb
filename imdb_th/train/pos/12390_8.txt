A strange horror movie filled with famous faces. But stolen by Cristina Raines (later from "Flamingo Road" of the TV) as a cute model But quite unpredictable with a sticky smile that determines to pay suicide trying to protect the gateway! The scene with Rain's modeling was very well captured. The music, the perfect mood, Deborah Raffin is as charming as Christina's friend. But when Raines moved into Brownstone, Brooklyn, an eerie creepy. Neighbors include the miraculous Burgess Meredith and Sylvia Miles and Beverly Dong, Angelo is a brutal and Eli Wallach is a crafty police detective. The movie is almost a mix of "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Exorcist" - but it's a combination! From the best seller by Jeffrey Connitz, "The Sentinel" is a shocking joke by director Michael Winner, who is skilled in the skills *** 1/2 from ***
