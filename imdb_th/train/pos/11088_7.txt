villian in this film is one means of crying and he seems to enjoy what he does. That's what I think makes him mean. I don't think most men will like this movie, especially if they've cheated on their wives. This is one of the movies that is quite beautiful, meaning the end. But then you have the end of the candy bar that makes me look back and say "HOKIE AS HELL". The end is the end that we want to see. But not the end of the average start And after that there was something going on Think you can decide about the true ending. I felt that only one character would survive at the end.
