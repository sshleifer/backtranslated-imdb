The movie "Cross Eyed" by Adam Jones drives the audience with redemption because the main character controls the rotation of the wheel and makes his life a mess. Adam Jones discovered a creative and vibrant way to strengthen his personality and make the most important thing come true. These truths are evident in both the characters and the audience as you laugh and gag with them. Simple but charming settings Set you to guess about what you will see next. You can't help but smile and laugh with the comedy that happened in this movie. I can't wait for his second year's effort. It's just a matter of time before Jones strikes again. Cheers!
