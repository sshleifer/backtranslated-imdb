This is a great new crime series that brings three old skeletons of British television. (Denis Petersman, James Bolum and Alan Armstrong) as a retired detective brought back to help clear the old case. Three quirky and frustrated policemen created a great team using The detection of twenty years in the police force that has been in operation for a long time since then has sometimes been effective at other times with the horror of senior officials. All three images are sympathetic to warts and all. There are beautiful cartoon scenes and some very moving scenes when all three scenes have to end with old and former heritage. <br /> <br /> At the end of the first six series (we promise to There are additional series next year) Each character was developed. Widower James Bolam could not be satisfied with the untimely death of his wife, Lothario Denis Waterman, learning to accept his role as a grandfather. And even though Alan Armstrong will be rescued by his new friend to fight his past demons - and continue to take medicine! While Amanda Redman faced a very familiar conflict between life and career. The story is quite interesting, depending on the magic of DNA testing. But it is a joint work of the four best performers in the UK
