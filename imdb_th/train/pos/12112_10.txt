The location of this anime series is about the bread of everything that will plot the story! I really laugh The main character has a special power in making bread that he was born while going out to study at the bread making school. I hope it will be on the DVD and it doesn't matter if it has a subtitle or dubbed - it's great. Even the accompanying song is a joke. At one point in the song, there was an African-Japanese man who had an African horse on a horse holding a French basketball like a samurai sword. These images are not reasonable if you don't see anime. You will laugh until sore. Of course, it's the most unique anime I've ever seen.
