I just saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2001. The name of the work there is 'Dog Days'. The reaction of the audience, some people find that sexual intercourse with graphics and violence is too realistic for them. Other people seem to truly appreciate how good this movie is. <br /> <br /> This film is not for impatient people. It's like 'happy' with sex. Clear and less optimistic about humanity There is a poison from the animal, teasing from the elders, bathing of the orgy'esque 'in the shopping center, piercing the bottom candles and attacking the incompetent mind. <br /> <br /> Too much to be dealt with. You This film shows that humanity is the most hopeless and pathetic person. The stubbornness of our existence is driven on our faces with great joy. <br /> <br /> Seidl has no interest in redeeming humanity here. And why should he? This film has excellent performances from everyone involved, interesting and probably the smartest social statement to make a movie for a while.
