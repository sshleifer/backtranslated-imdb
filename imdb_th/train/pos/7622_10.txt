I love this show! It's like watching a short movie each week !!! The first episode is amazing and very scary ... so the 2nd episode of the pilot ... I'll continue to perform this show! This is a true survivor! I've watched other reviews and I can see that after only one or two episodes, morons here are crying wolves ... Sorry if it's not a reality show. Once there ... now brace yourself! Real TV shows! And this one is really good, unlike the worst sitcoms today or copies of Law & Order or NYPD Blue or CSI that they're going out Don't take one from the head bone here!
