This movie is as good as the hero of this film. (And writer and director) is Simon Geist - the man "with the agenda". He created a fake magazine to have power to interview Los Angeles pigs - actors, models, musicians - who believe Their defecation does not smell. With a clever dialog box, Zucovic succeeded in doing this. Of course, the budget for this movie is probably what he paid for a second-hand car. But this movie is strong and can be written very well that it works very well Anyone who can repeat the 'The Scream' of Edward Munk again in the reflection of the silver trash that the local coffee shop should be nominated for certain types of awards Give a chance to this film and listen to what is said ... because they made the same car since 1986 ... It's called 'car' Bravo, Zucovic, bravo!
