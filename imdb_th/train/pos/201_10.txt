Marion Davies, the great and humble, shows her story in the last comedy (1928), which shows William Haines the best. Davies plays home in addition to Georgia, which falls in Hollywood with the help of Haines. They appeared in cheap comedies until Marian "discovered" and became a big stage actor. The great Lamphun in Hollywood and the claims Davies & Haines is a great team. (Terrible that they never talked together) and invited guests from Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn and Marion Davies for it) as a hoot is necessary. For a serious movie or for anyone who is interested in the insidious Marion Davies!
