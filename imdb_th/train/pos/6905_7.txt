I think Mr. Dreyfuss is perfect for his role as an actor and dictator. His co-star, Mr. Julia, has an equally perfect role. It is interesting to see how Richard Dreyfuss was reluctant to replace the dictatorship with his needs. But he was confident and comfortable with the role over time Because everything happened for a reason in life, I believe he was forced to replace the dictator because he intended to stay there all the years he had done. I guess he will live because he should see how good his life is compared to the poverty he saw in Parador. I think he uses too many things to give up in life and he needs to be seriously examined in that country for as long as he does. ....... .. Anyway ........... This is the reason I gave this movie with 7 out of 10
