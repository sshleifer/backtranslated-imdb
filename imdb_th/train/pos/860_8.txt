Audiard makes this a very interesting movie. It begins with an explanation of a deaf girl, almost a man in the universe who works as a secretary. She was ignored, discouraged, denied ... Hiring a trainee as an assistant seems to be a way for her to meet someone in her life: both of them were rejected by society. The description of the character is profound, with details ... Both start to help each other. For her to be able to read on the lips, which shows that she is very useful for him ... She will gradually develop far from what she is for the first time. All of them are very reliable, even if they become film noir at the end. The gesture is particularly beautiful in the filming of Audiard Emmanuelle. Devos should be nominated for the Best Actess Cesar Awards for her performance. Action at the end of the movie prevents it from being a simple "etude de moeurs". Actually, it's surprisingly entertaining: 8/10
