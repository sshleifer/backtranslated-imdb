Beautiful and memorable, an atmosphere that is inviting and intelligent. <br /> <br /> I can't understand what kind of people are showing this masterpiece.> <br /> This, together with Grapes of Wrath is John Ford's greatest movie. I will say that Long Voyage Home is next, even if it is rather back. <br /> <br /> Score: 10. It deserves 12
