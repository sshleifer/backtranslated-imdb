If you want to watch movies and feel good about watching Tigerland, it's the movie for you. I love this movie from top to bottom. The perfect scene of this movie looks very realistic. It's almost a documentary of what happened in real life, but with the drama, I told you that ... the real drama, they "really fight" in one of the scenes. (Let the DVD hear the comment. It is not clear.) I saw that this movie is a group of desperate young men trying to escape the unfortunate fate. After watching Saving Private Ryan, I appreciate what "Unfortunate fate" is and knows how men in the movie feel. I see that this movie is the blood line between "Stand By Me" and "Saving Private Ryan". What do men do when they are in a "difficult situation?" "In real life, some men are crazy about some men shouting. Some people use drugs. Some people sleep brutally with prostitutes mercilessly trying to get rid of the meaning of love from their lives. Try to drink some pain, jump from building or bridge. Feeling guilty and others feel very painful. It makes them sick until collapsing - the body. The film has those desperate feelings coming together as one child. But don't understand me wrong, it's not a depressing movie. But it's true. It's a very humorous movie. Bozz (Collin's character) is funny and bright, and above all there are about 5 female actors in the movie; I'll let you figure out what's in! With dialogue, sequence, war / action, perfect scenes with appropriate songs This movie has everything I say: from top to bottom, I can't. Why doesn't Tigerland get enough credit? The best thing about owning a movie is on the cover that is mentioned in the big bold writing. "The best movie of the year" and it's nothing short. Collect rare gems. Come to Hollywood, 10/10.
