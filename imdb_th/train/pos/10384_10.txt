Almost 30 years later, I remember this original PBS movie so gentle and almost unbearable. I checked at IMD here periodically, hoping that someone would have a good feeling to buy the rights and put it on the DVD. It was September of 2004, and I was hoping to take a deep breath. <br /> <br /> One of the two actors led to a small career, starting with the best evening soap. While Frances Lee McCain saw a small role here and there for a few years But there is nothing they did before or after matching this little movie produced as I can remember in the short-lived PBS series, which shows the original screenplay by the upcoming new drama < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I watch it every time it shows on PBS, maybe 2 or 3 times. That is before the age of the VCR, so I don't have a record except in my opinion. <br /> <br /> 12/31/2006 Also: Happy New Year Ladies! Finally, this great movie is available on DVDs at ladyslipper.org My understanding is that the DVD is burned from the writer's personal copy.
