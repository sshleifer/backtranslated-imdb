I will give you a complete series of ratings for outstanding and consistently high quality stories and character development, if not the last episode of Season 10! <br /> <br /> The last episode of the season 10 "Unending" that (it will appear for sure) Asgard is killed by haste, unbelievable and not very ceremonial, causing me to believe! <br /> <br /> From the end of the series, it was clear that at first, most of the stories were scheduled for at least one season. I guess they will accelerate these stories quickly to place the Stargate SG-1 franchise for direct movement towards the upcoming DVD. <br /> <br /> Unless Asgard is back in the movie SG-1 in the future (a very good explanation of the extinction "clear") I think fans are cheating with the removal of bad ends! <br /> <br /> It's not good for a great sci-fi series.
