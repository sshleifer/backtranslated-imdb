If the script writer and director intended to open his mind to the movie as a musician who wanted to make his music, they were successful with me. The situation of ordinary human beings becomes original, personal and immediate so that I can experience each situation. I believe that I will give credit to the power of music, as well as the perspective of the person who wrote this movie. I can say that I am very impressed with the way of life of movies. Haven't really cried out of happiness? empathy? Deep emotions? In a very long time, I like to find ways to show others to see it at the Seattle International Film Festival.
