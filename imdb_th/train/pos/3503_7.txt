If you still remember that summer, when you had your first kiss, the first male / girlfriend, or the first puppy to jump ... this movie is for you! OK, so this movie will and will not win the BUT Academy Award as a Dominican. I love it ... There is something in the movie that may go your head if you are not part of the culture ... Children raise. By the grandmother, both father and mother, the youngest son, was raised and bathed with canned coffee Batelo (Dominican Soho!) Judy is threatened by people in the neighborhood, going to church and lit candles, praying ... sparkling movies. In those small details, it is true that it does not pull out all the film work. But it does not mean that it is NOR because it is an educational tool for those who want to learn about Latin culture (TIP: find new friends instead). Faux leather is bitter and bitter than ever. This movie makes it true Without being too serious in the tradition of "Y Tu Mama Tambien". This is just a story of a boy coming up. I recommend (especialmente si eres Dominicano!) = O)
