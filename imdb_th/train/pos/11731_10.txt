I think this movie is very fun and horror. I love Elvira and I like this movie. It is a shame that the second part of the film was not successful because it was funny as at the beginning. I am sorry that in addition to this movie I have never seen Cassandra Peterson in other films. I think she is a great actress with high potential ... I hope II will see you in the future In the third part of Elvira's adventure, Cassandra Peterson is one of my favorite comedians. Cassandra If you read this, know that you are the best and my heart will be with you. You can rely on me What can I add more? This is a cool and classic movie!
