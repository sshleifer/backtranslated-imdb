This movie didn't surprise me. It was really better. I thought: "Paul Rieser wrote this thing, right? Well ... we can see how he did ..." Then I saw Peter Falk In there I was very appreciative of Colombo Although I have never been a big fan of acting But I always like Peter Falk. <br /> <br /> Peter and Paul's performances are so natural that I feel like flying on the wall. They played so well that I felt dizzy with enjoyment! ... and I didn't drink too. <br /> <br /> This movie was so good that I wanted to get a phone call from Paul and let him know how much I enjoyed it! But I didn't find his number Must not be on the list or something. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies that I don't know what it's going to be about or in there or what. It just came and I thought: "Eh, why don't you look at it if I don't like it - I don't have to watch ..." ... and I ended up loving it!
