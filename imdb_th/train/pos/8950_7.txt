For people you are not familiar with, Jimmy Stewart is one of his "lesbian" movies in his career. And while it is not a great movie compared to many of his other images, it is not bad and is the right time - but not much. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak is a witch In New York City and for some reason that can not be explained, she decided to cast a poor Jimmy spell so that he fell in love with her. Over time, Novak, who is cold and unmarried, begins to fall in love with Stewart - and is clearly seen in the book of the witch's law. This story is strange in terms of feelings about witches. They are not a sacrifice or a powerful variety. Most of their magic is quite limited and pointless (like Jack Lemmon using his power to turn off the street lights) and very strange. Every witch seems to be a Bohemia who travels in bars that you may find People wearing berets and listening to crappy jazz Considering what I thought about jazz, it had to be a foul smell in the world of this movie. <br /> <br /> However, this movie is quite romantic and funny. But not what I would hurry to see The performance is quite good. But the script doesn't give enough rewards to make this movie really special. In fact, I almost got a score of 6 - it's really close.
