Clark Gables plays the fraud that invaded the life of Jean Harlow, a boiled father. He tried to suck her while she brushed him with her difficult attitude. Despite their cynicism and disadvantages, they fell in love. When Gable accidentally killed a man when he was bitten, Harlow was loyal to the woman's prison where she discovered that she was pregnant with Anita Loos' and Howard Emmett Rogers was an excellent writer forever. Many interesting and dramatic plays (Including female inmates, Jewish socialists and black female inmates Gable and Harlow show their courage as an actor that increases the differences and quirks of their characters that send them far more than the roles of Gable and Harlow in general. And that direction is better than you expect from Sam Wood One beautiful shot was that Harlow was taken prisoner and brought out to a surprisingly snowy snow yard while the camera was following her. This is one of the best of both. "Criminals in love" and "women's prison" and have the best dialogue ever written
