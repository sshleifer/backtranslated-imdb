I think this is a lovely family movie. There are many hilarious scenes and warm moments in the movie. Great actors and effects do well. Danny Glover plays George Knox, who oversees the wonderful and brilliant 'The Angels' baseball team throughout the story. A great young actor like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd is as good as Al 'The Angel' and the effects that Great in this Disney movie. An impressive and heartwarming movie that everyone should receive.
