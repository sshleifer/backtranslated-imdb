The home room really surprised me. When compared to other movies written about Columbine High School, this story is the best. The home room does not show school shooting. But as a consequence and impact of communities and cities The movie focuses on the two opposite characters, Alecia (Busy Phillips) and Deanna (Erika Christensen). Alecia is the evicted person who sees all the shooting She doesn't seem to express emotions about this. Deanna is a popular girl and the only victim to survive. Alecia is forced to visit Deanna at the hospital to receive a degree. At the same time, the police are investigating Alecia because she knows that the shooting will take place. Alecia and Deanna are very different and are not compatible at first. Eventually they develop mutual understanding and become friends. (Very much in the style of the breakfast club). The home room shows the power of intimacy and chaos after school shooting. I would like to recommend this movie to everyone and everyone.
