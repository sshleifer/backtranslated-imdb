The story of Bagdad's thieves (as had been spelled) attracted the filmmakers from Raoul Walsh in 1924, starring Douglas Fairbanks for the first time, silencing the actions of "Thief of Bagdad" to try less and more. However, the best thing is still a version of the 1940s, which at that time was a high quality special technique. Those effects still remain charming. <br /> <br /> There are no less than six directors at the Calgary movie show, starring Sabu as the bandit boy Abu, John Justin. As a loving king While the lovely princess sought by Ahmad and followed the evil vizier Yaffah, played by the evil Conrad Vedt The giant devil was done by Rex Ingram with ability. <br /> <br /> Ahmad was jailed for treason by Jaffa and when captured by the devil who betrayed him and the boy Abu experienced Clearly incompetent fate Ahmad became blind and Abu became a cute person. Their adventures are through fun decorated Hollywood backlots. But the special technique makes this film work. <br /> <br /> Two men are responsible for everything, from the magic carpet flying to the enormous Jeanie that emerges from the bottle. Black storms like tornadoes: Lawrence W. Butler and Tom Howard (Howard made a special effect for this film in 1961. Both have a long and distinguished career in magic techniques) < br>> <br /> The amazingly cute Duprez, Justin's romantic project Ahmad. But driven by a dream that is untouched by sexual stimulation. Sabu is a real central actor in many scenes and he is very good. For movies, meaning for children and adults with violence But without blood Still, I don't think anyone under the age of eight should see "Thief of Bagdad". <br /> <br /> This movie makes it appear on TV. But today my teenage son and I saw it in a theater with a few children. It was great to see the children surrounded by computers in a wealthy community responding with cheers and applause for F. Special effects that must be viewed as a basis for them. <br /> <br /> "Thief of Bagdad" is a war when strong production values ​​often result in interesting and important emissions. This is one of the best categories. <br /> <br /> 9/10
