When American writer Edgar Allan Poe visited London, he was contacted by British journalist Alan Foster, who became the target of a strange bet. Do not believe Poe's assertion that all his scary stories are based on real experiences. Foster accepts bets from Pau and his friends, Thomas Blackwood, that he cannot spend all his time. In the Blackwood's haunted castle Once installed in an abandoned deserted castle, Foster discovers that he is not alone, as he is contacted by beautiful women and handsome men and doctor-metaphysics. Who explains that they are the wandering spirits. Will tell the story of the devil Their death anniversary! The first time I watched this glorious classic horror, I was enjoying all the time. I found the movie truly creepy and at the same time sad. Babs Steele is undeniably beautiful. Music scores make the atmosphere twice as much as fear. The naked scene made me circle in circles because I didn't expect. It seems that Synapse works great with image enhancement because this movie looks good for its age and is an Uncut International version to boot. This is a movie that is responsible for me starting to collect Babs Steele and Klaus Kinski.
