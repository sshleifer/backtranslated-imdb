In my opinion, this is a good example of a movie that would be better if it was shorter than 10 years ago. I wonder if it will benefit from modern technology. But it will look better if it takes at least 90 minutes instead of 70 minutes. <br /> <br /> Artists and animated movies work very well. In my opinion, this movie has the best background art and one of the best character designs. The animation is very smooth and realistic. At the time of the movie you believe in the world you see, so everyone works well. It can also show off the sexiest female animated characters, if not the sexiest, that beets can be easily drawn. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are some bad couples about this movie that will Can't make it Interesting now First of all, the plot and operation are comparable to contemporary and outdated adventure movies with modern standards. Secondly, because the duration will benefit a lot from the conversation for 20 minutes. Finally, the settings are not popular at this time. Conclusion: A good choice for another short story about Conan the Barbarian but not a novel.
