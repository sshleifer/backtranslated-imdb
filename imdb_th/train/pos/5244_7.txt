"The Ladies Man" is a common problem among the movies "Saturday Night Live" skits and that is the body that usually succeeds in five minutes, will not do that in ninety minutes. Although this movie will have a laugh like Tim Meadows as Leon Phelps, straightforward sex from the 70s and Will Ferrell as a wrestling husband with Leon. So this movie is funny, but it's not "Wayne's World"!
