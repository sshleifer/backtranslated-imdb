Sorry to say that I don't know what Hollywood is doing. Of course, for movies like Batman Begins. Oh, by the way Hollywood, I think they might cover the story in the Batman movie. But please do not entertain us with what we want to see Batman and Superman together. I hate it a lot because it makes me want more. I look around to see when it will come out. It's a terrible joke in practice. The graphics with good storyline, stable look, and everything from excellent movies Unfortunately, this has not happened yet. For all producers, directors and actors, it is very good. But i hate you who do this for me You left me wanting more
