I'm always a big fan of "Homicide: Life On The Street", so when I hear that there is a movie about reunion coming, I can't wait. <br /> <br /> Let me just say I'm not disappointed It's one of the two most powerful hours of television I've ever seen. It's good to see everyone back again. But everyone's greatest happiness is to get Andre Braugher back because the relationship between Pembleton and Bayliss is the strongest part of the greatest performance.
