No matter what you happen in your life, you must not forget that you have roots. This is the story of the true facts that create a beautiful and moving movie! I dare to say that this movie has been well underrated. This shows us the reality of life ... The more evil surrounds you, the better you will be ... without Indignation without life "under the rock" The movie concept is more interesting ... Linking storytelling and real-life events ... makes us realize everything .. from facts to ! Bless these people and make everyone happy! See, I advise all young people that it's not about racism. It's about how you live your life!
