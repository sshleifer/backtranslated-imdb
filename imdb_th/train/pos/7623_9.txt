While hesitant to jump on the bandwagon of "Lost" at first, I accidentally caught one episode at the beginning of Season 1 with the polar bear and it didn't receive attention since then. That show is Not a polar bear So be patient (heh) with me while I play as many semi-conversations as I can. <br /> <br /> "Get lost" Use simple ideas about the full flight. With people colliding with the desert Island and gradually add extra depth to its location by exploring each character profoundly and unflinchingly, what drives them, who they are? Where do they come from It soon became apparent that the island in which they were stuck served as a common denominator for many things in life, whether they ran away from something. (Saw and Kate, among others) or contact with the soul (Locke Clare). But "lost" extends into the island by himself and the mysterious horror that it exists ... and them All seem to be strangely interconnected. <br /> <br /> While television actors are certainly not known for being delicate or dazzling. The ability to perform most of the actors of "Lost" is a beautiful actor in their part, showing their hearts and humor in their performances. In addition, there are many eyecandy, but generally not Hollywood-type plastic like most TV programs. Every character feels very real and they look very interesting. Their interactions rarely fall prey for rational predictions, little arguments, or magical stories. (Although they are annoying secrets) ?? These people are the first and most important people who try to survive and any relationships that appear will be treated secondary to actions. The realism of these characters facilitates the plot of the carving well. <br /> <br /> About this plot ... Imagine a tree that is plotted. The template then branched into subtypes. (In this case, one branch for every character) ?? Loses add branches in each branch and those small branches are other story lines. If you are the brother / sister of one of the main characters in the incident, you will receive your own story. If you are a dog, you will have your own story. If the writer cannot continue to join them all together as a climax at the end, they will set themselves. I'm a little more worried that there will be a disappointing elimination while I'm sure most people are <br /> <br /> But suppose the writer pulls this out. "Lost" may be possible. The best show ever on TV. <br /> <br /> 9/10
