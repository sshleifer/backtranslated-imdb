The CAT SOUP has two "Hello Kitty" kittens - kitten types. Embark on a strange journey through the afterlife that everything can happen and do. This short-hearted Asian does not use the box to return words instead. There is no way to explain this degenerate cartoon unless you tell it to yourself. And make sure that no one under 10 years old is in the room, losing organs and eating meat and cruelty and cruelty, and sudden death and disregard for others is a common issue. The most memorable image is an elephant that consists of water that the kitten swims through and enters and rides. But like everything else in this movie, in fact, the strange interlude soon came to a horrible end.
