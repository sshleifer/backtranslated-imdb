Looks amazing But not firmly at Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie), the first aunt and cousin of Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis. city It is quite clear that these two are unusual in the past. It seems that Edie is the least person to make the most money when she is ten years old, although she is 53 years old, but the content consists of two things. The first one is the conversation that Little Edie shoots Big Edie to expel her potential spouse and destroy her career as a writer, actor and dancer. These conversations often become rhetorical, rhetorical and often fun. The second part consists of long singing attempts of both parties. Of course, each person thinks that their singing is perfect and just another song that sounds bad. In one dramatic scene, Big Edie attacks Littleie physically with her staff, just to let her stop making her warp. Very cute, but there is a feeling that they have serious exploitation here. The filmmakers seem to treat this as a strange show at the circus every day to record. (And chuckles) what strange behavior might occur In the end, this is a sad picture because it shows how the world has gone through these two things. Their hopes and dreams deteriorated as the mansion they lived in, despite the quarrel. Both of them wanted each other more than ever. Because without other places there will be no refuge from loneliness The most amazing line came from Big Edie, where many cats loosen themselves throughout her bedroom. Her response to the complaint about the smell was unbelievable.
