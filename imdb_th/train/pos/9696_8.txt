I'm not a fan of the new movie. But this is a very delightful thing to watch Adults and children can watch together - it's really great! My aunt also likes It has laughter, tears, love, adventure, special effects, good actors - and parrots say it reminds me of the favorite Wizard of Oz. The hero Polly, the intelligent parrot, was separated from his home and family and through many adventures, temptations and disappointments, reminiscent of his resolution to find his friend Marie Highly recommended
