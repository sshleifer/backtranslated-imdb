"The Incredible Melting Man" is a product of Z-level production that is worthless, worthless and full of energy that everyone is interested in self-respecting horror camps. The ideal way to describe this low-cost gem of the 70s is a ridiculous copy of Hammer "The Quatermass Xperiment" ... only a thousand times! Astronaust Steve West is the only survivor of a disastrous space mission. But turned out to be a carrier of terrible diseases that caused him to be radioactive and ... let him melt! With shock after seeing his face in the mirror (Can you blame him?) Steve leaves the hospital, leaving traces of sticky pus and falling body parts on the back. Doctor Ted Nelson must find him urgently because this disease causes Steve to have a craving for human flesh. The place may sound the most stupid. But this flick is very fun and has a great makeup effect from Rick Baker's hand. The friend's face melts like a rotting pizza and his heavy breathing makes him look like Darth Vader! Another important advantage is that William Sachs' screenplay doesn't waste time with boring scientific explanations or emotional speeches. The offensive started immediately and lasted until the last moment of the movie. Just enjoy the stupid horror gems and try to close the brain as much as possible, because if you start to ponder about a lot of foolishness in the script, you'll miss the full fun!
