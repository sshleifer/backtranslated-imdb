At first I thought that this movie would be your typical western movie. However, it turned out to be very interesting and caused me to be shocked to the end which became very unusual. Charlton Heston (Samberger), "Midway", '76, had a past experience with James Byrne, (Zoprevo), "Death", '93, and Zach never forgive Sam and will not stop With him and pay him back Unfortunately, Susan Burgade, "Portrait of a young woman", '96, was caught in this situation and found himself among the starving men that seemed to be Not leaving her alone, Sam Burgade had to make very difficult decisions and I was very surprised at the conclusion. This is a very entertaining movie and the performance is excellent.
