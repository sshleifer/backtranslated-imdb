Deathtrap lets you spin all the time in every turn. Actually, the biggest problem is that there are many twists that you never really focus on in a movie. You by surprise The story is very good except for the fact that it has a lot of twists. The screenplay is very good with great dialogue and characters. But you can't develop at all because of twisting. Caine's performance is great. The direction is very good. Sidney Lumet can control the direction. Visual effects are fair. But in fact, most of them are in play and are very fake but still functional and worth watching
