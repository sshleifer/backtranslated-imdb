I don't think this movie will be released today. It takes time to present the depths of the characters and the plot is not full of twists and turns, allowing you to sit at your edge. <br /> <br /> But what this movie has: interesting Learn how families cope with grief. The way when language for healing and excessive loss makes us quiet and we rely on raw emotions Grief without reason and patience is anger, even hatred. And unfortunately the lead character (The young man who accidentally shot and killed his brother while pursuing) in the film received more than his fair share. He eventually left and moved with his grandfather. (Wilford Brimley), which made him clear that it was an accident I received the impression that this young man knew in his heart. But have to hear those words from his parents and be forgiven. <br /> <br /> What I love about this movie: Lack of talk, a lot of emphasis on physical reactions, expressions. Facial expression And the slow speed of the movie allows you to watch the actors' reactions Something we didn't do with many movies today. <br /> <br />
