Legendary director Sidney Lumet is one of his best films in his career in tense history and was finally shocked about the unusual family as one of the children. The show is led by Philip Seymour Hoffman (Oscar's precious performance here), Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney, Lumet. The /> <br /> water layman audience, many <br may feel confused and badly constructed, Lumet has gone from here. Instead of acting in a linear manner, he went to the Tarantino route and showed the middle of the robbery from a different perspective. Personally, I found this thing very pleasant and made me guess what would happen next time. The script is very strong, with a wonderful scene between husband and wife, Hoffman and Tomei, as well as between father and son Finney and Hoffman. All the actors are fully involved in watching, and Lumet feels fun about directing the style that he often does not delve into with action and wonder to capture the audience for two hours of work. This is a movie. Rare Not disappointed for a moment
