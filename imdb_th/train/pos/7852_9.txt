Ladislas Starewicz's curiosity with insects and movies combined into a short film about the love triangle between Mr. Beetle, the arthopper and Mrs. Beetle, a relatively simple story of a couple, a beetle, a pair that both seek stimulation outside of their marriage. He is similar to a biography or a short paragraph. Starewicz's twist in this story is to use the pickled beetle with a wire that stretches the legs in a freak motion. frame The story created when Mr. Beetle was unconsciously captured by a camera with a dragonfly from a local nightclub by a jealous locust. When You Beetle goes home to find his wife in the arms of an art friend, she chases her in anger. But finally forgive her and take her out to watch the movie However, Mrs. Duang learned about her husband's infidelity shortly because the movie they watched was a jealous movie of the beetle and dragonfly. The beetle, Mrs. Beetle and the umbrella Mr Beetle jumped through the screen and they both ended up in prison after the projector they destroyed the fire. Insects are placed in human places, such as houses or nightclubs, and receive the characteristics of humans that are jealous of anger, desire and vengeance. Insect characters carry luggage, drive motorcycles and even wear shoes. But they still close the antenna and open and close the lower jaw as the real insect wants The novelty of the story does not make itself bored even though it has been watched many times. But when the fluid is slippery like a movie, it moves slowly Action occurs with complex details. But the speed and speed of filming will disappear in the process This film is a great example of Starewicz's early puppets and is highly recommended.
