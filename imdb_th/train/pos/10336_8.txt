This one is hard to see - as a previous reviewer says That was an amazing story considering the horrific movie that came out after World War II, in particular. Dachau's "emancipation" was evident that in the middle of the war we knew what had happened to the Jews. The sequence shows that "transport" is as bright as that based on the real news movie. (The Nazis like to record their cruelty) Knox as a Nazi is great. He ranked the Nazi career path. The creation of the chart was particularly special compared to the reaction of other Germans at first, laughing at Hitler, then unbelievable, and eventually doing nothing. However, that difference allows us to believe in "Repentance" of a young Nazi officer to show his anti-Nazi attitude Occurred as a witness in many attempts against Hitler, the most prominent plot of Staffenberg, which occurred when the film came out. A strong film using historical events to accurately predict the path of Nuremberg and others that will happen when the war ends.
