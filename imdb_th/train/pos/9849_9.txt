When I saw the example, I just watched the movie. And when I had I felt a feeling of discontent It's a great movie. Don't understand me wrong. But I think the wonderful parts that are in the trailer if you catch my drift It passed very quickly and it rotated so I never got bored and I enjoyed watching it. The humor is great. My first contact with sloth (.. or something like that)
