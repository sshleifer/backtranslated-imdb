I used to see the thin man series - Powell and Loi Krathong days are excellent. But there is something cute about Powell and Arthur's chemistry in this film. Jean Arthur flashes when she looks at Powell. This film may not have the flair of the thin man series. But cannot deny that it will make it attractive As I watched it, I thought Powell was working on the screen with Arthur. My friends think too. This is a movie that I hope I will go back in time. (Saying and caressing the lips with Powell!) Seems endless for his cute playful smile! Powell's character, Lawrence Bradford, may be something close to "Perfect man" Okay. This is a way that sounds too spooky. But I can't help myself
