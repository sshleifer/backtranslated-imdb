After that, I watched the movie ... I thought, "Why is he so successful in this Korean box office?" Although he thinks that this movie has a clever / unusual situation, the performance isn't Well, and the characters are not very interesting. For Korean movies ... I like fighting scenes. If you want to watch movies without thinking, this is the movie for you. But I have to admit that ... this movie is about children ... 6/10
