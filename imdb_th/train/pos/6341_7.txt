Although I really enjoyed the latest "serious" performance of Jim Carrey ("The Truman Show", "Man on the Moon"), but I always thought that he had a real determination in physical jokes. This is not to say that he is a talented actor: those bozos at the Academy Awards do not seem to like him so much. He has never been nominated or deserves any "Academy" awards. Nominated for 11 Academy Award nominations such as "Titanic" should not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> Continue with the review of "The Grinch" is a sweet and good-looking season The best and best since "The N ightmare before Christmas "Both movies seem very similar to the chic scenes and places of people who stole Christmas. Both made their main actors look like villains. (One level higher than others), both a strong lesson pack and both have real fun. <br /> <br /> That is until you realize that Jack Skellington is a doll and the Grinch is human. But humans are incredibly incredibly expressive, therefore, in his movements like cartoons, so it's not true that never gets in the way of movies. He can be hilarious. He can be a sad soul. He can be angry. He lives in a 3D world where 3-dimensional people live. He was funny. He laughed. He cried and in the end he helped Christmas. I love this movie a bit and can't wait for it to come out on DVD. This is one of those movies that you will enjoy 10, 20 years from now.
