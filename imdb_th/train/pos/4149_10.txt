Reading some comments on the message board here, I expect this movie to be completely reduced - but when I watch it, I can't stop laughing! It has become an official movie of my new favorite. <br /> <br /> I don't know what all this hate is about, perhaps because this type of movie has never been before. I'm losing my name to another female joke. Many comedians will have one or two actresses. But there are many male characters that support This is almost all women - except Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and Will Arnett's short appearance - and it works. Every female actor gives a very funny performance. (Especially Missi Pyle) from a quirky and cute chapter. <br /> <br /> The charm of this movie for me seems to be in a feminist message: accept who you are. The success of women in public circles, the strength of female companionship and gender role destruction Even if it is light But each lead character faces challenges due to their efforts to 'conflict' with feminist values ​​and they know who they are. <br /> <br /> Missi Pyle proposes that this This film missed the drama because it was all female actors and there were no big-name actors to get the studio behind and I had to admit. Everyone I recommend this movie will love it and I think it is a shame that the comedy that women are not widely accepted and unbelievably successful. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie to everyone. The heart or love of a female comedian is central
