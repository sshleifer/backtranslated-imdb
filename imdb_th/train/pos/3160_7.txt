This show has all the common characters in comedy: good people, idiots, bad habits, rich people ... but it's set in the 70s. That's the same difference with other TV series I don't know how you like this show. Humor, it's pathetic! I mean that joke directly ... The general conversation is: "Fez: Oh Jackie, I want to have sex with you. (Audience laughs) Jackie: Fez, you're a spoiled person. Oh yes i'm (Audience cheered and applauded) "This is not a joke. I think if it doesn't have laughter (I don't know how you call it in English. Sorry.) You won't laugh at all. This is not a clever comedy. This is a public insult. I like most American comedians. But it's not good at all. I'll give 4 out of 10 (sorry for my bad English again)
