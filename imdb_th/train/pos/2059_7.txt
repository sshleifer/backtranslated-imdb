It's something fun. The movie b! Shepis is very beautiful and Scarecrow is different and original. He brought me back to the monster in the 1980s. Clearly the budget is low and not everyone who is Pacino behind the lens. But it is not important because it has never been serious about myself From the heart of the trash bin trailer to the scarecrow's high-flying martial arts movement I'm very happy with this movie. I went out to buy all 3 movies. Scarecrow Of course, it's not for everyone. But it's his own Sometimes you have to set your mind to the maximum and smile.
