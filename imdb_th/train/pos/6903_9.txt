This little favorite movie is one of my favorites. I can watch it over and over again Dreyfus and Braga are great. But Raul Julia stole the list! Gomez Addams looks scary and funny with the right tone for the irreverent spoof of this storytelling story. <br /> <br /> Moon Over Parador lets you check out. Reality and join the fun that happens on the thumbs-up screen!
