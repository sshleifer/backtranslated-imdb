Secondary school, Vince Lombardi, has a new principal, Togar (Mary Woronov), who is evil. She intends to band and play music together. She banged the head with Riff Randall (PJ Soles), who loved Ramones. In addition, the school football team leader (Vincent Van Patten) seemed unable to connect with any woman - unknown. br /> <br /> Immediately midnight, this movie is a typical version and almost immediately exploded - but as a midnight movie, it is very popular and still plays throughout the 1980s. I remember joining more than a few people. When i am in University - it's like a party! People are singing along with laughing with anxiety in every joke and in general it's just fun. <br /> <br /> Seeing it as an adult now, I can't imagine why I love this thing so much. The script is young and full of lamentations which I can't believe that I heard. The characters change randomly and the movie will jump everywhere. The saving thing is that the song is funny and a great performance by Soles and Woronov (who really likes themselves). In addition, everyone is full of energy and plays their role in the north (as expected) for Ramones ... I've never been a fan. I like the title song, but the rest of the song never makes me fall in love. If you are a Ramon fan, you may give a higher rating. <br /> <br /> Spoiler warning !!!! This is mainly for kids (with PG scores) that might find it stupid but especially fun. I think they will like the end point when high school is blown! At the end of the spoiler !!!! <br /> <br /> So if you're in the mood for the dumb midnight movies of the 1980s, you might like this. Otherwise, stay away. I give 7 items.
