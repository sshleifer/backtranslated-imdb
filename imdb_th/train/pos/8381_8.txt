This movie I love since I was young! It's great Although it may be quite difficult for movie viewers on average, if anyone can't interpret some subtleties in the movie (Eg, our hero's name is Achilles and in the final battle between him and Alexander The rocket, like the legendary Achilles, was shot in his heel.) That's a little amusing truth! However, a great movie, a good story, will be complete when you see it, repeat it with today's special techniques! Oddly enough, Gary Graham achieved the average lead in T. V. Show Alien Nation This movie is a fun watch and should be more appreciated!
