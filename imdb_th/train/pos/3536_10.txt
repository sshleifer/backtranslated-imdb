EA has shown us that they can create classic 007 agents and make you feel in the 60s world. The graphics of the game are outstanding and the recording is very professional. I received this game in April 2007 (two years after release) and I'm still impressed with the gameplay. It's a shame that EA won't create another game. 007 <br /> <br /> I give this game to the existing level. I will recommend this game to anyone who is 13 years or older. The only thing I don't like in the game is the Russian ship level. It's too much pressure. Overall I like the game a lot !!
