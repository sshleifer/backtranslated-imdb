Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an ordinary man who feels that God is confused with his life. God faced him and showed Bruce a mistake in his way. Of course, giving power from God to someone may be worse The actors bring the plans together. The jokes are often the target, although sometimes they show too much emotion on Carrie's face. I like the fact that this film shows God not only that But also a black man too I think it is quite good, especially with Freeman who is wonderful. There are some hilarious scenes, open scenes, cookies, etc. People miss a little goal But still a good movie 6/7 out of 10
