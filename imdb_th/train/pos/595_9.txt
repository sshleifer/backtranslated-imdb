When John Wayne filmed the story of Alamo, he created the Alamo in the city. Brackettsville Texas State which remains and is a tourist attraction As long as we have a set for future Alamo interpretation for the screen One of them, with Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob Thornton, was created in this century. <br /> <br /> But I want to say that Alamo: Thirteen days to glory. The story of the best Alamo I've ever seen. John Wayne's movie is a good movie if overdue. But it's John Wayne's movie with a new story that will fill the parameters of John Wayne's screen. Brian Keith plays Davy Crockett here and interprets the formidable character. <br /> <br /> It's close to the book of Professor Lon Kookikin in The Alamo, rather than Wayne's movie and reading the book of the year. In the past, I can confirm that Tinkle's book was identified as the source of both films, but Tinkle, who was still alive at that time when Wayne's movie was created and he was not satisfied with the results. /> <br /> Alec Baldwin, age appropriate for children William Barrett Travis, the freedom fighter with ideals that accidentally owned slaves. Back in the day when no one saw the conflict in that matter. One thing that is not explored and is not a hyperactive sex drive of Travis. He is a flirt of the Southwest. He also keeps a record of the evil of his conquest of libidinal. <br /> <br /> But the person who has been baptized is Jim Bowie who played here by James Arness. He is a hero. At Alamo to make sure But his career before Alamo is a villain He was a smuggler of traffickers, merchants, landowners around him. But his brave death has certainly redeemed him There is no hint of Arness's image or other people I've seen Bowie on the screen, and of course he designed Bowie knives to follow his specifications. The man needs this kind of weapon. <br /> <br /> However, the main asset at The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory is a picture that was blown full of Antonio de Lopez de Santa Anna. The President of Mexico came up personally. Put up a rebellion by the North American settlers in Texas at the invitation of the Mexicans Unfortunately, those Americans came up with ideas that had come before, about the freedom that did not occur at the far south, at least freedom for white people. Raul Julia plays as Santa Anna, who is also a more controversial person in Mexican history. But he is the best person in Mexico until the reformer named Benito Juarez comes in. <br /> <br /> The film is a performance of Lorne Greene's farewell performance, which appears briefly as General Sam. Houston Green is not my opinion for Houston. He is too old for Houston. In his early forties, in 1836, he was not a governor of Texas. But within the specified limits, he works green well. <br /> <br /> For the romantic story telling of The Alamo, everyone looks at the version of John Wayne. But for historical content, I recommend this movie. very much
