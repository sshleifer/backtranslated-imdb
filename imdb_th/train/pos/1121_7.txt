This is a real novelty for you. It started out again in the PSYCHO shower scene on campus. Then it was crazy when many teammates. The problem began when they drove into the redneck zone ruled by the sheriff, killing the dead. One college cuties walked into the woods, witnessing the murder by the sheriff and having her head blown open. Then let the time come out of the MACON COUNTY while Dean stalks, traps, and kills the one who is resolute Tony March is the target as Dean, who is a happy shotgun. The overall tone of the movie is truly disturbing. The sudden ending, you almost thought the director had finished the film. Is a study of despair. SHALLOW GRAVE is necessary for hating women, hating women and destroying the whole world.
