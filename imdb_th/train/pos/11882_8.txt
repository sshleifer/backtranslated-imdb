This movie is in my collection. But it didn't happen before my friend would remind me about it ?? Until I decided that I should watch it I do not know much about close to Leo? Just that it should be a great movie that comes from an era and it's related to a very serious topic ?? AIDS. <br /> <br /> Although people with AIDS ?? Leo? The situation surrounds the way Marcel (Leo's youngest brother) faces the illness of his relatives. At first, everyone tried to hide the truth from Marcel? He believed that he was too young to understand the illness of his brother? The fact that Leo is also a homosexual makes parents unwilling to talk to Marcel Young. I know from experience that many times most seniors do not want to accept the fact that sometimes even when This person does not mean that he will not be able to accept the truth and do himself sufficiently. Except for the fact that the family tried to conceal the truth from Marcel. How they support their son ?? Even after discovering the truth about his sexuality and illness The fact that they allow Marcel, a young woman to travel with Leo to Paris to meet his ex-boyfriend, is it a sign from them? Most families I know are reluctant to do that. There are many warmth in the scene that the brothers spend time together ?? You can see them as real friends, worry about each other. <br /> <br /> Close to Leo is a great drama which I highly recommend.
