Released in France on DVD, many years ago - I hope it will be released again with English subtitles. Don't be confused with the remake of Penelope Cruz that received bad comments. Gerard Phillips is a lucky farmer who told him that he would marry the king's daughter. He set out to join the army and enter the war. However, his love is Gina Lollabrigida in her first movie. I will not destroy the end. Gerard Phillips died a few years later as a child.
