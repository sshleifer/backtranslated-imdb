Best comedy movie starring Marian Davies (with cute William Haines) Young Peggy arrives at Hollywood to find a star. Kameo's performance is a show "All the stars in MGM's paradise" in the scene of the famous delegation, including many ancient films that were detailed for scholars Day (Swanson, you are beautiful!) <br /> <br /> "Peggy" caught her as she met Marion, a famous star. Davies at the tennis turned his nose and commented. "Oh, I don't like you!" <br /> <br /> My perfect print job. The story, direction, show, true charm and things to do for the silent publisher.
