This is a love story that I like to watch. And mostly two reasons One. It focuses on young people, very young people. People who are still in their teens and are experiencing love for the first time or at least think they are All of us have in our lives and "The Man in the Moon" is a beautiful reflection of our memories, maybe adding a little more detail and adding more than we have ever experienced. The second reason is love triangle. And I believe that in teenagers it is the most amazing And the story is well developed until you believe that the character may have a real love or a new story to love which they just believe strongly that they are and after the tragedy <br /> <br /> The actors of "The Man in the Moon" are full of names with great talent. It shows Sam Waters, a truly talented actor, capable of playing strict district lawyers, including a strict father. But with the same concern and flair as in this film There are also Tess Harper, Jason London and Reese Witherspoon, the youngest. You watch a talented actor while you are fourteen and you think about ten years later she will be awarded an Oscar. All the members of the actors drew great performances and with the dialogue of interesting screenplays, they were developed to look like real people in real situations. As if it were all true This type of movie that I want to see more often Love story? I like to watch movies that make everything look realistic and not fake or unbelievable.
