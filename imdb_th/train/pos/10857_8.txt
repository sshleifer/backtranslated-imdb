Johny To makes this one of his best exercises, creating a strong movie with a good Yakuza story. Yakuza's new chief election is the beginning of the war within the organization. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the violence is used wisely in this context, making it a very strong gang movie. I like the way in which he tells a special history, moving in all the roles in the Yakuza family and seeing the same violence as they have to solve their problems ... <br /> <br /> Say Talking about technical aspects, movies are a good example of how to pause, stroke and plan for filming. One of the Hong Kong movies of the year Is like hell But there are no violent action scenes and confusing stories Highly recommended to all Asian movie lovers. <br /> <br /> (Sorry for my English doing better in Spanish lol)
