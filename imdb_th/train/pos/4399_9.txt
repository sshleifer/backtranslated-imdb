The most concise way to describe the ride with the devil is only one word: the correctness. I will not improve what I have said about this amazing movie. But I want to say how much historical research and attention to detail that this film team has no doubt. <br /> <br /> Admire as a student of history familiar with the time and environment of This movie, I must say that this production is one of the most accurate character movies about "blood Kansas". Yes, freedom is used in real events because of All they have to do. But the overall feeling of this film is genuine Authentic attire, real attitude (No looking back on the PC) Even though the actors seem to be real, even Jewel Kilcher (who has a small part in the movie) looks like she will step into the photo in the mid 19th century. <br /> <br / > A few viewers I talk to show unbelief in stylish conversations. They could not believe that farmers in the 19th century would "speak like a poet." <br /> <br /> What they didn't realize was that in this era of greed, the American people in the century The 19th was a literary and poetic literary man. These people were raised by Shakespeare and the King James Bible. The scriptwriter has recreated the verbal patterns of these people by judging from the documents of time. A chic dialog box adds to the magic atmosphere of the movie. <br /> <br /> But apart from historical documents, this film also works on the internal organs as well. Take pictures and show beautifully. It makes it back to the era of the great Western epic. The attack at Lawrence, Kansas, has been done many times before, in other smaller films, showing the sense of urgency that puts the audience in action. <br /> < br>> Romance Adventure The moral and ethical conflict, this film has everything that a smart movie audience wants. <br /> <br /> In a year that is dominated by rubbish that is too high like American Beauty, this wonderful art is buried. By an indifferent studio system But I'm sure Ride With The Devil will get in the next few years. Please rent this movie. You will not be disappointed
