I used to watch this movie many times and I like bad teachers. Everyone wants it out of ten. But felt that it would not be fair for other good movies. However, I think this is one of those rare gems: perfect comedy I will always take one of the greatest animated films. Matthau and Lemmon pair perfectly and do not match. The script is so sharp that you must stop bleeding. The story is well known and has been described in other comments. Both leaderboards provide excellent performances. Excellent girls and situations are funny. Not an oath that only one person sees (Marking Hollywood, you don't have to swear that it's funny. You have to be witty) and moving from one stage to another is smooth. They didn't make this anymore anymore. No time.
