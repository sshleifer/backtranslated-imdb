VIRGIN, 40 years old (2005) **** Steve Karel, Catherine Kener, Paul Rudd, Romani Malko, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks , Leslie Mann, Jen Lynch, Jerry Bennub Comedy, a comical concept about Andy Stylist with a high rank (Performed superbly by the second banana perennial, Karel, in a truly exceptional cartoon show. Of course, the stooge will be branded on the list.) Technology service providers Find information about his hidden identity by three colleagues who have a good meaning But still naive, innocent colleagues (Rudd, Malco & Rogen, each of whom has a level that is more funny than the next one). What follows is a romance that is unlikely and heartwarming. Cheerful (Keener, a great man who has lots of fun here), which leads to an increase of fuel for the fire in Andy. Good romantic comedy, lively and illogical. The most fun since "Something about Mary" with a rude observer script by director Judd Apatow and Carell, which has some surprisingly-circling sequences circling astoundingly, including David Caruso, comedy And demystifying the war of sex with brazen self-confidence True and classic winners immediately. The most fun movie of the year
