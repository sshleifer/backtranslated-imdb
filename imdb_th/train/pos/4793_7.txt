After watching this film, I felt that I knew a little about the United States. David Lynch was synonymous with shock and strangeness, because of these strange and not missing elements from The Straight Story. The brightness that I had never seen from Lynch before We started with a simple family that lived a quiet life. But ended up with an unreasonably interesting character that had a depth in their lives that could not be seen from the introduction In particular, the movement is a bar scene with two World War II veterans discussing the events of fifty years ago and how it still affects their current lives and emotions. If you are looking for Wild at Heart or Dune, don't look here. But if you are looking for real people who have real stories, this is the movie for you.
