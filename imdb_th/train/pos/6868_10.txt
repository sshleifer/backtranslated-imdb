I saw this in Detroit in what had to be done. I literally rolled in the hallway of the theater. It was very funny. I have never seen it before but like where you get a copy. Anyone who talks about too many dates or dates for my money is just a group of poses. Each play has both evil, evil love, or each evil, each one! There are no weak people included. The opening sequence, for example, which parodies 2001, has a go-go-dancer gorilla with pendulous breasts. Felinni will shoot it if he is a witty person ... if you come to this movie with an open heart and a heart that is mock scoff
