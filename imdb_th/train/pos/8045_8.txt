Finally, I installed a mail order, renting a DVD to find a movie that was not available in the store. I chose The Souler Opposite because I like Christopher Meloni and like a small movie that often doesn't care. <br /> <br /> Movies This story is very interesting! Meloni has this charm in this section. It's easy for a pigeon to break a hole. He's just you seeing him as himself. Elliot Stabler (LOSVU) The ego in this movie Meloni is a middle-aged middleman who skips slipping in many ways just to find The path of happiness in unexpected people. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Barry (Meloni) and Tim Busfield's characters are real and not over. I haven't seen Busfield since 30 years old and he enjoys watching. But it's all Chris's movie I became a girlfriend like this again. <br /> <br /> It's quite slow. At first I will accept. I think "some events" may be solved. But overall, this movie will make you satisfied whether it is male or female, because there is a honest and refreshing perspective in today's relationship.
