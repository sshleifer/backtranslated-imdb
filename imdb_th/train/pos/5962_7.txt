I've seen the "80s rocker horror" over the years, ranging from junk such as "Terror on Tour" to ridiculously fun gems like "Slumber Party Massacre 2". Can come, which is strange because it may be popular and well received I finally caught it and it was the best of the sub stories. (But always loved!) The plot (which has been raised quite a lot in the movie "Black Roses") involves the alleged abuse of Eddie, which was mocked by everyone in his high school for His musical tastes He loves the 80s metal, especially his idol Sammi Curr (played by the late Tony Fields). After Sammi is killed, Eddie's favorite DJ, the radio, saves Sammi's last record when Ed. He played the record behind him, discovering that he was quite strong and bad things began to happen to those who provoked him. Are Sammy's songs occupied? "Trick or Treat" can do well and honk all the horns. The special effect is great, even though it has a typical 80s laser beam. I grew up in the 80s, and while I'm not a fan of heavy metal, I remember the legend about the city. And playing the back, hear the worship of Satan. Haha! I still remember being told by my siblings and neighbors that both KISS and Ozzy worshiped Satan, so it was fun to see them both. Make a pendant as a radio jockey that is not harmful. If only I saw this movie as a child! While this film seems to stimulate the fun of popular connections in the 1980s between alleged demon worship and heavy metal, the audience never knew why Sammi Curr came back from death, causing disaster and killing. Anyone This is the weakness of the movie. But if you overlook it, it's fun
