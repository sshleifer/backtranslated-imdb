After seeing 'Break a Leg' in Vancouver at a party, I thought it was a fun movie. <br /> <br /> I had a few diarrhea. Scream. I never heard the news about the release date. Actually, even though I heard it near, <br /> <br /> The story is simple. But most are vehicles for characters and situations The script is smooth and seamless. The story is easily developed and the show is comfortable and fresh. This film received at least one award from each film festival that was in the range of 10 - 15 years. So <br /> <br /> I would recommend 'Break a Leg'.
