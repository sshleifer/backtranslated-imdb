OK, this is how I do it. I rate 10 movies. Each element starts with 5 points, then can reduce or add 5 points to 10 or 0. <br /> <br /> Emotions: action, romance, comedy, drama , Suspense - I give this part 10 points. It has a perfect balance of all five aspects. The operation is fun and exciting. Romance doesn't have too much. But still has a lot of emotions and movements I laughed hard and long throughout the film, and I still fell in love with the great drama and sensational suspicions. <br /> <br /> Plot - I gave this part 10 points. All have been told. I found myself sitting in the cinema, returning to my childhood, and immediately I believed again in the unicorns, wicked witches and falling stars that made dreams come true. <br /> <br /> Movie Photography - I give this element 8 points while the movie captures the story very well. In most perspectives, I find myself more than once trying to figure out what is happening. OFF <br /> <br /> FX - I give the 10 points I like that they use C.G.I sparingly. The epic scene is reliable. The magical power is horribly realistic. Overall very little, and this is all! Poll - I gave this part 10 points, no names and experienced actors alike. The actors were amazing! Michelle Pfeiffer wickedly miraculous, Charlie Cox makes the drama come to life. Claire Dennes gives emotions to the stars and I will never look and Robert De Niro again. <br /> Acting - I give this part 10 points. Even the new actors are still playing perfectly. I will not look at Robert De Niro again. <br /> <br /> Character development - I give this component 9 points. This gives a slight hustle and I think if the movie This longer, they can make the characters a little better justice. Conversation - I give this element 10 points. The conversation is intelligent and fun? Even boiled rice has a good conversation. <br /> <br /> Score - I give this part 7 points. I can only remember one small piece of music from all movies. I didn't complain over the fact that the song was more memorable. <br /> <br /> The ending - I gave this part with 9 points. The ending is almost perfect! I feel that some aspects of the ending are more pronounced, while others may be weakened. But there is no binding. <br /> <br /> All: 93% buy DVDs? Yes yes! Seen in the theater or not of cours! Bottom Line: Great movie for everyone! epic! I highly recommend seeing it in the theater. I know I will come back for a few seconds!
