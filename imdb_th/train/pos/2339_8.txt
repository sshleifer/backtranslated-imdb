I love this show Now I'm not a big fan of science fiction shows, so if it's not like them, I don't notice. I like the quality of the storybooks of movies. I still like the love story, even though I enjoy it, I still wonder in my heart that the heck that part of this story can truly improve is because Ned can't touch Chuck. I like Chuck. I can't find it. That she is annoying and in general I hate too cute and cute characters I also like the voice of the narrator, even though it disturbs one of my family members and almost has no resemblance to Walgreens advertising. I can talk about other situations about Ned's situation and how the author will. Mention it in the future But I just watched and waited to see what the writer had done.
