Wow. Seeing last night and I'm still spinning from the good. Every character feels real. (Although most of them are selfish, selfish as well as holes **) and strange stories - middle-aged widows begin to give up their daughter's boyfriend Popular performances all around But wore a hat to Ann Reid and our friend Daniel Craig in the north It's far from Notting Hill as far as possible. Thank God, <br /> <br /> Watch this movie !!!
