I can safely accept (As an IMDB looking for) that 'Phantom Lady' will not break into my movie, Noir ranked twenty. It may not sneak into the top fifty. But instead of losing the reputation of the film that is not as good as other classics of the film genre, it should be noted that 'Phantom Lady' has a strong and lasting image that is worth watching. What is needed by the audience is the ability to transcend a terrible slow start. <br /> <br /> This film doesn't cook until 'Kansas' (Ella Raines) will try to prove everything. Alone The innocence of her boss, Scott Anderson (Alan Curtis), convicted in the murder of 'Kansas', is Anderson's secretary in the daytime and amateur detectives at night. As a rookie detective, she is quite good for herself while working on the streets of New York at night. She started putting pieces of the puzzle to solve the murder mystery together little by little. In fact, this movie is Rain's and is due to her appearance that this movie works well. Anyway, she was able to breathe in the life of the movie about a man who was punished, which was even less interesting. I'm not sure that the power of the protagonist without the character becomes the fault of the actor or director. But clearly, this is a very unusual thing for movies. <br /> <br /> Interesting like Rain. As a rookie detective, things accelerated to another hidden device, when 'Kansas' went out to visit the late drummer drummer. (Elisha Cook Jr.) to find information to help the punished boss She and drummer draw a new style of the city while visiting the jazz club "All Night". Trying to describe this scene will prove unfair to the scene or worse, it can destroy the whole scene together. You will know that the scene when the last cymbal crash occurs. If you are lucky enough to get this movie from a DVD, you will have more opportunities to repeat this event over and over again. As good as Rain, it's a scene that makes this movie memorable. Mostly because of this scene where I rate 'Phantom Lady' a 7 instead of 6. <br /> <br /> Most of this movie came out impolite and polite with a few wonderful scenes and scenes. One beautiful scene. It's a 'drum / sex scene' that separates this movie from other people in the same family. <br /> <br /> And like it was said in the movie, "You have never been wrong with vanilla" I will and want to add that "going with Vanilla" is a safe choice when nobody can decide to eat delicious food. <br /> <br /> 7/10 Clark Richards
