I am a big classic movie But just entered the silent movie Many silent movies don't care, but Show People is an amazing exception. <br /> <br /> Marion Davies and William Haines are wonderful in this picture. In particular, Davies shows a wide range as she morphs from a small town girl who giggles to celebrities who take themselves too seriously. <br /> <br /> Show people as fast paced movies with Wonderful pendant array By the greatest star of the silent era The movie immediately caught my attention and I forgot that it was a silent movie. (I know it's not reasonable But that is what happened) The performers are skilled in their craft that requires a little conversation card. <br /> <br /> Show people the silent movie. It is an interesting movie that is fast and has two of the best stars of the silent era. Add to the words of Hollywood and show people should be on the 'must see' list for all classic movie lovers.
