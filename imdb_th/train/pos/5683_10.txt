Just saying that you have a movie about John Holmes is guaranteed to get people to the screen, but writer / director James Cox delivers more "Rashamon" of the lazy Hollywood movie scene. Said it had split the murder in July 1981 through various angles (And the movie library) but mostly through John Holmes' filter, making the brain a weasel In movies that are full of bad guys, Holmes is the most vile, poor, or both. Many versions of the story appear and combine when Cox flashes, jumps, cuts and twists the title cards amidst the effects and emotions. The conversation is fast and natural and never calls again. While this film occurred two years after Holmes was freed from pornography and became a truly evil drug that caused relentlessness, Kilmer relentlessly demonstrated extreme sex until he could be measured. Finger Sex at the edge creates the feeling that there is a hunch that hangs over the entire film almost as much as the violence at the center. Those murders were teased through the entire film, although not clearly shown, even in the climax scene, although their violent incontinence penetrated the entire image and a lot of blood was splashed across the wall. And Val Kilmer's crime photo again as Holmes shows that he can do wacko better than anyone else at work. Placing bragging, bragging or begging Kilmer as a continuous character and the character is a fascinating car wreck Outstanding performances other than Kilmer, including Ted Levine as the police chief in the investigation, and Lisa Kudrow as the wife of Holmes, who are separate. The three criminals of the criminals fall in there, including the horrifying high-energy Josh Lucas, Timothy Blake Nelson, and Dylan McDermott, who cannot truly remember the important role as another killer of the generation. murder Cock pointed out that no matter how much we learn about Wonderland, there is still a worse version. But looking through the intoxication around it is more interesting than understanding the truth.
