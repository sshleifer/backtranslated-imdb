George Lopez is a funny person, even without a sitcom. When I first saw this, it often made a joke at the expense of his mother. When I watched this thing more, there was more variety. No one in the team of actors is really safe from his wits. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that this season, with the progress that George was familiar with, the sitcom role of his father's family At first he didn't But he is going to become a groove This makes both him and the program more fun. They add a few characters to George to play this year too. His wife's father is getting more involved & more in the plot. <br /> <br /> His mother is still there. But not centered in the past season I think it's wise to speak with George's feelings about comic timing and the lack of good sitcoms of ABC. George Lopez has a good chance to come to ABC after George W. Bush
