This is far the most favorite movie in the world !!!!! I enjoyed it when I was 4 years old and I still enjoy it at the age of 16 !! It is an absolute masterpiece! No video collection is complete if without !!! I enjoy every second of it and not just But movies will have some special effects only But it sends great messages to the children of the audience which may sound good Although Michael Jackson will be in a few movies today But people still do not see him as an actor In fact, he is the best actor I know! He is very talented! He's incredible !!! MOONWALKER must see !!!!!!
