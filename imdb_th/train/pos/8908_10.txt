First of all, I don't see "The Blob" since I was 7 or 8. And watching as an adult is an incredible experience. Pages can be written on the influence of horror movies even today. And more than that, can also be written in social narration as well "Fear of adolescents" in the 50s, but the little horror stories about this planet are still horrifying horror movies if you let it go. <br /> <br /> Sure, of course. Looks great when going out in our modern world, but "The Blob" contains a truly terrifying moment, while a group of children follow unstoppable creatures when adults don't believe them. In fact, there are even pretty bleak moments in its candy-colored world, and Steve McQueen gives more than the story that deserves on the paper that our audience received at that time and believed in him. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you can remove the post-modern irony filter There is more love here than seen.
