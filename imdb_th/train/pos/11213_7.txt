This second movie is interesting like the previous movie, except that there is nothing suspicious. We know what he will do and what will happen before it is even hinted on the screen. Then happiness comes only from the ways in which various tricks occur and their inheritance. We know that there will be explosives in the car that he will lose the wheel that the car will have to crash just to mention the car. And that's what happened Now the details and details are provided for you to discover it in the movie. So that he can be tempted by some dumb women who are clearly and must come But we know that he has seen through her and he knows that he has been dragged into a trap How can he now go out? That's what you need to find yourself. And do not worry that he will receive the main acting supervisor But how is it another matter? The speed boat does not match our busy beaver in the river. We also know that when he is injured They didn't know what the bulletproof jacket of those days was. In fact, recently, some geographic information systems have not been found in Iraq. But what is the meaning of this film? Confirmation of hunting, traffickers and blind people who do not see it as a prohibition that causes problems But this film is a complete and complete example that does not have anything that can stand in the way of the moral crusade against the forces of evil. Why not just legalize these products so that they can be observed correctly and under supervision? When something is not illegal or pushed out of the way, it is all less fun to use them to do. It is forbidden or interesting restrictions. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques Kulurud, University of Paris, Daduen, University of Paris 1, Pantheon Sorbonne and University of Vau Mars
