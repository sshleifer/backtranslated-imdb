I was dragged to this film four years ago by my French actor friend. <br /> <br /> The first half hour I sat in the uncomfortable seat at the New Beverly Theater in Hollywood. Hated this movie. Hate yourself and hate the French actor ... <br /> <br /> I don't know what happened. But I was drawn into the movie in a way that I hadn't been for many years. And this is the fact that one of the projectors is broken and they have to change hands each time by hand. I stayed in the theater for almost four hours. But it is worth it. <br /> <br /> I believe that a great movie draws you into the world, making you part of it and letting you talk to your friends via coffee or drink. This movie did that. It's one of the best filming experiences I've ever had. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
