Anyone who thinks that the anime has nothing but sex and violence will be shut up after watching this movie. This film is a great movie that tells about Tetsuro's mission to avenge the death of his mother. But still growing in the process Traveling on this type of train instead of Tetsuro's journey from childhood to manhood. Music and visual styles of movies are quite outdated. (You can tell that it's a 70s movie) and the animation is better than the average "Star Blazers". But the story and the characters are very strong. It doesn't matter. Is something that shouldn't be missed for animation fans!
