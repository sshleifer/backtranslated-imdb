"A Guy Thing" may not be classic. But of course that is a good and funny comedy The plot focuses on Paul (Jason Lee) who wakes up the next morning after his bachelor party without memories and Becky (Julia Stiles) sleeps in the bed. Before he could understand what had happened, he rushed Becky out of his apartment because the Karen fiancee (Selma Blair) was about to come. > <br /> Almost every scene in "A Guy Thing" laughs out loud. The most fun time comes from when Paul imagines what will happen if he tells Karen. Selma Blair is a truly talented comedian and the worst thing about this movie is that she fell in love. Although she is more funny than the character of the style Of course, not all the jokes are perfect. <br /> <br /> Like I said "The guy" is not a classic. But not too bad. 7/10
