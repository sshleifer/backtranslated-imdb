Peach is a truly amazing movie. I write this to refute the comments from people called 'Auscrit' that appear on this website. First of all, the idea that Monahans' first movie, 'The Interview', is what TV is an unusual saying. This is a film that has been highly praised around the world as well as one of the best Australian movies ever created. Deserving of the best image Peach is a brave, brave and brave journey. For me, it works at all levels, and now I have seen it twice. Monahan is a filmmaker that shows great skills and incredible sensitivity for 'Auscrit' to comment as a movie. Another television and the fact that Hugo Weaving is not good, just not 'getting' movies or more, especially not wanting to receive it. It is the opinion that we expect from another filmmaker who is jealous or bitter or both. Or someone from within the industry, whether it is an exhibition, exhibition or bureaucracy Your average gambler I met just didn't write comments like that. I have noticed other reviews on the website and refer to the movie Sommersault. One must wonder what people think they are watching. Unfortunately in Australia at the time of the SS being released, if you don't like it, there is something wrong with you, not a movie. Handling this media is quite common. The truth is that the only similarity between the two movies is that they are the rights of the movie. Unfortunately for me, SS is a movie about anything that can be told in 15 minutes. I see it as a one-dimensional movie about anxiety. Peach in comparison is a masterpiece. Personally, I can't wait for Monahan to continue because he is clearly the next generation of his next generation of movies. In conclusion, whether this film does not win all AFI and IF awards this year or not, it is a game that is strict for Auscrit. Please find something more creative with your time.
