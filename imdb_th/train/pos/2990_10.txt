I think it was Ebert who gave Stella four in four stars. But apart from him, I have never read the positive reviews of this tragic drama that is misunderstood about class breaks, love and sacrifice. (Three general romantic themes). <br /> <br /> Here, the main theme is class division. Stella is a story from America's depression. Who said that it was translated to the screen in a memorable way that this remake (if you ask Stanwyck or two fans) is certainly not appreciated. Moreover, this model of Stella was created in 1990, not a time of great financial problems in America. (As well as depression) <br /> <br /> Now is the time to remove the rose-colored glasses in In the midst of a new era of economic recession and poverty in America, and seeing that this powerful story remains true, timely, and relevant, as always in modern ways. Divided into Important themes here Stella is one of the poor people who work solo, having a great dream. But there is little hope to realize those dreams She works in a bar, doesn't have much money, lives in a dirty apartment. You drifted In the morning she didn't want to get out of bed. On her wall, pictures of her favorite movie stars. <br /> <br /> A man saw her dancing at a bar. He is rich, has been educated from one of the high-class families that has nothing in common with Stella. His main concern is what Ivy League College joined her as a way to pay rent. How to be happy. They have a relationship They like each other Stella is pregnant. Stella told the news of the guy, his answer? "What about abortion?" She replied, "I just need a room full of balloons." He proposes balloons and offers. But she saw that his heart was not there and was proud to accept <br /> <br /> Finally, her daughter was torn between the two ways of life - the love she had for her mother and the advantages and the happiness and love that her father had. Be wealthy Stella alone and no one loves and doesn't want her daughter to become suffering like someday, making her the ultimate sacrifice. She gave up only the love and happiness she had ever known to guarantee the happiness of her daughter and perhaps live instead of hope and with the knowledge that at least her daughter found something. For life <br /> <br /> Now for the movie Everything is correct about it Beautiful score, shooting movies with art, great scene design (The difference between the two lifestyles, the proper mess and the decorating mansion), the wonderful and sincere performance by all the actors, especially Bette Midler. Oscar <br /> This is an important film and created. Come too well for you to believe
