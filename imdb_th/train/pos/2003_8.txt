The main problem of the movie "Vampire". The first story is that there is no sympathetic character. The carpenter learns from his mistakes and this time using a cute vampire hunter and a vampire with a charming vampire. Female Una is the coolest vampire since Blade's Deacon Frost. Unfortunately, while having a good idea, like a shop scene A cold slow-motion food (why the carpenter doesn't use it more than this?) This movie has no place as good as it should be. I expect to see a strong vampire in action and at least one battle sequence that has been designed for a long time again. (For example, in the city) and quite disappointed, while "Los Muertos" performed at a faster speed than its predecessor, it still dragged slightly in some parts. (Although there is nowhere near as bad as "vampires") like "Vampires", but the focus of this film is near the end. Very mild. <br /> <br /> Most of the things mentioned above may sound like "Los Muertos" is a bad movie It's fun and is a better type for the genre. It's not a traditional Draakea remake (like almost every other vampire movie) and it's not a clever action game like Blade II. It should be used. A little more excitement. <br /> <br /> I want to see the third part made by Carpenter, but it may not happen. <br /> <br /> Spoiler warns. The ending is way too predictable. Una should disappear - which makes this movie somewhat strange.
