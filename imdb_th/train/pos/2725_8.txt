"In Cold Blood" adapted by director Richard Brooks from the famous novel Truman Capote, which deals with the brutal and unconscious murder of a family of four by one unlucky criminal This film has the expertise to study the character of the murderer, especially Trigger-Man Perry Smith (Robert Blake). <br /> <br /> The actors include names. Few known people Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are excellent together as two criminals with different personalities. They played easily while Blake was given many opportunities to explore the character of his character. The remaining actors are just average and not worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks has been nominated for his Academy Award and his direction. In my opinion, both are excellent. But the script is wrong with incorrect descriptions at the end The film that was nominated for an Academy Award by Conrad Hall was as great as editing. What is worth remembering is the luxury rating by Quincy Jones, who has been nominated for 4 Academy Awards for the latest film. <br /> <br /> Unlike many other crime movies, the movie This is not violent. Brooks turns the murderer into a pathetic character rather than blame them. Whether you agree or not with confidence, the movie will offer an interesting alternative to the usual Hollywood approach. I recommend movies for this reason and for technical management expertise.
