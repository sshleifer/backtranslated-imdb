I followed the trip two years ago on the internet - now I have watched the movie !! What is it! And finally getting to know Darius Weems! It's a brave, intelligent and talented spirit! And the crew! To listen to Darius laughing from being in the water at Panama City to see his nervousness that is close to alligators in Louisiana. Surprised in his eyes as he rides a hot air balloon. Bet to eat one spoon of wasabi and the phone calls home. As always - boys are boys. Everyone must watch this movie, both young and old. Darius and his mother are examples of strength and courage. And the crew members are proof of the heart of the new generation They have Darius's new cart. They record access problems. They brought Darius to his life. And they have touched many lives This film will help Darius Goes West's final goal - DMD treatment.
