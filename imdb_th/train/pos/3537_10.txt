This game is the best Bond game I have ever played in my life. It is my favorite James Bond game until now because: <br /> <br /> The mission in this game is really fun. The fun of playing missions is much more. Action weapons that you use very well. Cars in this game are great. The mission of the car has many moves and is very fun to play. The voice actors are really good actors and it's great that Sean Connery made James Bond sound and it looks like Bond looks really cool because it looks like Sean Connery when he plays James Bond in movies and other characters as well as photos. Look in movies The graphics are quite good in the James Bond game. The following game, this film is quite beautiful. But not all But in most cases, this game scored great. <br /> <br /> Overall score ********** from ***** *****
