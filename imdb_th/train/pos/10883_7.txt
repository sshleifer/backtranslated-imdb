This is more surprising than the general fun slasher and well done with a fair gore! Every character is appropriate and the story is quite fun, plus Molly Ringwal plays a very annoying dog role. I bought this at a pawn shop for $ 1 and it was surprisingly worth it and the special effects were quite good for the budget, as well as I liked the mask that the killer was wearing because it was quite creepy. The ending is really cool because I like the way they beat the killer and the predictable ending is also funny, including all the characters, except Ringwal, is pretty cute! It was created and written appropriately, and I think it is quite creative and sometimes original as well. Some scenes of death are very impressive. This killer is not busy and I like it, and the Slasher fans (like myself) should enjoy this movie very much, plus the release, it's also evil when they filmed the movie! This is an above-average slasher that is surprisingly fun and well done. It has good blood and I say it's worth the watch! The direction is good. Kimble Rendall performed very well! Work here with stable camera work using a fantastic angle setting and make this movie fast. The performance is strong! Molly Ringwald plays as a bitch very well and I have a problem feeling sorry for her after she should be a heroine. She came out better at the end. However, she is doing well! Frank Roberts is a great person as an assassin. He is a terrifying, disgusting person and has a mask and this guy doesn't get messy. He's a great person! Kylie Minogue plays as a female bitch well in her small role. Jessica Napier is cute and well done like any other heroine. The rest of the actors are ok. Overall worth the look! *** from 5
