This may be one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I love it so much that I can remember most screenplays. (Especially the scene in the storage unit when Jerry Lee breaks) and even with the script in me My head still likes to watch it. For Jerry Lee, German Shepherd is hysterical and is tested to see who is smarter. The tag line is also true. Not to mention the great performances, even though Christine Tucci sounds whispered. (Check the work under the CSI if you don't know what I mean.) It's terrible that the film has only one version that Dooley and Jerry Lee have to work with. It would be cool to see the techniques that Zeus and Welles wear. Sleeve
