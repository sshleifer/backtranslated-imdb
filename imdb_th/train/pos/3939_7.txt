As John Ford shot the lyrics carefully, Abraham Lincoln's biography wore his greatest mistake, possibly the tediousness of women and the ability to dance in "The worst way" Ford's camera is just an appreciation that reveals the life of Mr Lincoln's childhood. But for what the movie lacks in the complexity of the characters, it's created for beauty and profound vision. The composition of the early movies, beautiful, unique, what seems to be a set of beautiful stills, Ford has unique eyes that are unique in storytelling. This film sings the lives of hopeful young men. Henry Fonda plays the role of Lincoln, a natural and intelligent contemplation for his best role. <br /> <br /> The film deals with two young men, brothers and sisters in the murders that both claim to have done. In the classic mob style that is furious, the city decides to use justice in their own hands and play their partner until the faithful Abe steps into the fight. He has charmed them with their humor, telling them not to rob him of his first big case and they are as good as Lynch as a male lawyer. The following seems to have become the whole courtroom layout - after that, Abe asked the witness of the joy and humor of the judge, jury and city before he stumbled upon the missing link. <Br /> <br /> This movie plays like John Ford's films, many stories, such as a tablespoon of Americana, a moderately predictable dash, a sarcastic remark that you are not sure if you put a formula R If Ford made. Despite the open feelings of Hollywood, films and patriotism beyond Lincoln's future presidency, this movie is fun and made fun if you can bring your drama too. Salt
