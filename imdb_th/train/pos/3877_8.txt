Coming from Canada, I can't say that this movie is original in the context of Danish cinema - but unfortunately we don't see many Danish movies in a year! I still can't comment on Clausen's performance in the context of my other roles - personally, I find him quite convincing - the surprise that can be felt by this man, Jorgen! For actors who played Kenneth - why his participation in the TV show made him an actor - why do we have that kind of attitude? Foreign viewers who do not know that Big Brother's participation will make him a fair actor. <br /> <br /> Despite the shortcomings of the movie (The writing may be more complex in some cases) The film's 'text' - is an important role of art in everyday life. Art as an art therapy power as Nietzsche says is a lie ('Kunst heiligt die Luege') It is a sacred lie: the wedding scene is incredible in this respect - a non-religious drama.
