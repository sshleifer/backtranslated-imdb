A thrilling and nasty retro-thriller action film about an escort who is determined to find (and destroy!) The killer of women he should protect. This film is almost unusual in the current political atmosphere. Director Scott has no desire to apologize for the inherent immorality behind the dramatic structure of the movie. Scott doesn't know or doesn't care about 30 years of social progress. I don't think we will watch movies that are more violent in no time, so you should watch this movie while you can. Despite the unstoppable horror, I think that this movie is a powerful example of the most horrific, useful and powerful movie. But i think i'm a buyer The special effects of this movie are more effective than I would ignore. Scott's director's choice was surprising and he pulled out a great performance from Denzel Washington. The delicate spirit must stay away from this. But I recommend to viewers who are looking for action-packed movies
