The story is being told fluently. No interruption Smooth flash back to the present Excellent actor selection. Young Ya'ara. It seems that Ya'ara looks like this age. The depiction of her blindness was done reliably. Director Daniel Syrkin did an excellent job of making many actors work together on this issue. The movie is very good. You feel that you are with Ya'ara and Talia. Walk through the ocean to the edge of the cliff. English subtitles closely follow the Hebrew script. It is interesting to note that although "Out of sight" is not a direct translation of "Lemarit Ayin", both names are very appropriate for the story.
