This movie surprised me. My friend told me that this movie is "Chicks Flicks". The boy is wrong! This film has an excellent family appeal without sex scenes like other movies. Jake Gyllenhaal performed very well in Homer Hickam's shoes. The supporting actors are also excellent. <br /> <br /> Science since the age of the family quarreled with the wonderful train scene ... The soundtrack was good, even though the score was presented somewhat choppy. The 50s song kicked the movie above greatness. <br /> <br /> The DVD is worth the use of coal. The replay value is very good - I've seen it many times.
