To a certain extent, I like this movie better than the original VAMPIRES. I found that the film has a lot of hate for women. As a woman and a horror movie fan, I'm used to the fact that women in danger are the core of the genre. But they hit Sheryl Lee too much In this film, Natasha Wagner is a character that is fully aware and the main villain is a girl! Arly Jover (who plays as a close friend in BLADE) is very worldly and dangerous Catch it on the cable if you can do it in Encore Action this month.
