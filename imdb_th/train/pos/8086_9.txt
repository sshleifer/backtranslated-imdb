I recently rented the animated movie of The Lord of the Rings in the video after watching the live version of the FANTASTIC 2001 live action film The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, directed by Peter Jack. Better than the ending of George Lucas' Star Wars "prequel" (Episode 1-3) will be the true fantasy film series of the 21st century!> <br /> I remember seeing the Ani version. Animation as a child and I do not understand the depth of the movie at the time. the Now I have read the book and I understand that the whole story is about anything. To make sure that some characters are quite stupid (Samwise Gangee is almost as annoying as Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode One (AWFUL!) But I have to say that it is quite close to the book. And it is part of the second book, The Two Towers. The good thing is that the action is quite interesting and some animation is quite outstanding for the time. The bad thing is that it ended halfway through the Two Towers without any effect from Frodo's quest to destroy one ring and the animation looked quite old compared to today's standards. <br /> <br /> Overall, not as bad as others say. But the live action version of 2001 is the highlight of The Lord of the Rings! At least Ralph Bakshi takes seriously the script! Peter Jackson said that the animation version inspired him to read a book, which allowed him to create one of the greatest fantasy series ever made in a movie, so at least we can thank mold. For this story! I will use the animation version of the Lord of the Rings to use the Harry Potter live version every day! <br /> <br /> 7 from scale 1-10 with less intensity than the live action version in 2001, but nowhere near good! For fans of books and movies, The Lord of the Rings
