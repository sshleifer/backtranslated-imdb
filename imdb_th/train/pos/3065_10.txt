<br /> <br /> I like this movie a lot. One of those rare movies that Hollywood didn't create anymore. William H Macy is great as a soul-killing killer and Neve Campbell is a wonderful person while women who make life His presence is in redemption. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance This movie. It has been praised.
