Kimi wa petto is a cute story about a woman who one day finds a boy in a box outside her apartment one day. She decided to bring him in and fix his wounds. Then she left the note for him to eat the food she had done and went home because she had to go to work. When she got home she found that he was still there. He told her that he wanted to be there with her like a brother or cousin. In desperation to leave him, she told him that if he became her pet, he could continue. And as a pet, she said he would not have the right to do what she told him (Not in the wrong way!) To surprise her, he agreed and then he was known as Momo, her pet.
