For those interested in business and the business world, this show is the best. As one of the former contestants of the program written on his blog about this innovative show: People in the business eventually have an audience. All the ideas are perfect. Having a group of businessmen competing in a business-related event is located in the best place in the world. New York City Donald Trump is perfect as a boss, although his ego is bigger than every universe. In addition, he made a suspicious decision about who will shoot, which is one of the negatives about the show. <br /> <br /> Season 1: A great season overall, the best season of the season. " Normal "This season is the season with the most business skills. Later in the series almost drowned in a marketing job that involved too many product positions. The contestants are great and interesting. Overall, there are characters that are the most favorite in this series: Troy. I know I'm not the only one who suspects that the Trump World Tower episode that he was fired for is given. Amy and Nick win this event. <br /> <br /> Season 2: Great season as well. The work is still quite ok and there are many interesting contestants. Jen M is terrible and shouldn't do it the most. This season IMO has the worst shot ever (Pamela) <br /> <br Season 3: Terrible. Actually, I like the concept of clever books with Street smarts, but the actors are so terrible. (It turns out that Trump hates actors too) that the whole season is a total disaster. The best time is the second episode. (Motel renovations) by PM Brian shot people who didn't add anything except a lot of comedy. <br /> <br /> Season 4: The season is great because it's interesting and fun. The contestants of this season (especially Randall, Alla, Marcus and all the disasters named Toral) episode "Take me out to the meeting room" is one of the complete classics of this performance ended with a shot. Four times as well remembered Sadly, I think we were robbed of Randall and Alla in the finals. I think Trump is afraid that she will win and prevent this from happening. <br /> <br /> Season 5: A boring season with nothing special for it. Brent was just a shame and was clearly just to create a drama. Overall work is very bad. (How do you create a jingle?) I guess the best man wins. But personally I don't care less. <br /> <br /> Season 6: I can see why they want to try LA as a new place for showing mistakes. New York will be A place for this thing always This season, adding a lot of new things, mostly bad. (For example, losing the team that had to sleep outside in the tent, winning the PM is still a PM, for example). The job is terrible and Trump chose the wrong winner as well. James definitely deserves. <br /> <br /> Season 7: Celebrity The best season Totally different rules (such as using rolodexes) but all fun and entertainment The biggest problem is that many contestants are not really celebrities, especially women that everyone doesn't know me, except Omarosa, which is a disgrace to everything she participates in. This is the season of Gene Simmon. After he was completely stupid himself during the Kodak event, others emerged from the shadows: Pier Morgan No one has ever dominated the season as he did. He crushed his opponents and found that he was a good humorist. (Although some Americans with depression (Not every American, of course, don't misunderstand) Sad, no social skills to understand it. <br /> <br /> For the fans of this game, I would like to introduce the UK version starring Sir Alan Sugar. As head In fact, the English version is better and it says something from American. (And traditional) is a truly wonderful show One thing about the UK version is that contestants often behave as good humans in the meeting room, which is different from shouting and vulgar behavior that occurs in the US version.
