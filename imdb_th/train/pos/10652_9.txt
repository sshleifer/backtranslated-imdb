I don't know why critics left this movie. I almost disagree with them. <br /> <br /> This movie is a bit scary - I don't usually go to watch horror movies! I still have to make myself see it in the daytime. I don't want to bother! ;) (The cinema is full of kids with Hm!) ... Liam is a great person. As always, I also like Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell) <br /> > The house has gothic beauty and is very beautiful. Special effects and great sound I like music scores, especially gentle songs for Eleanor and her travels, to help children how she grows from her routine and still life.
