It started to slow, showing the boring life of two housewives who decided to rent a castle in Italy in April. But don't give up Nothing happens But time elaborated and there were many jokes (My favorite is to ride a horse carriage in the storm, which I find hilarious). (Like Polly Walker) and the resolution in this movie is very satisfying. <br /> <br /> The movie takes a couple of liberty with The greatest book in the business, Arbuthnot / Briggs / Dester, but I like the version of the film. (May be more sensitive But I feel that it is more consistent with the tone of the story and I like the feeling When done well) <br /> <br /> Great movie, especially movies, days in bad weather.
