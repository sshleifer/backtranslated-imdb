I would not be surprised if Soderbergh was pressured to avoid the Cuban revolution as graphic damage as before. Surfing a few statistics will not make the crowd younger. Still part of which almost all were shot in the forest to capture the feeling of that place, especially when exploring the mountainous areas of Cuba I like Del Toro's interpretation of Che Guevara's personality. And actors who play Castro Bishops also perform well Obviously, Soderbergh didn't insult these people. But it is clear that he will not plead their case to be 'yanquis', which is far from the past Some important historical aspects conflict with what I read. According to my knowledge, Castro did not go to court in the Soviet Union until all attempts to be accepted by the United States were exhausted. But on the other side, he was right, especially the plunder by foreigners while controlling other rebellions.
