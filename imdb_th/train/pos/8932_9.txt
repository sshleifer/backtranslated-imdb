This film is not an attractive image in ordinary terms. It doesn't offer a set of beautiful pictures. It's an interesting movie instead. It forces the audience to run all the time or may imagine the context of various shots. This thing is easy to try. But difficult to succeed This film refuses to use the crutches of the genre to help the less engaging audience receive what has happened. Instead of touching movies and moving through many different genres, the secret to love this movie is being able to enjoy this playfulness. I wonder if 99% of North American viewers won't get it. If you try to describe the story of this film or philosophical text or symbol structure, etc., you will waste time. Without these things This movie has a trick for these and other genres. The only thing that combines the power in the movie is Claire Denise's feelings that are perfect. There are a few lengthy films that are similar to Kant's descriptive descriptions that what art is: enjoyment in the power of judgment rather than just experience under the concept. Movies often use simple and selective methods to make it easier to understand what happens. Most movies are not art. Most movies do not approach art. When the movie did as the film did and still enjoyed a large audience, it was a miracle. My negative opinion is that sometimes I find that this film is too easy to buy into various lecture topics that run through. The story of the father-son of Tahiti, though not as normal. But ended up doing things clearly and simply It's too overwhelming
