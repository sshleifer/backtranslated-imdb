Hey guys, <br /> <br /> I watch everywhere to find these two movies and I can't find them anywhere in my area. (I'm an Australian) Can you help me and tell me where I can buy it from General Home Ward Bound 1 and 2, which is the best movie I have ever seen and good for people of all ages. It was my favorite movie when I was 5 years old and still is now when I'm a teenager. It's a great movie for the whole family. Everyone in my family loves this movie except my sister because I have watched it many times that she is sick. I love this movie and I can't wait until I buy it again on DVD. <br /> <br /> Sally
