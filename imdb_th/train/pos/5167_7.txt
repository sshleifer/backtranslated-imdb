I must say that the worst part of this movie is the first half hour. I'm really confused about who it is. For example, Bill Paxson's character has long hair and wears a jacket. Then, when every man came to the camp, it appeared that there was a character that looked like Bill Paxson, but not me. Where did Bill Paxson say? Then there was a man and his girlfriend. He said that she is 21 years old. This should be the most memorable 20 years of the director (Alan Arkin). Later, the same girl interacted and talked about her camp experience. Not reasonable She should be one year old. That said that the movie came out very well. Kevin Pollak is a good person who is always joking A man is completely narcissistic and ends up losing his beautiful girlfriend. Alan Archin is interesting as an old camp director who admits that he has grown up and doesn't know about modern youth. The best part is that there is no one who succeeds in life. No one has a great career. Looks like a real life This movie is compared to The Big Chill. In some ways, it's not as exciting as Big Chill. But it is more realistic Therefore, even if the beginning is not promised But the movie became a good movie
