I believe it is a joke that is a parody that is the main point of reference. <br /> <br /> Although the format is important and boring for today's audiences It doesn't waste time. <br /> <br /> Although being a student movie is an excuse. But the evidence is that it appears with caution in a small budget. None. <br /> According to other reviewers, it is less than ten minutes long enough to clean the ceiling Watch with fun, enjoy, sit back and relax. <br /> <br /> I think the short bread of this movie should be as happy as an appetizer for reference. And the audience should relax and roll with it.
