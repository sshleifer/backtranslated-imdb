I like the way EARTH makes. Unbelievable photography, editing must be an interesting challenge and the sound of Patrick Stewart is perfect. In addition, music and sound editing also makes EARTH viewing a profound experience that you shouldn't miss. You are traveling to a place where you may never meet yourself. <br /> <br /> And although at first I was very surprised by the laughter of the audience that we saw animals fighting for Their survival every day, I can't help myself laugh sometimes. Nature seems to be too impressive to understand. <br /> <br /> But instead of having to laugh, I left the theater with profound questions: "The 200-year industrial revolution can destroy the natural system that has been here for thousands. Thousands of years? "<br /> <br /> With this question, you will understand that I feel bitter and powerless after seeing the world. I felt the need to change the world to help all these animals in their struggle to cancel the changes that we have taken over the centuries and to stop the global warming immediately. (All non-NGO activists!) ... <br /> <br /> So I visited the website mentioned at the end of the movie immediately to see what I could do to save the amazing world of we (And polar bears) from a depressing fate .. (www.loveearth.com) <br /> <br /> I was a little disappointed that I didn't find the answer to my question there. Even so, it was very interesting to know more about this film and the team's struggle was over. <br /> <br /> I hope that reducing my energy consumption will be possible. I don't know how to reduce the distance to a polar bear. Swim to the land before they drown or attack animals that they can't overcome in a state of exhaustion ... <br /> <br / > Inspiring movies, but I didn't leave the cinema, feeling very happy.
