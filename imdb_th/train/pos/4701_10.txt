"Roman Troy Moronie" is my opinion about the movie. There is nothing to say again. <br /> <br /> This character causes mental retardation in a strong gangster Moronie who cannot pronounce profanity well. It seems frustrating to look uncomfortable and still cannot express <br /> <br /> Roman Moronie will go into the history of the movie as one of the greatest morons of all. <br /> <br /> There is definitely a good joke in Among other characters Mich ael Keaton is F.A.H. and likewise Joe Piscipo <br /> <br /> I like the fact that Moroni keeps the movie at the "R" level because he can't pronounce rude.
