Usually I do not like reality shows, especially those that profit from the success of "American Idol", but I can live with this person. <br /> <br /> Comedians from around the world make a short routine. For famous scouts and if they like them they will be stationed for a real audience. Then, ten or twelve cartoons will be chosen to live in the house together and compete in style. "Survivors" using funny tricks Then will be considered "Last Comic Standing". I like to stand up to be funny, so this is one of the reality shows that I'm interested in. There are usually funny cartoons selected through it. Begin your career with talents such as Alonzo Bodden, Ralphie May and Josh Blue. <br /> <br /> My negative criticism is the fact that there is a possibility that Many of these cartoons have been chosen to support the reality of the drama. At first they lived together in the house, such as "Big Brother" but now they have done it. Thank God. <br /> <br /> And There are many comedians that I know Over selected not because they were funny, but because of race, ethnicity, gender, attitudes, etc. When other cartoon should clearly overcome them away. But overall, it's a well-established reality show that has two terms. Until now, I thought it was oximon.
