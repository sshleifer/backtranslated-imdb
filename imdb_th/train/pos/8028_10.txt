This is the best movie I've ever seen !!! Thomas Beckett and Richard Miller - Two human beings who want to survive in the "jungle" of violence and madness - one is killed !! You have to kill if you have questions about certain things. You must survive !! <br /> <br /> P.P.- I beg that I am bad / worst / English !!!
