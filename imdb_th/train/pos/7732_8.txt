The performance in this film is excellent. The conversation was great. Jason Patric presented a great performance as a "boy" Collins in the adaptation of Jim Thompson's great novel, "The Grifters", which is a good movie. Remains true to the story of the pulp / noir movie, which is the source of the story I recommend this movie to all noir movie fans.
