Although Cher and Cage are the whole point of this story, Gardenia and Dukakis are good partners for them - this is where Loretta and Ronny will be in 50 years - still having love. All actors performed well from Aiello to John Mahoney-It shows the true life. Although I have seen this thing for a long time - I'm glad that it finally shot Cage to the place where he was accepted in Hollywood for his abilities. From music to scenes in opera houses to kitchen tables, this is a fun movie.
