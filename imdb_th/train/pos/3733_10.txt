I have an uncle who committed suicide after serving in Vietnam because of the psychological problems he encountered after returning. So when I saw a part of this movie one night in the paid channel for watching, I was amazed. I want to know what my uncle did and how he felt when he was ready for Vietnam. I went out and rented this movie and I must say that it is the most horrible movie I've ever seen. I bought the DVD immediately after renting it. The way to pull you in many ways is emotionally something that I never touched with other movies. As far as the movie Vietnam is released, I think it is the best movie, even though Platoon will run close to that. In addition to all that, I think it's Colin Farrell's best performance as an actor. I like him in most of his movies. But in this film he is incredible I rate this 10 because it's one of the five movies I like best.
