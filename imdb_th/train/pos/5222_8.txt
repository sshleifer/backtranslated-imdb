After Chicago, I started to lose respect for Richard Gere and the crowd came. Have a good smile and a few smiles on your face that can give you But he proved to me that he eventually got his craft Claire Dens is excellent as his "trainee / representative". Some suggest that there is too much unnecessary violence. But I don't see that Nothing I saw that deviated from the power of this film. I was really shocked that I had never heard that it was released in the cinema and found it at Blockbuster instead. It was a really great movie with a perfect combination between action, excitement, excitement and good social consciousness As much as 7even? Maybe and you will see better performances of Gere than everyone who gets from Pitt.
