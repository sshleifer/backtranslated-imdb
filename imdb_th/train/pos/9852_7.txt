Never passed without a new animated computer animation, so we had the opportunity to see more good effects after watching Ice Age. I felt that it didn't have a big impact on me. Other movies of this type <br /> <br /> But it's because now I'm a Big Guy and I'm pretty sure this is The movie is very fun for children (up to 14). The story is quite simple and "actors" are funny in a cute way. There is no humor, rough or complex. Those jokes And the story ends happily, which is a little disappointment for me (Knowing that most of the main characters are doomed to extinction in a sad way) but are good for children and in addition to some battles that no one dies (Not even when he had been ravaged by many mammoths) that caused a comic feeling. <br /> <br /> The computer animation is good. But nothing special Comic scenes are really good feelings when you feel like walking in a good drawing or cartoon page. [Which means there is still a lot of work!] <br /> <br /> There are some gags that make me smile - I agree. The creators try to meet those adults - but they are hard to see and good. than (In my opinion) nobody noticed it because it didn't feel like it. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good movie. But it is quite an animal that is suitable for children and the world for children If you don't hate cute animals that make funny things look at least once
