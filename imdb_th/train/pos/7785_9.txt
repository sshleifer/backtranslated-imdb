I just watched the movie of Brother Pang 2 on The Eye and One. Only received when I watched The Eye. I was disappointed about these two men, which I had heard good words about them before. That movie (The Eye) has a very bad chapter, especially the ending (kids are bored and too coincidentally in my opinion), but it's still good in photography and experimentation. So I decided to see One take only and I was not disappointed again. Great photography, beautiful images, MTV style editing, cool music, and at this time, a lot of indie spirits, logical and beautiful, you'll see some small channels, one problem story about movies. This story is I got a bad DVD.
