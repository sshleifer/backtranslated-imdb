We finally got the TV series that we saw in the show! One episode is great! The script gives us a little more normal. Yes, there are still. "I am not your father - I am your father. Garbage, but the script allows actors to feel and use those real moments rather than show us how it feels if there is a lot of television soap. <br /> <br /> The camera's work makes us a little more normal, with no repetitive images in boring corners for hours. But without "Capture inside the camera or mobile crap camera" to add "art" edge. It gives us what we want to see and also have beautiful scenery pictures as well! <br /> <br /> There's nothing beyond reality or true. They are real people in real places that deal with real situations. The show has nothing in the drama and is completely relevant. It is a relief to experience the true and delightful performance that our country sees as how talented our actors are when getting a real role as a real opportunity! Thank you Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, Channel Ten and all the actors and teams - great work !! Please continue what you are doing, your efforts are appreciated and do not go unnoticed!
