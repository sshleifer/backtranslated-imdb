Sandra Bernhard's film without you, I have nothing. This film was released in 1990, followed by the heels of her Broadway musical production in 1988 ... what she and people Others talk about this movie. "<br /> <br /> There are many changes in the collection and the screenplay, and the movie version can be edited again, making Sandra from being at the top. Yeah As a successful stage actor in New York while she calls her "summer superstar", an almost desperate illusion, returns to her home in Los Angeles S-manager wearing her role in the film, referring to it as Sandra back "With her roots to ..." <br /> <br /> There is a point to do here. Sandra is trying to attract her liberal worldview, and sometimes she criticizes American pop culture violently to a completely invisible audience in LA. She is playing with most black viewers trying to connect. Her thoughts when these people seem to want to be "Shashonna" dancers like Madonna. And at that time with the dance of Shashonna to the drums that are similar to "Like the Virgin", there is not much to say for the audience to enjoy the show The scene in the club throughout the movie is blowing over the bones. The funny scene that will be captured by the young man, the audience, help Shashonna from her pants. <br /> <br /> But if you're going down, Sandra is following the style and strength, vulnerability ... to the point that she is naked. (Indeed), pleading for acceptance and still swimming in the swimming pool of her transparent star. Describing her interactions with the likes of Calvin Klein, Jerry Lewis, Bianca Jagger, Ralph Lauren and (what we believe is) Warren Beatty is a character and hilarious. <br /> <br /> Sandra starts the show. In her Her most awkward moments, quiet action But the mystery of Nina Simone's song "Four Women" while dressing with other Muslims and Africans. "My skin is black" "My hair is fur" and "They call me cute things." <br /> <br /> She resurrected and celebrated the ghosts of geothermal art in a funny explanation. Much of Andy Warhol's crazy estate auction: "Let Andy have intelligence and sensitivity. Hours and hours of hard work and labor that enters the Indian products ... They are lucky to get money from what this Santa Fe all happened. "<br /> <br /> She explains the abundance. Of Hollywood Comforting the hopeful friend and warning him that "Mr. If it's Ishtar's story, I'll get up. Now and walk away from your life forever because it is too self-centered for me! "<br /> <br /> Sandra shows the expectations of women in the era of feminism. Sandra dressed as a cosmo girl, creating a new girl's fantasy story to be the executive secretary and marry her boss. Eventually she concluded with relief. "I will never be a statistic, not me. I'm under 35 and I will marry!" <br /> <br /> Sandra shows social openness: "When he touches you at night, it feels right. Or is it really a feeling? I think it gives the true feeling ... MIGHTY true. "<br /> <br /> Finally she cried for a progressive change. American society by creating the Strait of Disco Patrick Li and Sylvester and declaring that "In the end, everyone will be scared!" <br /> <br /> All of this happened in the form of plays, songs written and created by Billy Paul, Burt Bacharach, Hank Williams and Laura Nyro to name a few. At the same time, the birthplace of Sandra is ideal - the mirror image she created herself - floating around the city, a beautiful black model with flowing outfits and a bustier, reading Kabala, studying chemistry and listening to rap music. NWA <br /> <br /> In my absence, I have nothing. Sandra Bernhard explores the emotions and living things that until then, she just played as a guest late at night with David Letterman. will be Like her children, for the shock of the show throughout the 80's, was thrown into the midst of the glamor and her confidence in the confrontation with the materialist and famous American. This funny method will change the direction of Sandra forever and mark the entertainment that is more mature and more polite. <br /> <br /> If you like the delicate humor to the point of participation In jokes about glamor Despair and shyness of love and kinship, this movie will make you courageous It may not be a joke on the board. Maybe it will make you uncomfortable But consider the emptiness of the world that Sandra envisioned for you and you will understand that she is really funny and wonderful. <br /> <br /> But see that you don't have anything I have with friends. "Who knows" because it's more fun than you think Before you know that the two of you will trade Sandra thorns and confuse others.
