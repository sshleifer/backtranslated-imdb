This is a good example of a good dumb movie. No, it's not advanced art. Or a script anywhere near Woody Allen or Mel Brooks, but what! The Killer Tomatoes series (four movies and comic series) is a good-natured scene that trampled with love on the land that Zuckers ruled before they switched to serious movies. <br /> <br / > By title The fourth episode of the Tomato Dealer trilogy with the French Killer Tomatoes plot. In this case, Professor Gangrene (the third role of John Astin) plans to rule France through ancient prophecies about the return of the righteous king. France, Steve Lundquist, returns as Igor Tomato, a man who wants to be an athlete and who has just become a deceased person for the long-lost real king of France. Apparently he played the aforementioned role. K, F happily speaking French. <br /> <br /> Opposite to them is Fuzzy Tomato, who is not afraid (like everyone else) FT. Was introduced in the second film Characters in the cartoon) and his human allies The recently unemployed Mark Price, which is the result of the conclusion of the FAMILY TIES series, plays a disguised version of himself through "Michael J Fox" as a way to win the girl of his dreams. And Angela Visser is a dream, as Marie, bounces back and forth between undaunted virgins and boundary psychosis. Oh, the former Miss Netherlands has more acting professionals! Another member of the tomato killer stock company is Rick Rockwell. (Now known as the unfortunate title of "Who wants to marry a millionaire?") Like the creator John De Bello, the Rockwell collaborator works on both the front and back of the camera in this series. <br /> <br /> What do you say about Jon De Bello? Not much, except that he has a unique vision and can pull it out. John, if you've seen this, thank you for giving the killer tomatoes to us. <br /> <br /> The script is serious. But not disgusting to know that this is just a movie As with the return of the killer tomatoes, sometimes the action will divert the scene from the scene and enter the middle of the movie team. And Mark Price has a funny forum to complain about his lack of success compared to Michael J Fox in his past. This is the biggest budget of Killer Tomatoes flicks and is a series of submissions. good OK, the show moved to Fox Kids as a cartoon series. (Which is quite smart) but the cartoon is not the same
