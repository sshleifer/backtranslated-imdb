This film shows the life of northern Cameroon from the perspective of a French girl, Daniel Lada Lens, whose father was a colonial government officer (France) and a family of a few white families. It gives a feeling of how life is for both the colonists and the native people they are involved. It's a feeling that is consistent with other films I've seen about Africa at the same time (Nirgendwo in Afrika (2001)), but I don't know if it's realistic or normal. It's not just an impression - things happen in the movie - but the plot is easy to understand. The audience was left to draw their own conclusions rather than forcing the filmmakers to shoot, although the framing of the story was a retrospective after visiting a girl in south-west Cameroon while adults looked at the view
