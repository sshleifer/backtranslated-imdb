This movie is about this scary guy who decided to be a spy for this famous high-tech company, Digicorp Morgan (Jeremy North), not happy with the miserable suburban life of He and his wife claim, so he decided to be a spy. He should go to a meeting with other high-tech companies and find all the plans of the company. Morgan found himself interested in a beautiful woman. (Played by Lucy Liu) and both companies are forced to become repetitive agents How can Morgan rid himself of this? Can he trust the beautiful but mysterious Rita Foster (played by Lucy Liu)? And more importantly, can Morgan make life lively? Wow! It's a really good movie! I was completely sucked after 15 minutes of watching this movie. It is very suspicious and you can feel Morgan's fear and confusion as he tries his best to live. The scene in which they put this horrible contraception on Morgan's head to brainwash him creepy and scary. Morgan had to go through a slow personality change that wasn't clear until you thought about it after the movie ended. He became a man who fought hard for his life. <br /> <br /> The ending, Wow, the ending is incredible! The twist is so fun! It made me gasp and cheer like crazy! Good performances from all corners, especially from Jeremy Natham, Lucy Liu and Nigel Bennett. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie!
