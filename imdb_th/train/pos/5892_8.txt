Thomas Ince always draws for bringing a simple home story to a complete and witty life. "Italy" is such a movie. Strong performances, especially by George Beban, the father of the silent child actor George Beban, Jr. and the wonderful scenes conveying the real feelings of the early immigrants in New York. True in 1915, which is unusual in this vintage style. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a modern day and a man (George Beban in modern clothes). Read stories about immigrants. The Italian and Then we changed into a story by George as a immigrant. He earns enough money to bring his fianc√© from Italy to America, marry her and have a son with her. But hard times and families struggling for survival I found myself wondering why her mother did not breastfeed and avoid complications with dirty formulas. But well, though the Dream Factory will push for the correct political behavior for women in 1915! <br /> <br /> The best scene in the picture is when Beban has a chance to seek revenge on the criminals who are taken prisoner Inadvertently and at the last minute he decided against his plans. I liked the curtain effect. It was great. Using great light in this movie <br /> <br /> I gave "The Italian" 8 in 10
