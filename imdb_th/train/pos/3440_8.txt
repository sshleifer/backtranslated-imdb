Love Rosario Dawson thinks she is one of the best female actors in the modern era. <br /> <br /> The descent seems to have more power than himself. It corresponds to everything in the movie. The dialog is flat, the character seems to be gentle and on one side. The only consistency is the representation of self-empowerment in the character and the journey of Rosario, from empowering himself to losing power and returning again. <br /> <br /> Many people do not enjoy the movie. The 'rape' audience will not like this particular movie and may be an issue. This film asks more questions than answers, and it encounters the target group, whether they like it or not. There is an interesting relationship between the character and the target group, and while the film does not hit the audience around the face with self-courage, it makes the audience participate in what may or may not be. Is the whole reason.> <br /> Descent is a good movie that IMHO is rated too low.
