warning! Front spoiler! <br /> <br /> Spoiler <br /> <br /> I've watched movies in Germany, so it may be that I missed the clue. <br /> <br /> Despite being weak In the story, it was the movie that came to me. I especially like the performance of Lexa Doig. Sometimes I feel that you * are Camille, but I can't help but wonder what happened at the end with Bob Cassie and the child. I believe her after starting to put Bob, eventually ending up in love with him and regretting what happened to his brother and being forced to lie to him. Otherwise it is strange that she will hold the baby and love it. It depends on the audience to decide - and I don't like the ending. Dean Cain did well. As always, Eric Roberts .. I've seen him better but worse. <br /> <br /> I believe this movie. It analyzes human relationships and responds to more unexpected situations. The crime story <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that I like it a lot.
