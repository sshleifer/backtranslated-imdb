This finely crafted production has dug deep into my sweetness. Respected students, driver's life, bitterness and personality of teachers present a mild discussion when the story is revealed. Every adult character looks familiar to my teacher, my bus driver, the opinions of each person are reliable and well known. When important events occur on the bus, we will be sent to the circuit of the viewpoint. At all times, the babbling of teen energy just kept under control by the organizers of the trip. Mr. Harvey is constantly experiencing pain. He reminded me of the war, a corrupt teacher that I didn't understand when I was a disrespectful student. <br /> <br /> Rhidian Brook and the producers deserve great admiration for British films with good shape Performances that are not outstanding, appropriate scenes should be used extensively. But doesn't seem to get the right opportunity
