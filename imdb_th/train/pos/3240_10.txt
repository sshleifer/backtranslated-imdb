I accidentally found this movie many years ago & wondered at that time. (Still doing) why it's not getting the praise that it should have A good writing, a beautiful performance, a satire, one after another, and a credibility in what evil characters are trying. I will not recommend this movie for people with short attention span. It requires sufficient intelligence to understand that there may be a kernel of truth in this matter.
