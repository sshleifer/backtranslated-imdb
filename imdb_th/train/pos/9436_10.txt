"Everything is up to you, Ed." "Now you will play the game." The day that my father left my mother took me to watch this movie with his new girlfriend on the opening day at Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. I am only fourteen years old I'm not even sure that what I have seen But I will never forget it, especially with the scene of Ned Betty. <br /> <br /> See today, thirty-six years later. <br /> <br /> My father is a big fan. Burt Reynolds' s lot, so the reason to stand in line for almost an hour to see what should be "Action Movies" I have seen two movies at the previous dome: "Grand Prix" and "The Song of Norway". This is not exactly Mario Andretti or The Brady Bunch. After leaving the theater, I was shocked. br /> <br /> But even in my age I still admire the art ... and after seeing it again today <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that it was a painful experience for a fourteen-year-old boy who had never kissed his first girlfriend. I don't blame my father for taking me. But it is a small matter for children to be witnesses. <br /> <br /> As an adult, I still find it quite disturbing. But I'm still very impressed The quality of filmmaking <br /> <br /> Bert Reynolds is truly astonishing as all the principles ... from Billy Red as a guitar that is strange. Come to Ronnie Cox as an insurance seller ... Everyone is admirable. The sound quality is second to none, from chirping birds to ticking clocks. Taking pictures of movies ... All the technical aspects of this incredible movie are the first. <br /> <br /> Moral questions that arise from the killing of the sex killer until the consequences of the deal. And the killing of humans is still Today is as profound as they did when this innovative movie was released. And the classic sequence of trying to survive in the wilderness after dealing with such unforeseen cruelty as life changes The four men of the city face a situation that has never been imagined before. Elevated from action to horror. <br /> <br /> It's a classic game that must be sure, and the phrase "You have a beautiful mouth" is right. Came endlessly, from Saturday Night Live to the outings of reviews about cool water machines that work on this film. There is no doubt that most of our social pop culture ... A posture that "makes my day" or "I'll come back" <br /> <br /> So what do you do if you find that your friend has been sexually assaulted by a mountain guy far from your life? In the city, comfortable bed, wife and children? And if you take measures Burt Reynolds do (and I will do the same) you will bury beneath the lake shortly or will try your chance? The bottom line is: Delivering, you can take it to the bank. If this film is not under your skin, it means that you are not a human. <br /> <br /> Even if you've seen this before, rent it again and ask yourself the question above. <br /> < br /> The part that I like in the movie remains the same: Ed can't kill the deer ... then change Life and unpredictable situations can change humans. And I think that's what this film is about Jon Voight, especially Ed, which gives the best performance here. And he remains one of the most talented actors in Hollywood history, from midnight cowboys to humble performances like Franklin D. Roosevelt in Pearl Harbor. His performance raised the film. Climb to the rock at dusk, fearful and determined to correct it. It must be believed that must be seen. I guarantee that your heart rate will rise to a new level. <br /> <br /> Fast, tense and tense like a banjo line. This is a moral play that asks questions that are still present. Time has changed But our choices as human beings are not <br /> <br /> ten in ten stars
