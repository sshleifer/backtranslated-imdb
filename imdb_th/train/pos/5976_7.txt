Trick or Treat Quickie Review The hectic story of this film deals with the heavy metal culture and horror movies of the 80s - two things that I love deeply. As you can imagine, this movie easily attracts me. Moreover, for reasons that are not clear, Ozzy Osbourne plays as a preacher. <br /> <br /> This film is about a famous high school student who is like all of us who were defeated in the world of heavy metal. "His favorite Metaldude died and certainly miraculously resurrected - by playing the latest unpublished album. This will help the singer who has been drafted to kill people with demons and they * help out. <br /> <br /> Okay, it's wonderful sometimes. But you know what? There are a number of surprisingly good qualities. Appropriate performances (Including Gene Simmons as a radio DJ), great special effects, short nudity, good atmosphere ... In conclusion, it's a really good horror movie. But what really suck is music Ridiculous, right? Well, this metal man "uber-evil" is one of the most obnoxious, lamenting, Motley Crue rejected on the world - and "metal" is slightly less than the pop / wool of the 80s. Here, whether it's walking around the fairies, fairy tales, to looking for the average to screaming "Rock and Roll !!!" At a level that is high enough to make King Diamond retch apart from being a cruel musical representative, it is quite good. 7/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard. com
