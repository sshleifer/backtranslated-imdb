First of all, I must say that I am a Portuguese, and it is not unusual for me to spend time watching Portuguese movies, maybe one each year, or even without ... <br /> <br /> ... and The reason is The idea is almost normal between Portuguese people that the national image is scary, close to the worst thing that has ever happened! However, in the last decade it began to surprise me when we came back to comedy in the 40s when "Leão da Estrela" e "Costa do Castelo" was one of the best of their time with movies like " Pulsação Zero "or" Sorte Nula ", both from director Fernando Fragata and with some actors and musicians. <br /> <br /> This one is good, not the same as it is not really funny. Formal drama, drama of the woman Which has some unexpected, funny causes of funny characters or hilarious things that happened to them, such as assuming a trip to the Caribbean to put <br /> <br /> the plot works and may Surprised us a few times; Good performer, normal place is the score; But the truth is that it makes all the sense, and then we can count as a good effort for the national cinema that seems to start from the ashes as the phoenix. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch Portuguese movies, of course, you can choose better.
