How do I get it: When I started watching this series on Cartoon Network, I must say that I had never seen anything like this before and it was the best. But when I started compiling the series on VHS and many years later on the DVD of the Anime Legends collection of Bandai, it's amazing and worth watching. There are many explosions that will leave you in the seat. And of course the song "Just Communication" and Rhythm Emotions "is the best song. <br /> <br /> Characters and Gundams: The characters I like in the show are: Heero, Duo, Relena, Treize, Lady Und, Noin and Zechs Gundam I like the most favorite items are Wing Zero and Epyon and of course Altron and Deathscythe I and II. <br /> <br /> The meaning of the show: what this series tells us That in real life the war is very difficult and sometimes we can win or lose But peace is hard to get and I believe that the Gundam pilots are doing the right thing and are Trying to receive world peace. <br /> <br /> However, this performance is truly the best. So, to close this review after you watch this program, watch Movie Endless Waltz.
