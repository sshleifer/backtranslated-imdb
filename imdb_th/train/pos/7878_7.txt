When the story of my family went, my father Milton Raskins played the piano for Dorsey. After Sinatra joined the band, my father trained with him for hours until the end. Then, at one time, my father told Sinatra that he was actually a good person to be tied to a small group (and a band) and he should take himself away. At that time Sinatra had credit. 'Enough under his belt' to do so! Dorsey never forgave my father and the rest was history. <br /> <br /> I have pictures and records of that impact and Berkley University in California. <br /> <br /> I can. Saw all Sinatra movies more than I wanted to say and his movies were not old.
