This is a real gem piece of Americana for everything shown. If you are programmed to resist the story "Exciting life" just stay away and let the rest of us still believe. And what makes the frost on the cake truly delicious is the fact that according to the story of rags and riches, there is no need to choose what the details have changed to make the story compact. Chris Cooper is one of the live actors. The greatest and complex self-contradiction is good for the main father he shows that can be successfully pulled out by somebody. With skill and insight. The simple opinion in mind refused to accept the father who tried to put the law while feeling that he might be out of the way, revealing the limitations of the critic, not the writer or the show. This is not for others or ordinary people.
