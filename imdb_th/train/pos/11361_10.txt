Even though I saw this movie many years ago, its effects never left me. The description of Stephen Rea's Invetigator is deep and moving. His anguish that could not stop death was obvious. Everyone on the cast was amazing from Sutherland, who tried to help him and provide a way for the police to coordinate their efforts for the problematic citizen. X Every day when we are attacked by the story of many murderers, I miss this movie And the tiring work that people are trying to find the murderer
