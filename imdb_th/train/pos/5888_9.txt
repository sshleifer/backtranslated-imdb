I can watch this movie fully and be very impressed with it. I'm not sure if it's a joke or a drama - it has elements of both Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper. They all look fantastic - the image of our 60-year-old woman has definitely changed since Aunt Bee! They are lively, beautiful, sexy! The only drawback in this film is that there is no mention of other characters in the program "MTM" or "Rhoda" from the 1970s. I think because it is located in New York City. (With the "Rhoda" setting), at least some mention from Brenda, her sister in Big Apple. <br /> <br /> It's my hope that ABC will do the series. And bring back to appear in front of every guest in the old drama. By the way, CBS made a mistake in this new reunion or series in the end? Isn't the network that has "MTM" and "Rhoda" displayed?
