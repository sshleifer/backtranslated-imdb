There are movies or movies that I consider as favorites over the years. The road of the gospel is one of them. I watched this thing as a teenager and wanted the opportunity to watch again. My favorite part is the fact that <br /> <br /> 1 / Jesus blonde hair <br /> <br /> 2 / Last supper is a big meal <br /> <br / > 3 / Like to play with children <br /> <br /> 4 / His death for everyone and all the time <br /> <br /> Movies may not have high quality sound or action At that time I touched my heart. In addition, I am a fan of Johnny Cash and it is courageous. If ever come out on DVD, I will buy it purely for emotional reasons.
