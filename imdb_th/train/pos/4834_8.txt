For everyone who wishes to impress the Soviet perspective on modern Russian history, this movie is a treasure.

Focused on the boys in the remote Siberian village, who were characterized by the arrival and arrest of anarchist figures during the emperor's era. After that, he joined the Bolsheviks after the revolution and brought Soviet Communists to his village. His son with local beauty fought with the Germans during World War II. When he returned to the village, the oil industry began to close and we were treated to the Soviet economic ideology. <br /> <br /> The film is long and slow. It can be seen in three parts.
