This movie is great! Brad Pitt will not be able to show his performance in this film. Duchovny is the top mark, like Forbes and Lewis. The four main characters start on a scenic road tour of one murder scene. In the coolest car ever built in the 1960s, the Lincoln Continental Early Grace model is a simple person with a taste for dry toothbrush and carnage. He likes women who do not curse or smoke and wear PWT Duchovny and Forbes as a partner from the city, while Early and Lewis are trailer parkers from rural areas, although most of the sound in this film is dark. But there are many funny scenes that must be Writing, directing and acting are excellent. If you like street movies, murder, humor and lectures, watch this movie. Every delivery and you will want more when the credit rolling. One of my favorites all the time, "Hey ... shave that dog to teach you to hunt!"
