I've been looking for this movie for a while, and how good it is to find it on DVD ... <br /> <br /> I watched this movie at the age of 6 Netherlands And I was very impressed It shows in front of Walt Disney's JUNGLE BOOK! <br /> <br /> What I remember from this movie is the split. I remember Indian boys being friends with eagles. This story impressed me a lot. For some reason he was thrown out of his village. (Not understanding this reason) When another boy threw a stone at him, he climbed onto the rock and jumped out. At that time he became an eagle and flew with his eagle friend. He also wears a turquoise necklace like an eagle. <br /> <br /> CB
