The plot did not begin to explain the movie: a man is writing this movie or film. It references itself completely to the point that you think it will fold into itself like a black hole. The author wrote something and it happened or something happened and he wrote about it. <br /> <br /> It's a philosophy like "Waking Life" but Zen is more focused and in that I Think much better At one point, there was a face-to-face interview, and then you could see the pictures of these people who were filmed and you would find that their answers were scripted when one still crushed her. With beautiful scenery and illusions. <br /> <br /> I hope it will come out on DVD, so I can watch it again more carefully. See Cinequest (San Jose California Film Festival) on. Date 2/25/2002
