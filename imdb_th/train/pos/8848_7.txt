I watched this movie in a very strange way - I put it on my Netflix list and couldn't remember why. (Other than that, I know Philip Seymour Hoffman is in that) I can't remember who directed it. <br /> <br /> When my wife and I watched it, I Turned to her for about 45 minutes and said, "You know, I want to decide if I hate this movie. But there is something about this story that won't let me stop. "Then there are about a half-dozen scenes in the middle of the movie that truly creates electricity in the actors' performances. <br /> <br /> It was only when the credit at the end of the roll that I knew it was Sidney Lumet. The film and I thought - wow. I was surprised that Lumet told a little dirty story about a heartless person. But it is a testament to his talent that I received when I didn't realize that it was him. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman is really good in this movie. With Capote and I will argue that Oscar should have received this movie instead. <br /> <br /> I also introduce special features in storytelling with Lumet, Hawke and Hoffman who talk about making movies - it's fun and Studied by Hawke playing as Grange is eager to learn at Lumet's feet, teaching you to know the first rules of working with actors - kissing their asses continuously! <br /> <br /> There are movies. A lot of violence came out with empty ciphers when speaking and doing all. And there are elements of that thing in this film - the actors fill the air with a hot mood explosion and when the smoke fades away, nothing is left <br /> <br /> Lumet gave us the network and the Twelve Angry Men for us - the movies that each story was upgraded to the highest level of movies. <br /> < br /> This film is not at that level. But there is something about it that reflects And sometimes enough. <br /> <br /> My last comment about comments - if you look at the number of comments about the little movies here in IMDb - and the depth and intelligence of the comments. Professionals and Conventions - It is a good sign that something special has happened to this movie.
