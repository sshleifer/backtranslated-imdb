In this movie, we have great characters. But with a rather shallow story It's good to watch because Singleton works well in presenting mysterious conflicts and interpersonal relationships. This makes the audience forget the realism that doesn't exist in this movie. In fact, what we have here is all possible cliches and stereotypes, placed on the celluloid at a higher rate than soap. Not a deep film (Although it is needed) but better than general college movies
