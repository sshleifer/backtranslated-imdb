Otto Preminger of the Dana Andrews cycle of noir movies is among the (mostly) unsung gems of the genre. Because they lack paranoia, hatred for women or hysteria, they may seem to be leaving the place at that time But clear images, eyes, complex playing with identity, masculinity and representation Looks very modern today and is very similar to Melville The apparent irony of this film is full of cruel and ironic until the end of 'happiness' is one of the most cruellest in Hollywood history. Excellent in the level of thriller, fun, stressful and packed with two aspects of dialogue.
