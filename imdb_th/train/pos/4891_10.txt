Great ideas, great actors and what a shame that there is not enough time to show the story. I love it and want more. Dench, Dukakis and Laine now have real women! Even though Dench and her character alone had enough content to broadcast the script in less time. I have it on the tape and will continue to look forward to hoping to have a clue at the end that suggests that there will be a sequel. <br /> <br /> The top drawer! - No questions! - No arguments! <br /> <br />
