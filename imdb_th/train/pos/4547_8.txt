This may be 10, if not for the predictable situation and Hollywood style. Daniel Day-Lewis confirms its position as one of the leading actors of our time. (Why I don't want to be ahead) and the remaining actors are very high. Personally, I was impressed with Hugh O'Connor who played Christy Brown since I was a child. The first scene that I watched him was very strong. Wow.
