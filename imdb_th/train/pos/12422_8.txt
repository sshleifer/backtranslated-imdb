With this wide variety of reviews, I did not expect too much and was surprised. It is a small crime movie that is very entertaining and has interesting characters, excellent drawing, writing with a breeze without having to be glib and a good rhythm It looks good too in a funky way. Obviously people like this movie or just hate it and I'm the one who likes it.
