This complex story begins quite easily, with British journalists accepting bets from Edgar Allen Poe and his friend Lord Blackwood that he can't spend the night in the haunted Blackwood Castle. When he arrived there, the writer walked around the dusty room and walkway until the song and a glimpse of the dance partner that led him to walk into the empty room. He was sitting at the Harpic and began playing songs that he had heard and was surprised to be knocked on the shoulders by Elizabeth Blackwood. She told him with an eerie / creepy charm that she had prepared his room upstairs and expected someone tonight ... the night of death. Therefore began a series of supernatural events that confuse journalists throughout the night. In front of the spoiler: It may not be surprising that too many viewers will learn that Elizabeth is really cute and is a ghost. This didn't prevent her from falling in love with journalists. But it makes things more complicated for them than the average couple This is a fun movie that has everything: a ghost castle that is frightening, repetitive images of past events, sex and violence. (Although both were adapted to the version that most Americans saw over the years) is the main reason to see it. She has a strange charm, unlike anyone you've seen in the movie. Recommended!
