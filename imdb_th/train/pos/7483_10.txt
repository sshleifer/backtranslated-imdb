Vanilla Sky is a new movie created in 2001 from the movie Abre Los Ojos in 1997, and in my opinion is more human and emotional. Tom Cruise played by David Aames, a selfish selfish person who takes the emotions of others Just think of myself Jason Lee plays David David Shelby's best and in many ways has only friends. Penelope Cruz played as Sofia Serrano, Brian's girlfriend, who came with him at David's birthday party. Cameron Diaz plays David Julie Gianni's bedtime friend from time to time. Kirk Russell plays as Dr. Curtis McCabe, a psychologist interviewed by David All of their interactions and their consequences make Vanilla Sky one of the most exciting and exciting excitement. I will not explain the plot anymore because it is much more interesting. You know less. Ignoring everyone who calls this movie is too confusing to follow. If you pay attention, you will not be confused. This film is very complicated, but not confusing, and in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made.
