I am amazed that this movie can still be created. I watch movies of all kinds all the time with my friends and I can say that this is one of the best things I've ever seen. Never thought that a movie that took 146 minutes would make me think about it all the time. <br /> <br /> Washington is charming and intense, as always. Drama Creasy, a former terrorist agent. When he was assigned To protect the young Pita (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico City, the emotional arc and his redemption began to jump in the same way that a cute little girl can give Inevitably, Pita was kidnapped by gangsters and Creasy decided that most of Mexico City would have to pay the price for the courage to bring the teddy bear catalyst to catch his character. Yes, he has become ... Man on Fire <br /> <br /> You have to watch this movie.
