After dipping his toes in the giallo pool with the movie "The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh" (1971), director Sergio Martino followed in the same year as what became another suspicious thriller "Scorpion" tail. " As with his previous efforts, one star cast George Hilton, who will perform in the hybrid of Satan / giallo hybrid of Martino "All the Colors of the Dark" in the following year. Going to "Scorpion's Tail" also has actors Luigi Pistilli and Anita Strindberg who will Live a pair of unhappy images (softly spoken!) In Martino's "You are the locker room and I have the key" (1972) (I love that name!) I think Edwige Fenech isn't busy this month when they shoot. ! However, this movie has a modern direction that Martino fans expect, including some winding stories, elaborate scenes and beautiful shooting scenes of Athens. This story is related to the insurance detective (Hilton) and the journalist (Strindberg, here looks like a smarter sister of Farrah Fawcett, a smarter sister) who became a horrific murderer after a plane crash. . I think I have this picture, halfway out. But I'm wrong Although the plot has the perfect reason for this giallo, I may have to watch the movie again to appreciate all the subtlety. For me, the highlight of the picture is the cat's fight with Anita's mouse and the killer at the end of the house, which is especially suspicious and a good fight on the roof of the tile. Great action movies come out in this movie! The good people at No Shame will be grateful for still being a good-looking DVD with good subtitles and interesting extras. In continuing quest to bring these missing Italian gems back from being forgotten
