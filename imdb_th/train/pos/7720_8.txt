The only thing I knew about this movie before seeing it was Robby The Robot. My idea was that it was another story in a long, sci-fi film that continued in the 1950s. Large studios, great budgets and mass production values ​​make this a strong competitor, at least with the eyes of the best sci-fi movies of that era. I passed the qualifying round with the word "see because "The War of the Worlds" is darker and more frightening. "Forbidden City" and should be suitable for a better style when attacking into a foreign land. <br /> <br /> What impressed me Immediately is the translation of the color of the movie, followed by the complexity and scope of the relevant details in the house and the laboratory of Dr. Morbias (Walter Pidson), but that is just a prelude to icing on an underground cake, a maze that serves as a base for Krell. Krell's technology seems to be more advanced than speaking of "Star Wars" I think the audience of this film came back again when it was released, probably sitting in the same fear as the theater audience in 1977 with SW or in 1986 with "Aliens" on-screen viewing. Large TV in the room I'm living the same effect, and I was quite resistant to /> <br /> hyperbole so it did not exceed <br scope to imagine. "Forbidden City" too much before the TV series 'Star Trek'; Gene Roddenberry said that the film had a huge impact on his vision of acting. The followers of the short series will recognize the elements of the plot used which appear in 'Star Trek'. I have to do twice when the men of United Planets Cruiser C57-V head to the moving room in While the puzzles presented to Robby create the impossibility of responding to elements that are used at least two or three times in the ST series, <br /> <br /> movies that get a lot of attention From the whole idea of Morbius uses his subconscious to protect Altaire IV, a unique concept in 1956, when everyone who is a scientist in dealing with Mars or other space monsters. This movie Working with delicate magic on this character by helping me understand that Morbius was the guardian of Altaire IV for a moment before Commander Adams (Leslie Nielsen) explained. <br /> <br /> You know that you look. See the calendar year 2200 is not far away. This movie may be a movie that is accurate compared to exploring and living on other planets. I think they have to come with Robby, a sleek model.
