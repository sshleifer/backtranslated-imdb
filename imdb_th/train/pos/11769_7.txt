I bought this movie a few days ago and thought it would be a boring movie. But when I nailed it to the DVD player, it surprised me in a very good way. James Belushi played very well, just like Bill "The Mouth" Manuccie, but especially Timothy Dalton plays a good sheriff. Much of the 'ending' scene in Bill's house is great. The camera works well, good conversations and good performances. Bill "The Mouth" Manuccie steals $ 12 million from Mafia with his wife. He lives in South Carolina. In the project Witness Protection But the Mafia followed him and needed 12 million dollars. Bill can trust only one person he knows inside himself.
