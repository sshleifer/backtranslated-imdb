Large Ramones fan I like Ramones and I think if you hate them, besides being a big supporter of Bush, you may not like this classic. <br /> <br /> It's better than John Hughes. Cute teen and Like the garbage dump in the 80s, better than Anant American Pie that makes us a plague now. <br /> <br /> There are many other high school movies: Switchblade Sisters, Fast Times ..., Class of '84, Three O'Clock High and wonderful but catchy (seems impossible) River's Edge, but RnRHS will always be my favorite because it is the most fun and fun, plus you can get up. Go up and dance with it. <br /> <br /> I love you. Riff Randell <br /> <br /> 10/10
