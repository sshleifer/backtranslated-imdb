Watching French horror movies last night and like it a lot. The film takes place in a cell with three prisoners who found a hand-written daily note on the wall from a serial killer who had escaped from prison 20 years ago. When they look through their journals, they discover That it delve into the black art and the commands that may come out of the cell and to freedom What they discover is something completely different and scary to say the least. I like low-price horror movies that offer products in a quality way and tell a good story. This movie did that, even if it took a while to go. The results and the horror that they released was very interesting to me and I enjoyed not much blood sitting, but not suitable for the story even though it had quite good blood.
