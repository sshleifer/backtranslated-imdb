One of my favorite movies, of course. That story is good. Performing is a great story. Every technician. (Especially movies) with sharpness and clever script. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is great, like Edward '' Ned ''. Well, from Geoffrey Rush, Naomi Watts and Orlando Bloom, all action scenes are on the spot. <br /> <br /> This film is your edge seat until the end. One of my favorite movies from Heath Ledger, the legendary deceased, which is the highlight of every movie that he starred and didn't miss. <br /> <br /> Every great movie around
