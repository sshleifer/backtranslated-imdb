Recently I have watched the Spirit and enjoyed it a lot. I have seen it about 4 times on HBO and will buy a DVD. Those who give negative comments may think that "Vanishing Point" is just another movie chase and `Thelma & Louise 'is just a flick. Although the conclusion of those movies is darker But I feel that the content has some relationship Independence and individualism are very important and there are people who want to take you away. Other general characteristics of these movies are genres. `Guardian angel 'Attentive and attentive, which helps the main character overcome the misery. <br /> <br /> Other reviews here mention that this film deals with the story of civilizations that invade others. What to do. Is looking around the open space around us to see that <br /> <br /> I think the animation and the story are amazing. The emotions of the soul are very clear when the story progresses. (Yes, I know that they make the human race a little horse. But this is a novel) in the two action scenes, you feel the stream of rapids and heat from the forest fire. In a scene that is quieter (Most of the time) You are allowed to taste the background. One of the important things that makes the story work is actually not talking and singing. Doing so will take away from the power of the story. Instead of telling the story of the main character from time to time, the sting character will be added to the great soundtrack. Another advantage is that they are not afraid to make the story quite dark. (Which makes this movie see me), although it is not prevalent in both movies and conclusions, it is appropriate and uplifting without feeling bad. <br /> <br /> Those who admire horses will like the movie This really But I think it is a lot more than a movie horse. I don't feel that this is a good movie that will take the kids too if they grow up from a worthless fare that is offered today. But if they are prudent who can handle interesting stories like The Lord of the Rings and Black Beauty, they may love this movie. Hell, I'm 35 years old and still love that thing.
