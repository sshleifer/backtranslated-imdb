Americans in Paris are examples of Gene Kelly. Watch Gene's performances, sing and dance through Paris in many majestic situations, meticulously, some pure corn. One can imagine what Kelly created when he created this movie just a year before "Singin 'In The Rain". He is one of the greatest people of all time. It is interesting to see the similarities between the two, especially in the character of Kelly. The only important difference is that one story is located in Paris, another story in LA. <br /> <br /> Less than pure, perhaps Cyd Charisse, which was originally intended for a role, may have done better, but Caron is quite convinced of his role and has a chemical relationship with Kelly. In this movie, it is something that needs people who are not like Gene Kelly. Adding a role as every human being is not easy, but Levant does it at the same level as other leading actors. The music and dance routines are perfect. Even the ballet that is too long at the end of the movie makes the film better. When he saw that there was not much time to build a lovely relationship like this, Minnelli used this sequence to make it seem like you spent four hours with them wisely. <br /> <br /> I would have to rate This movie with Singin 'because it is very similar in the story and Singin' song rarely gets attention because Debbie Reynolds is highly effective. <br /> <br /> Full instructions <br /> <br /> 8/10 stars
