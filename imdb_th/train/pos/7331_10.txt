Help from the Avenger Darkwolf. <br /> <br /> Epic, fantasy, animation that is well done and excellent. Include live actors with animations that follow them (rotoscoping) It is Ralph Bakshi's second best movie, with "American Pop" number one and "Heavy Traffic" being the third and "Wizard" being fourth. It's better than "Cool World" or "Lord of the His ring "Of course, the designs by famous artist Frank Farzetta and the animations are good coloring and still have hot men. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie.
