I enjoy this movie a lot. I'm always a big fan of Whoopi Goldberg and this movie will only focus on it. She plays a housewife in an African-American family that is moving in a social network due to her husband (Danny Glover) as a lawyer She moved to an all-white area where people were friendly. But still clumsily approaching her slightly The events that occurred during the making of the movie made some people laugh. But most will attract other emotions. This movie is not very funny like a drama. I give it a strong 8/10. I suggest you catch it on TV or rent soon.
