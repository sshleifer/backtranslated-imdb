I watched this movie from Ralph Bakshi (Wizard, Hey Good Lookin ') last night at www.afrovideo.org And I don't see anything in the race (I'm not a fool) I agree that the character design is Today is quite rough and unpredictable. But I think it is the words that tell the story of an old Uncle Remus that tells that the black American culture was created from the main character and nodded clearly to "The Baby Baby" and "Briar Patch". It is not a matter of much talk. But is a cultural symbol created by black Americans and I am a white woman who read and loves those stories And I found that it was an interesting time capsule perspective about black culture in Harlem, New York in the 70s. <br /> <br /> Take this movie as a live-action movie / Animation, which began in Live Action with a friend named Sampson (Barry White) and Preacherman (Charles Gordone) rushed to help fellow Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) escape from prison but stopped by obstacles. Wind up with the police While waiting for them, Randy reluctantly listens to his friend Pappy (Scatman Crothers) as he begins to tell Randy's story. Randy Brother's new Rabbit in the big city rushes. Up from the confusion, you know? Rabbit, Bear and Fox is an animal in the Randy, Sampson and Preacherman versions. An abstract juxtaposition of chic animations and live action videos, movies are funny and condemning Graphic patterns that are prevalent in 70? Ethnicity, race and others. <br /> <br /> So it's another GOOD Bakshi movie. And should we sweep this kind of film under the carpet? Pretending that they never existed? Hmm ... I think it's a shame; I think we should watch these movies and learn about what has happened since then. How far have we come?
