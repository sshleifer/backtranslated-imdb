Yes. This is a movie that has a very limited budget and has continuous errors. (Such as the only scene filmed in the sun and then mixed together) and as much as I love Nick Mancuso The part that came out and some minor factors were terrible. (Including at least one actor used for two different roles But clearly.) Richard Grieco is hysterical. (His hair alone is worth the trip.) Steven Ford is very fond. Mancini has some great lines, while Nancy Allen ironically is gentle and not interesting. Classic? No. Bad parts? Yes. Entertainment? Big, yes. I like to arrange the day when they decide that Grieco will have a hairstyle. "Are you fast?"
