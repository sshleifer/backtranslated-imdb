Documentary without losing the word ... forever ... <br /> <br /> Let us assume that the narrative is more than a fictitious thought of us as a description of Japanese society. And while the film is a fast-paced documentary film, they come to play a constant word fast, and it doesn't translate as well as it is - in the current version, the film festival is still fun. <br /> <br /> But for patients and only patients who are real and generous, I'm talking to Jim Jarmusch's fans who have increased agony. I believe this is a movie for you It's a smart movie. If you allow it to win, <br /> <br /> Quite beautiful and quite charming and sub-culture of Japan. And rather experimenting with 2D in the 3D world. Summary. Fun for those who want to watch Japanese movies that trick Japanese culture. Lift your finger if you are in a completely different mood.
