I love stories Somewhere, the poster says that there is no family like that shown in this movie. Maybe have I think everyone seems really human and reliable. What a wonderful thing. What songs are great in the soundtrack? It's a good thing and a good thing. But most importantly, I would say two words to introduce this film. Steve Karel <br /> <br /> Steve Karel <br /> <br /> He showed that really good. Deep depth that touched me He is truly a commander, as a dedicated widow, perhaps too much to be a good father, at the expense of denying his own needs. <br /> <br /> He acts like a fool. Why did he do that? <br /> <br /> And you see that it's the perfect thing for this movie. The actor who played this character made me believe that he felt something and not only acted like he was feeling something and that he had completely transmitted to me how he felt and what he felt was rejected. > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Reject success. <br /> <br /> Reject love. <br /> <br /> Losing your love is too painful. Believe and many people who do that No way to feel that way. <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie <br /> <br /> I give it eight out of ten.
