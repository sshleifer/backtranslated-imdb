Like most films of Eleanor Powell, this film is the most brilliant. For some reason - is explained! - She was chosen to transport a magnetic mine to Cuba. Good people and bad people compete in the mines and who is confused. But as always, Powell's dance is great and worth the admission fee. And in this film, Lahr plays as his cowardly lion, awakening the warm memories of the Technicolor movie in 1939. The benefit is to hear Frank Young with a great voice. In addition, the great drummer Buddy Rich has a great time to show his special abilities. Watch the couple, especially for his unique partner, with Dorsey's trumpet Ziggy Elman. I said "unique" perhaps because of ignorance. But I know that there is no other drum / trumpet sequence like this in movies or recordings. This movie is fun. Even Skelton's stupid people are still restrained. Powell once again demonstrated that she was the greatest movie dancer ever.
