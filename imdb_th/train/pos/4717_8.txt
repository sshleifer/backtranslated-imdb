How does everyone love this movie? I think it's a haunt of all the old thugs; If you've never seen them, see this instead. Michael Keaton has the ball in this role when something happens. A man speaks English every time he speaks, and Griffin Dunn plays an innocent AA role. But my favorite role is Joe Piscopo. He has all the best Danny Devito, Alan Hale, Ray Walston, is in this movie, a satirical comedian who is more ignorant of the "mafia" that is made for underground crime
