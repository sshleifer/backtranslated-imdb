I tried to rent this room many times. But there are often fans who, as a general rule, often deny spanking and comedians with comments. "Uhm ... looks good, but I'm not in the mood. For that movie "So go to" Almighty Solo Movie Night "! <br /> <br /> Next, I found Collinwood a very fun movie. Even if in the end being forgotten fairly, there will be a moment of fun and a moment to laugh out loud. I am not familiar with the fact that it is a new creation and as a general rule, watching movies trying to ignore that truth And watch them with their own advantages. George Clooney wears a funny and rough pendant that is a parody safe nutcracker, which makes me wonder if there are two things ... 1. Every Funny unit would be better if Mr. Clooney cameo of sorts in 5 minutes? 2. How do they make fake tattoos that look old and fade, and how can they be washed off easily? All the actors are good actors in their own way, put on a great job and you will be impressed that they have a good time working together which is reasonably important in this film. Needless to say, everything is not as planned in this movie, both smart and funny. But it makes me see the special features and consider the original, so I think it's a success! This rental in good times may catch friends and pizza. You will have a good time. <br /> <br /> *** 7/10 *** <br /> <br /> The music is beautiful. It's a good thing to listen to Paul Conte, who has a lot of work and makes me score less after accumulated credits.
