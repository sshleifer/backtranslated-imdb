I'm not approaching "Still Crazy" with real expectations. Another rolling stone figure I thought ... a great nostalgia for baby boomers. The film has some parts, but more. Brian Gibson, director, has helped Tina Turner's biography and quite succeeded in his style I think it is appropriate to be his latest movie. <br /> <br /> The actor was chosen Bill Nighy perfectly in his role as the band leader. Male actor, director Bruce Robinson, appeared as the band's guitarist. He works great, even though he has not appeared in movies since the late 70s. If you are looking for a funny and impressive movie (with good music), you will find it. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
