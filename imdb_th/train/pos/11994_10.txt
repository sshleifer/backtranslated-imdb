For many people here, I can't help but admire the actors and the Talespin development team and others that they do throughout my childhood. I, everyone who commented here, enjoy the quality of animation. Only But the quality of the story Stripes and letters <br /> <br /> In the art of "cartoon", it is not possible to do justice. In fact, it is an insult to "cartoons". Talespin is a animation and no What Less, it is clearly the greatest work of genius that will be produced at Disney to date. When Disney "pulls" it from the air, they don't realize what they do and I'm sure their spirits. Being tortured with regret since then. <Br /> <br /> I will take a moment to explain from the beginning, which is ducktales to the last, which I think is the Darkwing Duck. Due to political correctness and has taken Quantum Leap back since Now they need more quantity than quality and don't have to mention a room full of monkeys for My story can't let my children watch "cartoons" that make them scared right now, with the fear that they will become Homer Simpson in the future in the future and 50% of the offense. Will blame me They watch it, I can't let it happen, which is why I have all the programs from the late 80s to the mid-90s on the hard drive. So, one day, my children can't be damaged by "Cartoon Crap "of today and to taste the last piece of childhood I have and hold on and I owe what Talespin <br /> <br /> Talespin for me is without a doubt the best animation ever Little in the world because It has depth, charm, wisdom, kindness, emotion and lack of quality that is not really good, and the story that many people have today. You see any content in the words "Ed, Edd and Eddie or whatever you are. Think about? The garbage produced today can be compared to the Hyroglyph that cannot be deciphered by 3 year olds. <br /> <br /> The next time you watch Episode e of Talespin; Watch wood grain on any object or wooden building, such as Higher for Hire, and indulge in the quality of the craft and effort put into this animation, even the only background scene that has been finished, as if they were using it again. Repeat the building Looks realistic with the art deco movement that has been popular during the time it appears, even the real vehicles in life. OK, not all episodes are wonderful in animation. But the lower level scenes are covered with the best scenes, so all It will cool down at the end of the chapter and you may never notice it even if you don't focus and pay attention to details. <br /> <br /> One thing I like about this is what I am. Like to be called "Misunderstood intentions" or "Accidental mistakes" in each episode, and some people have two, for example, in the deep sheepskin that Rebecca says. "You are doing something Baloo" and Baloo replied "Who am I! As an innocent student "Looking into Rebecca's eyes, I will 'not waste my time on the rest of the Baloopers, but just keep an eye on the next time. <br /> <br /> The opinions of everyone else are beaten and right. Must be 100%. I have nothing to add that others have not already said. Here, Disney, WAKE UP and smell the coffee. You fall asleep for over a decade. Stop producing waste and bring quality back to animation and stop production. "Comics" We have seen evidence of what you can The car can do it and we want it to come back as soon as possible.
