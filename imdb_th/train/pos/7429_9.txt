She is an extraordinary singer who cares about other things !!!! The last scene is one of the best moments in the event. Biz - bar none !! I'm glad she kept the camera on herself for ten minutes - she deserves a symbolic status - that is the power of sound. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time when I was five And it affects me a lot I saw it today and yes I saw some bugs. (For example, Esther wants to leave Grammy's rights because of her award announcement) <br /> <br /> But some user comments are simple. False - I mean naked pictures. Where? - Maybe we will see various movies ??? <br /> <br /> Streisand's singing ability is very important and if she has a big ego - good! <br /> <br /> She gets it.
