I am afraid that it is a movie that you have to watch really. To take something out, I am not an illogical movie like ..... "Weapon movie Episode 58" Do you know that Riggs is really crazy? It's not the same movie at the end, because it's the beginning. You can run anywhere, talk on the phone, do what it used to, and enjoy it in some way. I've noticed in the past that most people who don't like this type of movie are the type that will do the most. But watching movies Because ... they don't understand or don't understand or happen. <br /> <br /> Don't let your dog take a shower !!!
