This movie is really difficult. That will match you. This film doesn't have many interesting stories. It makes you want to know how it will end. But I'll tell you something now ... Never have I ever tense and jumped up before in my life! This film is sure to deliver jumping and excitement! To be fair, I watched it almost midnight, so I was so sleepy, so maybe I could explain why I was scary ... or it might be because this movie delivered in that aspect! Basically it's about a couple who lost their children in a tragic event. They decided to move out and rent a cabin on the mountain ... Everything looked calm and peaceful until they had their first visitors. (I thought it was the main character's sister and she brought her husband) ... At night, the husband heard the sound ... Check out and that's when things really started wrong ... they Did not stay for another day and told the couple that they should leave as soon as possible because there was something wrong ... to cut the short story ... eventually they found out what happened in this house during A few years ago and decided that <br /> <br /> It's not Hollywood blockbuster. It doesn't have a big budget. But please don't let it let you down It's scary, stressful and very scary! Just try it. :)
