This movie, even though it is over 70 years old, is still a strong and moving movie. Betty Davis as Cockney Mildred, a trustworthy little girl Seeing her performance still spelled out. She certainly makes the audience insult her and pity her at the same time. Leslie Howard's performance as a weak, Phillip Carey is weak. But I do not see which actor will be able to perform your Davis performance She chewed the scenery in all the scenes in which she stole the show completely. This is a film that sealed her star and she deserves an Oscar but lost. It is a shocking story today with the theme of unmarried pregnancy, many partners and Mildred's evil language So it is quite old But still a great movie To see the scene in which Mildred told Phillip what she really thought about him ("You are a dirty man, a pig ...") is also the greatest performance I have ever seen in a movie.
