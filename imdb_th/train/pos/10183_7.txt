This may be her best Karisma. Apart from Zubeidaa, Nana Patekar also gives him the best thing without having to try it. Sometimes the story is very good. But at the end it seems to be dragged, especially when Shahrukh came into the picture What makes me like it is the performance of the leaderboard, the delivery of dialogue, and the story for what is. It should be better and fix it. The support case was great, including Karima's mother's husband, although she had a shining moment. But it was great to watch her. <br /> <br /> The scene looks good too. I don't like drawing their Canadian family. But when they entered India, it was as true as they had been. <br /> <br /> Overall, I'll lift my finger!
