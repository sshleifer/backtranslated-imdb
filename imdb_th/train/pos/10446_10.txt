I watched this movie 10 years ago and watched an average video once a year. Is a type of movie that has no time because the theme is universal But stories and conversations are personal. It is also one of the few movies that captured you from the first frame to credit, even though there are only two characters. (Very relevant) Really, this is a lot of debt for the performances that are involved by Hawke and Delpy, which makes us believe that they are Jessie and Celine. Mentioned and now the phenomenon is rampant! I like the way this movie encapsulates the audience in its area and makes you think, however, you might be bored that you are one of those characters. It made me want to ride a train across Europe! I didn't find anyone who couldn't get involved with this movie. May speak of myself, my friend, or just the true genius of this movie
