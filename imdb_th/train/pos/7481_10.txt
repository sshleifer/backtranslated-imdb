I disagree with the saying "This is one of the best movies ever." If you think Vanilla Sky is just "rebuilt", you may not be more wrong. There is a lot of depth in this film: visual, visual, musical and emotional. <br /> <br /> See because the film is soft and delicate sometimes. (First scene with Sofia) and sometimes powerful and intense (Times Square) the highest point of the background) <br /> <br /> The song and sound are perfectly tied to this movie. Without music, the story tells only half. Nancy Wilson creates emotional scores. But incorporating from this film, which is not suitable for dreamy topics (Although never released before, I can score about $ 60.) If you look hard, you may find a copy yourself.) Crowe's other music selections, such as The Beach Boys, Josh Rouse, Spiritualized , Sigur Ros, Monkees, etcetera etcetera is ideal for this film (Crowe has ears for beautiful music) <br /> <br /> <br /> More important than the emotional theme in this movie. (Such as love, sadness, regret) are very powerful and expand tenfold by visual and musical experiences, including ingenious conversations I agree that the elevator scene makes my tears occasionally. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie, however. (As if it is better) is that it is created wisely for each person When you watch a movie, you will find something new. So watch closely and be prepared to think! Of course, the theme will be clear after the first or second viewing. But there is always more story than you think. <br /> <br /> This is Cameron Crowe's best work easily. The inspiration for making movies and my music mostly comes from this work alone. It touches my life honestly because the true art tends to be done. It continued to surprise me that there were many people who couldn't appreciate this film for what it was. (I guess to understand the art that is truly art itself) <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Vanilla Sky is in a league of its own.
