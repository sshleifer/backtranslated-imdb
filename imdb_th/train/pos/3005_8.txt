This is still the standard for judging the golden age of the investigation, taking into account the limited technology and the suspicious ethical standards of the authorities (on the screen) that endure all similar efforts from movies and TV. Fast and furious with Warner Bros's cleaning wipes and thank you for not having the time to make an interesting love happen with bringing a great actor to the extreme end.

There was an abnormality and not a PC - When looking at the second murder victim, he inhaled that there were many people in the world. Of course it was William Powell as Philo Vance (and Michael Curtiz as director), which made this movie - when Powell had made a fool. <br /> <br /> The police force in the crime scene Can't 'do a very good job of finding the second corpse and an unconscious dog! The best bit is the position that Vance described to us about the sequence of events that occurred around the murder - a series of dodgy sets that combined with a spectacular camera angle to create a modern and astounding feeling of what happened first This page The only problem is that, as usual, the conclusion cannot match the overall deductive process shown throughout, and the predicted termination is quite invoked. Of course, some of Moto's and many others can be summed up in this way as well. But since it happened very quickly and ... quite suspicious of a little moral, it didn't reduce my opinion about the status of KMC in a classic way. <br /> <br /> All the prints I used Seen from the KMC is the worst picture), like looking into a goldfish bowl, so if you are interested in seeing it endure it until you are sucked in.
