'What I like about you' is a program I can't wait to see each day. Amanda Bynes is a great actor and I grew up watching her performance: 'The Amanda Show'. She's a person. That is very funny and seems to go down to the ground. "Holly" is a person with this ability and has a personality that "Going out" I enjoy her seemingly turning things around and upside down, so she makes herself confused sometimes. But that is what makes the performance great. <br /> <br /> I like the special performance when the character 'Vince' comes with Nick Zano. It's very hot and funny, including 'Gary', Wesley Jonathan. All the plays are excellent. Each character has its own personality and charm. Jennie Garth, Allison Munn and Leslie Grossman are all very interesting. I love 'Lauren'. It's special. She's the best! She helps to make a special comedy program and you never know what you will do or say anyway! Overall, the performance is very good, but the reason I didn't give 10 is because there are no new episodes anymore.
