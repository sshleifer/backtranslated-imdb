The only reason I gave this movie is 8/10 stars, not 10, because 1) Sinatra is terrible, and 2) Kelly's love for the character's interest can be desirable, loyal at Dean Stockwell, Quantum Leap - Al is a little boy. The dance sequence with Jerry Mouse is one of the most fun and exciting dance sequences I've ever seen. Tom and Jerry is still my personal favorite and my daughter. I'm 28 and you. shy Therefore, while the character is less prominent than Mickey, he is still a favorite of many children and adults today. Kelly is always cute, his eyes are full of fun and excitement. In every movie I've seen, he always steals the show. One of the best dancers of the 20th century, it is not surprising that Paula Abdul will be moving like Kelly's "sampling". I wish Gene Kelly to be one of the most beautiful people in the 20th century. Don't miss Kelly's dance with Jerry Mouse. You won't be disappointed.
