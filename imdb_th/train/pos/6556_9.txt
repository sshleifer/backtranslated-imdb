I really enjoyed this movie. I am the same father and daughter of a 17-year-old who is intelligent and talented. I hope my women will use themselves as well to solve crime and help others! So for me, maybe this is PG level. Fantasy. I read many books of Nancy Drew during my teens long ago. Sure, this character was played by Emma Roberts but didn't like Nancy Drew. I can remember from the book. That is because the script is not a show She was not caught in the modern competition around her. There are some weaknesses in the plot, in addition to Nancy Drew of the Books and trying to think about what decade we are in. (What is that car like?) <br /> <br /> <br /> I read the IMDb overview before watching movies while I was researching Rachael Leigh Cook from other movies. This is not one of her best verses. But I will continue to search for her movie. Rachael is too old to be shown. But doing a good job as an orphan who grew up from the center of mystery. <br /> <br /> I'm very disappointed in other reviews written here. Some people expect the perfect connection with some books, expecting reliable situations or adult action movies. I got what I expected! Good entertainment focuses on young women and their dads who want good children with high standards of conduct and success. This is the movie Teen PG, not James Bond! Do you want to be a model for your daughter?
