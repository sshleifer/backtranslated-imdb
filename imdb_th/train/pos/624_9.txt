The summer is full of blockbusters and the return of the movie and not having to mention some disappointment of those comebacks that I'm sorry to find a movie that I can sit down and enjoy. <br /> < br /> In case you do not want to read further down the page (Without any spoilers) I will conclude here: It is more mature than Ella Enchanted (there is something very suspicious Many death pieces and a few scenes with little blood, not for young children), but don't try to be too naughty or out of scope. Imagine that the princess of the bride is more dangerous and you will get closer. <br /> <br /> ----------------------- ------------------- ------------------- <br /> <br /> I may not Movie actors are as good as others ... maybe once or twice a month. If i feel energetic I'm also a sci-fi / fantasy fan. I'm bored of stories and movies that are monotonous with flash rather than filling faster than you can count up to 10 and this movie is a rough diamond. <br /> <br /> In At the end here (August) I was very tired of the broken expectations from the hit songs that I didn't see the Bourne Ultimatum to support Stardust. The confusion I had hoped for by Transformers for the novel My preview of Stardust looks interesting, but I was careful /> <br /> certainly like others <br here, I was surprised at the end. I miss going to see a typical fantasy movie. Other things from here are breakfast. Do not be fooled. In fact, it is a fairy tale. Actually, it has magic witches and needs full disbelief ... but the most refreshing thing I find is that it is not based on what I do. Read 15 years ago and it is a really good movie. <br /> <br /> ((unlike 90% of other movies that seem to appear repeatedly like thorns beside them) sign in that Hall Lee is about to lose I can read the statistics for this year and the next two years, this film will become another "Epic fantasy tale like LotR and the" so and so, the NYT said. No doubt)) <br /> <br /> The stardust didn't make me stuck with my seat because of the action that was full of traffic jams and I didn't sweat because of the bullets-hooks after. Plot - Hook threatens to tear High tension and reflection throughout the theater in loudness It does not use large explosions to attract my attention to what happens on the screen. (Transformers I'm not looking at you.) It doesn't try to show the latest CGI techniques and doesn't make me lack intelligence with conversations and simple stories that I can understand at level 3 (the boy I hate them). <br /> <br /> I just watched ... watching and enjoying the fresh creative story before my eyes. Of course I may know what will happen in most movies. But it makes you forget It makes my heart tremble partly. But the most important thing that I noticed was that I left the theater better than when I was inside. <br /> <br /> It's a real gem. After the muddy summer and many movies that didn't meet my expectations, this was like a cup of cold tea that would turn off all the hard work I had done, sitting through others trying to get out of them. He too My money is worth <br /> <br /> It may not be for everyone. If you enjoy fantasy movies that show only time-tested (Princess Bride, Black Cauldron, The Dark Crystal and others) then you should really see this movie. This small diamond is looking for a way to get into my DVD collection. As soon as it's sold in stores, you can trust me in this story. <br /> <br /> Really wonderful.
