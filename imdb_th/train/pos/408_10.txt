I can't tell you how much I love this movie. I have read reviews that say this posture "Too confused" or "like swimming in a dry concrete" I said that these auditors have no imagination! For anyone who likes Fantasy Fiction, this movie is for you. If you ever love playing Dungeons & Dragons ... this movie is for you. (Especially if you enter Oriental Adventures) I'm just sorry that I didn't watch this movie on the big screen. (More motivation to get my big screen t.v. :-)
