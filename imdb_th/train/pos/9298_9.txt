Just one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It is a parody of the crime of life, a parody of everything that is representative of Chicago in 1930 - there is no need to underestimate this film because of ratings lower than 5, the opinion of mass and hypnotism. Who decides to watch it, will regret it. Who decides not to see it will be very sad.
