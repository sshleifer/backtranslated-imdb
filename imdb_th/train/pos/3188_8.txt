I have the worst day of my life Then I stumbled upon this cute movie, and now I'm ready to go out and kiss the street. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I watched it for two reasons only: VERA leg -ELLEN. But it's more The story is quite intelligent and truly creative. It's almost like Shakespeare's comedy with all the pleasant misunderstandings. And of course there are ... LEGO VERA-ELLEN <br /> <br /> The only unfortunate aspect of this movie is the version I bought ("100 Family Classics" collection by Mill Creek. Entertainment) doesn't have the best video quality, and I heard the same about the Alpha launch. The brightness and contrast are a little high, so many scenes look faded, especially when Vera dances in white. But I think you can fiddle with your TV set to compensate. I can imagine how it will look on the big screen. In '51, stage costumes, costumes and colors are something else that is impressive and creepy - in "the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari "Vein <br /> <br /> As romantic as this is perfect. Unhealthy, unplanned, and not 100% soulful ahhhhhh Unfortunately you are poor, your miserable life will not be as charming as this. Harar Harar, what's up? My life is as bad as yours. Oh, it's time to watch this movie again.
