Yes, the plot is realistic and very thin. Yes, the show is in the middle to laughing range. Yes, it has been done many times. However, what we are facing is a movie that doesn't shy away from these facts and pretends nothing more than that. There are scenes of original death and tension increasing throughout the movie. In addition, you will not be more than a few minutes from blood slaughter. I want everyone to watch this movie with unbiased eyes and watch it for what it is intended to do. Scary and funny slams with a theme that is second to none.
