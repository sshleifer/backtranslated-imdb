I am not a regular commenter on this website. But to see how important this film is, I try to write comments and observations about it. I enjoy watching this movie, perhaps because Kat is everything I want. I won't post spoilers or reveal plans. But there are many things that I find really amazing. The way she handles people. This is a movie that is not very much to play. I have no arguments here. I always enjoy it and talk a little about it when you go to see a fun movie and I am very happy. In 1h53 I stayed in a dark room. Must be seen repeatedly until happiness fades away Try not important to it. Thank you for reading.
