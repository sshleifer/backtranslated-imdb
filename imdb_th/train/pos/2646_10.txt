I think most people don't seem to get the right idea about the movie, at least it's my opinion. I'm not sure if it's a movie about drugs. Rather a movie about how the genius brothers think of them. Drugs are some minor side effects Again, it's not a commercial movie that you see every day, and if the author wants that, he will certainly fail because most people think that it is one of the films related to drugs. However, I think otherwise is the case. Like in many movies that show different cultures, viewers often understand movies that show their own culture, such as what they grew up and familiar with. This movie is to show that those "geniuses" tend to think a lot and have problems. The reason they do this is because they feel disgusted :) They have to meet people who do ordinary things and accept them as if they were releasing the space shuttle every day. They started work quite hard and good in no time. They feel like - I go to work, do nothing, still better than those around me twice when they do my project, what should I do with my free time? And what is more boring? When you can begin to predict behavior, not because you are a psychologist But because you've seen this pattern in the past So for them from one side, it's a challenging job that is sometimes boring and sometimes starts to understand people's behavior. It is a recipe for big boredom. And the most stupid things usually do to leave this state They said earlier that their biggest problem is that they are trying to find life in terms of logic. (Mathematics describes logic) While life is not really realistic.
