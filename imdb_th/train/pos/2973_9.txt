This is a truly funny movie in every moment that covers. What would it be like this movie for South Park creator and directed by David Zucker? When I saw this movie for the first time, I didn't realize immediately that Coop and Doug were really Matt and Trey. But their acting and writing abilities were quite impressive. I was very surprised to know that they were really Matt and Trey. Later, sometimes humor was rude, sometimes foul, sometimes subtle, sometimes loud and stupid But overall, this is one of the hell of a movie without a doubt. Actually it's crazy Totally crazy
