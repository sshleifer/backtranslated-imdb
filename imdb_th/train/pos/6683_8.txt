Forget the deep meaning, leave your logic at the door and have a good time with the ridiculous "comics" that are totally ridiculous. MYSTERY MEN is the super delivery of every flick you've ever seen. But it is unlikely that there will be an interesting, different, and handsome option that will become a memorable character of your own. Dark humor, serious ignorance, honest action, and even an impressive moment or two combined to make this comic story about a cute loser a true winner. The funny talent of the actors who play Mystery Men - including Mystery Woman - is the perfect foil for Wes Studi. It can be described as just an underground bargain. Yoda and Geoffrey Rush are one of the most talented people. The most villainous wall (and the strange charm) that had walked out of the Dark Horse comic book and entered the big screen. Be prepared to laugh, cheer and say, "Are you?" More than once .... Enjoy!
