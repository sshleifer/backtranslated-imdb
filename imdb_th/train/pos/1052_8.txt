Documentary about the outstanding achievements of the Women's Lawyers Association (WLA) of Kumba in southwest Cameroon to protect the rights of women and children from domestic violence. In this Muslim culture, which men tend to have power over women, according to Islamic law, we can imagine the difficulty in establishing worldly legal rights for women and children. After a 17-year failed attempt, the leader of the WLA just started to score a few victories and the purpose of this film is to share these victories. <br /> <br /> The leader of this legal reform movement is Vera Ngassa, state prosecutor and Beatrice Thapapa, senior judge (court president), both played themselves in this film, which may have a natural visual footage, even though I imagine it as most But if not all of them consist of simulating real events for the camera at a later time Four cases were investigated and all the plaintiffs played by themselves in the movie. <br /> <br /> Two cases involving repeated visits by a wife, in one case, forced sex Another story involves having sex with a 10 year old girl and another story involving the beatings of an 8 year old boy by aunt in a smashed wife asking for divorce. We monitor various cases, from investigations to complaints to the results of experiments. The results in each case are beneficial to women and children. The offender receives a prison sentence and / or strict fines. The divorce will be given <br /> <br /> a serious prosecution against the aunt's children, which shows that these female criminal officials have sexual neutrality. Noteworthy is the respect that all parties, including those who are guilty, are treated. This is a movie that is important and well-built. (Interesting is the fact that one of the directors, Ms. Longinotto, also co-directed the film, 1998, divorced Iranian style, which relates to related themes in Tehran) (in broken English with English subtitles) grades.
