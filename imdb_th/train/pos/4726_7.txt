The origin of this film is a mystery for me as I know just as much as IMDB did before I rented it. I think earlier "Starship Troopers", "Killshot" was one of the countless pilot pilots who had never done cable networks or else the new name of "Kill Shot" was thrown into a humorous opening scene. The first of many quick clues that this has never been intended for movies. Fast cutting, "Melrose Place", and close-up shots. The 2-second main actors will tell you what you are doing. <br /> <br /> And I'm not interested in all I rent. This film, which saw the packaging that made Casper Van Deen and Denise Richards in front of the volleyball net, thought it would be a joke to see them in the movie, in addition to SciFi. The travesty of Starship Troopers is not a movie The hottest part After watching the IMDB, my roommate and I predicted that the pilot was dragged up after the clear success of the Troopers and Richards career (see Bond-Girl and Wild Things, referenced here). Sex scenes that are related to small characters in order to get a status. R - Top ranked coveted in the suspicious part. Rent a video. That is, in any case, they should let it not rank if you try to sell. Part pornography suspicious / Soft /> <br /> It's all Court is <br entertainment. I hate to spoil the fun of telling you it's a television pilot. That is the greatest pulling force while watching it - when you expect to receive movies, cinemas and TV shows, the differences between them make themselves more clear than usual. <br /> <br /> I Will you rent again? No, will I watch this TV show? Okay, why isn't it better than Baywatch and their little effort to hit the entire population will do well in the mid 1990s? The black guy token. (Which is gay who must avoid TV taboos in racial dating) Asian tokens (Japanese, I think from the name Koji) are better than science and computers than talking to women Everything will happen to her, except her family's bank account - this list should be good. <br /> <br /> But as a movie, it makes me crack. <br /> <br /> I give 7 things. From 10, considering what it is and being forced to become It makes the evening very enjoyable and that's all I would like to rent.
