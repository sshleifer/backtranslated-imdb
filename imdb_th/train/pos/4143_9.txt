No, I'm not joking. If you ever have the opportunity to watch this movie, see If you want to cut your arm to see it worth it, <br /> <br /> The Fatty Drives The Bus is different from all the movies you've seen. It requires trash in the cinema and elevates it to be a work of art. While it has bad images, stupid characters, bad conversations, strange performances and public movies in Iowa But it was successful in the goal as a movie It's determined to be the most bizarre, stupid movie you've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I'm going to make a storyline for you guys who are worried about things (the creators aren't obvious) but actually you don't have to pay too much attention because The film's story is presented in a long text before it is released. In any case, FDTB (as it's popular) is the story of a bus tour through Chicago led by Satan. Do you see that Jesus was in the city and all the passengers on the bus should die and all their souls had to go to hell except with Jesus in the city? He doesn't like stupid faces, so he decides to take people on the bus to sign his spirit directly with him. But he is a demon, so he must disguise himself otherwise Those who go on a tour with him are correct, so he disguises himself as Roger and he takes the bus without the driver ever mentioning the name But he is a fat person, so I think he is a fat, bus (and driver) on the path, colliding with strange! <br /> <br /> Examples of insanity: the name is repeated on the screen 3 times. I don't know why. The characters appeared on the bus during the journey without explanation or introduction and sometimes sitting next to others and they looked at her like she wasn't. I do not know why Two characters fell in love and exchanged long wishes which were the same shot over and over again. I do not know why After Satan gave a long time alone about changing to become a human, the name card flashes. "Satan is about to change." I don't know why. One character is a woman who is clearly a man who is dragged and referred to by other characters in the name of "Bridget's charming". I don't know why. <br /> <br /> If there is one good thing coming out of my internship at Troma last summer, it received a copy of my own Fatty Drives The Bus.
