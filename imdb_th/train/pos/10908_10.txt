I couldn't hold my tears when I watched this beautiful documentary. It is a painful and disturbing story that inspires all in one place. I recommend this documentary to anyone who is looking for something that will make them think about what they do. Or just what will make you think You watched while John lived in the last few months of his life. You watched as he passed his day with a positive attitude. At one point, you begin to see that he is a truly remarkable person. You start to understand that he has something to teach us all. His life and struggle will make you cry, laugh and find life much easier if you spend once a day.
