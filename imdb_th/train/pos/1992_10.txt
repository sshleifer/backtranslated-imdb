I'm really old now. I'm watching 40-year-old flick and wonder what my grandchildren will look for 40 years from now. It's an old saying. But they didn't do that anymore .. It's not just about music, performances, both by children and adults .. Actors seem to be born to play their own roles. Oliver, young age, Fagin is very old. That talks about them all The role that Judge Oliver had previously played, I have seen in many other roles for many years .. Those who are cleverly tricky Ron, good temper as Fagen, Mr. and Mrs. Woolsey Take a few Golden Globe awards as well. If you decide to watch this movie, please indulge yourself. Get some kids, if not everyone, to see this masterpiece.
