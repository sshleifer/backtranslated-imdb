This may be the only film that comes close to capturing the film world that cannot be truly adapted to the experience of American colleges in the late 70s and early 70s. Go ahead, name another movie that is closer to this story. : "Getting Straight"? "RPM"? These are caricatures "The return of the Seacus Seven" has a period but it is a retrospective movie about a person. (Obsessed with myself) more than movies about the time and place shown * in * time and place "Drive the car, he said," portrays - with the subtlety and the difference that should be, and the quick kick in the shorts, which is the only proper way - the movement against the dubious form of big college sports (Especially when there is a war) the sexual revolution of the period and general unreality of the day Believe me, it's like that. <br /> <br /> Every actor deserves praise. (Like the director, of course), but especially praise should be reserved for Bruce Dern as a basketball coach and Karen Black. The hero is very strange - except at that time - love interest.
