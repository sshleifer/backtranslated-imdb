I love Kristen Dunst, especially in Elizabethtown. I guess she is a type of actress who shouldn't show himself in front of the camera. But should be yourself She did that and she looked natural in Elizabethtown However, in this film, she tried to increase the effectiveness of the invention, especially in the first half of the film, so she seemed to be a quiet editor. While the other half she set herself completely on my daily track and I couldn't tell her to be an editor in any way, so her performance didn't end in this film. <br /> <br / > The overall film is attractive and inspiring. Young's character is full and reasonable. However, this movie tells a great and complex story. <br /> <br /> The only big flaw is that it doesn't show the hero's turning point and the heroine's love story. I'm completely confused when they kiss each other at the end of the story because it's not clear for both of them.
