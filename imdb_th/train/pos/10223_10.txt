* Some destroyers * <br /> <br /> I was very surprised to find harsh criticism. (Acting conversations, dates, stories that are not clear) are unfounded. Belafonte is excellent as Brandoesque, a dangerous, swearing spirit that must receive his wings. But is a bad device from his past life to do so He learns too slowly that his hustling life is empty. Objects, life without love. Mostel is also great as a pain with Fanny, a dying wife. Despite praying for miracles, his bitterness prevented him from accepting (or believing) only one thing. The two societies in which the characters represent each other, collide and fill others Sad to touch. <br /> <br /> The tragic ending is quite consistent with the rest of the film. After looking everywhere, Belafonte Mostel looked up and saw the feather falling, and he reached out to him as if he was finally willing to believe in angels and miracles. But Belafonte was not allowed to finish the miracle (Whether to restore the health of Fannie's or Mostel's faith) so he never received his wings The furry came out narrowly from the understanding of Mostel. The parable of the life of both men: It's too late and you won't get a second chance, just like "It's a wonderful life." Funny magic But very sad
