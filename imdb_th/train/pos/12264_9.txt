If you, while I have a long and close relationship with the world of Tintin .... Make yourself a favorite and watch beautiful documentaries about Hergé and his life that created Tintin I am excellent and it is a great work. The story behind all about Hergé and the people, as well as the many different situations he was influenced by the good and the worse, was amazing. There is a good and clear link between the comic book and this story. I will be in the basement to dig the Martin's resolution again. In addition, the movie itself is very good and has a great ambient sound for it. I hope people will find this interesting as I do!
