They do it and boys. They do it amazingly or anything! Finally, the BBC brought the doctor back to our screen on Saturday night he was! And they do it in style! <br /> <br /> Part one: "Rose" - One of the highlights of the new series is Russel T Davies as a writer and producer. He is a big fan of acting and knows what other fans want. But was an experienced writer on his own, so he knew what others wanted Another highlight that is fully demonstrated in this first episode is Billie Piper and her character Rose Tyler. Finally, the doctor's companion will receive a credible story and strong character. It's also good to see the return of Autons - a good nod to the classic series there. <br /> <br /> Episode two: "The End of the World" - In the beginning of the second bill This time to show off the TARDIS Our strengths end in a special effect that is everything! Now they have the technology to create real environments and monsters. It's convincing - there's no strange rubber dress again! Advice at the end of this episode about the new doctor's past - very interesting to rid the lord of time and make him one. <br /> <br /> Third episode: "Silent death. Calm "- We 'used to have a future. Now, let's have a past. The first episode that was not the writing of Davies was quite flat in some places. But it was created by Charles Dickens of Simon Colin and the sudden twist of the plot when it was revealed that br / <br /> Episode IV: "Alien Of London "- as a result of the doctor's actions were fully explored in this series, not least with the effects of the Rose that ran away with him. We also have our first excitement. Not the best of those who accept Slitheen as an interesting villain, even though they can see CGI for their own goodness. <br /> <br /> Episode Five: "World War III" - Part Two of these stories about most Slitheen experienced the same problems of the first. In addition, clips from the next episode that will arrive at the end of the current episode are annoying and wasted for people. <br /> <br /> Episode Six: "Da" - Yes! We have a future, past and present (ish), but now we go to the good things - the return of the doctor's process. Here I think we can fulfill Christopher Ecclestone - he is excellent, is a doctor and not so much now that we see the pain on his face as he reminds of war times and the nature of aliens. <br /> <br /> The seventh episode: "The Long Game" - is just a story that will serve as a prologue for the series finale, recorded by Simon Pegg as Smarmy and T editors amsin Grieg in an amusing pendant The media are controlling us - never done this before ... <br /> <br /> Episode Eight: "Father's Day" - This is a wonderful episode. Full of human emotions and the sadness of Rose and the consequences of what happens when you destroy history The full score for Billie Piper here. <br /> <br /> Episode Nine: "The Empty Child" - I didn't find this kid that was so scary. Sorry but I didn't, even though it was a good episode. But the thrilling person would be better - that's a bit "next time" that made them lose. John Barrowman was introduced here as captain Jack conman. Dashing - he's a good actor who has been around in while <br /> <br /> Episode ten: "Dance Doctor" - The second part of this WW2 story - very well built in the historical context. Ended in a good rhythm But may be a little confusing for younger audiences when revealing "mummies"? <br /> <br /> Eleventh episode: "Boomtown" - probably the weakest of the series. But that doesn't mean it's bad. It's a good reward for Slitheen and Doctor and Rose's interesting character education. <br /> <br /> Twelve episodes: "Bad Wolf" - This started with a rather stupid, good humor and fun. At the popular TV show Over You in Blighty, things quickly become deadly and the final revelation is the most exciting story in the series! <br /> <br /> EPISODE THRITEEN: "The combination of methods" - Goodbye Christopher Ecclestone, a great doctor in many ways. David Nant has to work hard to make socks as good as him. The scene of revival at the end plays beautifully. Oh and the Daleks are back - finally! May God bless CGI because they can't pull this out as normal! <br /> <br /> Overall - excellent! 9/10
