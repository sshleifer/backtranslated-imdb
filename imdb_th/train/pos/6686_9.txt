This movie is a great concept. It is original, cleverly written and highly appealing for those of us who do not choose compatible movies. Do not understand me wrong - there are some great movies that are so appealing. But when you move into watching movies using "Others are watching." You know that you are tweeting or not having opinions. This story has a subtle, cute sense of humor - though most people may only look clear The actors portray their characters with self-confidence and I think there is a more "personal" personality in this movie. There is an appeal for children as well as Esp adults. Pleased to find a good movie that does not contain sexual references and drugs! Great movies that should not be overlooked by public consumption. This must be purchased.
