So what is considered a true independent movie? In the day and age in which the mainstream Hollywood fashion trends are emerging and modern, I'm sorry to say that what people tend to perceive as independent movies is usually nothing more. Than clever marketing tactics> <br /> which is why we are glad to have a movie like "Hatred of a Minute". This movie makes a difference from its own template. (Indie horror film) Love or hate it. "Hate" is not afraid to be the way it is and in watching this movie, you will feel that Kallio (director) not only created this movie to spray fake blood all over That he is in here to tell a good story, you may find that this movie is in the horror category of your video store But don't be fooled, this story is about love, good people pushed to the edge and the light at the far end of the tunnel. <br /> <br /> If you expect smut or rip Dead Evil to stay away from this movie But if you dig the finer points of the horror / paranoid line to watch this movie, <br /> <br /> Yes, Bruce Campbell produced this movie and I'm sure he is proud to tell people that it's not "Evil Dead" Bruce never tried to create the image of his "ash" and apparently he was not involved with <br /> <br /> My advice, though, for everyone. Dead-ites like crazy, swallowing things out. Mr. Campbell is checking out this movie. Go and see if there is anything else that Mr. Kallio and Mr. Campbell are trying to show you. <br /> <br /> The performance is good though. There is nothing about this movie, oscar caliber (probably intended). It is good to see sympathy in horror. Often actors in movies like this do not seem to try as well. "Hate", but it seems that all the actors take their actors seriously, never turning to fear horror movies. <br /> <br Technically, "Hatred" has the same ability as that. Indie movies The editing is fast, the movie gets a good budget and "Hate" continues to go fast without having a deadlock or an anti-climax. <br /> <br /> All in all, hate may not. There are millions of dollars of shimmering indies. But personally I don't see the problem. It's a movie of people who are really interested in the media. People who came in their bags broke out. Pulled Nickles and their dimes carefully and made a good movie. <br /> <br /> Let's see.
