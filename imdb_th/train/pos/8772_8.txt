Director Raul Walsh is like Michael Bay of the 40s and many years before that. And I mean that in a positive light because I am not a hater His movies are just as high quality entertainment as the Raoul Walsh movie of his generation. <br /> <br /> "Gentleman Jim" is good quality entertainment. In addition, there are first-class directors and top performers, with Errol Flynn, Raoul Walsh's leading man in the main section. <br /> <br /> What surprised me? Is They use a non-stop camera, which makes the boxing match more exciting and exciting to watch with the final championship fight with John L. Sullivan being the most prominent. <br /> <br /> Biopics of '40's and before This page is still clearly different from the current biography.

In real life, this means that filmmakers often use the freedom to create with the characters of the main characters and the events that occur in them. / Her life. This film is not only But is a biography about boxing legend But also creating a good image since the era of illegal bare knuckle fighting into the age of modern struggle. Errol Flynn is a great job. The famous boxer of life, James J. Corbett, aka gentleman, Jim There are not many people who know, but Flynn works in a great performance in the 40s. This movie is Fysicaly. He still looks very good. He looks different from the original without his small tentacles in this movie. The film also has good supporting actors and good performances throughout <br /> <br /> Great movies and entertainment that are still true today. <br /> <br /> 8 / 10
