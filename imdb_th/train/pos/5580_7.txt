Beautiful Eva (Hedy Lamarr) is married to an old man (Zvonimir Rogoz). Unfortunately, he cannot satisfy her sexual desire and doesn't care about her. She returned home with disappointment and planned to divorce. Then one day she dipped in the lake in the forest. Her horse ran out with her clothes ... and she ran along it! She met Adam who was very young and handsome (Aribert Mog). They created love and she realized that this was the man she wanted. <br /> <br /> Spoiler at the end !!! ! Naturally, since this was created in 1933, she had to be punished for her sins, so it led to the last tragic scene. The end of the end of the spoiler !!!! <br /> <br /> Scary people in 1933, but it's quite tame in today's standards. Lamarr's nude swimming did not show anything, and when she ran behind all the horses, it was shown in a long shot or covered with branches and others. Her breasts had a slight shock. In addition, when she has sex with Mog, nothing will be shown except her face. But you see that she succeeded in orgasm These scenes are considered extreme in their days and are cut from the American version. Now they are back today. This movie will come with PG-13 easily. <br /> <br /> The shot is now ok. It was beautifully filmed and there was no discussion. Except for music scores, this may be a silent image. Fortunately, all the performers are good - Lamar and Mok in particular, and they are charming as they just hold their breath. See them. The order in which they create love is easily one of the most beautiful scenes and scenes that I have seen in movies. The scene with the sex symbol (there are a few). Unfortunately, it is obvious today. In fact, I started to laugh at one moment. <br /> <br /> So the direction is wonderful. That attracts good performances around - but I don't feel surprised I found the movie moving slowly. (Beautiful images do not create images for me) is quite blunt, clear, constant and has a negative end. I can live with the ending But didn't solve any other problems that I had last, really strange - and out of place So I admire this movie more than anything else. It did very well and I highly recommend it. But with caution Many people seem to love this movie, so I am a minority. Use your own judgment
