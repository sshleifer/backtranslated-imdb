Erroll works for the Ministry of Public Safety and his job is to investigate sex offenders. Sometimes he pushes his job and defeats the sex offender. I don't blame him, but his boss is ready to let him go. Now Erroll is training her to do his job and it's like a shadow. Allison is quite naive about the job at first. But she did not realize the danger she was and Erroll's fault. He began to go far with a passion for finding a lost woman when his job was not a police officer. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that Well enough about the madman who pushed the boundaries. "The scope of his practice" Erroll works well, but for Allison's safety, there is a great mystery as well, and when I think of it, there is more.
