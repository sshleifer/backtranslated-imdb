This is the first review I wrote for IMDb to bare with me, but I caught a flick on HBO and glad I watched it. Richard Gere is a great person in this film as an energetic agent / detective who stole the rules to complete the task. I think this is very good and there are no boring scenes that make the movie slow down. Some of the movies about drug addicts who have sexual symptoms are quite shocking. But if you have seen a crime movie like Se7en, you will be able to shoot the scene well. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for a good detective / suspense movie, don't ignore the low ratings that this movie has on IMDb and watch. Of course!
