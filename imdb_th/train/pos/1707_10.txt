This movie is not for everyone. You are bright enough to get "it" or not, fans of sci-fi movies that are not very serious about it will enjoy this movie. I recommend this movie for those who like parody and parody. Everyone I recommend to this movie is happy. If you enjoy Monty Python or Mel Brooks movies, you may enjoy this movie. The sound classification is done in a tongue and cheek, flying fast and violently.
