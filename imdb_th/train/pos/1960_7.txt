This will take about a year after the event in "Basic instinct" Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is now in London. While having sex with a footballer while speeding the car to 110 miles / hour (don't ask), she leaves the road and ends up at the Thames. She survived - he couldn't. Police hired psychologist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) to see if she had mental abilities or not. Usually, she starts playing with his thoughts instead of having murder and having many sexes. <br /> <br /> The film is doomed before it opens. It took forever to get actors and directors of script problems fixed and the actors were not satisfied. (Morrissey complained about the movie often) It wasn't too bad. It was like the first time - with scores of lush music, beautiful places, sex and many nudity. (Must be solved for R) complex plot and good performance - but without any effect, it feels like the first casting People are killed here with a choke (I believe) ... just as people were first killed by ice. At a lovely time, once the stone chose ice and watched it for a long time. She also plays a game of thinking with a man and may cause him to participate in the murder. The similarities are too clear. <br /> <br /> This has also been rated R - There are many clear sex talks, male nudity. (Morrissey looks better nude than Michael Douglas) Nude pictures of women) and bloodshed murders Performances performed well across the board. The most wonderful stone here Morrissey looks miserable, but it's ok. Charlotte Rampling and David Thewlis play an important role in support. <br /> <br /> So - this is not bad, but it feels like it's the first creation. Just attack this because Stone is not a favorite and they think it's stupid to do the sequel of "Basic ..." 14 years after it was created.
