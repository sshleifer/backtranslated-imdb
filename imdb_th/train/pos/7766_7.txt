After playing the nymph with the writing of WIND, Dorothy Malone said goodbye to the role of a good sister / wife and demonstrated the ability to play with the best. She and Gloria Graham played as a nomadic - and for her efforts here in a very bad role, Malone won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. <br /> <br / > The movies that she joined were not standard. But it is a strong enough melodrama under the hands of Douglas Sirk Has a look that is almost like a bomb shot scene and has set the tone for interesting fireworks in the story with HUDSON ROCK, LAACEN BACALL, ROURT STACK and DOROTHY MALONE. Struggle in the home among the wealthy families whose oil background is the main focus of this drama, focusing on the strong players supporting Stack and Malone. They both took the opportunity by hand and The stack, too, should be rewarded for his heavy work as a weak and alcoholic brother who is driven to despair from his own wild impulses. <br /> <br /> A little star. Impressive to do But with normal skills and confidence - Hudson and Bacal They have a more compassionate role with quiet power and understanding. <br /> <br /> The use of color is a remarkable thing. (Usually in the movie Sirk) but didn't prevent me from thinking about this movie As the movie Technicolor Noir in the veins of LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN <br /> <br /> Worth watching with an interesting show from all the actors.
