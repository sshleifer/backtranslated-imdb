Two great comedians in the great Neil Simon movie based on his play. <br /> <br /> A wonderful mix, especially when the comedian with the problem is Matthau and Burns. Why Burns won the Oscar this time; He is sharp and funny as always. And Matto is his partner every time. If there are more mistakes, <br /> <br /> This is a familiar land Simon: Two old music partners gather together for TV < br /> <br /> It was a pleasure to see both of them choosing their scenes together to make this movie a definite pleasure. I myself like "tap, tap, tap / ENTER!" Especially the scene. And if you are a fan of Burns or Matthau, you will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> In fact, you will have fun. With the whole movie <br /> <br /> Ten stars put a little "sunshine" in your life.
