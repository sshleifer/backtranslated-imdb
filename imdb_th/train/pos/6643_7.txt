When I heard that this movie came out the night before Halloween, I was very excited. When I discovered that it was a book written in 1978, I had to read it before watching the movie. I'm sure this movie will be very different to me if I don't really read the book. Actually, the author works well to maintain the reality of the main plot of the book, with a slightly different nature. I think the thing that made me the most disappointed about this movie is that Boyle plays as Col. I am not a big fan of Boyle and it seems like no matter what the mood in this movie is. She tried to use her more. The plump lips and eyes that are entirely covered to make yourself look super sexy. In fact, I think this movie is true to the horror of the house. My favorite plan is the Sheehan family (which is very strange, b / c, the son was killed in Iraq, and in the current event, with Casey Sheehan, the mother who went against the massive Iraqi resistance) in this book It is clear that the war is not Iraq. But in Vietnam and when the house opened the video of the son in the helicopter, I actually crawled out Overall, I was impressed with this film, which is well based on the book.
