Not bad for Raw's first PPV from 006, but the ending is really shocking to everyone in attendance and those who are watching at home. <br /> <br /> The first match - RIC FLAIR VS EDGE W / LITA for the WWE Interchange Championship is not a good kicker. Both of these competitions are excellent if they have enough time to compete with the winning Dair Flair by DQ after Edge bash him with the MITB briefcase. His 3/10 match Twice - STRISH VS Micky James Strategy for the WWE World Championship. Not bad. Notice the fact that this is the first time these singers face each other in the arena. Mickey goes to the Chick Chick that has been Adapted to her own Chick Kick & Chick Kick nail to win to maintain her position. 3/10 Third - Triplex H VS. Big Show This is a really good match. All competitions HHH focuses on the injured arm of the Big Show. But the Big Show continues to fight back. HHH can overthrow the Big Show and hammer the bloodline for victory. 5/10 The fourth match - Shelton Benjamin W / Mama VS VISCERA {This is a bonus match} No It's bad. It doesn't matter. After Viscera fell behind, the judge of Benjamin's mother received a purse. {Which had a brick in it} and struck Viscera on his head three times. Viscera got up to get kicked by turning the heel by Benjamin to defeat the 4/10 big man. <br /> <br /> The fifth race - Jerry 'THE KING' LAWLER VS GREGORY hats are boring, slow and sloppy. The two men didn't make much effort. Jerry Lawler won after Fist Drop won 2/10. <br /> <br /> Six matches TORRIE Wilson vs Victoria VS Ashley VS Maria VS CANDICE MICHELLE In the first match in which all women matched, it was fun for me. Ashley {I think} eliminated Candice as the last person to win the first women's glove competition. 5/10 Seventh match - JOHN CENA VS CHRIS MASTERS VS. CARLITO VS SHAWN MICHAELS VS KANE VS KURT ANGLE W / DAIVARI in the competition of Want to compete for the WWE Championship, it is the best competition. But nothing is better than the best screening room last year The last three are Masters, Cena & Carlito. Carlito turns his back on the Masters & manages to get rid of him. A few seconds later, Cena joined Carlito for the third time to win the Elimination Chamber and retain his WWE position, but his night did not finish 7/10 after Vince McMahon came out to congratulate Cena. For his victory Vince McMahon said that his night was not over yet, and said that Edge had withdrawn his money on the bank's opportunity to challenge Cena for the position of Edge, coming out with Lita, giving a briefcase to Vince and heading. At the ring, because Cena has another appointment to go here tonight. <br /> <br /> Eighth match - JOHN CENA vs EDGE W / LITA for the WWE World Championship {Cena, who was caught being opened in During the Chamber match) was knocked out by Edge by Edge and Stunned Cena's spear at the cover and shocked him. Cena broke out. Edge nails Spear & covered the shocking three times as he beat Cena & won the WWE Championship for the first time in his career. 1 / 10 So the New Year's Revolution last year is better than this year. But it's okay. The EC pairing is good & the shock of Edge cashing in on his MITB opportunity is the most shocking in the PPV list. <br /> <br /> Overall: I'll give 7/10 & C.
