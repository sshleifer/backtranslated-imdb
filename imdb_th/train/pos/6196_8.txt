With a series of representatives of government, terrorists, flight and tragic firefighters. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey presents the perfect cartoon show at a given time. With the strong participation of Jasmin Tabatabai and Saffron Burrows Fay Grim proved in the Billy Wilder tradition that the best is nothing more fun than a beautiful woman who is in trouble. <br /> <br /> Another good score of Hartley ( And thanks to the American Academy credit in Berlin that Hartley served as a friend in the fall of 2004)
