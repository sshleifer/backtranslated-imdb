Surprisingly good The show is fun. The movie script is fun, fun, and fun. This is a fun movie for watching and allowing the brain to rest. Some of the plot and words I found were very creative. 7 out of 10. Actually, it should have been 10 out of 10. You should not compare it to an art house or bloodshed
