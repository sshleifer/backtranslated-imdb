It is remarkable that for players who support 'Young Mr. Lincoln', Ford has less famous and less known actors. This does not only add interest to his film, which is only for Lincoln's main character. But it also helps the audience gain a deeper understanding of Lincoln as a man in his time and time. A man has become unrelated to each of us. The feeling of his time and find a way to fix them It doesn't have much in the words and actions of Lincoln's Fonda. But on the player's reaction page, Ford tells the story of the formation of Lincoln's young worldview, the sense of place in society and modesty. The words and actions of Mr. Lincoln and his confidence in this man whom they thought were respected and caring. <br /> <br /> Try it out: instead of focusing on Henry Fonda the next time you See 'Young Mr. Lincoln, change your focus to the supporting characters - I expect you to be rewarded with great appreciation for both Lincoln and Ford. I like to wonder if Ford's storytelling through the character's reaction to Lincoln's support of Fonda might have attracted David Lean when he directed Omar Sharif in 'Zhivago', which is the character's reaction Really support Zhivago
