The name has many meanings - a boxing ring that fights with differences and frustration. The wedding ring that Mabel feels trapped and Jack feels that his problem will end and the cause of the bracelet-like problem is the ring that Bill. Let Mabel <br /> <br /> Danish professional boxer Carl Brisson was started in the movie by Alfred Hitchcock in "The Ring", Ian Hunter, who is still very young. Long in the movie, played as Bob Corby, who attracted the eyes of beautiful Mabel. (Lillian Hall Davis) fun She accidentally participated in "One Round" Jack Sander (Carl Brisson), but that didn't stop flirting with Bob. Bob persuaded him to go "one round" with Jack, he went many times and won - he was a professional boxer and he and his manager came in to see if Jack was a good fighter as they used to be. Hear it? He proposed to get Jack and Jack out with his boorish trainer (Gordon Harker) to make his fate with a plan to marry Mabel when he did good. Jack wins the fight and marries Mabel the next day. But the deep appeal that she and Bob felt to each other was still there. Jack wondered and kept everything in his training so he could fight Bob for his wife. <br /> <br /> Finally, the boxing movie that the hero didn't freak out - Bob behaved himself. And do everything possible To be a winner - if only Mabel did the same way !!! She left him for Bob - and the fight at the end was a powerful story. It was very realistic - spent the last 20 minutes of the movie. From being raw and enthusiastic, Jack almost bursts out - then, during the reunion with Mabel, makes him brave to succeed. The question is why he wants her to come back - from the beginning, she doesn't think there's a relationship with Bob - why don't you do it again? <br /> <br /> This movie is full of symbols. Jack shook hands with the promoters of Mabel's hand that accepted the bracelet from Bob. When Jack puts the ring on Mabel's finger, the Bobs bracelet will drop to her arm. At the end, Jack saw a reflection of Mabel in a water tank by the river and that made him confident in his next work. This is a great movie that will not disappoint you. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
