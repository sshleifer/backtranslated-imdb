I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago and it stuck in my head ever since. It is the two hypnotic characters in a documentary that is disappointing. In order to receive the true story of Beales, I have to wade through the content, bonus DVDs and all comments and search the web. <br /> <br /> Although Maysles and their fans (not to mention Edith and Edie himself) are angry at the words. Suggesting that this movie is an exploitation, this is the exploitation of the true meaning of the word There is little effort to explain Beales or how they came to participate - the way in which Maysles seems to turn on the camera and wait for Edith and Edie to say something outrageous. The sound, even in Criterion re-release, is bad and difficult to follow. Although I appreciate this film quite quickly in the history of documentary films, it is ridiculous to compare Geraldo Rivera (!), A superior series of sexual abuse of mental retardation patients at Willowbrook State School in Staten. Island from 1972 before being shot at Gray Gardens <br /> <br /> In the transcription of New Yorker reviews, there are many things that Edith and Edie wanted in their lives, and the documentary wasn't one of them. <br /> <for Edith and Edie, what I think next while watching movies is "Where is the hell in the family?" They live in dangerous, unsafe and unsafe conditions. Jackie O is married to one of the richest men in the world. (Or the wealthy Bouvier family themselves) can't make Edith and Edie a good home. Or at least hire a temporary housewife or caretaker to come in and watch them both? It's a shameful and embarrassing story throughout the family. Bouvier <br /> <br /> Although this review may sound negative But I recommend Gray Gardens to everyone who likes documentaries. Maybe someday someone may come and make a documentary about this documentary - bringing the story full of the backstory (and after) of Beales and the entire subset of the Hamptons society in the 1970s.
