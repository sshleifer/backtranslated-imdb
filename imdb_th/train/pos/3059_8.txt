Writer / director Henry Brommel has done an excellent job with his movie "Panic" from 2000, and that includes choosing his actors: William H. Macy, Tracy Ullman, John Ritter, Neve Campbell, Donald Sutherland, Barbara Bain, David Dorfman Brommel recruited actors Ullman and Ritter in a role that is certainly not funny and the casting of unusual performers is a delightful change from what we normally see. <br /> <br /> "Panic" Is the story of the killer Alex (Macy) working for He (Sutherland), covering his career, his real work by mail order. By all appearances, he and his wife (Ullman) and their son Sammy (Dorfman) are typical suburban families. Alex asks for help from a psychiatrist (Ritter) telling his mother (Ben) in the waiting room. He meets a young woman (Campbell), whom he is immediately attracted to, which makes his situation more difficult. His mother broke the contract and told her father about a psychiatrist. When Alex was given the next assignment, he discovered that he was about to kill his psychiatrist. <br /> <br /> This is a profound story of a gentle man and a good man who became a murderer by animals. The freak of his parents Knowledge that killed his father But still can't stand up and stop His anger is so deep that he loses his emotional attachment to everything and everyone except his son - and eventually it is his son who wakes him up from life-long oppression. When the time that "Panic" is moving is done - fast. <br /> <br /> "Panic" doesn't seem to panic. In fact, it moves very slowly. But it moves slowly, not because it does not work well - laziness is a thorough thought to reflect Alex's mind coming out of the fog slowly By deciding on Sara, a character in Campbell, and when seeing his mark, his own psychiatrist, who is still breathing with humanity, Alex begins to connect between what he did to the person he are Scam And the difference between the two may lead to the loss of Sammy's heart. <br /> <br /> William Macy's gives a great performance again as a father who loves husbands who are far away. Far and cold killer two children A monster that never cares about his feelings or desires. The person who finally realizes that he has to step on the plate or has a repeat cycle. <br /> <br /> This is not a drama that plays well. In the cinema It is too mature, too small, too fragile, is a character and good too.
