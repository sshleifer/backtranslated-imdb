At the same time he met Cheryl Smiley. (Joy Bryant) and they fall in love with each other Solving his personal problems, Antwone became a new person. True family drama This story is an impressive and positive story of a man who finds friends and is sent back to normal life. The direction of Denzel Washington is excellent, making it sensitive, attractive and tasteful. It's a story about child abuse. In the hands of other directors, it may be very heavy. My score is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Voltando a Viver' ('Return to Live')
