The story of the homeless, the boss of his sheep farm and the boss's daughter is not for every taste. But it is still very interesting It happened in New Zealand that is beautiful amidst the scenery that we know well through other movies from this region. <br /> <br /> This movie is the first time I have seen Mary's wonderful. Regan and I have been her boyfriend ever since The actors also have Bruno Lawrence, who may be best remembered by American audiences from the movie "Smash Palace". Terence Cooper turns out to be a ranch owner who is wrongly interested. With his daughter too (Regan) <br /> <br /> Perform clearly with an accidental breakdown from all the leaderboards. The first time I saw this movie in a format that was very much modified on television late at night here in America. But believe you, I shouldn't miss an irradiated version.
