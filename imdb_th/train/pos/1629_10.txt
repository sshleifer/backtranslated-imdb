This movie is very cheap. It's love !!! With Ron Liebmann (Major Vaughn) delivering the most entertaining screenplay in movie history I am the owner of 2 movies in the video ... One story that Ralph McKio was truly captured in the background that Major Vaugn, as he was bragging about "Hash", apparently they forgot To fix this error from the movie But it will show how funny the movie is when the actors can't keep their face straight !!!
