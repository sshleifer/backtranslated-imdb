"Painting is seen and remembered better than you see." (Ronald Coleman), a painter in the film The Light That Failed, said that the film is an old-style Hollywood movie starring Ronald Coleman and a brave actor. (Co-starred with Colman in Condemned.) And a strong performance by a great actor Walter Huston. <br /> <br /> The title and opening sequence of the movie is quite true that Dick is losing sight. He didn't see it by releasing the powder gun while he and his childhood lover Maisie (Muriel Angelus) were playing with a pistol. Later wound up while fighting in Sudan as a catalyst for his blindness He became a famous painter. But he was blinded by ambition and did not reach its full potential until the point that his eyes had left him. Enter Bessie, a bad girl (Ida Lupino) and his own destruction began. Man as well Her evil tart reminds me of Bette Davis in Of Human Bondage. <br /> <br /> Act and act well. This is one of my favorite Melodramas Colman.
