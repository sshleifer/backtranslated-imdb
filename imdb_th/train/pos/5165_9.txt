This work is about adults returning to a newly developed summer camp for their youth, a very quiet participant and screened in theaters in the fall of 1993. I can say that this is a shame. The quiet release that was not much appreciated. <br /> <br /> Diane LAne, Kevin Pollack, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Julie Warner, Bill Paxton, Kimberly Williams, Matt Craven and Alan Arkin (painfully Very good here) is a group of actors that nourish these roles as people who grew up with good, bad and funny memories in the past summer. This film has content about the most pleasant emotions and the film never disturbs the audience to feel the characters that have the feeling of choosing to let the audience enter their own memories. Since I was a movie viewer who brutally brushed in the film, this is what I thank you from the writer / director Mike Binder. <br /> <br /> This movie is a cheap movie rental that good Beautiful ride in the flick theater You may come across this on TV and I definitely recommend watching it.
