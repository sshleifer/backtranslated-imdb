I think Mookin wrote wonderfully. It's not just about entertainment. There are many detailed messages that I think Yasmin is trying to use. And yes it may confuse some people (Especially if you don't watch Sepet and / or Gubra 76 times) <br /> <br /> How can I bet that you noticed that they used the characters from two previous movies, right? It's really funny how the characters relate. Just like the bossy neighbor is a prostitute from Gubra and the chicks that the snooker turns into a religion and the wife of a devout man in the future. <br /> <br /> And I love the voice-overs. Its crude oil is surprisingly fresh. For example, when they photographed the sign Rumah Tumpangan Gamin. Suddenly, there was a voice of Mook Mun saying that 'Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim ..' (The scene where he climbs the tree) <br /> <br /> It captures the attitude of Malaysian people (and) in a mild way, with a pathetic idea, drawing in the characters For example, even children can speak sharp language. (With an annoying sound wailing) and bad mouth, watching all the movies And how you can be a busy person and talk about ppl when your life is not separated. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that this movie reaches my expectations completely, if not <br /> <br /> It makes me stare at the screen. I can't take my eyes off it. Not made out in the cinema. Ha.
