Time for Hit! <br /> Waqt Dir- Vipul Amrutlal Shah Actress - Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra, Shefali Shah, Rajpal Yadav and Boman Irani Written by - Aatish Kapadia Rating- *** <br /> <br /> Eureka! We have received! Yes, ladies and gentlemen in the 'Waqt' of Vipul Shah. We may find the first real hit of this year. Contains all the necessary ingredients of a popular commercial fare. 'Waqt' has everything to make the movie click to the Indian audience. It's a movie that makes distributors feel happy and contemplating his next visit! In the 'fairy tale of Indian emotions', now we have a happy family, Ishwar (Amitabh Bachchan), a wealthy postman. (Don't ask! ... there is something about selling toys while sending letters and everything seriously - who gives a damn! Married to Sumi (Shefali Shah) is a father who is fascinated by Aditya (Akshay Kumar). Ichwar must make a serious decision about the son's attentive attitude towards life responsibility. Although his love for Aditya resulted in procrastination of serious problems However, when faced with a situation that will test the race against time, Ishwar has no choice but to throw Aditya out of the house - hoping that the new situation may make him more diligent in his own life. But the solution to this presumed problem has become a problem in itself when the rift between the increased love with the son and the fence continues to increase. <br /> <br /> You don't have to be a rocket scientist who knows the story. It provides many opportunities to put comedy and drama together. So before the moment when you had a funny first comedy track later in Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav; And after that time there was a time for your handkerchief between Aby and Akki! Writer Aatish Kapadia (He also wrote the original Gujarati drama 'Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu' in which the film is based) works well in the treatment of liquid lectures. Conversations tend to be inconsistent sometimes. It doesn't help the music that looks like acne on the teen face and destroys the proceedings. Obviously, there are a few numbers that can be eliminated. Vipul shows that he has a natural flair for telling 'Waqt', as well as his previous debut efforts. 'Aankhen' makes You are interested until the last round In a personal note - the seesaw of emotions is a jerk for me. But the assessment of the audience's reaction is working with the handle. <br /> <br /> Finally, 'Waqt' is all about their performance, which is equal to one total score! Amitabh Bachchan can be trusted as always. His energy can be seen and his age too! Shefali pitches in the best performance and matches the superstars at every step. Boman and Rajpal bring the house down by showing their talents. Priyanka can do nothing less than fulfill the role of the heroine. When everything was boiling down, even though 'Waqt' was Akshay's vehicle, I always confirmed that Akki was as good as the right role for him. Put him in 'Mujhse Shaadi Karogi' and he was great, but in 'Bewafaa' he was bad. Very much here. Akki is probably the best. Whether it is a funny moment or showing his emotions, he is near perfect. There are also action scenes for his fans! Ironically, his previous best effort was' Aankhen'- with the same director and Big B beside him. <br /> <br /> 'Waqt' is an unforgettable movie. Not the only one that will be shown in better movies in our industry. But it is one for the masses And during the time when the industry is waiting for an international hit, 'Waqt' may be trickery! <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Unimportant story - This is Akshay Kumar's second movie, after consecutive 'Bewafaa', which he performed on stage during the climax! <br /> <br /> Rating - *** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good *** * Very good ***** Excellent <br /> < br /> 22 April 2005
