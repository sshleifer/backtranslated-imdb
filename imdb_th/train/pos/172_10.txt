I saw this movie in Comedy Central a few times. This movie is quite good. It was an interesting adventure with the life of Sunny Davis, who was managed to marry the King of Ohtar so that the US would have a base there to balance power in the Middle East. Some good jokes include "Sunnygate". I also love the ending theme. It gives me a good political spirit. Ten out of ten is my score for this movie.
