I saw this movie after hearing about it for many years. Needless to say, the actual experience proved to be a reducing drug. Even so, Alec Guiness brought great actors to work with excitement if it was a formula that ran through the industry after the Second World War. Perfect Can you remember the car that ran on the water? Can you remember the promise of nuclear power? In this case, it is a fabric that does not deteriorate, reduces wrinkles or even dirt! Of course, the textile manufacturers and their workers were scared when they were expected to be discontinued, so the plot would be slightly thicker. <br /> <br /> Guiness makes the whole organization worth and see. He explodes The factory research lab over and over again explodes! (Those Brits ... The upper lip is always stiff when burnt.) This movie may be embraced like Guiness's ridiculous inventions, but it's also a good car.
