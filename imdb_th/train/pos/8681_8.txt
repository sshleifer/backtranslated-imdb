This cartoon is short on the plot. But is a remarkable work There will be very few destroyers: <br /> <br /> There is a short "story" that is surprisingly little. The underground gnomes are responsible for the spring return each year. But having to fight with the winter that is not ready to withdraw. Both gnomes and storms have their own songs. That is a very beautiful plot as it is. But this cartoon is not about the story But about color and animation The picture is special. Back in 1936, this bright color is still something new and some incredibly inspiring. <br /> <br /> My favorite moment in short is Movement of liquid paint through pipes At more than one point, there is a set of pipes arranged in rows from the shortest to the highest, and the colors that move through the pipes and music tracks make it look like the rows are pipes. <br /> <br /> The image of The battle between greenery and winter storms which refuse to go out quietly. This type of shorts is what Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising said, but they may help lead to the ultimate departure from MGM. Because this cartoon has more budget and finally MGM decided that they can better control the cost Being managed by people who pay a little more attention to Harman and Ising. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful cartoon that is worth watching. It is available on the character's DVD Attack. Like a good animation
