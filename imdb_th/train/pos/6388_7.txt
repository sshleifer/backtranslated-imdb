This is what I know about "Atlantis" before watching: <br /> <br /> * - Disney's first sci-fi adventure. I'm not sure how accurate it is (I like nitpick), but it makes me want to know the first time I hear it. <br /> <br /> * - The preview looks the best. Apparently it was "Secrets too" according to some critics' comments after the facts. <br /> <br /> * - Clearly, it's terrible that Disney says "Swing it out again." Spy Kids' "<br /> <br /> So all that said, the movie is like <br /> <br /> Hella-cool <br /> <br /> I'm a person. Soulful with fantasy animation related to Listening to music and special effects rampant, but "Atlantis" went all out. It was a return to the entire CGI candy shot in "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin", almost as the best effects of the animators. The characters may not be memorable. (Except for the medical staff of the ship) and the plot is a little boring But this is not a movie that you watch the plot. <br /> <br /> This is an argument that bothers me. "Failure" (while it "only" comes in like five hundred million or something, I know that the animators killed to see five coins) from this movie compared to the popularity of "Che Rock "and" Monsters Inc. "are seen as evidence of the death of the original animation. I don't think it's true. What do you think of the movie "South Park" and Final Fantasy? Really, stories and art are everything, not the way. I don't know what the Disney movie will be like. But I don't think they will be out of the picture
