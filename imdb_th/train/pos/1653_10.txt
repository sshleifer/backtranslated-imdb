I agree with everyone who says that this dress is the best type of 'spy'. My husband and I were amazed when it first aired in the US and watched every episode I tried at that time to buy the series. (I made all the tapes) but was told by WGBH that it is not available. I also consider writing to Ian Holm to see if he might have a copy or not! Like everyone else, I bought and read the Deighton series (part to understand the complex plot). If there is a traditional version to play on the DVD, I'll be the first The picture of Ian Holm's Bernard Samson is fragile but brave. (He's always amazing)
