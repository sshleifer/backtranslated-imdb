I just got to occupy The Five Venoms's 3rd Region Celebs DVD and what they did very well.

No need to say that it's a fight scene that many people buy movies and they don't disappoint. The only problem is that they are a little far away and seem to be through rehearsals. Bruce Lee can catch this lot and drink tea at the same time! All kicks and punches come with "click" and "whooshes", which are the coolest effects, though quite fun! Well, but not good in the way I felt it would be a bit better. Golden Swallow by the same director ten years ago had better stories and actions
