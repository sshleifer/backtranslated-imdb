UC 0079 One-year war near the end The neutral colony of the 6th side is determined by the Cyclops, Zeon's task force. Their goal is a new Gundam that was created specifically for the Newtypes (created for the Amuro Ray from the original Gundam saga). Al-Izurah, a Zeon MS fan, met Saku after the battle broke down in the colony. He befriends the pilot Benard "Bernie". Both magicians became good friends. These are honorary members of the team, Cyclops. Through the show, Bernie served as Al's father. (Which the real father worked all the time) and seems to have been taken with the Christina MacKenzie pilot federation But in the end they have to meet .... In the fight, soon Al knows that the war is not a child's toy and Bernie must choose to sacrifice the most to complete the mission. <br /> <br / > Only 6 episodes. Gundam 0080 is a very good program. Mobile sets are very well designed and the animation may look outdated. But showing the emotions in the characters. If you like 0083, try this one, or if you're new to the Gundam world, this is a good show to start with. If you look at acting for drama and character development, this is what you want to focus on mobile suit fighting. I will give more points than the drama. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sometimes you have to lose.
