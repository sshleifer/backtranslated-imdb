Before I watched this movie, I'm not sure whether it would be my cup of tea or not ... I think this is one of the best movies I have watched for a long time and is a really classic family. The story of a young immigrant and his new 'foster' father. This film eliminates all channels. I didn't read the book (It may be a good story & I mean, I like this movie more) But with respect to this, I can't think of a bad issue at all. By the time William announced that 'I can ride my motorcycle. Father!' I cried out of my heart. (Anyone who sees it will understand me, sure). Really warm and recommended.
