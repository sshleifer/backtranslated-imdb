The film took 370 minutes to air on Italian public television in the early seventies. It tells the story of Homer of the Journey Odyssey after the Troy War. It is a great story about the ancient Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations that were listed on the 500-year program after those events occurred around 1100 BC. <br /> <br /> This is the 1969 movie. That the sound is mono and there is no other language other than Italian, although the subtitles are Italian. Pity many people will enjoy this masterpiece if there is a list of English subtitles.But if this is not a problem for you more than I would recommend watching this movie.
