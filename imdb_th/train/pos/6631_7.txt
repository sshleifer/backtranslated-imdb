I do not know how to describe this film and will love to give others the opportunity that I have seen without first knowing about what to expect. I really enjoyed it. But can say that I almost do not understand what happens if in reality there is something to understand from the beginning. Fans of David Lynch (especially) or especially the movie Guy Maddin should be especially fun And fans of the comic book EIGHTBALL may be beside themselves with joy and wonder (It comes close to any movie, Dan Clowes emotionally created effectively) <br /> <br /> A little note, just a warning for everyone who makes it easily offended - this movie if rated Will be NC-17. Of course, fans of full-frontal male nudity, but ... Well, well ... yes, this is a strange thing.
