While I'm not a fan of musicals, I love Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers because they are so fun. Of course, they may be a little recipe. But even if you know what will happen, they are still very pleasant to watch. However, however, I was a little disappointed in this outing. Partly because this film has no great actor, as you can see in TOP HAT or SHALL WE DANCE. Without Edward Everett Horton or Eric Bloor, it looks like the movie. This is a bit lacking, especially in the "fun" department. The stupid comedy of these supporting actors makes the movie more charming that you didn't do with FOLLOW THE FLEET. The normal drama that is played by Astaire, this one is more jerky - while his fat head makes Rogers have a problem over and over again. And as a result, it is very difficult to like him or want to see them gather at the end of the movie In addition, even though Irving Berlin's song is a song But the song doesn't seem as memorable as it should be. In fact, there are no songs that are special and I can't remember even though I just watched the movie. Although this movie is still a cute and worthwhile movie But lacking the spark and the magic of their other movies, good but far from good
