Right, as you can see, this is one of my favorite movies if it's not a favorite movie. This is a very hilarious drama. The main character is a businessman trapped in the idea. "The same thing for another day", he saw a woman watching the depression outside the dance studio window from his train every day and wondering about her and decided to find out more about her. He decided to join the dance class only to find that she was not a teacher. Then he bonded with four other dancers and learned to enjoy the dance, including finding out about a mysterious woman. <br /> <br /> No sexual intercourse (or any) without any reason. How to establish and develop friendships The movie never made it big in America because it was not eligible for an Oscar because it was broadcast on television in Japan. (Movies cannot be broadcast on television or disqualified from Oscar nominations.) It won many awards in Japan for their films, actors, directors and Oscars.
