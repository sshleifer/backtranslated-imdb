The wide openness makes me happy with their inventions - the logo of the Archers that have been modified, the initial responsibility rejection, the way the camera rotates throughout the universe It's strange to think that `It's a wonderful life 'Came out in the same year Not a great coincidence: the 1940s was an action film, Heaven and Earth; But the sparkling cotton ball nebula and the fairies of the competition seem to be tattered. Some things pass quietly next to Alfred Junge's vision. <br /> <br /> It still looks good. throughout And the more outstanding ideas have happened to us I'm not a fan of color mixing and black and white in general. One of the two forms of the image is often ugly when placed next to one another. Powell melts. The color is white, black and white, black as if it were the most natural thing in the world. color Both color and black and white photography can stand on their own. <br /> <br /> For the story ... This is probably the best chapter of Pressburger, or at least it should be more conclusive. Logical results of previous events Besides that, it's tight But there is still more that I can mention here. What in heaven is real or imaginary? (Or both, perhaps Carter dreams of the actual imagination that happens). Everyone says that we shouldn't ask or answer this question. But I don't see why I'm sure we intend to ask questions. This film gives us a clue as to what the answer is - of course, the problem is that there are many clues and they seem to start pointing in different directions at first. The fact that other things should receive attention from us as well does not mean that this should not occupy us as well. There are things that I have said before. There are many things going on. <br /> <br /> Consider the scene in Abraham Farlan. (Lawyers who prosecute heaven) play radio programs of cricket matches The British voice of Dr. Reeves 1945 (the defense) accepted the show with great shame, then created one of his own songs: American blues from which Farlan listened as if he had lemon in His mouth Reeves looks comfortable. <br /> <br /> Crazy? I didn't see why it was so disgusting to condemn the blues - and that's not what Powell and Pressburger were doing while playing music. We received the sound of American soldiers: many people nodded to the beat. Like home They didn't find it difficult to understand. There are some valuable things about music and not Reeves and Farlan know what it is. Reeves probably realized a lot. All English viewers (And all Australian, Indian and other audiences) know without being told that there is something worth having in the cricket broadcast as well And while Reeves understands that he cannot explain to Farlan - so the blues are broadcast, which shows that people can understand each other without having to understand anything else. It's a clever scene. <br /> <br /> One last thing. I found David Niven quite cold, without any special abilities, he would continue to receive in his career. Even so, I didn't think that this movie would grab my heart quickly after the action began as it did.
