Armageddon PPV <br /> <br /> Final PPV of 2006 <br /> <br /> Smackdown brand <br /> <br /> Results Ahead ******** <br /> < br> We are starting to perform with Inferno Kane v. MVP. This is an event that doesn't matter. Nothing about wrestling here. This is a picture Overall, this is not bad. There are spots near Kane that are too close to the fire. But in the end, Kane wins by hitting the MVP into the fire before returning. <br /> <br /> Good launcher. <br /> <br /> Teddy, try announcing a new match for the title. Tag team: London and Kendrick will defend: Regal and Taylor, The Hardyz and MNM in LADDER MATCH !!!! Let's move! <br /> <br /> Second match: The dangerous four-way ladder race This is all killing. Judging by three of the four teams here, you expect chaos. Amazing point All inclusive spots At one point Jeff went to find a poem in Motion and London moved and Jeff hit the stairs! Shortly after, Jeff set up on a rope with two ladders nearby because MNM was about to kill Jeff. Matt rescued and Jeff shot "See - see". Shoot for Joey Mercury! Mercury is injured. His eyes were quickly closed and arrested openly. Mercury was taken out of the race and Nitro remained there. He will fight alone for the position! Then Regal and Taylor grabbed London and Duplex to face him first! Jeff climbed the stairs and Nitro on the spot. The killer dropkicks through the stairs to nail Jeff! scary! In the end, London and Kendrick remain tag team names. <br /> <br /> This is crazy. I can't understand why WWE didn't announce this until now. Buyrate will increase significantly. I'm sure the replay value will be good, even though <br /> <br /> Mercury suffered from a broken nose and an eye wound. He was at the hospital and received a good child. <br /> <br / > There is nothing else here to be above that. <br /> <br /> Next: The Miz v. Boogeyman (Ugh) This is a competition that has nothing. Will Boogeyman ever fight? Mr Suck too After this insane crowd killed them, DUD. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit v. Chavo This is a strong competition. I enjoy it. Chavo hit the super killer button at one point! Benoit, press the German Flex EIGHT button too! Benoit wins with a good marksman. <br /> <br /> Helms v. Championship title, rubber-cruiserweight. This is a good competition. Unfortunately, silly fans don't care about this. Why? Hats and yang are capable and wrestled well. I agree with JBL. He is frantic about the JBL crowd. 100% correct. Learn to appreciate this or go out. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kennedy v. Undertaker-Last Ride competition is not too much here. This is a bullet festival with some exceptions. Kennedy at one point threw Taker from the top of the stage to the ground. Good point. Disappointing reaction. The end is Taker Kennedy, a grave on the grave and win the race. Not real. Kennedy wants this victory. They work hard both. Still, Kennedy still wants this victory. The Undertaker should be defeated. Creativity screwed again. <br /> <br /> The stupid diva thing is next. I like women. Not like this. At least Torrie isn't here. That is refreshing Judging from the crowd, Layla should have won. WWE wants Ashley. Imagine that your next bathroom is broken. <br /> <br /> Main activities: Cena & Batista v. Finlay & Booker T. This is nothing. The focus is Cena v. Finlay and Batista v. Booker. Batista and Booker don't work well together. Finlay tries to make Zina look good. Completed successfully Finlay hit Batista's knees with a chair and Batista didn't sell that shot and ended the match. incoherently. Not the core competence of the event. <br /> <br /> Overall, Armageddon should have scored less. That is a fairly worthwhile money. The other two are stable. <br /> <br /> The last word: PPV, good for matching the ladder, is the savior. Smackdown is not a bad performance. But not attractive enough. Smackdown must stop cena tagging. Smackdown stands with two legs of their own. This show proved that Smackdown can
