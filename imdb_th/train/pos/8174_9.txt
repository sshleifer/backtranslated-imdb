I love this movie. As a child, this was one of the first movies I saw that made me startled. Of course, it's not serious now. But come back today, it's great Dentists are one thing that many people are afraid of, so why not make a movie about a murderer dentist? It's wonderful. It's fun. Sometimes it's scary. But it was excellent And I always have love in horror movies and Corbin Bernsen plays Dr. Finestone perfectly. No one can do better than this. And for horror movies that have low budget effects and these things are quite good And I like the theme song. It fits well with the movie. Ken Foree (Dawn of Death) is one of these who plays a long-nosed policeman and works well. There is a good amount of blood and a terrible torture / death scene. Let's see!
