I am a kid .. crazy about Michael Jackson His music, dance .. He is the greatest and greatest ever. A few days ago a friend gave me a gift .. "Moonwalker" DVD .. I can't believe it! So I took my time and watched the movie again after many years and it made me go back in time. I almost cried, not because of Michael Jackson, but it was a good time I remembered back more than when I went to see his concerts, enjoying music and dancing This movie gave me a different perspective than before when I was a child. You can see the parody that Michael uses in his life. Thank you Michael Jackson for bringing me back to those great moments to your wonderful songs and dances. It's a shame that people forget you .. I'm not because you gave a wonderful moment to your music .. The best thing for you wherever you are ..
