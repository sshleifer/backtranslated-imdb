... and the series helps you forget everything. I am older than a three-year-old boy who is shown in the series. Born in 1958, I learned to drive a car during the first gas shortage and was awarded the position of first graduate school during the second gas shortage in the 1979 era 70 is a truly terrifying moment for children - a job that has to be quitted for thirty days. Scary music, bad clothes. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that this series doesn't appeal to anything and still makes. The Fun in the 70s, even for those of us who are old enough to know better. It manages to see 70 on the straight face - along with real time clothes - and also complements the show with the hope of youth and what makes high school and college years both the best time and the worst time. Then there are parents Two young couples in the show - Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti - have truly terrible parents with the best intentions. Eric's parents, Red and Kitty, are not June and certainly the ward. They represent what happened when the 1960s finally came to the suburbs in the 1970s. Ek's parents were two people waiting for the 1960s to appear throughout their lives to be legal. Eric Eric Fez's friends, Kelso and Jackie round out the group to represent nonsense, meaninglessness and snobbishness, respectively. Hyde is an extraordinary teenager for suburban shows. But in most cases, he represents people who have to play cards that they have been given, even though those cards are dealt with by parents who are mostly negligent and negligent. I recommend all eight seasons, even though the eighth season is a little delayed because there is no Eric.
