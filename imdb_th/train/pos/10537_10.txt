This movie is very funny. I can't stop smiling when I watch this story and watch it twice in 2 days! This film has a distinctive sense of humor and vision, both of which are excellent and unlike the gems in Cube and Cypher movies. I became a big fan of Vincenzo Natali since watching Cypher and everything. He made it very interesting. <br /> <br /> The favorite thing about this movie is the music and the characters "Lost" Dave and Andrew, played by David Hewlett and Andrew Miller (co-writer). That Like a couple There are also X-Box Dead Or Alive fights (you can also see Dave playing Halo at one point) and Andrew's amazing guitar guitar, among other things. <br /> <br /> All in the movie given. Great feeling About friendship You must see this!
