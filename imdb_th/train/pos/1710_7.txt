This film is an exact copy of the TV series about India's television channel, doordarshan, which aired at least 15 years ago. This series, known as "gubbarre", means balloons. Each episode is a new short story. The story is great and the manuscript is very sweet and "convinced" Abhay Doel works well, but he does not fit the role of "ordinary people" and "third class" (as he calls himself in the movie) in Reality Shayan Munshi with his hair, short haircut, and if no designer clothes will come to play the role of Abhays, but Shayan has no ability to pull out. <br /> <br /> I want to introduce Serie. This if it available. It is the same thing, except running around with mum, friends and introductory advice. The actors of the TV actors are better than these "stars". <br /> <br /> The only reason this movie is a failure is because the director tries to stretch the story half an hour (or 45 minutes). Is 2+ hours, so must be dragged Even the song that sings with the nose cannot compensate. <br /> <br /> This film is suitable for a lazy and really refreshing Sunday afternoon if you haven't watched the original TV series. The script and the end of the serial is much better. <br /> <br /> ##### The spoiler ahead. ############### Front spoiler ######## Spoiler # ##### Spoiler in advance ################################################## ################################################## ############# The ending of the original sequel is stronger than before, because the hero himself left the girl, even thinking that she was willing to marry him. He knew and told her that he didn't want to "repay" and never helped with that intention. The director or script writer can't catch the original ending in this movie. The original ending would have to buy tears for the girls in the eye and would have to nod in the agreement. The delivery is not correct. <br /> <br /> But personally, I feel that this is a pathetic copy. Should not give credit to the director / playwright The story is amazing and one of the famous novelists at the level of PRemchand munshi. I am not sure whether this is the story of premchand munshi or not, but many other short stories that he has shown are stories of writers. Excellent hindi
