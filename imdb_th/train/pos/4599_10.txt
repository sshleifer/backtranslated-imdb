This is my favorite Jackie Chan movie and in an interview, Jackie said that it was his favorite thing as well. It has incredible stunts and reduced jaw scenes, as well as some funny scenes. This movie is a favorite of Brandon Lee, who used to use pieces in Rapid Fire and was raised in Tango and Cash, which uses some opening scenes. <br /> <br /> Jackie plays the police in Hong Kong The story jumps into a wonderful chase through the cottage town and continues when Jackie moves down the hill and jumps on the moving bus to catch the evil. (Which is one of the greatest villains in The scene is very funny, as Jackie tries to balance his duties as a cop with his girl friend, played by Maggie Jung. His duty is to protect Ku's secretary who has enough information to disappoint him. But that caused many problems Jackie is his best here. The final fight scene at The Mall is the fight scene that I like by anyone - the moment it was the most fierce battle I've ever seen. Jackie made and climaxed in the form of a slide down the pole amidst the explosive lights. Overall, one of his greatest stunts he had played and left him with his hands. He was fortunate that he was not electrically shocked because of the people who showed his ability to use high voltage instead of low voltage. <br /> <br /> All of this is another classic movie of Chan At the end of this movie, you can tell that he doesn't do anything and doesn't show talent. Many of his stunts were injured in this film, which no one would guarantee them anymore - Jackie had to take responsibility for himself. There are no wires or stainless gimmicks - it's a real action in life. It is this type of action that makes him a phenomenon that he is and is a movie that will surprise people 100 years from now. If you haven't seen this movie and are a big fan of Jackie Chan or the action In general, make yourself and watch this movie It's truly exciting.
