Does anyone cry for tears of joy when they watch this movie? I love it! One of my top ten movies of all time it makes me feel good I watched a number of productions closed with every actor member over and over again !!! Bebe Benson (Michelle Johnston) is the first child of the movie. I have never seen plays But I was angry when I read the reviews that said the plays were better than movies. Both are like apples and oranges. The film making process will rarely deliver the finished product which is reliable to the original work. I believe that it is because of the fear of public alienation that many well-known works adapted from the screen will not change more than it is. This is a very good movie. It's very satisfying. That's all you need to know!
