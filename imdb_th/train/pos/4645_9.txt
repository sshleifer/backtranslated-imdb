This movie is very interesting. I have seen it twice and it seems that Glover smashed the nail on the head with what he claimed he wanted to achieve. One of me can relate to the evil that filmmakers express clearly with today's thoughtless organizations that are everywhere in our media center and what we are culture should not "think" about Control the media of the organization. The evil that Glover expresses through the "outrageous" elements in the film is both clear about the aggression of internal organs and The beauty of the strength of the poem. I'm glad I watched this movie, and it's even more clear that the glove depends on something interesting, with the second episode of the trilogy ending. It's okay! Everything is fine. See that people who leave this movie as "without thought" or "pretend" disappear from the boat. This is an intelligent movie. If you can watch with his live performances that he had previously performed with his book, it is very angry while The way you go into his thoughts is something. You will get experience!
