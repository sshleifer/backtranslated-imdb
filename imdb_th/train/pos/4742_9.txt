This movie has more action before having more credits in this type of Hollywood movie. This film, produced by Tsui Hark and Jet Li stars. This team brought you to Hong Kong's worthwhile film production, including once in a Chinese series. The action is fast and furious with an incredible line of work. I only saw two wires in the match. In addition to the action scenes, the story is still strong and not only But used as a filler To search for other action movies to compete, you must find a Hong Kong movie store in your area. They should check out and often do not disappoint.
