I will be honest with yall. I am a junior in high school. When this sitcom first aired on ABC, I didn't think I would like it at all, but with John Ritter in there, I felt that it had little potential there, including them. Is something else that i like The show is a great story, not very funny. No. 2 is awesome. John Ritter always brings his game when talking about jokes. This is a great show to watch and I'll tell you why it's a great show. My father, who never looked at the computer, he just watched movies, sports and laws & regulations. He sat down with 3 brothers and sisters, mom and myself and watched the program I thought of because John Ritteran. I honestly think that this program will continue to work if John Ritter God rests. I hope he will not die.
