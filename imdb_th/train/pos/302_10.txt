This film is suitable for all couples in the world. John Ritter has never been better and has the best lines in the movie! "Sam" hits near the house. Lovely to watch and enjoy playing. Ben Gassara is an excellent actor and easily fell in love. I'm sure I met Arthur on my trip somewhere. Great choice to pick up the evening! :-)
