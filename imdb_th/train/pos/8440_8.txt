This is the last episode that we deserve. At the end of last season, things were left in the mood. 'Life goes on' which is hardly something that makes this realistic scene deserve. Although not a happy item But this set is an item that makes you think that it is rare on television and this is an exception. 'Death is the reason by reasoning?' 'The morals of society reflect or society is molded by morals that have been chosen by the less powerful? 'What is death and does it really exist?' All these and other questions are laid out by the writers of this show every week and this is their final thesis Excellent performances, excellent writing, excellent camera work, wonderful editing, clean directions If you have seen the series and you missed this story when it first screened, you will receive a copy. If you never watch this series when it runs out, it will stand up on its own. But it may be a serious matter to try to track what every character is. For those of us who are the big viewers of the series in the past two seasons, this is a very satisfying thing to watch.
