This movie is important to the younger generation almost in the early years after the war. (And especially if you were born between the years 1946 and 1953 and would love to spend Saturday afternoons at the nearest movie theater). And the memories that have seen it remain with you Style, it is a short time and exciting moment during the time we grew up. <br /> <br /> It has a modern storyboard for modern audiences of that era. This set is a city with supermarkets and cinemas that will be packed for Friday midnight performances. It has hot bars and stubborn youths, but in 'Why can't they give us fun' rather than being a rebellious without chaos? All characters can identify us - teenagers, parents, old men, doctors, nurses, technicians, boys, puppies, even police - sympathize with us. We can relate to all of them. <br /> <br /> There are strange monsters that are terrifying. Was the first victim to hear the groaning 'it hurts ..... hurts' and we are confident and afraid Threats continue to grow throughout the story. There was an intense period of brightly colored effects, leading characters in the McQueen, and moments of comedy, both intended and unlisted. It has almost sad parts on top to make us feel more crying, crying, crying. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the summer, 9 years old and up, charged twice too 'I married a monster from the Outer Space' and was excited about the experience of these two features that I returned a few times before it left. Everyone I know saw it. Everyone I know loves it.
