Recently I met a little gem of this film in cable. It surprised me, even though I should expect from the team involved in this film. <br /> <br /> Henry Bromwell directs this movie by hand, and it shows. One is always wondering about the secret life of the killer that was hit. We don't have to go too far to know that they may be their own neighbors or social acquaintances or even friends. They are no different from us, at least on the surface. <br /> <br /> In this story, Grandpa is a nasty character and doesn't hesitate to get rid of anyone at the right price. He had no intention of teaching the rope to his son and even his nephew! <br /> <br /> Alex is a man who lives in turmoil. He knew what he had done in the past and soon realized the consequences of his actions. He must see someone to help him find peace with himself. To go to Dr. Parks, he tried to find forgiveness, even though he didn't find it there. On the other hand, there is a lot of reversal when Alex knows who should kill the next person. <br /> <br /> Alex, the image that was brilliant by William H. Macy's makes us fascinated not only that he is an excellent actor only But he still makes us believe that he is that man One of the best things in the movie is John Ritter. At the end, he believes equally as Dr. Park, the man who solved the mystery, <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland, while his grandfather is perfect He is a natural actor in everything he does. Neve Campbell, who was surprised by Sarah's important role She showed her ability and incredible range. Tracy Ulman is Martha's wife who is tortured and she doesn't do much. In addition, Barbara Ben, in a rare manner, is a grandmother from hell. David Dorfman enjoys the movie He shows his maturity more than a year. <br /> <br />
