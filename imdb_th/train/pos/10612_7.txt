It's wonderful. It's creepy. It's disgusting. But that's what makes it so fun It passed the most beautiful time, which is a ridiculous normal. This movie is good to make fun. Rent it for a good laugh. <br /> <br /> The film has three female announcers at a time before mobile phones. They go to a small town to organize a festival. But they can't stay overnight And when they met Ernest Keller He is creepy in the form of psychosis. And he offered to let them stay home But he didn't tell the truth to them who was there. <br /> <br /> Stephen's performance was amazing as Most movies are boring, although finding the truth of Ernest's family is interesting. <br /> <br /> Just seeing the actors in these scenes makes it worth looking at. Barbara Bach and Doug Bar cook beautiful eyes. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is a rare old gem and worth watching.
