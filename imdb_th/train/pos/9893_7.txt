Poor Marty (Simon Scuddamore) was burned terribly due to April's brutal talent in April. Delivered per decade and those involved (Including the scary Caroline Monroe fans for her in Maniac, Faceless & the Last Horror Film) in a psychedelic prank for a reunion in a high school that is about 10 years old. In the school (now closed) and go out to get revenge. <br /> <br /> This Chaulk is for the wrong happiness. I know it's a bad movie. It has all the features of one. But there is something about it that makes me feel forced to watch from time to time (Especially with beer on hand) I am happy to overlook the horrifying end. (Which I have to say I hate) I think I like it because it has a fun atmosphere about this and a lovely killing. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy (for men): Josephine Scandi and Donna Yeager both received the top <br /> <br /> Eye Candy (for women): Shoot Simon Scuddamore's naked chicken at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br >> My grade: B - <br /> <br /> Lionsgate Special DVD: Follow options, trivia; This movie trailer; And trailers for My Bloody Valentine (1981), Monster Squad, Dirty Dancing
