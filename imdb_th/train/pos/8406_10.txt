In 1979 I was a 12 year old boy. My parents had just received a box office which was quite new to our neighbors. As a 12-year-old boy, this is the first time I saw a Boobs on television. I will never forget the joy of that time. The van, the wiping of the worst van, the bed, the smoking of herbs The hottest chicks of the 70s, 'Love the clouds in my Chevy van song. It's a new story for me. A complete movie with all the memories you can expect. I own and enjoy it once a year. When I watched this movie, it made me want to get my skates with 4 wheels, not in a narrow line, go to the park and hunt down babies with feathered hair. Truly good memories of young teens!
