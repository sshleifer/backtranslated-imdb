Kristine Watts (Molie Weekly) Crumble Lost Her Lover; She couldn't overcome the love he had in the past. She hired a stranger. (Douglas Davis) and give her a list of errors with him, along with what to fix But when it is irreversible and sometimes the treatment of pain is a sad end A concise and sharp screenplay can develop a sad and gloomy love story with an unexpected point at the end in less than eight minutes. The soundtrack is beautiful. But the volume is slightly loud and related to the fact that English is not my native language at certain times. I need to say some words repeatedly that the narrator describes An unknown actor has a very beautiful and beautiful performance. I hope to have the opportunity to see her again on the screen. Lastly, not least, the release of director and writer Ryan Jafri may not be better. My rating is nine. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): Not available.
