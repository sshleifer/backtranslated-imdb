I'm a little young But I have to watch it There are some great songs that many people are talking about. But there seems to be no one to notice the "Angel" that is very rare, which is now mostly ignored. Wearing a white dress that is their trademark, they grind through "20th Century Fox" and clearly everyone trying to cram into the vision of the camera. Keyboardist Gregg Giuffria is still an outstanding band and never seems to cut it! Cherie Currie (former singer, Runaways) started a short but famous acting career here and was very memorable with Jodie Foster and the rest. (Her three-dimensional nude scene in "Parasite" and her UFO sightings in "The wavelength" makes us all watch her once) <br /> <br /> It's not a masterpiece. But it kept the time for everyone to see and wonder
