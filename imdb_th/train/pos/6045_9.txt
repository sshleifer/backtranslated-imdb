I'm in the movie too But I don't know if they actually brought this scene back from traveling to school (in 2005). And we were asked (All of us) ran in and shouted! Freebird! We are about 10 years old. Anyone who has ever watched a movie told me that the part was actually stored in the movie. I remember that I thought that this movie never came out because it was 2 and a half years before it was released. Your opinion seems good, so I guess it's a successful movie I might buy. But first I want to know if I'm in there or not! : D Thank you
