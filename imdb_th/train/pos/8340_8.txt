This is a romantic comedy that is fun, cheerful and light. You can't go wrong with the cuteness of Meg Ryan plus the genius of Albert Einstein. Usually I'm not a big fan of the complete story about the real person. Now, the dead and unable to protect themselves. But I think Einstein himself might laugh at this story. <br /> <br /> It's the 1950s ... Princeton New Jersey in the spring. The story revolves around a lovely young mathematician, Catherine (Mek Ryan), who is ready to marry a hand-jerk, a behavior researcher named James, just because he has the brain she is looking for in the future of her father However, it was her first love when her car stopped and she met an auto mechanic named Ed (Tim Robbins). While she didn't think Ed was smart enough, her uncle didn't have anyone outside. From Albert Einstein, the creator of the matching game, helped by his efforts with three mischievous followers, all theoretical physicists. Uncle Albert must make Ed look reasonably smart, so he gathers actors as physicists ... naturally with amusing results. Walter Matt is a normal hilarious comedian and draws the character of Ein. Stein out Effective With his three fellow professors, Kurt Nathan and Boris, laughing a lot The real Einstein has a real human side and this film takes another step. If you suppress all logic, you can imagine this foolish story. <br /> <br /> It may not be rocket science. (Although the main character) but it is a sweet and refreshing film One of the best romantic comedy types
