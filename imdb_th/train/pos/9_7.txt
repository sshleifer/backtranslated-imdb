The class romantic drama from director Martin Ritt is unbelievable as they came. But there was a time of happiness due to the special abilities of actor Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro (both). She was a widow who could not move forward. You might guess that others, the adaptation of Pat Barker's novel "Union Street" (better name!), Put it on the floor and the editing of this movie looks messy. Blue-necked fantasy No serious championships (Even the illiterate viewpoint is just a planning tool for a love story that follows) and there is no real fireworks, even if the characters don't have color and lead to interesting levels. The ending is pure fluff and the scoffer will find it difficult to swallow - even though these two characters deserve a happy ending and the image is not satisfactory in other ways *** from *** *
