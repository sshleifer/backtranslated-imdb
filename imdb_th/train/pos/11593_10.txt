I remember watching this movie when I was a child one day in the wonderful world of Disney. This movie has been in my memory for more than 30 years and I am looking for it. I must say that from all the children's movies I saw back now, it emerges more than all of them and after seeing it only once, I hope I can see it again. The story and images of this movie were burned down in my memory. To this day I have never seen it after the past days in the 70s. In fact, I never remembered the name until an internet search earlier today revealed to me. I love it and want my children to see. Anyone know where I can find it?
