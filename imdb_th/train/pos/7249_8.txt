It's hard for me to determine the number of "fair" stars for this movie. But I settled on the 8th due to the high production cost and what was in 1968, a new method in the war movie. Remember that I didn't see it since 1969, but it made a huge impression. <br /> <br /> Long Day's death must be one of the most powerful anti-war movies ever created. It was easily accomplished by just showing in a very realistic way the actions of a number of soldiers in northwestern Europe in 1944-45. Previously, there was no movie showing war in the military level. Flat with very brutal details No sermon, no sympathy, no cartoon, no relief, no complicated situation. <br /> <br /> Too bad that there is no subtlety. Partly because of their situation - trying to live - the characters were found to be familiar old ideas as "entertainment". Movies could not be done even if they didn't intend to. "Entertainment" clearly. It aims to slash you overhead with the misery and horror of World War II and modern warfare in general. This was twenty years before the Platoon and Thirty before saving Private Ryan, both of which were more "watchable" movies. Here, the characters are generally flat and nasty. The lack of a plot occurs. True and unrealistic images (Including what may be the first time that appears on the screen in theater history) makes this film difficult to pass. <br /> <br /> So 10 stars for production and 4-star realism for feelings Which you will receive when it ends as a bonus star for having a heart in the right place. Average: 8. <br /> <br /> Like Carl's "The Victors" movie With a very low valuation Together But more interesting and thought-provoking than why not both films use cable many times
