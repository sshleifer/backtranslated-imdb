I have read somewhere (In a review that appears to be quite true) This is an anime action movie, and I think they're in the right direction. I watched this movie for the first time when I was very young and I was dying to see it again, and not so long ago all the memories were finally overwhelmed. I don't think this thing has to be taken too seriously - it's just a fun story that is almost a TV movie in the 80s (set against the backdrop of a dark future, although this point isn't too stressful). What I admire the most about this movie is the conversation, not the general listening - no clich√©, no predictable lines - all. Good fun! Sometimes it may not be kind to this little movie, but I can still find admiration for this movie. It's not perfect But it provides entertainment and does not try to be anything else besides that Let the fool and the cartoon seller worry about technical problems - who cares? See for yourself and decide for yourself. The opinions of others are not important.
