Without Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, this could easily be a turkey. But they are excellent. Ustinov is the best of him and for Maggie's fans it's a good thing to see her on her first day.

For the British in their fifties (And I'm in parentheses) It's always fun to see and hear the sound of Swinging Sixties, and even though this film will spend most of the time in the Carnaby Street red bus office, Lulu's music and delicious drinks shoot on. The waitress's micro skirt is something that the British have never seen since in public. As an I.T engineer, I know that computer hacking techniques are ridiculous. But they didn't intend to do it seriously Or an excellent map of Italian, French and German
