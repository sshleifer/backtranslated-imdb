"Life stinks" is a joke of life and death, happiness and depression. Black and white are always in our lives. Mel Brooks performance is great, as always, and other actors also work well. This film has a taste of Capra. That's why it's good. <br /> <br /> There is an unforgettable joke, like when Brooks tries to raise money to dance on the streets and people passing by. Come Just ignoring him or when he meets a funny madman who believes that Paul Getty started to argue and slap together. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, you don't know what you missed. <br /> <br /> This movie tells us about the old and eternal struggle of the poor and the rich. <br /> <br /> The only difference between this film and its being. Actually, this film ended happily and <br /> <br /> Yes, life is still there.
