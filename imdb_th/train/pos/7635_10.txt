I've watched this movie many times and I have to tell you I'm happy every time. This is Belushi's best movie in my opinion. Belushi and Lovitz are cute and identifiable people with whom you can't help. This movie has some great actors, some are big and others have just begun. It is billed as a movie that feels good and that's what it is. This movie teaches you that life is not bad. Sometimes you have to look at things in a different perspective to appreciate what you already have. When you are finished, you will be more impressed with what you have and you will smile as well. You can't ask for anything more from the movie in my opinion, not to mention it's a hilarious movie and you won't lose interest. Movies with very low rating here, many people. <br /> <br /> Rate me: 10 I'm out !!!
