I've never heard of Robert Roy MacGregor before. "Rob Roy" came out, but this movie is worth watching. Liam Neeson plays the character in the story that he brought to the role that he brought to Oscar Schindler and Jessica Lang, as well as Mary, his wife, Archibald. Cunningham (Tim Roth) is a person who tends to make your skin crawl. <br /> <br /> All of this is as good as "Braveheart" (probably better). I laugh when I think Hollywood released two films, almost dating back to fighting. The British are very good. Starring John Hurt, Eric Stoltz, Brian Cox and Jason Flemyng.
