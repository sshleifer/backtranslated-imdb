This movie is great. The story is just ... Wow. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised with the performances of Gackt and Hyde after growing up in the American world of actors who couldn't sing and singers that couldn't be shown. br /> <br /> In this movie, Gackt, a young man, has found a vampire Kei (Hyde). Over time, they create an unlikely friendship. K is suffering because he is forced to leave another life, half the life of a vampire. <br /> <br /> It's a sad movie. The plot is very unique and in contrast to your typical vampire flick. The story is thick, with twists and turns and a lot of acceptance. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I can tell is that this movie is not happy - even if it ends in peace. I have an unpublished version. (I'm lucky that I understand it all, helping to protect some Cantonese), so I suggest finding something that has a description. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is great.
