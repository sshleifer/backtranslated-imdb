Anyone who has seen Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ movie and suffers from a blood-filled violence wants to watch this movie instead. Although not successful in the box office ratings or TV programs, Fox movies still find good motivation to perform this thing on their own.

What surprised me or shocked was the scene where Kayafas told Jesus about Pilate that "And do not forget that you are a Jew!" Although that may not be a racist speech, Colin Blakely tries to make Chris Sarandon look like a junk in the eyes of an important person in those days.
