Who voted for these scores? "Jacknife" is a great work done with actors at the top of the game, especially Ed Harris and Robert DeNiro, which are incomparable. (Please don't talk about Marlon Brando in the same way that people watch) "To confirm this point.) It is a 'normal' movie because it has no action / nudity / meaningless sex. This movie is about the complexity of the characters involved. Ed Harris makes you feel that all the time with him and his upset to the end makes him ache. As he ordered a young man in the bar to take off his army's clothes, it was a great observation that how fashion and movies took advantage of tragic situations and how disappointing people actually felt when seeing small soldiers. While we are on this topic, "Casino" 7.8 out of 10? One of the greatest movies of all time, from one of the greatest directors starring the greatest movie actor of all time, with the most horrifying horror movie thugs ever !! !!!
