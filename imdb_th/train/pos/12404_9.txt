I live in Rawlins when this movie is created and I'm lucky enough to work with it. Both in special ways and with Eddie Surkin in special effects It was fun to see the behind-the-scenes work from the living barbedwire scene to the electric chair through the office floor of Wardens. It was fun to meet all the actors from the Viggo to the Tiny. For this film and still being called "Disney Gate" by local people If anyone is interested and is in Rawlins, most of the movies are still in place and can be seen during the tour. It was fun to work with R. Harlin and hope that I will have the opportunity to do it again.
