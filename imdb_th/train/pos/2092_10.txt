I watched this movie with curiosity. I want to see that 1) Paul Muni can play Chinese and 2) Luise Rainer deserves her Oscar award. I go out of the movie that thinks yes! When seeing Muni in the only film that he was quite lonely, I was expecting the same type of performance here. I have been happily proven wrong. Although some people may criticize him as naive and simple in the Asian Hollywood concept. But I think he was right in the role of Keye Luke. If he gets a chance to play a role, may play him in the same way. <br /> <br /> I'm very impressed with the camera work and the use of the crowd scene Especially during the sacking of the palace, which O-Lan used to be a slave to the scary graphics and atmosphere of the shooting and drought team, making this epic different from others at the same time, a fascinating and sparkling place I watched this movie from beginning to end. I can't say the same thing as today's "epic".
