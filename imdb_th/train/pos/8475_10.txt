This movie is a children's fantasy movie based on Boggy Creek Legend, although I don't know why they called it Return to Boggy Creek as if it were a sequel. Arun Wells shows the stars as the mother of three children who lost their way in the bogs around Boggy Creek with 2 other men and the monster came to help them. Yes, it's very stupid and the story is repeated. But this type of movie is suitable for groups of 8-12 years that it targets It doesn't have a small ticket, G rating that is not dangerous, and at least you don't have to worry about leaving your children alone while they watch. Strictly for dresses aged 8-12 years old children are bored and think it's weak.
