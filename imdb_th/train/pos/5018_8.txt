If you are like me then you will love this wonderful teen age movie. I think it depends on the misfortune / book of love / high school in the US / yelling / calendar girl / crybaby / all wonderful movies in lat 50s & early 60s, and it has as many excellent soundtracks in the genre of movies. But still wonderful. It's funny all the time and has a very interesting love. A great young actor. I hope to have Is a great movie genre, more than a favorite movie of all time, back to the future when Marty mcfly gos back in 1955. In these great movies, it still exists in the 50s (early 60s). More than this but not much
