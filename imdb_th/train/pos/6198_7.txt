I was one of those people who crawled through the broken glass to see the movie Hal Hartley. From trust and iris to Henry Flo and (Hartley's favorite of me) The unique thing, Hal's unique film brand is a taste that has been acquired. The combination of mystery and espionage, equal to the small comedies, is probably his right hand. Comedy movies are not in your face and often run across the entire scene before achieving it. And the case of FAY GRIM, which is the sequel to Henry Fool. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey stars as Fay Grim, Henry Fool's abandoned wife and the mother of Henry's only son. She returned home one day to find a CIA agent in her kitchen. His name is Fulbright. (Jeff Goldblum of the Year) and he wants Henry's notebook There are a lot of Henry Fool notebooks, and everyone believes that there was nothing other than getting lost. Obviously there are many of them. The secret to researching weapons or the path to terrorists, who knows, but Henry Fulbright staff tells the angel that her husband is dead. But this is a surprising way to leave her house and search for Henry. (And it works ... but not the way they think) <br /> <br /> The fairies fight with many spies to collect Henry's notebook and find him. She also made a deal with the CIA for Simon, her brother. (James Urbaniak) left the prison (he helped Henry escape the country in the original film Henry Falcon). Many overlapping events occur continuously. To death, Henry was discovered in "Safety" by Jihad Fay frees her brother. But risking the life of her son without knowing it, and the CIA was rewarded for putting the Faye in danger. <br /> <br /> Hal Hartley likes to play with themes. And he did that to the extremes here Even the character's name (Grim, Fool, Fulbright, Fogg) has its own meaning, which is quite funny. The most excellent ol 'espionage film has been given in many screens as well, since the blaze in the stop motion sequence has never dominated our heroine even though she is in the fire. <br /> < br /> Now that I have been praised for this work, I will say that Fay Grim's Parker Posey exaggerated image is not the best part of this movie, which is embarrassing when considering that she is on the front. How long is the screenI know that this may be something that Mr. Hartley wants: women who are not decorated with hand gestures to Italian extremists. But it's still painful to watch all the time. <br /> <br /> Even so, the fans might swallow Faye Grim and ask for more. Although this isn't my favorite movie, Hal Hartley, but I know it's ready.
