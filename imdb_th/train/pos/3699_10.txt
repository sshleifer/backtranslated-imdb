"Who loves the sun" works through a thorny story with enough flair and elegance to make the story not only attractive but often hilarious. For a long time, I found an impressive and fun movie. <br /> <br /> This beautiful film draws the eye with beautiful scenery and peaceful landscapes. Peaceful images are surprisingly different from the tensions between human characters that are flawed and still pleasing. Because the five best performers of the big players are amazingly interesting and lively. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Who Loves The Sun". It's a really funny movie that looks very painful. That we can inflict damage and difficult forgiveness procedures But amazing
