And the plot of the unexpected, too. For this era, there was an epidemic in New Orleans and Richard Widmark had only one person who could stop it! Elia Kazan's trademark: Waterfront, the working group, the crowd, the refugees, the blue collar people, the violence on the backstreet are all shown here. <br /> <br /> Jack Palance is quite effective. Like a cold-hearted gangster with a large score, Zero Mostel, while Dom Delouise is quite wrong But of course it's his go-fer. I'm happy with Barbara Belgate as a cold wife - I think she and Widmark are reliable couples. <br /> <br /> Himself Always remind me to remember Sinatra in front of That means compliment if anything. I have never heard of this before, and yes, you have to watch Widmark's performance. I also enjoy Paul Douglas - he seems to be playing this role many times. They create teams that are not effective, but <br /> <br /> That epidemic is McGuffin - and you have to know that it doesn't do what it wants. Get in real life - quite a small size, at least not - but I found it carried out a plot along the way. <br /> <br /> Check this well. *** outta ****
