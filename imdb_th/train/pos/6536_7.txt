Let's face it; Nancy Drew has never been a great literature. It is in the same category as the nanny club, the magic tree house, Goosebumps, ABC Mysteries. In fact, it is one of the original recipe stories Nancy is perfect, cute, prudent. "Good". There is no internal conflict! And never changed Ned is quite the same. This movie is a real style and I have to say that I like it. It will never be a great movie. But it has the same nostalgia that the book holds It is just the right suspicion for my children (8 and 10). Almost no offensive language. I prefer more conservative dress. <br /> <br /> Corky is annoying. He is a little offsite in a high school university. I never understood why he was there from the beginning.
