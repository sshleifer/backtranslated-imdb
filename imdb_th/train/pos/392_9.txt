The Legend of Zu, as I see, is a very interesting story. I think many people who don't like it don't see the basic myth behind the movie. They expect something similar to Star Wars and not like that. I believe Joseph Campbell will like this movie. There are many metaphors and hidden meanings that the average viewer may overlook. We all have a mountain of swords within us. We all have to go into their own blood cave sometimes in our lives. We all face our own insomnia one day. Obtaining some narrative causes a bit of confusion and some actions sometimes cause minor accusations. But I think other points of this movie are easy to make. I'll see it again. <br /> <br /> I don't know if there is any difference between The Legend of Zu (which I saw in Mandarin with English subtitles) and Zu Warriors (version of the USA ) Probably because of the American people The audience who really deviates from this movie
