I am a big fan of M Lillard. That makes me watch this movie. Actually, I wonder if he is not in this movie, I will enjoy it a lot or even watch it But when I watch it, I know that this story is quite good. Bad ending, I have to say But I saw that it was coming It's a low budget movie and some actors aren't really good. But all that I rate this movie 7/10 <br /> <br /> The suspicion that Lillard really depends on Interested in this movie <br /> <br /> It's a good rental! <br /> <br /> 7/10
