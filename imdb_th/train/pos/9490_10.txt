The first time I saw this film was in eighty. But check now this thriller is still true Some newer films focus on similar topics. <br /> <br /> President - obviously JF Kennedy was shot in a car open in public. The results of the major investigation found that the body of "Lee Harvey Oswald" is guilty, but a member of the jury confirms further investigation. He revealed surprising evidence ... <br /> <br /> Unlike JFK's Oliver Stone - a movie with the same plot - this story doesn't play with emotions. But focusing on exciting explanations about conspiracy Draw a new picture of the assassination Even the true psychological experiments were used for the explanation of the scene. Compared to JFK, this movie is more intelligent and exciting. Some of the plot can be found in many new movies. I have Deja Vu sometimes sitting in the cinema. <br /> <br /> "I ... comme Icare" is a "must see" It's unique and wonderful, and Ennio Morricone's music is great. This movie deserves a very good rating if it is a Hollywood movie. It will definitely be famous. <br /> <br />
