When you read the conclusion of this film, you might think that this is a strange movie and in some aspects for the main character of the film, Gerard Reeve. (Jeremy Krabe) is possessed by images and hallucinations. Gerard's vision is a subtle hint about what will happen to him while the story continues and is so fun that viewers will try and use the symbols used in the movie. Despite the use of symbols and implications of the ending of this film But this movie still has a very high level of excitement and not even one minute boring Most of them are the result of the great performances of Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk (Christine) and Paul Verhoeven's great direction. His directing style can be seen clearly and anyone can speak from the corner. Unlike 'De Vierde Man' is a typical Verhoeven movie. Not only does it seem normal for people familiar with his American movies because of the nudity and violent graphic scenes. But it seems to be normal for people who are familiar with his Dutch movies because of the same things and their abilities. When people watch the movie of American Verhoevens, the short-sighted person may say that he has no ability to tell. Good story and focus on blood and sex only That is what some people think of as I think he is a very talented director who tries to convey a more profound message to each movie. Although not a good movie, Hollow Man (his last American film) is an example that Verhoeven can do more than science fiction movies, splash stories and companies should trust him more and offer more movies for him. He wants that Just watching his Dutch movie They not only show that he needs a certain amount of freedom. But they also showed that he had a remarkable ability. 'De Vierde Man' brought him near Hollywood and was one of his best. <br /> <br /> 8 From 10
