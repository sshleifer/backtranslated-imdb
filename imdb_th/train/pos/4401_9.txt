Ride With The Devil, directed by Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger), is another gem in the best director. For those unfamiliar with the history of the Kansas-Missouri border war during the American Civil War Watch this movie and you will visit the sad Americana in addition to the great action scenes. This is the story of love and dedication between men and women. In particular, it is the star Toby Maguire, Skeet Ulrich Jeffrey Wright and as a young woman jewel I have never heard or seen her before. Seeing her more) Performances are excellent work, excellent production, novel) <br /> <br /> This is a 128-minute movie, but worth watching. <br /> <br /> Giving My rating is **** <br /> <br /> Send in order <br /> <br /> Ja y Harris <br /> <br />
