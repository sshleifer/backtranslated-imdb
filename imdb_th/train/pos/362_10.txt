In 1985 (my birth year), Steven Spielberg directed a strong and memorable story of a young African-American woman, Celia. The story began in 1909 when Sealy was only 14 years old. She gave birth to two children for her father. Sealy has a sister, Nettie, which she can't separate. The widower laid his eyes on Nettie, but their father gave him Celia. It was the beginning of an era of terrible harassment and continuous control. Women are inferior to men, and especially their African-American women. Their rights are less than Celie's story center, a true survival story. <br /> <br /> "The Color Purple" is a movie. The masterpiece and low valuation of Spielberg. He should create a drama that "The Color Purple" and "Schindler's List" is a good idea. <br /> <br /> The actor is amazing. Whoopi Goldberg is well known as Comedian who is afraid of legsBut the role that was introduced while Celie was an amazing word that she was able to draw a heavy drama. Danny Glover was a nasty person like "Mister". I never saw him in such an evil role. Oprah Winfrey's talk show icon is great as a strong and strong Sofia. <br /> <br /> Warning! Prepare to have a certain amount of tissue with you when watching this movie. You can connect with the story of a strong brotherhood. Especially if you have a close relationship with the brothers and sisters, just like I have with my sister. <br /> <br /> Applaud you Spielberg very much!
