Surprisingly good movie! It's a few good jokes throughout the movie. The only thing that is negative is some of the most extreme scenes to show how the two main characters are stupid. We understand that silly blondes go with it! <br /> <br /> The plot that just dodged is called "Repetition" and Tao is usually positive, although the movie for some strange reason doesn't play with that card, even in the line The plot introduces two black-haired women who act as resistance against two blondes. <br /> <br /> So overall, a good movie to watch. I almost give it 8/10 but not crazy
