This movie is fun to watch. If you like "Dave" and Kevin Klein, you will be kicked out of this. Think "Dave" disappeared in South America when Dreyfus played Jack. Ah, the actor during the event, which was selected by the police chief of the police police department of Parador to replace Al Fong Sims after him. Heart attack and death Noah quarreled, helping in his role by the former dictator, as they tried to interrupt Raul Julia's plans. Jonathan Winter also appeared as an American émigré, which became a CIA. Also starring Polly Holiday and Fernando Ray. <br /> <br /> There are a few ridiculous moments, such as the old dictator's body being kept for one year and the scene. Finally at Sonia Braga, who lamented the blood filled with blood After a while, I saw all white, while there was a stain on her. But overall, it's a great play.
