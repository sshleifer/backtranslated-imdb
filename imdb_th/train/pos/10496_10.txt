Excellent actor, actor who has been nominated for an Oscar, breathtaking views, strong stories and more laughter than you can put in my new handbag. (And it's quite big) this movie is excellent It was beautifully built in a more violent scene and the funny moment was. I never heard a movie audience laughing and the tears flowed down my cheeks in the scene. 'The drunken woman in the tea shop' performed well for the British film industry and with Craig Ferguson with a wonderful mixture, making sure that this is one of my favorite movies of the year.
