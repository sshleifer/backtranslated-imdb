This film has saved my heart from the beginning when I first heard Quincy Jones or saw the magical color of purple flowers in the grasslands. This is a movie that cries and dies for ...! All the actors give the best performance in the movies I've seen in the past year, and Spielberg has really defeated himself! Whoppi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey (Oh God!), Danny Glover and others all give us the best and you can feel - almost touched! Goldberg IS Celie She gives insecurity and a lowly sense to the characters and we grow with you. We grow strong with her throughout the movie and we win her. Margaret Avery is great, like Shug Avery, though she is in her arrogance and shows us that "sinners" really "have souls too". Sympathetic and charming, making the work that makes people hate him and the beautiful songs of (I'll tell you) Quincy Jones adds beauty to this great movie! Photography, music, directors and music make this beautiful and soul-filled movie a life experience. You don't want to miss it! "Sista '... remember my name ..."
