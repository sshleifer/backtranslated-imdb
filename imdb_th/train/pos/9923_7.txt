I read a variety of reviews and many people seriously criticized the film. I became interested in this project because it was directed by Tony Scott and I was very interested in his work after Man On Fire had a huge impact on me. Before I started the review, I said this before ... It was wonderful to see that this movie can be told in a boring and common way. But the writer and Scott chose a different way. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: <br /> <br /> Easy to say, not boring. Most Hollywood movies offer plans. 'Try and be true' that they know will connect with people often, ensuring that the audience accepts this film and creates higher profit opportunities. This story is another interesting story that I have seen now. Just for reference, I just watched 'The Weather Man' and 'Lord of War' and while I would say that these movies are great and I enjoy them both very much, the plans in these movies are boring. You expect to be informed. They don't use any opportunities and they can guess a lot after you watch many American movies. The plot of Domino is both interesting and told in a way that makes you think. "Oh, man, they're drunk." And I felt that I lacked a lot of movies recently. It has a lot of depth in my thoughts and gives you lots of questions while watching. Overall, this is what makes me interested in movies. <br /> <br /> Character: <br /> <br /> I felt that the character was right. Knightley performed a great role in drawing. Beautiful woman who is what But inside and want to be seen as what she is Obviously, she wanted to prove herself and she did whatever she could to succeed. <br /> <br /> Choco also believes that using his Spanish language in situations that are not appropriate, his reaction continues. The lack of love of domino Including the problem of his jealousy in the team ... they are all so loud for me, which makes me feel that his character is more true <br /> <br /> Rourke's character is interesting The most for me, but it is still loud for me He seems to be a normal person trying to make it true. I hope that's what filmmakers try to do with him because that's what I got from it. He did a great job of showing Ed as the average Joe made a mistake. But still trying. <br /> <br /> Claremont / Ladies: I believe that they gave me a very important heart. 'With the story They are not just people who go out to buy money for Bentley. These people are real people who have real problems and they want others to achieve that goal. You can sympathize with them because the illness of this child is a problem that has no other solution. These characters should show less fortunate people who get this mess because they need help. <br /> <br /> The bad guys: They make the story look scary in the way the crowd can do. And i like that part a lot They also add stories with a small complexity that makes the story even more interesting. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken / 90210 People: <br /> <br /> They give relief to cartoons in violent movies. A lot of Walken's awkward statements to the relentless reference to the existing 90210. Their participation in the movie makes it even more fun. <br /> <br /> Film shooting .... Yes .... this movie is The film seems to lose a lot of potential fans. But in my opinion, I think it's a genius. Using a camera to translate the emotions of the current situation is very effective in my opinion. I think it's the right way. But can use the update at any time like anything else I both applauded and congratulated Scott, the editor, the film maker and the photography director for the real opportunity in this film. Not only did they go far and superior with their presentations They go further than that. The use of both bright and dark colors makes the 'look' of the movie with a scary and dirty look that shows the lives of mob hunters, bounty hunters and underprivileged people in the manner shown. Saw that their lives were wrong Not like peaches or 'clean' like other people. If you notice that when there is little stress or conflict, there is very little camera trick if there is. This shows that Scott and his team try to do something with this look and not only for success. I know that most people who watch this movie do not expect it, and it has caused many of them to be closed in this movie. But I think it's great that Scott uses this method. The Hollywood movie has grown and is predictable. Most are shot in the same manner with twists and turns as well. And I'm glad that Scott is trying to do different things. <br /> <br /> Receiving this movie isn't for everyone. But said it was trash I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and glad that I spent money on it. I would like to recommend this to everyone. But I'm sure there will be only a few chords I have to agree with the previous poster when he said that many people who refused to watch outside the 'sphere of MTV' would not appreciate this movie. But I think many people will We should all try to enjoy the truth that Scott and colleagues. Take the opportunity and try to deliver something different and unique. And with that thought, I think he was very successful
