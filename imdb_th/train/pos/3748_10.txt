I've watched it many times and I plan to buy full features. I love Jason Steele's comedy. It's all different and unique and very fun. I love indie movies and this is very good. The story is strange, but very funny. This short film about paddles discuss Edward's name. The sequence of events is quite confusing, making this movie very interesting. At first, you saw Edward fighting with a spoon. But then the focus changed earlier in his life. This is a stupid movie. But of course it is still good I suggest you watch this movie at www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com It's very funny. Humor may not match everyone's taste, but continue to watch. Your time will be only 16 minutes and free.
