If you love the Long Way Round, you'll enjoy it almost as much. It is educational, funny, interesting and stressful. Charlie shared the screen with two interesting teammates, two tired mechanics, two excellent photographers and too many Russians. Ewan appeared a few. But Charlie really pulled it out He is funny, engaging and still having stress and doubt. Great things! <br /> <br /> The series closes in 7 episodes as well as LWR. The preparation is close to the competition. Although they cover the details of the competition very well But there may be additional explanations about trucks and cars, which are a little mentioned It's a motorcycle movie and everyone who has two wheels will love this thing. <br /> <br /> The series has incredible photography, including interviews from people. But this song is not as good as Stereophonics <br /> <br /> If you live in the US gods Look on your computer like I do. Oh and prepare to buy another motorcycle.
