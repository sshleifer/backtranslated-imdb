In all truth, this is not "movie" as much as the last episode that expands. By this I mean if you don't follow the TV series (Homicide: Life on the Road), I wonder if you will have a difficult time following the movie created for the TV. This must be said "Homicide: The Movie "is also a great watch. I think it talks a lot about the production of television programs that every single actor member will return many years after the lack of work to portray their characters again and lead to incredible shows. The film presents the feeling of "family" that is not only among the characters. But among actors as well It was a bit bitter when I realized that this would be the last time that we would meet them all again under the name of HOMICIDE. Candidates for the election of Giardello seem to be specially planned and I feel that his photography may be handled within the parameters of his normal position as Leiutenant. In addition, Det the most distorted plot of Bayliss, which was left at the end of the series, was finally resolved. But for me one never felt that it needed to be; I enjoy being left with mystery. (Let us remember that the first case of the first episode has not been resolved for all actions!) As a big fan of the TV series, I can love this movie and the fact that it happened after At H: LOTS has been canceled But I would not recommend to anyone who does not experience this series. Now if they just let it onto a DVD ...
