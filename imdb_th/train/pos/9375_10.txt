Before Nicholas Cage was an actor, he was a great actor. The less-known movie that Cage gave him one of his best performances. "Red Rock West" is an inexpensive movie that is almost unknown. But it's my favorite movie of all time I discovered that it was walking down the aisle in the video store and wanted to see the Cage and Hopper. Go get this one and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
