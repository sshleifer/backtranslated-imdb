I gathered at least a few people to watch on September 2 on TCM. If you know that Hedy must change her name to avoid getting involved with this movie when she comes to the United States, it's a big scandal and I gathered that the first release in the United States was shuffled by censorship, which it did not understand in practice. I watched because I just saw the documentary "Bitch" actress. The American Film Review Board, established in the early 30s, made me look as if they had escaped more than Hedy's most "sensational" appointment in "Ecstasy". In fact, Hedy looked pure, positive. According to today's standards, and it is good to see her beauty early It is a beautiful and relaxing movie. I love what it is: simple love I watched it after recording in the early days of A.M. I couldn't sleep. I like to see the first version released in the United States for the sake of comparison.
