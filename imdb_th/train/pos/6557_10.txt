I am a college teacher, 53 years old. I go with my wife and 12 year old daughter. We all enjoy movies. This film is original, witty, fast and totally charming. The plot is simple enough to track 10 years, but twisted enough to make adults interested. I think Emma Roberts works great and the remaining actors are ok My only criticism is that the Los Angeles outfit isn't as interesting as it should be. They work well. But nothing is outstanding On the other hand, makeup, costumes, lighting, filming, editing and supervision are great. Overall, I think it's a truly enjoyable experience. I'm disappointed at the professional critics. (Almost every male adult) attacked the film violently. Obviously they have something with a movie that shows a strong, intelligent and independent girl. Their writings reveal the nature of women about sex rather than about this wonderful family movie. I highly recommend all children and all parents
