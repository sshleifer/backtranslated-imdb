Barbara Stanwick gave Douglas Sek's first production soap, which was directed by Universal, just by kicking in. Not as memorable as Sirk's later melodies. It is easy to see by "All I Desire" that Sirk will head to the art in the next few years. Stanwyck is an actress who comes back to her family in a small town. In the United States after having to leave them ten years ago Her family and community have mixed emotions in dealing with her shocking return. Some movies are amazing and Stanwick is a man who is tough like nails and gives energy to this movie. Overall, it is a fairly good performance.
