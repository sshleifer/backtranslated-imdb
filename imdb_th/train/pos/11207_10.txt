This film was nominated for an Oscar and was easy to see why, even 45 years later, it was an impressive event Why does it not print out a mystery that only Disney can explain? Take advantage of live video and animation in tandem. This used to be a part of "Disney Vault" every few months or more. But I have not seen it before * sigh * most recommended
