I think that dealing with this movie is really a time of about 2 minutes. Really funny moments and it makes it a very good example and many people come with expectations from the sample and this time the movie. Not at the trailer, it's a bit slower and slowly moving for an exciting place, and I think I see from the comments that people who have a love / hate relationship <br /> <br /> However, if you look at In this movie, for what it is and not what it might be considered the talent of the actors, I think it's still quite good. Julia's style is a clear star. She is a playful and carefree person who is in the midst of others' harmony. Of course, other actors, who are the colleagues of the Testo Toro, full of Lee, his adoptive mother, Jim, his best friend, Jim and his bride, all work great in Adaptation to the attitude Stand out from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Lee doesn't live with his expenses. I don't think. But you can see that the more they are difficult to live Perhaps it is the source of disappointment. <br /> <br /> The movie itself, despite its slowness and jokes, does not come out as funny as the writer intended. Intelligent movie The theme of consistency and "Using safe routes" seems to be aligned wisely in many layers. For example, there is a motivation for all of the ways in which he will imagine the situation. But will not act on them until the last scene or the way in which he listens on the highway radio program. Talk about how everyone does or does everything Selma Blair and The character of Julia Style speaks and is reflected by one person's theme, which is a safe option and one risky choice. <br /> <br /> Another good thing about The movie is, it's a joke. Which Jason Lee had to lie in front of him through the movie and the lucky person (for example: the pharmacy became a good chef) and his intelligence was lost with it. <br /> <br /> Although it's not as funny as I expected. But there was a slight talent But overall it is still a good movie
