Before not watching movies (And can't stand Matt Damon) I was reluctant to watch The Bourne Ultimatum when we were asked to look at AS Film Studies. <br /> <br /> However, I was absolutely surprised that even movies with The movie in this movie can be fun. <br /> <br /> A fast-paced battle scene, a chase of a crazy motorcycle and a big explosion is what makes you have to leave the seat in TBU. IA and Bourne makes you feel good /> <br /> However, there are always many things <br cheese grated on my /> <br /> I really really <br that film. It's just a set of Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA. This sequence is trite and boring in the end. Although Damon will entertain us and seems to be one step ahead of the CIA But I was slightly annoyed with Bond's survival. He hit the car and went out as if he had knocked it or something! <br /> <br /> And secondly (Inevitably) - SHAKY camera is clearly shaky and makes me and everyone who goes to see it in my class. (Even the instructor) Symptoms of seasickness We have been told by the instructor that if we used to use in the movies we did in class, it would be wrong automatically and we would be told to use a tripod Fair enough if Greengrass wants it to look like we are there. Watch Damon and Stiles hold the conversation, but of course we won't shake our heads violently! <br /> <br /> But in TBU, all are fun and worth watching movies, but I don't think it's the best movie of the year, even though it's an entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> 8 / 10
