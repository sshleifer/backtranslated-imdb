If someone told me that the director of a series of unfortunate events, Lemony Snicket, City of Angels and Caspers are going to make an indie movie with a limited budget and that is really good. Play But that's what director Brad Cybersling did. And it's really good. <br /> <br /> "10 items or less" are similar to movies like "Before Sunrise", "Lost in Translation," or more. "Once" it involves the opportunity to find. Of two people who, if accidentally not wearing them, may never cross the path or if they do, they will not say one word to each other Like those movies, "10 or less" focuses on the relationships that are created and how the characters come to understand each other and create each other's strengths and weaknesses. <br /> <br /> The story is related to Morgan Freeman An unnamed actor who researched his role as a grocery store for the upcoming independent film and because things that are beyond his control make him spend the day with women on 10 shows or channels. Lesser way She is married and hopes to get a new job as secretary. At first, Freeman's character wanted to just lift home. However, after spending time with her, he wants to know her and may give advice to her. <br /> <br /> Brad Cybersling created almost all characters through the exchange between Freeman and Vega. The story is just a setup for these two characters to interact with each other in the 80-minute period of most of the movies. Freeman enjoyed his character as he appeared as an outsider in the lower world at Scarlett. Vega's character lived. Vega, at the same time, grows beyond the stubborn checkout staff who are not satisfied with the situation in her life that is going forward. <br /> <br /> There are some things that stand out in this movie. First of all, Siberling may Take notes from independent theaters to make sure that the relationship is sincere and not fall into the pitfalls of Hollywood. It is a mutual friendship that has developed incredibly throughout the story. It can be used even if the situation seems unbelievable. <br /> <br /> I'm also impressed with the performance. While Freeman's appearance made the film reliable from the journey, he showed the charm and fun that had never been seen by him. At the same time, Paz Vega is preparing for future US film development. I love her in Spanglish and she is as good as Scarlet that is merciless. At the end of the movie, she succeeded in conveying the growth of her character. I am looking forward to seeing you in many movies. <br /> <br /> Combining the 10 best-broken functions as the characters that were screened and directed by Brad Siberling, he didn't write a lot. And most of his films are Hollywood movies There are also artists who work here for sure and are eager to see that he will use this road again.
