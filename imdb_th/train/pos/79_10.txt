I like The Real Mc Coys (1957-1963). It's terrible that Lydia Reed decided to be forgotten and didn't appear. She's great in acting. Of course, Walter Brennan is great, just like Tony Martinez. I like it a lot when he calls Amos Se√±or Grampa.I bought a Season I on DVD and I can't wait to buy the season 2-6. If there are more TV programs, everything will be better. This show appeared briefly in the summer of 1999, but disappeared. May God bless the members who had been left and please. Llydia Reed made himself known to the public again. You are loved and respected. Real Mc Coys will live forever.
