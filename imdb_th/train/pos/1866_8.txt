A wonderful story based on the true story about young black men and all the hardships on the road. Since this is Denzel Washington's first film that he will direct, I have to admit that I am a curious person. But who wouldn't be ..? But then again, he is a great actor with a long experience and the results are excellent. Stories are told in a great way, giving you problems during childhood and young age to see yourself in those situations. So it hits you hard, so you know that it's not the only one who passed hell. In every matter that touches about the young man trying to make it in this world (This story is based on the life of Antwone Fisher, born on August 3, 1959, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, who is also a film writer). Highly recommended. 8/10
