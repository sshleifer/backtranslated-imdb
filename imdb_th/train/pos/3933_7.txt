The problem with acting in real life is that the performance is good. But still not working if the audience doesn't believe that the actor will show the person That was the main problem of "Young Mr. Lincoln:" Henry Fonda gave a great performance. But I find it hard to believe that Abraham Lincoln speaks softly as Fonda shows him. <br /> <br /> This is the main drama in the courtroom, along with Abraham Licoln, the front man. No matter whether this is true or not, I don't know. But if it's not so, why tell by using Lincoln as the main character? Never mind though. In this film, Lincoln defended two young men accused of murder. <br /> <br /> There is not much for this movie and the result seems to be empty. I need more stories and character development. This movie is 100 minutes long, but it doesn't feel like it has a small scene that shows Lincoln and the relationship that blossomed with Mary Todd. But they look superficial. <br /> <br /> The performance is very good, but as I said that Fonda's performance is a Lincoln character, I just don't believe that the real Lincoln is soft. In fact, he had a big voice when he wanted to, for example, when he persuaded a group of drunken lynchings to allow the accused to stand trial But Fonda acted as a gentle Lincoln. Other performances were strong, especially Alice Brady as Abigail Clay, the mother of the accused. She is a good woman that we can feel. Simple and without education But very sweet We can see why Lincoln wants to help you. <br /> <br /> John Ford thinks this movie is epic and at the time of its debut it may be But even then there is not enough material to offer. <br /> <br /> It's a good watch. But not classic
