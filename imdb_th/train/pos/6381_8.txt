"Atlantis" is a new and correct step for Disney properties. Is a good alternative to making movies by mysterious legends such as "Atlantis". I didn't expect anything about this movie. But after watching, I do not understand why this movie has received very bad reviews. Even in my country, critics are not positive. <br /> <br /> "Atlantis" is not a perfect movie. But it is also one of Disney's greatest films, although I wonder if this film will gain fame "Disney Classic" That is another case. It is a joke to think that this sci-fi movie is directed by the same director as "Beauty and the Beast" and "Hunchback" (so Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale are trying to escape from the fame of their fame. Kidding) <br /> <br /> Well, ridiculous enough. "Atlantis" is a movie to watch out and have fun. Although this film is an action feature that has been rated PG, but is also suitable for children in my opinion. (Parents who have the opposite meaning do not kill me for writing this thing.) <br /> <br /> The story is a little predictable. But it does not destroy the movie Animation inspired by comic books, suitable for this movie and the departure scenes from the usual Disney style. It has a dark color and the details of the Deep Canvas sequence are quite impressive. Sometimes this movie is funny even though I'm laughing more than laughing in the movie (spoiler). The characters in this movie are also very popular too. Unfortunately, there is not enough time to get to know everyone, so some characters are left behind (spoiler) <br /> <br /> James's score Newton Howard is great. It is courageous and exotic (spoiler). The most impressive thing about this film is how they make the language of nature sound, ethnic and genuine. It's really wonderful (beyond SPOILERS). <br /> <br /> The script is tight and well written. But there are still some questions that have not been answered in this matter. But fortunately there are not many of them. <br /> <br /> You like not listening to the reviewers and watching "Atlantis" because it's waiting for you ...
