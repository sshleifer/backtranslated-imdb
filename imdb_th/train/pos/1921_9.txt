ABC has done more things for this program by allowing veterans James Garner and David Spade to participate in the show. At first, the show was able to be viewed and predicted, even with John Ritter and Katey Sagal. John's loss caused the world to be shocked. The lesson after John's death in real life made me go home. I lost my father at the age of 17 and able to sympathize and understand their pain and pain. ABC should be proud to maintain this performance and even keep this as John's last wish. This show is due and developed due to an impossible situation. They should be rewarded with Emmys.
