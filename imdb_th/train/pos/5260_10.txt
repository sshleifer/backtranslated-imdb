Yes, it may be stupid and may not look as funny as a high budget comedy. But this movie is really hilarious if you really watch it. Tim Meadows impressed me on a Saturday night live performance. Whenever he would do this character on the show, I would laugh. So after I saw this thing being played in Comedy Central one night, I decided to try it. Overall, I was very impressed with this movie because it didn't mean to win an Oscar or be a comedian of the year. But it entertained fans Saturday Night Live, who loved the Ladies Man character.
