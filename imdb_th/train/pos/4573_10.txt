Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best actors of our time and one of my favorites. It was surprising that he threw himself in each of the characters he played, making them real. <br /> <br /> I remember many years ago. We had a party in our house - friends. Find us around the table, eat, drink, wine, talk, laugh - have a good time. TV is open - there are movies that we are not very interested in. Suddenly all of us stopped talking and laughing. Glasses do not make loud noises. Ku Kae doesn't move. The food starts to cool down on the plate. We can't take our eyes off the screen in which a deformed young man with his body is opposed to him, and has control over his left foot, picking up the chalk fragments with his feet, and what seems like eternity. Just One word on the floor When he finished writing one word, we all knew that we didn't see only one victory. But the triumph of the human and the victorious spirit of the movie that can record such moments in movies and The victory of the actor who did not act <br /> <br /> Jim Sheridan, "My Left Foot" is a sensational and immoral biographical drama about Christy Brown, who was born with a cerebral palsy, Dublin Ghetto; Who became an artist and writer and found that the love of his life <br /> <br /> I like Day Lewis's performance every time (I have mixed feelings with his performance in GONY) but I believe That his biggest role is Christy Brown in "My Left Foot"
