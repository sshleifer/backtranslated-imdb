The movie begins with many children in the reform school and focuses on a boy named 'Gabe' who seems to be working hard for his parole. Gabe and his sister move to a new neighborhood to start a new life and in Soon Gabe met with the Dead End Kids. The children in this movie were a little punks, but they were less social. In the previous and deeper movies, they were the meaningful punks. However, in this neighborhood there are some criminals who commit fraud through arson and see that Gabe is a convenient scapegoat - because he wants to reform the school and nobody believes him so innocent when Gabe is ready to be sent back to " The Big House "It is up to others in the gang to help him and reveal the true bandits. <br /> <br />" Dead End Kids "appears in the Warner Brothers United movie. The story in the late 1930s and the film was very good. (Especially ANGELS with DIRTY FACES) However, after the children's contract expired, they went to Monogram Studios and the film to show that they were weak and determined - by Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey was quite a person. A lot of performances and groups were renamed "The Bowery Boys" because the Angels washed their faces with great writing and production values, and Hall and Gorcey didn't always watch the camera. The film is very good - and almost 7 points (close to reality) In fact, while this is not a movie, it was great fun to watch, so I'll give 7! Of course, it is very funny, especially at the end, when the children bring the law into their own hands and Reagan ignores the Bill of Rights - but it is quite fun. The Dead End Kids are performing the best. And Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan provide excellent support Of course, this part of the movie is unreasonable and impossible. In any way, it is still funny and more charming - so if you can suppress unbelief, it works well.
