I was not surprised that the film was released in theaters. I was very surprised when the DVD arrived because the film was not widely published. <br /> <br /> Denzel's first debut Washington and finished products are nothing. To envy other films with the same content by the director with more expertise This film looks very professional. It shows that Mr. Washington learned a lot about the other side of the camera. He brings a different perspective to this movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best things that this movie has is the good performance of Derek Luke. He is an actor with the right approach to go without a doubt. He spends time with a troubled young man at this point of his life in the chaos and suffering for a bad hand life. Until now, he has dealt with him very seriously. His antwone is like a man's image. Pain, which is generally very good and very much But no one can see the side of his character. <br /> <br /> At the worst of his despair, Antwone was sent to Dr. Davenport, played by Mr. Washington, is very quiet. Due to concerns within Antwone, he missed the opportunity to open himself to this man who needed help. But due to the restrictions placed in his office, there are only three sessions and then have to cancel the patient. <br /> <br> Things work out when Antwone can persuade doctors to continue working with him. Antwone's past details are revealed. The abuse he suffered in the hands of Mrs. Tate, who is his foster mother, is brutal. The effort in the hands of an old woman in the family against Tate's sexual assault, Antwone tasted the bitter taste that had been with him for the rest of his education while he was scarred by the shame he carried him. <br /> <br> Antwone finds the last love with Cheryl, who is patient enough to make him see the world that is different from the love she gave her. <br /> <br /> The show is Very good thing. Of course, Dr. Davenport Fort Denzel Washington also had his problems as well. He is not a happy guest as well. He can help Antwone, but he can't help himself or his relationship with his beloved wife. <br /> <br /> The ability in this film is incredible. Joy Bryant makes Cheryl D. Novella. San, who is a great actress like Mr Tate, a abused patron mother. <br /> <br /> The combination of Anwone and his unknown family is quite sweet, sweet and sensual. Is to believe that Fisher finally finds happiness. We have to accept that part of the movie as well.
