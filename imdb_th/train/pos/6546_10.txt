I may be one of the biggest fans of Nancy Drew. I read every book three times and I played a lot of Nancy games. I love this movie. It keeps you entertained anytime you watch it. I go with my friend about 10 people and everyone loves it. There were three women sitting behind us which seemed to be in the late 30s to the early 40s, and I asked them how they liked it. They said they liked So you will see that it will be entertaining for all ages. You just give a chance And it teaches the lesson as well. Be yourself, even if everyone around you is exactly the same Overall, this move is excellent. I'll see it a second time now! So stop it please It's a really good movie!
