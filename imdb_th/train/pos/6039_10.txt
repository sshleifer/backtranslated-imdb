Fortunately, being a supplement to this great movie and loving every minute of filming Went to the Premier in London and talked to Phil Peter Martin and Jon as well as my wife Then, a few weeks later, went to see a movie with a member of our bicycle club. It's a great movie. It deserves to be there with every great motorcycle rider. Now we have a DVD. Sue, my wife can't get enough of it. Get out of the club that seems to think I'm a movie star now. Oh, well, anyone can dream. I think they are jealous. The only downside of the first part of the shoot is the rain, rain and rain. But now we are in Wales Hope to have a follow-up so I posted Jon Beck.
