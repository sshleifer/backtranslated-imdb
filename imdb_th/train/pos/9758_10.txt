Personally, this is one of my favorites forever! No, I'm not 10 .. I'm 30! I am the owner of the original VHS, which is the original item I bought from a rental store. I've watched countless times .. <br /> <br /> While it's a fun movie for kids, it's an interesting movie for adults. I've seen this movie when I'm .. No sober. My eyes are open to things I've never noticed before. I see that morality is very supportive, both openly and exaggerated .. I hope that I will remember everything I noticed especially. But it has been a long time since then Rest assured that there are many things that are mentioned in the movie. If you get the chance to watch it .. not quiet .. do so, you will not be disappointed .. In truth, you may feel quite happy and warm !
