In the crap sea that Hollywood (and others) still reveal, this is one of the rough diamonds. A small, simple movie that is extremely entertaining and makes you feel that you are not just wasting half an hour in your life. <br /> <br /> Ashley Judd is a very amazing movie. I've never been a big fan or noticed her before. But returning to see her first performance made me confident that she was extremely talented. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie was a work assigned to me for my college program, so I I'm not sure. I will care. I think "Oh, this boy, some flick, chic or indie man, woman, indie ..." I was very surprised. If there is no analysis of many related themes, I will say that if you have never seen you, do something you like and try. Sometimes the best live movies and this is a great movie.
