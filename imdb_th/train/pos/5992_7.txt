I agree that I do not know what will happen before watching this stylish piece. Probably the treatment of zombies or flu viruses for everyone I know It starts with a wonderful picture, a small sample that attracts your attention and makes your imagination go wild. As it continues to learn quickly through the voice of what happened The little neo-no story that I felt was not the waist of the moment. The little clues given to the audience through the pictures at the beginning made them feel successful while they planned Along with a good twist at the end, it is the overall cool package The score, although not bad But gave the feeling to the music video It felt a little outdated without adding anything to the story. Some shows feel too real. But fits perfectly with the feel of the overall piece I walked away from this satisfaction. I received a lot of information in a short period of time, but with the corrections and the use of excellent speech, I didn't feel hustling or pushing. Great!
