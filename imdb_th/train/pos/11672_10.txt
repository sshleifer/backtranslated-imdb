Great pirate entertainment! It has all the good ingredients that need to pay attention - the fascinating story of a female pirate named Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara) that attracts the attention of Mr. Hawke (Errol Flynn), his own irresistible. They create a romantic couple on the screen - sigh! <br /> <br /> Anthony Quinn is a vicious pirate who weaves his wicked web in the separation and conquest. I noticed the familiar face of Mildred Natwick, who played a supporting role as Mrs. MacGregor, the guardian of Princess Patma (Alice Kelley). <br /> <br /> There is a beautiful filming scene of the coast, boat and bay. Many things, such as fighting with swords, naval battles, the brave jump of Errol Flynn (Robin Hood on the boat!) From a fiery red head. I have heard in the interview of Maureen O'Hara that she boasted that command Excellent The bullwhip and Flynn could beat in a fight with a sword in those days. But don't need to test it here. <br /> <br /> The movie is so fun.
