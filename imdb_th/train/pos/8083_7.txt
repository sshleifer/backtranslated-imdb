If you have read the book and forget the character that Tolkien created in your head The representation of the hobbits, dwarves and others has a 'Disney' treatment. Dark riders are excellent and as I always imagined from books Great combination of live motion and animation to create amazing effects for years. I just hope he (Bakshi) will receive money to complete his epic. <br /> <br /> It's worth having a video because they are worth little after Lord of the Rings in 2001. !!
