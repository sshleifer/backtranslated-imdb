Titanic must be one of my favorite movies of all time. It has problems (things that the movie doesn't like) but still fun. <br /> <br /> When I stumble on someone who asks me why I like it Titanic. I think my first reaction is "Wait a minute, can't you?" I know many people who don't like this movie, and I'm not saying that I don't understand why. "The love story is too wonderful." Okay, yes. But isn't it fun? Okay, the love story between Jack and Rose is unrealistic. Everyone knows that this kind of love doesn't really exist. But this is a movie, not everyone enjoys watching beautiful stories that let us sneak into a little imagination for a while? The next complaint DiCaprio and Winslet are horrible actors. Okay, in this movie, I agree that they can't perform their full potential. However, I think it's not fair to say that they are horrible actors. I think they are both talented actors. Unfortunately, there is a great reputation for movies that they are not breathtaking. But the role they get is simple and the characters seem to be true enough for you to be interested in them a bit. I agree with many people that they can't do as expected. <br /> <br /> And finally, if anyone complains that they don't like this movie because they hate love or because They hate history or tragedy movies. I'm sorry. But why are they going on the earth and watching movies that are clear to all of these things? It's like people who complain The Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies. Just to be a movie, not because you don't like the movie genre, this is a good movie. <br /> <br /> Deserves an Oscar, especially the best movies that I think are the best I have ever had. As seen in the movie, may help the trilogy of the Lord of the Rings <br /> <br /> I know that some writing has failed, such as the screams of each other's names throughout the movie. The story of the story may be quite weak at times. But overall, it was a great success in making Titanic look very realistic and the feeling of being overwhelmed by it. <br /> <br /> I understand why so many people don't like it. This movie But in most cases, it will make them not like basic ideas, like it is a love story more than they think that this movie and in itself is not good. <br /> <br /> me Can tell you that I have read more than five books about the Titanic, including the memoirs of the day that it happened, and the film has a very historical accuracy, recorded only Miss a little The only important thing I can find is that the pipe that should be screwed, not copper, iron, and iceberg, is not realistic enough, just like the scene in which they collided. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 10/10, Not because I like romantic movies But because of the success of the great movie, which makes a person afraid of adjusting to actual events
