I really enjoyed this movie. It's a rather dark story - Shakespeare's Macbeth and encapsulated in modern quirky yarns, often funny and angry. <br /> <br /> Glorious how the filmmakers bring a different world of NYC and Scotland Macbeth combined under one roof The opposing world, <br /> <br /> brings out the attractiveness and comedy of the plays and you have to love Harold Perrineau as a singer who is not in the drama. But really helped the jazz story, the ending was outstanding among the small indie groups that I had seen because it was closed and had originality
