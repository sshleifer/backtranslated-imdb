The movie Unborn is a horror movie with a low budget, quite well, using the fear associated with pregnancy. It performed very well by Brooke Adams and James Karen, who had excellent performance, although the supporting actors were quite normal. Gary Numan's songs were good for everyone as well. Henry Dominic's script is quite smart for this, though. There is a hint of the hatred of women. The direction of Rodman Fender is enough and there is an unnecessary fear. If you are an avid fan of Adams, where the movie acting career is nowhere near as it should be, try it. She's great as always.
