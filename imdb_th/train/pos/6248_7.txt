Being an Austrian, this is what impressed me. Fortunately, I didn't live near the place where this film happened. Unfortunately, it presents everything that other people in Austria hate about the Vienna people. (Or someone who is close to that region) and it's easy to read that this is truly the director's intention: to let your head sink into your hand and say "Oh, God, how is it possible?" No, not with me. The scene in the swinger club without censorship is totally exaggerated. No need. I watch porn for sure. But in this context, I am somewhat disgusted than placed in the right context. <br /> <br /> This film tells the story of a stray person who lacks education or a bad company trying to survive and Living in a world of repetition and boredom A girl who is treated like a whore by her envious boyfriend. (And still coming back) The female teacher who discovered the abuse of self-punishment by putting on the life of her cruel "lover" in the old couple. Mathematics circuits almost every day (she was the "official replacement" of his ex-wife), a newly divorced couple and an old husband who had to suffer under the actions of his former wife, apparently had a relationship With her masseuse and finally Who asked her driver about the most unusual questions and stretched their nerves just as annoying. <br /> <br /> After seeing it, you almost didn't feel anything. You are not shocked, shocked, sad, or feeling like doing anything ... Maybe that's why I gave 7 points. It made me react like I had never before. If good or bad, it is up to you!
