I went to watch this movie with many friends one night. I don't hear much about this. So I didn't expect anything. But after I saw it, I liked it very much. Nicolas Cage and the rest of the actors were very good. But I must say that the performance of Giovanni Ricci does not need to do anything. But a small flaw may be replaced. <br /> <br /> Lost in 60 seconds is about a car thief who has to fall back, which must add 60 cars. Rare and exotic one night to Save the brother Movies cannot be predicted. So the ending should be a surprise. Think of it as another fast driving movie, right? You have some rights More Everyone should watch this movie.
