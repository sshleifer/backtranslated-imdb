A fictional biography in the early years of Abraham Lincoln from director John Ford focuses on the trial by a young lawyer defending two brothers accused of murder. <br /> < br /> The shape and film made out well But seems to be quite incomplete without any great moments from his presidency or even discussions with Stephen Douglas The clear intention was to show that Lincoln, when the young man developed a feature that would make him become the great man he would become. But the result for me is that while I appreciate the description, it is not as satisfying as I think it should have a broader scope. <br /> <br /> In the role of Abraham Lincoln, we have Henry. Reevada at Showing silence effectively Fonda's performances include some gestures and other feelings that are reasonably effective in presenting Lincoln's image, especially when combined with some powerful makeup and pricing, which are sometimes quite overt Strong and surprising, not including many of Ford's regular supporting actors. (Sometimes called his stock company) but we have Ward Bond, one of the most productive actors in Hollywood Bond appeared in more than 100 popular AFI movies, more than any other actors, both original and edited versions. He also appeared in 11 Best Picture Nominees. <br /> <br /> This movie has a scene that seems to be inspired in a similar scene in "To Kill a Mockingbird", which it will do better. Stay here even though the scene is most effective in this movie.
