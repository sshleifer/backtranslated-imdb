This film has a very raw potential. The conversation was excellent. The conversation (usually) was great (although it might have made the sound of the perseverance lost). The direction and the movie were surprisingly good, although some experiments didn't work. The main problem here is David Duchovny when the geek-boy is always geek-boy; And the sad and simple truth is that he cannot play anything other than Fox Maleder He gestures. He tries to slip. He poses. He tries to be a man. Eventually he tried too hard. He overcame his character. He acted beyond the line and he was able to overcome in every way by Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie who was in his class for acting skills. Timothy Hutton is very good as always. There are times of uncertainty or two moments in which he plays a dramatic role. But you can tell that he enjoys it He watched that time and he became a physical character and atmosphere. Angelina Jolie was also good. She has not many roles. In fact, I even though you can use more strong ... Your character is not developed enough. But she did well with what she had And the chemistry between her and Hutton is clear. (Maybe that's the reason why Uma left him ...;) Overall, it's quite rough around the edge, but there is a lot of effort from good actors and great supporting roles if David Duchovny can't. Wearing a piece, it would be much better. 7/10
