I love when they do sports. Many people in the past have hokey. It's embarrassing to see. Not this one. It's just a really good movie, a story that is outdated and based on real-life men who will do what Dennis Quaid has done in this movie. He played as a high school coach who talked about his end-of-life efforts, speaking bravely to being a professional baseball pitcher. He finally reached his goal of reaching the major league, even though it was a short time. <br /> <br /> Every character here is a good person. A player in his high school team for his little boy (Angus T. Jones is now a television star). <br /> <br /> Quaid is believed to play Jim Morris. Because unlike past actors He knows how to throw a baseball movie. He looks like a man's pitcher who can shoot 90 miles per hour. And this movie is mostly true according to the actual pitcher's testimony in a documentary on DVD. <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for movies, sports, good life and inspiration You are not wrong with this
