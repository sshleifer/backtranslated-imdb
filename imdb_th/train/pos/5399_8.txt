Gosha's latest great film in the 1960s. A stylized stylist and a great purpose for his film. Gosha teamed up with Shintaro Katsu (from Zatoichi, a celebrity) to create a complaint that shows loyalty to an irrational nation. <br /> <br /> "Tenchu" (Heavenly Judgment) is a word that is loyal to the emperor shouting while assassinating the enemy or "traitor" to cause Katsu to show loyalty to each other. His simple to manipulative politicians on behalf of a proud patriot. Anyone who questions the politicians will be identified as "traitors" and become targets of assassination. <br /> <br /> One of the best movies that has ever been shot in many shots is an element. Incredible color scheme and lighting The fight scenes are frequent and bloody and very cruel. Blood became part of the palette that Gosha used for his image. Beautiful and annoying While the personal story is easy to follow, the historical background is complex and while the basic history lessons for this time in Japan are very useful, you can fight through the movie without it. Some of the disadvantages of this film are the occasional musical path, length and scenery of Katsu. He has a drunken scene at the top of the movie. But actually it is a very accurate picture. <br /> <br /> Downbeat, but one of the great Shambara films.
