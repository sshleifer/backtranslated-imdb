The thirty most memorable horror movies are Dracula and Frankenstein. There are many good reasons for that. But less than But there is a great production and The Invisible Ray is one of them. The plot is not unique and has similar characteristics that have been seen many times before. (Even back in 1936) But the way in which everything comes together is truly imaginative. The story focuses on Dr. Janos Rukh, who has a good heart, a man who finds a way to create a new world history His discovery convinced him that there might be unknown radioactive elements somewhere in Africa, so he set out with a popular team to find it. However, the tragedy strikes during the journey and the good doctor becomes exposed to the elements; Which caused him to glow in the dark and still send him crazy ... <br /> <br /> The biggest attraction of this film is the fact that it is the biggest two-star horror star in That day - Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi and both have excellent performances. Carlos shows that he is a really good actor and his character has a lot of meat that Carlos has impressed. Belalukosi has a very different role from what we've seen him, and it's a great performance from him as well. It's a good story to see the versatility of Lugosi. This movie started quite slowly, but things started to pick up. In the second half of this film the best, and that is when the movie gets excited, Carlos gets the opportunity to shine (literally). The film doesn't focus on the effect. Special, large, and mostly depends on the actions of the main characters to make things interesting and it works very well. This movie is still interesting all the time and leads to a great climax point. Overall, The Invisible Ray may not be one of the thirty best horror movies. But it is very good and recommended
