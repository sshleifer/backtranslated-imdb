Setting and actors create a television movie, this story for me, the best story of Dickens George C. Scott's classic tale. Believe well like the rest of the actors. Scrooge was so greedy with the disgust until the end of the movie. Then his character transformed into a truly repentant person. The 19th century English town that was appointed to create the atmosphere suitable for Dickens and increase the credibility of this film. It's a movie that I watch every Christmas with real Grinch and it's a wonderful life.
