The ability of this film is that even a talented dentist is scary. It is one of the first fears of mankind. This movie is a nightmare that every child has to go through in the waiting room. Corbin Bernsen gives a surprising performance as a crazy dentist whom I think is trying to kill people. But he only works with their teeth, so it doesn't really work. In a blood-filled scene, we find that the great actress Earl Boen has his teeth completely destroyed with training and anything. Which I think is the worst thing you can do when you are a killer dentist It is a general situation of Brian Yuzna, not well written, but with blood. Plot it, sparrow, and sometimes it seems to be created at that point. But hey, it's a killer dentist movie, we all think of it But they do it for the first time
