I like almost all movies in the Dirty Harry series, except for movies that I think is called "Enforcer". "Deadpool" is also weak in the area as well. But i still enjoy it This one is one of my favorite series if there is nothing else for the great line of This is also an interesting storyline, even if someone has killed someone who made her mistake. Just think of "Magnum Force" with less mystery about those behind the killing and You have your plan There are more, because this is a very good final showdown feature at the amusement park. There is also a Dirty Harry feature that has received a bulldog as a gift and it adds up to Sandra Locke in a rather funny scene. The only question that remains is why Clint Eastwood must have a moderate female actress Sandra Locke in his film. She makes the score drop every time, even when the overall picture of the movie is fun for me. In fact, she's not bad here. But her habits may be greatly improved by others Another problem of this film and other Dirty Harry movies. Sometimes they seem to advertise guns. I like guns as much as the next person, but we need his scenes that describe the strengths of his latest weapons and how many ammunition? Is still a very good program in the Dirty Harry series.
