This is the reason I love this site so much! I saw this film in 1980 on British television. Over the years, it's what I want. I know more because it's with me. It's one of the most special things I've ever seen in my life. With just a few words to remember, I followed this movie here and many information, including the fact that it would become a Broadway musical! <br /> <br /> interesting, unlike previous commenters I do not remember finding this movie sad or exploited. On the other hand, the extraordinary relationship between mother and daughter stuck in the mind, witnessing strength, honor and dignity. Ironically, you may think that considering the filth of their lives It may be because I live in the United Kingdom where the fading greatness has an acceptable language in the life of old money that is dirty, often accepted as evidence of good breeding. I see it as a rare and unique image of a monstrous spirit, profound and profound humor that has the most delicate and subtle fabric, making it sober and respectful. In a way that I regret seeing it being mentioned as a 'cult' over the years in my mind, it will illuminate all above all, as a wonderful and outstanding television experience. It is a personal story that is revealed. It looks strange to think that it will become public in order to become a New York musical. But maybe somewhere, the daughter will receive amusing results She is the person who will have the last laugh, maybe .. (they do her musicals before you Jackie O ')
