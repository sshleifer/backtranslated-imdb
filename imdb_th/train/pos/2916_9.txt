In all the movies I have seen and that is the majority of them, this is the best thing to do about the US Navy airships (Blimps) in the WW-II era. Yes. Most use special techniques rather than any real-time images. The Navy of this Man has a lot more real-time blimps videos. There are many conversations. But that is what makes Hollywood movies even more interesting. Even today, PS I spent 10 years (from 20 years) and spent more than 5,000 hours on all types of naval airships since 1949.
