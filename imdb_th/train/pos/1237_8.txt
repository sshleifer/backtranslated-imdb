This is a movie with very good originals and a brave posture for everyone involved. I don't care that it's not the best movie ever collected. The fact that Eddie Murphy is doing something that's not a formula and I don't know what will happen next, makes it my favorite . I hope this film will be more creative than this movie than it is a traditional formula for entertainment.
