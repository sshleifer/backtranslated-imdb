They go to school and practice shooting and have chosen their "proby" (experimental firefighter) to join them in New York firehouse, Ladder 1 and engine 7.

Believed to be the only image of the first plane crashed into the World Trace Center. <br /> <br /> I'm traveling back with my friends on the train from one night of LAN gaming and getting a phone call around local time 850.00 hrs.

When I returned home, the upper floors of the twin towers were bright and the smoke and my fear broke down within an hour. <br /> <br / > The filmmakers have two cameras that work on that day. The team followers followed the line regularly and rushed to the WTC as soon as they heard and saw the plane crash. We follow what is possible. The sequence of events that were taken only once in the lobby of the WTC1, which responded to the first question of firefighters, doctors and police must understand what happened and develop a fast action plan.

Arriving that day as a witness to a close event of safety. <br /> <br /> Code 1 DVD consists of an exclusive 4-hour interview with the Ladder 1 and Engine 7 separate men.
