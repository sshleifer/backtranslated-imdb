"The Bourne Ultimatum" begins a brutal chase and in pulsating dance, beating the bomb from there, while Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, truly fantastic) follows the CIA expert behind the color. black In order to learn his true identity, David Strathairn, who is as cold as "The person behind the curtain" was added to the returning actors, including Joan Allen (great) and Julia Stiles (none actually exists). <br /> <br /> Like the second program in Series. I hope Paul Greengrass's mobile camera will stabilize at least for a few minutes of downtime. However, as mentioned above, it is the perfect way to capture the awkward tensions of close combat scenes and work well on the chase scenes, most of which walk and cross the roof with a large car stack. Occasionally, up part of the fun of the Bourne series is the continuous jump and management of technology and communication that seem to challenge the laws of physics and triad. Present The film Bond seems to have existed in an unreasonable reality that is full of magic that uses technology. It is unreasonable that everyone seems to be in the right place at the right time. But I will be cursed if it is not a bomb that will watch them there. <br /> <br /> When there is no emotion and the connection with Franka Potente, the writer tries to create an emotional connection between Damon and the style. But she is an actress who has to face the emptiness Even though he was still able to forgive, unlike "Identity" and "Supremacy" which "Ultimatum" revealed all, and finally we learned the truth about Bourne's past. It was a fun and satisfying summary for Series and if they have a good feeling and Damon gets his desire, this will be the perfect end.
