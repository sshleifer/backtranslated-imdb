that is cool! In Story Mode, you will change from punk to pro. You must achieve goals related to skating, driving and walking. You create your own skater and name it and you can make it look silly or realistic. You are with your friend Eric throughout the game until he betrays you and gets you fired from the skateboarding team. (You can choose which team to open) and then you start building your own team! There are many levels such as New Jersey, Manhattan and even School II (not part of the story mode) from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. You can unlock the skaters like Iron Man, Gene Simmons and other players. You can create your own goals such as letters, skates, letters, COMBO, Tricktris, spaces and much more. You can create targeted pedestrians and write what they say. If you're tired of doing so, you can make pre-built goals in a pre-built park. The only thing I don't like about this game is that sometimes it's hard to drive a 9/10 car.
