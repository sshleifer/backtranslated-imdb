Note to previous reviewers: This movie is "Science fiction adaptation of Lied" according to the screenplay So whether the reference is painful or not, there is no apology. It is the basis for the movie. They admitted that they had stolen ... but converted to P.C vocabulary. <br /> <br /> Great flick. But too short May not come out like a writer, director or studio that needs But very fun The fact that the studio itself is involved during the creation only helps to increase its heritage. <br /> <br /> Creating a large budget will not be fun and may not make a movie. But it was fun to dream about the potential there Apparently there was a DVD release with a little extra. But I don't think it will play with NTSC players. I'm not an expert and still trying to figure it out. For now I am with the VHS Avatar.
