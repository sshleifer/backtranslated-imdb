Night theft is a wonderful story of the week leading up to the rapture and the week after that important event. <br /> <br /> I'm happy with both the production value and the content of independent Christian movies. This. <br /> <br /> Value of production Hey, it's an independent movie with limited budget. So you will look a little scary. (If your standard is Hollywood fare) but when compared correctly with other independent films, this movie is perfectly acceptable. More important than the style of performance, costumes and music as a story Interesting story, right? How amazing moments work Does the movement of the story create for a satisfying climax? The answer to these questions is "yes" unconditionally. The real technical significance is continuity, sound and light. The audience can watch the show without having to worry about sloppy crafts. <br /> <br /> The value of the text of the great movie. When you consider the amount of ideas that the filmmakers developed within a short period of 69 minutes, you will begin to appreciate his art. He presented the message of salvation, the consequences of unbelief, the danger of reversing the truth of the rapture and the threat of the Satan government that has power over the world with imaginary flames and the most important for the Jesus film. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers are good storytellers. For example, he developed a message of salvation in two important ways: (1) He showed us through the actual actions of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ for our sake. This is a success in the sub-plan that the zoo caretaker bites and almost dies. The only treatment is blood from people who are immune to poisonous snakes. The poison is like sin. Healing like the blood of Christ shed on the cross (2) The filmmakers also develop a message of salvation through dialogue. He has many characters describing the truth about human sin and the need for salvation through faith in Christ. Therefore, the filmmakers use both action and dialog boxes to tell their stories. <br /> <br /> As a note of the fact that movies produced by evangelical Christians include dialogue and scenes That convey a clear message Of salvation, which is clearly recognized in Christian language, images and theology Criticizing this film that being a Christian is ridiculous It's like criticizing Nike ads for promoting sports wear. What would the Christian filmmakers do if they were not films that identified their case? In addition, the fact that filmmakers use the idea that unbelievers will be left in a world without God is perfectly acceptable again. The filmmakers used the amazing potential of that idea remarkably. How do i know I heard about the nightly theft from a woman who saw the show in 1974; It remained in her memory thirty years later. How many movies can you talk about? Fun and thought-provoking performances I plan to show my teen group that the church knows.
