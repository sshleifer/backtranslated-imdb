Since watching this movie as a child 30 years ago, I never bored to watch it. From the opening scene in the Horn factory to motor cars that ran from the back of the car to Ollie answering the phone and being pushed out of the window by Stan accidentally After that, they moved to the 20th century, Fox, and while those films were not bad, they lacked the comic moments of this film. Jimmy Finlayson broke their long record of his last appearance with the boys appearing as the top doctor! Quote: "I said goat's milk." His answer to Stan asked him how you drank ghosts! Charlie Hall and even Ben Turpin appeared! I will speak all in one of my favorite L & H comedies.
