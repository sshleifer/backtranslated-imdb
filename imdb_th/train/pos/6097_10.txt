I do not see how you can say that Freddy's nightmare is wonderful and torn. Obviously you don't know a good TV when you see it. The episode is full of drama and blood. Freddy is creative in the way he kills people. I like Freddy's nightmare and I hope to get all 44 episodes on the DVD. The best episodes are: Saturday Night Special, School Daze and Love Stinks. If you think this series is sucked, you are entitled to See your But remember that it's just your opinion. Freddy's nightmare will be one of the best series of all time and you'll have to accept that truth soon. If you don't like it, don't watch it. But don't deny that it is wise
