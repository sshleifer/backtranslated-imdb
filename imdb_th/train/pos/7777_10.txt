However, Bacall is loved by Rock Hudson, a close friend of Stacks and Dorothy Malone. Lustful after the stone Throwing in a few clutter, and the movie rotates according to the control (in a good way). <br /> <br /> The film has a lot of luster in beautiful graphics. Everyone looks perfect. And dress with beautiful clothes In general, this is a television drama that has a production grade. The story itself is very fun and some dialogue at the beginning is very fun. The performances of Hudson Stack and Bacol are not good. But seeing them are young and very charming ... especially the stack ... when he smiles my knees weak! On the other hand, Dorothy Malone is great - she deserves the Best Supporting Actress award for her role. She is sexy, violent, vile and pathetic ... <br /> <br /> Trash can be fun. miss!
