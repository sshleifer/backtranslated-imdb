I watched this movie on Friday 7 April. I didn't see the last scene. (Because I'm talking to my mother, husband, at the same time). Everyone can tell me what happened to her. The door is dead. <br /> <br /> What happened to you? Did you kill yourself? How can she handle everything like a phone while she is at home when her husband is talking to those who like this strange thing? Everyone can explain to me I'm very curious !! (In the end, I read that she suffered from doubly personality disorders. <br /> <br /> Thank you earlier.
