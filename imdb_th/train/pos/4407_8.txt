For those who comment on The Patriot that is correct (in general English), it's interesting to watch this movie. The whole story is the most cold-blooded war that Americans have ever participated in and they are the only nationality. Therefore, it is very exciting to see something that is similar to the historical accuracy that came from the Atlantic coast, which did not portray America as a witness or savior. Overall, what this film brought to the house was the real horrors of the conflict and the way in which any action done in the war caused only bad deeds. This is not the movie you cheered on. But giving both regret and hatred
