Personally, I think this movie looks very good. It summarizes the actual situation of the triads in Hong Kong and allows the audience to see how to organize the triads. <br /> <br /> Not only that, it also shows the audience how Hong Kong police control three situations and why. Police not only But go outside and get rid of the three people. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is quite violent due to gang-killing and torture methods. However, this movie is still true in the real world, so the violence on the screen is just a reflection of what actually happened. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie to the movie Triad. / Mafia Another good thing is the Dragon Squad. This movie has more guns, as in this movie, has more knives than guns. (In fact, I can't remember seeing a single gun)
