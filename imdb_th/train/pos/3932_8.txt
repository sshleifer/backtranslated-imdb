Similarly with his Americana drums along the Redskins, John Ford gathers American history in a fictional manner. But very convincing. Henry Fonda created three films in this era with Ford and all three stories about time and space, with an emphasis on the environment and culture. In the American pioneers, America was blooming full of Americans fighting for India and other forces here. Ford showed us that America in the 19th century; The time when invention and creativity began to blossom and this country was truly great. Among all that, is a tall, thin young lawyer from Illinois named Abe Lincoln and this movie lives as a lawyer to predict the greatness he will receive later. Wonderful in this movie The essence of what constitutes Lincoln's identity, even if no one knows what he is. Supporting scenes and actors also work well together and create a unique balance in the dreamy images of the American dream and the various styles of Ford. But symbolizing that Lincoln received warmth for the events of his life to build his legacy We got the scene between him and Mary Todd. And difficult to see how they gathered But that's not the point I believe that this is just to praise Lincoln's greatness, which is widely regarded as the greatest American president. His quiet and straightforward posture is rare and will be today. Of course, our government definitely wants men more than him.
