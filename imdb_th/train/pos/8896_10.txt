Any one can help find the name and artist of the song that plays at least half way through the movie. I can't remember what the scene was playing. The words in the song are ballads. Some lyrics look like "It's a way to tell you that something is wrong." It's a way of telling the song "" as a way to forgive you. "Please help me with this question. Thank you so much. I searched the internet for many days. So now this thing will challenge me to find someone who may help with this. I hope I will pay attention to the scene when it is playing.
