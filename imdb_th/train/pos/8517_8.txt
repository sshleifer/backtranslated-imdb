Russ and Valerie are talking about starting a family. Both live in a luxury apartment and run an auction business that involves valuable collectibles. At the same time, the owner of a dedicated adoption company spends a small holiday and leaves the orphanage in the care of his father. (Leslie Nielsen), father Harry is in the rental business, and he had the brilliant idea to "rent" the orphans, some couples like Russ and Valerie. Harry, who is aware of the dilemma of couples, families, brothers offered for rent for 10 days! Brandon, Kyle and Molly move into the apartment with their temporary parents, along with surprising results as new caregivers have no experience with children But where is the possibility of a happy ending? This is a family movie that I love. The actors, including Nielsen, as a businessman and novelist, Christopher Lloyd, are kind-hearted porters. Fast and fun script and the overall production cost is quite high. Yes, if only life is like this! Every orphan deserves the opportunity to prove that they are loved and able to give happiness to parents who are considering adoption. If you want to show movies for your family, which is rooted in good value But still very entertaining to find this movie It is guaranteed to let everyone laugh, even if their hearts are melted.
