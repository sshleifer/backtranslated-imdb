This film presents a wonderful vintage view of Philadelphia during the year. Fri. 1940. There are various scenes in the city, a railway station that no longer exists. The 30th Street station, which still exists, includes scenes from the northeastern part of the city. Good pictures of old row houses when they appear This movie is quite "talkative" many times, causing viewers to lose interest in a short time, but the overall story is strong and moves very well. Those who love this movie should try to watch the movie "Bright Victory" along with images in Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville, PA and scenes from downtown Phoenixville. The Army Hospital has become a university campus. These movies don't have any form and I can't imagine why. I have both of them in the VHS from home records as shown in TCM in the past year. I suggest they know other history there from my area!
