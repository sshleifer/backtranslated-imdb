One of the best movies out there. Yes, maybe movies may not be the greatest thing. But a great story and concept Great for time and great ideas and creativity. Something different from general movies and good fun One of my favorites and will recommend to anyone who likes creative and imaginative movies. After World War 3 and the battle in the giant robots, the actors gave excellent performances and made it worth while. The scene is not breathtaking. But simple and works well with the overall image of the movie This movie is very rare on DVD, but also using VHS. Try it out because I like it a lot. Not the main flick and don't like what you've seen. Try and think like a child. It's a great view and very fun.
