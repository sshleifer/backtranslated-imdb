I can't believe my eyes when I read other comments and reviews as if it were a medium-level movie with a working duck. <br /> <br /> This movie is a good, funny and crazy story. But with low intensity and all the way Power to the core Love every bit of it Can not remember such crazy things created for laughing and martial arts And now the most important thing (At least for me): It's a free computer impact. When I watched Hollywood actors, Duke came out on the screen in a modern, high resolution and high budget action "fuflo" (the Russian word that means "bull * beep *"). * beep * can be done - you can adjust the power cord for the body, add cute effects on the PC and things in action movies It's different here. I don't think there are a dozen of the most advanced action actors around the world that can repeat the controversy that occurred at the end of the movie or the "Chinese football" play, and it's just a small Hong Kong movie theater. Created for fun without pretending to be "Star Wars". <br /> <br /> Having a DVD with an English soundtrack is not a problem with this movie. It doesn't destroy my atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I can't help but talk about the dramatic performance. Suppose you do not like some people. For me - it's great. See the dragon friends who are speaking bravely with criminals and suddenly have fleas on the left side of the head. His facial expressions changed into something strange and he came to the dragon with the baby's expression. And see the size of the mouth that is dangerous - it's almost from one ear to the other side when he makes grimaces. <br /> <br /> This film deserves a higher score and thousands of comments from people around the world. Thank you very much for our Russian industry for publishing Jackie Chan's classic movie. His modern men are much weaker in my humble opinion and do not deserve much advertising. <br /> <br /> Total 10 out of 10 - legendary movies in its genre. Thanks for your attention
