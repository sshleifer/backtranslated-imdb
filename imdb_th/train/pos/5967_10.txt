Sammi, Curr, metal rock gods. They try to stop him. They try to ban him trying to check his music !! (As with real life, Dee Snider from Twisted Sister, [Tipper Gore] or Ozzy Osborne) Killed by Fire The fan and only one person knows what sammi is and what he feels (or he?) The Nuke DJ at the local radio station. (Gene Simmons) has and gives a copy of Sammy Eddie's latest record only. But when Eddie tries to play the record, he finds Sammy talking to him from death and tells him what to do. Returning to the gangsters at his school who hated him and his music .. Everything was done. Sammi started killing !! Great movies and must see for fans with heavy metal hair, along with a great soundtrack from Fastway, and in case you don't know if the music sounds like or knows Fastway and doesn't like them. He changed his voice a little. And stylish as well as sounds like Cinderella more known or Ratt .. Is this movie a real horror movie? That depends on what you call horror. For me, the real horror movie is slasher by killing a lot, or just scary .. This movie isn't enough death. But it cannot be called action, funny, drama, suspense or thriller, so this is the reason why I think it must be a horror movie .. so if you want to "Rock N ' Roll, Rockin 'in the middle of the night, your soul !! Than Sammi Curr and Trick or Treat for you .. I mean "What are you afraid of? It's just Rock 'N' Roll!?! "
