When will people learn that some movies are created for fun and do not need to change the world? If you realize this, expect to have lots of fun while watching. "Bill and Ted's fake journey" This is a fun movie that has been watched. Keanu and Alex create a great on-screen team to show their characters from "Bill and Ted's great adventure" with more "style" It's not rocket science. But it's great for laughing, capable characters and very violent stories. You have to laugh. Don't expect 'full of meaning and full meaning'. Just expect pure fun!
