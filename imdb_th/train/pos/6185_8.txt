I just watched the MURDER AT VANITIES in the newly launched Universal Pre-Code set and I was very surprised that I enjoyed using the car until the end. Most other critics say this is the mystery of murder in a musical. But I want to add a few more notes. Brisson and Carlisle are quite polite compared to most secondary players and it seems that no one can hear the right sound for what they are singing. Low notes) Victor McLaglen, the great and Jack Oakie played superbly with a great sense of timing that allowed the ball to roll between musical numbers. Yes, Lucille Ball and Ann Sheridan Vanities, but don't forget the famous jazz singer Ernestine Anderson in "Ebony Rhapsody" Gail Patrick makes her first appearance sound like Eve Arden; Patrick will continue to be the producer of Perry Mason's television series. Then there is Jessie Ralph, a woman's wardrobe. - You will meet her at David COPPERFIELD (as Aunt Peggoty) and THE BANK DICK. Very good song. Different "Sweet Marihuana", along with the peyote clad button, almost does not appear in the girl's background. (Blood drops on the white skin of one chorine, feeling amazingly chilling); "Ebony Rhapsody" with Duke Ellington's orchestra and beautiful dancers, both black and white. Mix them together. And I believe that this is one of the earliest musicals that have such a mix and the costumes do not leave anything to imagine
