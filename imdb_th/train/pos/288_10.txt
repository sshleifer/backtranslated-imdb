This movie is great! I am a teenager and I and all my friends love the series so it shows that these movies attract the attention of people of all ages. I advise everyone What I like in this movie is when Logan Bartholomew says: "Rose cheeks" when he talks about his daughter. He is a great actor like Erin Cottrell. They match very well and have excellent chemistry! I hope they can work together again. They are very attractive people and actors. I finally found a good-looking movie recently. It's hard for me to find good movies and show good morals and Christian values. But at the same time, these movies are not wonderful.
