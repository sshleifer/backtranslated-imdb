While watching this movie, I was frustrated and distraught, and at the end I wanted to make this movie strong 4 or 5. I think the animation is random and everywhere and it happens a lot. Too, even my ADD cannot be treated. It feels like a little acidic. Everything looks flat, there is no dimension for anything. There are many shapes, lines and patterns. I want to stop the movie halfway and destroy the copy of this burnt movie. But after I finished watching it, I went online to read this movie and I should do a little research about this movie before watching <br /> <br /> The secret of Kells depends on the true story about The original book of Kells Brendan, a little boy, was commissioned to write a new page in what was designated as the greatest book ever written. This book will contain information that will help. "Changing darkness to light" Brendan lives in the village of Kells behind a large stone wall. The abbot of Kells, Brendan's uncle, born in the 8th century, is trying to build a wall to protect the Vikings. Brendan's uncle confirmed that he had helped complete the wall. But travelers and caregivers "book" secretly practice Brendan to practice his drawing skills and convince him to complete "books" and <br /> <br >> all the time when I watch movies, I think I'm missing something because I don't understand what happened. I think I just lost some of the Irish history. A simple Google search teaches what I need to know about the Book of Kells. The original, my opinion about the movie changed dramatically. <br /> <br /> Book of Kells is a book copied from the first two books of the New Testament copied in Latin by Gaelic in Ireland in the 8th century. In addition to the paleographic and insular scripts, this book also Showing gracefully in solitary art, early art forms that are known to be complex, complex and small illustrations Most of the art in the Book of Kells is a picture that shows that there are many works of art at that time. Simplicity and challenging dimensions without perspective. But what makes Book of Kells stand out from the first piece of art is the use of many colors. <br /> <br /> The secret of Kells is very colorful. At first I thought the animation was flat and boring. It reminds me of a lot of samurai jacks that are flat and "min" too. When I learned about the art form of the Book of Kells, it is clear that many forms from the book were imitated in the movie. With lines and swirls and various shapes in Brendan's mind Whenever he enters his imagination, the circular shape resembles the sun, cogs, clocks and wheels begin to fill the screen. The edges of the screen become framed in triangles or decorative circles. The transition will be filled with colors and Celtic knots. From the tree to the ground, many things in this world are covered with shapes or patterns. <br /> <br /> Hammering the card in 70 minutes. Remove credit, Kells' secret is a fun history lesson that is adventurous. A little and Madness makes people interested. (It may be just children) I think people have to open and dig for The Secret of Kells. It's half the art, half the story about history. Although it looks like it's an animation with Adobe illustrator, it is a movie that looks very good. But from the 20 films submitted to the Oscars for consideration, I don't think it's worth it to be nominated for Mary and Max. <br /> <br /> ThatWasJunk.Blogspot.com
