I understand why some people like this movie and why some people don't like it. For me, I like it very much, although I noticed some good and not impressive. The animation is really great, just like Charlie's dream. The character is a mixed bag. The best thing is Ann-Marie, voiced by Judith Baxi. At the end (I'm sick when I read what happened to her). In addition, the interface is a convincing villain ( I like "Morons. I'm surrounded by morons" especially) and with Rasputin and Warren T.Rat seems to be the most memorable of all Don Bluth villains. Charlie and Itchy only lack the same spark but I love King Gator and His music Some of this film is as fascinating as Anna Belle. "You can't come back" which makes me afraid Unfortunately there are some bits that I don't like very much. The story tends to be clumsy and ignored. But Disney's black boiling pot suffered the same problem. There are also some dark scenes that young children will feel dissatisfied. But the ending was very painful However, the biggest flaw is that the song is quite polite and the way they sing. In particular, they have no one except "Let's Make Music Together" and "Love Survives" and Burt Reynolds can't sing and Dom DeLuise sings much better. Overall, it is a movie that can be viewed, which may be more than that. But it is memorable and I'll watch again 7/10 Bethany Cox
