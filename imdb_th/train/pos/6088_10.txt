Is the script more suitable for sitcoms for 30 minutes? Yes, but they are still usable! I think the actors do a great job with a disrespectful script, especially Jack Black and Christopher Walken. Most people on the board seem to really hate this movie. Personally, I can't see what it is like, but Envy is just one of the movies you love or hate, like Napoleon Dynamite and all of Leslie Neilsen's movies. You might think it's one of the worst movies ever created. Or is the most fun movie Do not avoid this film because of criticism. Watch it and see if you are the one who really likes it! If you do, I guarantee that it's worth your money. If you don't like it ... Well, now you know.
