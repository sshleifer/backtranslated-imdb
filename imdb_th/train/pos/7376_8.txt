I enjoyed this debut by director Hideo Na Kata. If you've seen the ring in advance, then you'll be familiar with the style and idea of ​​this flick. It has a terrifying horror about it which works better than Stingers (and predictable) continuously. If you like movies that make you feel cold, you might like this movie. An eerie good debut by Hideo Nakata 8/10
