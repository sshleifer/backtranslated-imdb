This is one of those movies that, after watching, you will miss and come back for months after watching the show. It is exciting for two children. (I always hate movies with playful performances.) Bill Paxton is great. Launching his director better than I expected from an actor whose most memorable line is "Game over, man! Game over!" (From the movie "Aliens") <br /> <br /> The best part about movies is the polarization between the scenes that the actors play with the family and when they work "their". It makes this movie. Reliable and memorable. <br /> <br /> View Bill, I'll wait for the movie many things I love!
