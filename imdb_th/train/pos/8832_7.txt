"Hey Babu Riba" is a movie about Mariana girl (nicknamed "Esther" after the famous American movie star) and four young men Glenn Sacha, Raja and pop, aged 15-17 years in 1953 Belgrade Yugoslavia Five people are friends who are passionate and passionate about blue jazz music or whatever the Americans look like. <br /> <br /> The close relationship of teenagers is intense and eventually sacrifices for Try to help Groups that experience unexpected problems After the change of communist politics, they traveled together in 1985 (the year before the film was created). <br /> <br /> I'm happy to book. Subtitles for one difficult thing Especially in the beginning, there were a few conversations that had no subtitles. Maybe conversations may take time. But I can't read the text and absorb the scene, which makes me not understand the characters involved. I watch movies (Videos from our public library) with friends and we do not understand part of the story about getting streptomycin for sick relatives. <br /> <br /> This Yugoslavian film can be effectively transmitted. The feelings of adolescents towards ideological invulnerability and strong bonding and loyalty There is a main shine and it is interesting to make me guess until the end that these characters will be actors in 1953 and what actually happened. <br /> <br /> I'll score 7 out of 10. And want to watch another film of director Joe Wanzin (1941-1991)
