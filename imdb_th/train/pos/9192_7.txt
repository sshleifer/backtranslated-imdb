We started this review well - I'm so glad that they didn't decide to be shot by Tony and do a backward season like some rumors. In fact, the creator and writer now David Chase did the opposite. We don't really know that Tony will live or die. He was in a coma and his chances of recovery were very thin. It now seems to be moving very slowly and the dream caused by Tony Coma is related to the misguided identity and Asian monks who clap their sh * t from him. After 45 minutes, I was tired of all the pain. But that shouldn't have any reason to cause it to crash now It's a strange and unpredictable episode. But still well written and concentrated Edalfo gave an impressive performance in his career now when a controversial wife faced the death of her husband. I also found it interesting. AJ left the school and vowed to fight with Junior, which AJ often didn't have the ball to pull out. Now Silvio is the acting head, which opens many doors to the problem in the next episode. Many cool now and I think the Vito 'Pole-Smoker' Spadafore might meet his death if he is still greedy. SOB <br /> <br /> This is not a great episode and Just disappointed because Tony killed people. But we, as an audience, liked him and felt that he was the hero of the program. This is a necessary episode for the series, although it is a little snore that leads to the conclusion. The glory of the performances of Edie Falco and David Chase and the writers who created the plot of all unpredictable traditional stories. This is the only season of 'The Sopranos' that I still don't know where the clues are going. I can't wait for the next week's episode. My rating: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> The best line of the episode: (Polly to AJ): "Let's go, Van Helsing!"
