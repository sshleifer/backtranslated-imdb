I love these "Diaper Baby" movies! You can't create a movie like this today and it's full of movie history. It's stupid and the movie was created to make you laugh, which is like that. The way they make these children "show" I will never know I think they are precious and the kids make me laugh. But do other people who make this movie because it shows the innocence that exists in the 30 trees. You have to remember that this is when the movie industry is very young. Was created to let people stop from the real world The fact that you can watch five cents is beyond my understanding. But then dinner for 25 cents is also It's a different time with a completely different set of ideas.
