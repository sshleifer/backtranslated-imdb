I think the kids in the program do very well. I especially like the performance of the character Emma. Well done! The sensational performance is quite good for a budget show. I can track movies and enjoy it without having to watch my watch every 5 minutes. I enjoy the scene with her tooth fairy and burning. The spirit of the spirit of the children that is released is also good. Another advantage of this film is that it continues to move forward. The scene is not very slow. Adult actors also believe, therefore helping to make the show fun. On the fun night of watching movies
