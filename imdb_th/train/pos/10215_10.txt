Most people who follow the movie with Audrey Tautou do not seem to understand that Amelie is a character - not Audrey Tautou's real-life personality. Therefore, every movie that she joins will not be Amelie. /> <br /> Now I picked up this movie because Audrey was there. Yes, it is true. There is a big gap after the first scene that you didn't see at all. Maybe for 45 minutes, but I didn't miss you because I enjoyed other characters. People who lied about everything were funny. Too, someone who shows people who run out of his cafe and skips to the bill by searching for coupons and the balance between losses. Actually .... take a moment. But this is one of the best movies I have seen for a while. <br /> <br /> Audrey Tautou Irene's character is not too sweet that Amelie was in fact while Irene. Her rudeness against the request to change my mind made me to be careful at first. In this film, Irene is a well-intentioned girl. But in one day (terrible), her management became more sour and pessimistic. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so good for you? There are stories and plans to create these interesting ... entertainment to watch the scenery and pictures that are brilliant, colorful and not too slow and all the characters can actually show. The best part of this movie comes from about 20 minutes .... This is when all the plans begin to be combined and the ride will be better and everything is connected and well compatible. I swear it is the best movie I've seen for 20 minutes and the ending ... It made me think "I'm really lucky to find this movie." The ending of this movie is top notch. Anyone who wrote the script for this story is excellent because not only But there will be other sub-plans that will happen but will make them tie together (And in an appropriate manner, which is the case here) but still makes each one feel Humans and live not only But the person who used to be a crutch to create all these butterfly effects ... very impressive. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie because it is a great movie to watch. Anytime in any mood with the company or alone
