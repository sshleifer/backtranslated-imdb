I love this movie all my life It is also a wise story as well as a reference to many classics such as the ship that had disappeared for many decades before being called Bellerophon. Two or more people in FP, Walter Pidson, are clear that they are dreams and themselves. <br /> <br /> I like movies that writers give credit to the audience clearly with intelligence. Unlike blockbuster new releases cost $ 150m in special effects /> Cheers.
