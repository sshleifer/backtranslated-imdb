I am about thirteen when this movie comes out on television. It's superior in action than most movies. Since then, Martin Sheen is great, and even though Nick Nolte has a small part, he also has great support. Vic Morrow as the villain is great. Visit <br /> <br /> When Sheen "test the water" in '34, his Ford (COOL) goes along the mountain highway, it is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Great ending <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed in this low vote received. I think the new generation has a lot of interest in the garbage that comes out today. <br /> <br /> Good taste helps eliminate the masses!
