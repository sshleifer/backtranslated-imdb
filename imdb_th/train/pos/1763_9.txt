This is one of the more fun movies I've ever seen. It has a difficult time But they are full of charm It is the Altmanesque screenplay, excellent physical humor and relaxed friendships, happy to see and parts of life that most of us can relate to. And I can say honestly that I am afraid of Steve Carell's nipples .. I am truly Surprisingly, this is a funny movie that has a bad temper, which is about many love and relationships that we may encounter all the way. Catherine Kinner is great, like Trish and Steve Carell's friends. Everyone has flaws. But very friendly and fun The idea that they suspect Carell is a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a forty-year-old virgin. But the simple truth is that he wants to have love first Original, charming and very funny Highly recommended
