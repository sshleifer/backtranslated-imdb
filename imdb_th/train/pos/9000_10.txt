I saw BLOOD OF THE SAMURAI for the first time at the premiere during the Hawaii International Film Festival. Wow! Blood just blows us away with full vitality, vitality, vitality, excitement, greatness, greatness and even more, and all this is so much fun! Especially for those who like the Shamaru movie, Samurai and Japanese ninja, you have to watch the blood!
