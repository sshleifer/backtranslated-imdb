Although The Shining is older than a quarter of a century But I still challenge everyone not to be surprised by Jack Nicholson's downfall. This is a rare example of something that is so unique that no one can cut it off. Instead, it receives time and again references in pop culture, twins, blood lifts, RedRum, "writing" ridiculous nonsense ... This should be seen if there is no other thing to understand allusion To everyday life This film is horrifying, suspicious, beautiful and fascinating at the same time. It has Hitchcock's classic mystery and the fear of modern thriller. And it has what horror movies often lack: excellent screenplay
