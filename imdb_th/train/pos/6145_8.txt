Mary Poppins is much better, but this is a lovely movie. Angela Lansbury is a forgetful person like Engletine Price and David Tomlinson has fun as Mr. Brown. Their chemistry is excellent as well. However, the children lack the same spark, although Paul is funny and cute "Beautiful sea" is the best. In fact, every song is unique. Special effects are wonderful, with many magic and the story is original enough. Highlights like Mary Poppins are animated sequences. The underwater sequence is beautiful. But my favorite thing is a football match that is extremely hilarious. The only other criticism is that I didn't get the ending when I first saw it. Overall, it's a lovely movie that almost never happened. 8/10 Bethany Cox
