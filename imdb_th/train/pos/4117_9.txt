"DÃ´ desu ka den" is the first color film of Master Akira Kurosawa and surprisingly not about samurais, ronins, warlords or battlefields. It is in a very poor community in a slum in Tokyo, where residents are nomads, nomads, beggars, nomads, women who are abused, losers. I do not know why Kurosawa chose this sad theme and environment to wear it. But actually they are very sad stories, some people look heartbroken Personally, I like the impressive story of the boy and his father who dreamed of their own home and built by them. The story of a retarded child who believes he is a train pilot. The story of a man raising five children as if they were their own sons and daughters. And the story of a deceased girl by her stepfather My rating is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Dodeskaden ?? O Caminho da Vida" ("Dodeskaden ?? The way of life ")
