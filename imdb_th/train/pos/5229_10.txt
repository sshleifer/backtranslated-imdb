This film received an awesome rating from everyone who voted here. But I'm here to say that if you like movies like Dude Wheres my Car and Dumb and Dumber, this movie is for you. If your movie like Citizen Kane and Casablanca id must surprise you in a different angle Still, I still love this movie and everything about it, even though it's "small". This is one of the few things that I and my friends can watch over the years. Very good movie. This movie should be the number 1 AFIs because of the high level of friggin. The only problem with this movie is that you may have trouble viewing it because it was created for television movies in a channel that is no longer So I don't know how to get this movie. Id like to buy a DVD. But I can't find it I still recorded the tape from the beginning, you can come in if you want and watch it. But i may be sleeping This film shook the industry and that's what you need to know.
