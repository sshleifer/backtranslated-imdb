Moonwalker may not be a movie to watch if you're not a Michael Jackson fan. I'm a big fan and are happy with most movies. The ending isn't great, but the first 50 minutes - if you're a fan <br /> <br /> Personally, I believe that the first 50 minutes can be viewed repeatedly. The dance in each video is amazing. Great music for listening and entertaining conversations. <br /> <br /> There are many of his best videos from Bad and examples from his previous videos. It also includes some concert videos. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of Michael Jackson, this is something to do if you're not a fan / don't like Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> 9 / 10
