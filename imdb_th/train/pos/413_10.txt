Sure that this film is not as accurate as history. But it's a great entertainment. Most DeMille images, especially the later epic, will be slow and padding. But the action here will be moved to the clip This story is a set of shoots with very little quiet moments. This action brought us from the attacks of India on the cabin. One of the best parts of this film with Jean Arthur is excellent while trying to appease the villagers at war. Followed by her and Cooper being brought to the war camp and tortured Later, the protracted battle with Cheyenne All things are ridiculous. But fun and fun from beginning to end Jean Arthur is one of the best actresses of this era and she shines here.
