I've seen a lot of science fiction since the 70s; Some people are horribly bad and some people think that it is really scary and scary. Soylent Green is suitable for the latter category. Yes, sometimes it is a little bit, and yes, it's a good furniture for a giggle or two. But some movies seem to have a flair. Here we have 9 years of movies before Blade Runner dares to imagine the future as a dark, scary and destructive thing. Both Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson did better in this Ten Commandments and Robinson's suicide scene was a terrifying scene of Kekeke and his family. Some attitudes have already happened. (Can you imagine the filmmakers with the concept of "women as furniture" in our 90-second correct political concept?) But it's hard to find a movie from Me Decade. Actually, you think this is one thing Which I like to see on the big screen, because even in the widescreen presentation, I don't think the overall scope of this movie will be due to try it out.
