I found that this movie is very funny. I like that it is built from the politics of modern sports. This movie is not as funny as South Park, but it's funny. And since I'm a sports fan, I like that they enjoy more ridiculous things in sports. This movie is very good for non-sports lovers as well. It may be better for them because they really have to live by wondering why people follow sports so close. I also found that the real game that they created was interesting. It's like a horse with a base and deep thoughts. (For portraits) Overall, I suggest you watch this movie and believe that you will love this movie. However, if this movie is not your favorite, you may not like it. (But that is with any comedy)
