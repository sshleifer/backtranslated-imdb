I agree with "Jerry". It's a very low-cost space movie. (Of course, there is the lowest price that AREN'T does not underestimate.) If I remember correctly, solving the puzzle is variance. Because the computer that controls the spacecraft is a real man and has become a computer And just like HAL, they tried to release his "ideas", but not his mechanical parts, and like HAL, it led to disaster. There are at least one funny time period. When the character of Christopher Carrie, who was unable to find food, found an abandoned bird with a harsh time. But then things that were not obvious did not happen at all.
