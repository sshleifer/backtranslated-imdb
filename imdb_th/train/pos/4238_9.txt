On the surface, this is an average comedy after the war. Under the veneer, it is an actor, a stunt MGM character. The most fun performance. <br /> <br /> The leading actor is straightforward. Margaret Hamilton (aka The Wicked Witch of the West), Edward Everett Horton (hands Occupation - fussbudget) and Sig Ruman (Marx Brothers Nemesis in _Night in the Casablanca_ and _night at The Opera_ are always excellent The gang that is trying to bring the two of them together instead of separating them into their "normal" characters. <br /> <br /> It also makes fun in many romantic comedy sessions. Do not be a romantic comedy that is "straight" more than this, because it is a romantic comedy after the war and the characters in the 2D stock. <br /> <br /> I only saw it. One time with an interruption, so I couldn't be positive. But this movie may be one of the movies that work better in the context of the time it is done. But now viewers "These secondary characters go through" completely different lenses I think this is the case that I gave 9 stars. I think it's hysteria.
