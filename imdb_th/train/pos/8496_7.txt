Wow, for many years I've watched this movie for the last time. Watching in 2008 is different from watching in 1986. At first I didn't think I would do it through Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) So disgusting, arrogant and insulting that I found it difficult to see him He embodied the negative of every American. If that is not good enough, when the best workers of small towns in America show that image is worse. In the opposite spectrum, Japanese people are presented in the form of robotic robots. This movie is not a joke. I'm just hanging there because of the value of nostalgia. And I'm glad I watched. <br /> <br /> Like boxing This movie starts from about three to seven stories that I rate because of the ending. In the end it was excellent You always want a harmonious end, and this is like that. It's great that the city has to work and maintain the factory. But the most special thing is the marriage between Japanese customs and values ​​with American traditions and values. It is an ordinary movie that ends with a reputation.
