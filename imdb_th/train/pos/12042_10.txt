........... Like when I watched this movie) I won't watch this movie again, not because it's a bad movie. But because it makes me so scared! As I said, I was 14 years old when my English teacher decided to show us. The reason for this is that we have read the extract from the book. <br /> <br /> Every girl in my class was TERRIFIED when a woman in a black dress came through the window and floated above Kidd's bed. There are some things that shocked us, when Kidd found a toy soldier under his pillow and he heard the voice of a child saying "For you". That scene still haunts me to this day, almost 7 years after I watched the movie br /> <br /> If you are scared easily, avoid this movie !!!!!!!!
