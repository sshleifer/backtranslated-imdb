Titanic is a classic I was really surprised that the film did not have a total of ten points in the IMDb user rankings. Sometimes it was cool to not give the Titanic credit today. But when it was first created, it was true. When the movie came out, people flocked to the cinema. When it comes out in the video, my sister and I will watch it twice a day for a month. It's safe to say that we are obsessed with good reasons. Some of the difficult scenes can be forgotten, such as immature children or men who commit suicide after killing people in disobedient people. Many people died on that boat and to convey that with the urgency and emotion they needed, it was a hard challenge that James Cameron stepped up. And don't forget the amazing love between Jack and Rose No matter how their relationship is part of someone's imagination, it is cute. They hardly know each other. But they will die for each other They trust each other. They are confident that hell is giving money to Romeo and Juliet. "I won't let Jack go." Titanic is a great movie, which is very important. It is a powerful story told through great performances, great movies, beautiful music and a team full of hard-working and dedicated people. It made me really amazed when someone said that they hate this movie.
