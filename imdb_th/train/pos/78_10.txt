Although it has one of the standard "Revenge Price Plots" But this movie is the favorite of Vincent Price Gallico. The quality is missing in many horror characters. When you watch him feel him, you feel frustrated with his injustice and you cheer him when he goes revenge, even if he scares you with original anger When the movie continues, his character becomes a tragedy. He committed his murder. But now he must kill to hide that And again to cover up one place and again ... your stomach sank with his soul as it was spinning down as if watching the beloved brother Although the story of revenge is old, the planning device is original - Gallico uses his tricks to kill in a more creative way.
