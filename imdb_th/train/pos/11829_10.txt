I watched "Dick Tracy" for many years and because of this, it became an important part of my life - it was with me throughout my childhood and I've seen it often. When viewed as an adult, it is still a very good movie - dark, satirical and incredibly misunderstood. About the only thing that can be said is that Pacino, who has been offered the title - apart from being less talked and doesn't make it very difficult when it comes out. Top but good results because he clearly has lots of fun. Betty is as good as Dick Tracy and the back of the camera can capture the atmosphere of the film Noir comic better than any other movie I may have seen. Just looking at one scene from this film is an amazing story, the lights, the velvet overtones and the smog / smoke combined to create a fantastic effect. <br /> <br /> There is Some really funny pendants, including one by Dustin Hoffman in the name In terms of performances - even the forced child characters are still better than expected. <br /> <br /> Overall, a really good, misunderstood movie over the years since its launch / 10 by The average on IMDb. Critics' criticism is quite good (see RottenTomatoes.com) and after watching the movie again, it's not hard to see why - this is a perfect example of the book's essence Gart Since the style weirdness> <br /> It is highly recommended 4.5 / 5 Stars.
