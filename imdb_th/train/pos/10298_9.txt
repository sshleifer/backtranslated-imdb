I am glad to see Jim Carrey in one of the movies above, not the goal. His character is like all of us. Want more - better things that will happen to us and expect God to deliver. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman creates a great God. With a sense of humor and true love for each of us But still ready to rest on the holidays when there is a chance to present yourself. <br /> <br /> I think Jennifer Aniston's character is too weak. In general, AnnCorman TV wants to be self-centered. But that's the way it was written. <br /> <br /> I think the example would destroy many funny scenes, because everyone who saw them knew what had happened before the birth. > I have read a lot of reviews and it seems that some people look a little too deep. This is a summer comedy and does not mean solving the problems of the world, although there are some messages that we should consider <br /> <br /> funny movies.
