I joined IMDb, so people know that this is a great movie! Often you don't see animated movies and movies. You read the plot, so what I want to say is that I don't see it because you want to see a religious culture that is babbling because that's a misunderstanding that people read instead. Is the story of the father And the son on the increased journey to get to know each other through their struggles Buy it and forward it before the movie enters the round. This is one of the few films that have been nominated for BAFTA, which is an independent and international film. The beauty of it is that it can attract anyone, even if you have never watched anything that has a description or accustomed to a Hollywood formula. Just a wonderful story that will make you participate The only thing I want is to keep it longer and see what happens.
