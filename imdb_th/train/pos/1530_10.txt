Old people show ???? I am 15 years old and watched the show since I was 12 years old. Recorded it on my Sky + box every day from Hallmark and BBC 1. I hope they don't cancel it. They don't have proper leave. But what all those adventures have, I think I see them all and no one can imagine that I don't like and enjoy. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that BBC switched between Murder and 'Murder She Wrote' diagnosis - never viewed and unintentionally However, he has a character in the Diagnoses Murder that is deeply penetrating and the chemistry between the actors is amazing. It's a sad day when they cancel this program ........
