lovely! I saw domestic imports in Philly in October with my children. We all liked it so much that we saw it a second time with my parents. I've never heard them laugh for so many years! This is the first time I remember watching movies that my parents and children can enjoy. It's really cute and we can't wait for it to come out on DVD. They want to create additional movies like importing in the country. It is refreshing to go to see a movie in three generations. Different people can enjoy. I've never seen this cute movie since My Big Fat Greek Wedding. I love Mindy Sterling as a mother. She's still in Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is here too, and he's a hilarious person. I can remember him from WKRP.
