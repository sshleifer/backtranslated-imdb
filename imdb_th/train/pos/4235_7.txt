.... After 16 years, Tim Burton finally disappointed me !!!! Whatever happened to Burton, who read Frank Miller's "The Dark Knight Returns" to be used as a research to prepare Batman back in 1988-89. He has everything wrong! This movie! It's not as good as the original and is not related to the same story as the original. If you want a good monkey movie, see the original <br /> <br /> ** from the star ****
