The design of the movie seems to be Alpha and Omega of some important problems in this country. (United States) We see relationships all over the world in movies. Clearly, students v.s have a teacher But what movies add value to it is other relationships: male vs black white women and social vs. individuals. But the most important of all and in a direct relationship with all other relationships is vs the person he is. <br /> <br /> I was surprised at the perspective of the two directors who expressed their relationship to the university. Most movies show the injustice of one side while showing the suffering of the other. This film shows the injustice and suffering of both parties. It didn't try to show that both methods were correct, even though I said that the skin was showing cruelty and vengeance. (Quite clear until the end) This film also discusses sex and rape. This injustice is a ridiculous story that, in some ways, will bring together two races from time to time. Lawrence Fishburne works superbly as a skilled Profesor Phipps. He fails in the idea of ​​favortism and instead of acting. Showing the equality of the lazy and down with diligence and positive The other stars that created the film were Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Jennifer Connelly. Michael Rapaport gave a wonderful picture of a child who was confused by the misplaced anger looking for acceptance of Tyra Banks, launching her film and proving that A model can act. <br /> <br /> Higher learning gets a name in college performances rather than studying and accepting a piece of paper. In fact, I would say that this movie is a statement that shows that students interact with each other rather than dry books because it is a true study of the university. It is a learning process. Life is not a mental process. I think you will find "Higher learning" is about many important issues in universities and even life in general. 8/10
