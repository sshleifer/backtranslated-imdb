Never seen this film from Nicholas Katzenbach, based on an entertainment novel and taking into account the leading actors in the production, so we decided to watch "Just Cause" while not a horror film using too much freedom with original content That Jeb Stuart was not successful in his treatment A garden is the brutality of the police. After that, the sheriff Tanny Brown and the police officer Wilcox did not show mercy in the strike of Bobby Earl, who was accused of killing white women We were scared of what the authorities had done with the prisoners. <br /> <br /> Then the scene changed. Evangeline, Bobby Earl's grandmother, was sent north to ask Professor Harvard Lawyer. The young man's retirees want Paul Armstrong to protect him. An old woman was convinced that Armstrong would look at this case. He still believes in the innocence of young men. <br /> <br /> Things are not the same as we thought. When Blair Sullivan, the man who served in the same location as Bobby Earl, came out saying that he was involved in the murder of a young girl and changed the dynamics of the case. The way it plays in the movie, it serves to confuse the audience and distracts from Armstrong from the truth. <br /> <br /> This thriller is made fun by the player Sean Connery. Armstrong The famous actor Lawrence Fishburn made a great impression as a sheriff, who, as far as we can see, is that he has guilty of his prisoners. Ed Harris has a great opportunity. To show why he is one of our best actors Blair Underwood, Kate Capshaw, Rudy Dee and Scarlett Johanson have a supporting role. <br /> <br /> This film, despite its shortcomings Whatever
