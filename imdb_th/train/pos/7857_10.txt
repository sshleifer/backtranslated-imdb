This film does not fail to participate and move even in 2008 for viewers who are familiar with modern sound and computer improvement techniques. <br /> <br /> Movie experience In 1922 that can see this In cinemas and other people on their big screen must be truly deep and a pleasant experience. <br /> <br /> One thing that filmmakers have to ask today is making movies. Quiet for two hours and make it interesting Rhythm, structure and balance as far as this film has Creating a silent movie is a pure art. It must pay attention through its structure, direction and performance - no more expansions with words or computer interference. The silent movies that are created or not interesting can not be viewed. <br /> <br /> This film must be taken into consideration for those who may not be satisfied with the mention of Christian themes. This is not a movie 'Christiany' but doesn't sell anything. These themes, along with references to current moral standards, often appear in this era - just like the church on Sunday is a past nation. Christianity has been in most households, so this film is Just drawing the normal life as before. The theme will come true and deep at the time. <br /> <br /> It's the most strange, especially good support for the good Christian thinking of this movie. (And it does not preach religion to everyone, just emphasizing differences Between the hypocrites and the faithful) that in the year 1922 the bishop in the open debate with representatives from the film industry with a large crowd condemned Picford as an example of immorality along with others whom he named NY Times 1922 <br /> <br /> Perhaps they should watch this movie that came out in 1922 and learn some lessons. <br /> <br /> Pastors complained that since the film industry began Christmas arm Attendance reduced 500,000 movie agents in the discussion, however, the following observations; Participation in sedans has decreased and pastors in prison are more than actors (truth) and choosing samples from many people is not representative of all. <br /> <br /> So there Proceed continuously The fight between the church and the film industry in the early days of the movie. <br /> <br /> This film is a great movie about being honest and sincere with friends, family and willing to sacrifice. Mary Pickford is innocent, honest, honest, full of happiness and joy, honesty, humor and quiet sacrifice, even though he is poor and uneducated. However, this is not pushing our necks. But revealed little by little. <br /> <br /> This is a modern Chinese movie that is reminiscent of slow characters. The rhythm that creates a strong connection with the characters Great and must be appreciated that can be done without the benefit of the dialog box usage - it can be done by showing excellent skill and excellent governance. Sometimes it's surprising to know that at the end of the movie, you don't hear the words. But it feels like you hear everything. <br /> <br /> The actors who perform in the great performances, especially Gloria Hope Jean Hersholt and Lloyd Hughes <br /> <br /> The last few minutes are funny. Pickford as she goes outside under the pretense of snow sweeps, the closest balance and end. This is a special humor that should not be overlooked. Chaplin frequently used this device and copied some from Picford. <br /> <br /> Another special observation about silent movies and especially the Picford movie. Is that stars often have to hold cameras for most movies The audience became bored or bored with the actor who revealed too much. Pickford is often the center of attention through most of her movies. But people are not enough. She is a testament to her acting ability.
