Carter Wong plays the noble hero in the search for healing books, which makes him look for the ultimate revenge! The pacing is good in this movie and there are many fighting scenes that make the movie continue. Flying guillotine is evil and the main villain has no problem using them. Although the story is not strong, the action is fun and attracts you to the end. (Which I feel may have a sequel) <br /> Campy and dark. This is a good kung fu skool !!
