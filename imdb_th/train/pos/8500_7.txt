Surprised to see a relatively low score for this film Just saw this movie for the first time in 10 years and was reminded of why I liked it. <br /> <br /> Come back with me, the kids, until the time that Michael Keaton was a comedy and You may find happiness in this movie. It's a gentle comedy that Ron Howard specializes in. But if it is yours, you should try The low-key charm of Keaton is suitable for this project. <br /> <br /> "Gung Ho" is quite outdated because it happened in the last phase of the pre-world economic world. The country where the business is located says that it laughs and lessons how people can learn from each other for great benefits. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie and enjoy it without remembering. Especially the scenes you really like But that's because this film gives a slow but steady laugh. It's like I.V drops. And I mean well.
