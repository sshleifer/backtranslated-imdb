Wow, this is an excellent Italian "ZOMBIE" movie by two great directors Luci Fulci ("ZOMBIE") and Bruno Mattie ("HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD"). Lucio started this movie. Better than I expected, surprisingly if you saw "HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD" directed by Bruno Mattie and if you see "ZOMBIE" directed by Lucio Fulci and like both, or one of the themes, this is the movie you must Look, it has a wonderful "ZOMBIE" makeup witch equal to a fantastic look. "ZOMBIES" has a funny head flying "ZOMBIE"! And "ZOMBIE", a bird that throws you acid and turns you into "ZOMBIE" people), but most of them are just "zombies". Great poison, like in Bruno Matti "Hell of Death" So if you like Italian movies "Zombies" or just the movie "Zombies" in general the movie "ZOMBIE" Italian language!
