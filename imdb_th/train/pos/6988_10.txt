This is a movie that will take time to get out of your head when you see it. The close dialogue is perfect, which is expected to be received due to the adaptation of the play. Actors just make the best, the story is simple and attractive. Pure happiness 88 minutes <br /> <br /> Yvan Attal is credited with his role. Sandrine Kiberlain is still a beautiful blonde girl. (And proud to be like that) and Marina Fois are stupid friends who are always wrong when you expect it to be a little This wonderful and the best thing for future production! <br /> <br /> I hope to have more of these things in production today. If you like, you may enjoy: "Un air de famille" and "Cuisine et dependances". Both were written and played by Bacri / Jaoui pair.
