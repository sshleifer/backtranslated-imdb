It is a simple movie that is not active. But very charming There were times when I saw why Cher won the Academy Award for Best Actress. But there are many times that I wonder why Glenn Close didn't win for Fatal Attraction. However, the Oscars and the Golden Globe and BAFTA awards were nominated for the role of Loretta Castorini, a simple woman who has a low wage job that you Johnny Camello (Danny Aiello) asked to marry him. He promised her that he would return in the next month because his mother was sick, so she wanted his family to attend the wedding as much as possible. The only problem is when she finds Ronnie, the only brother who doesn't shake hands. (The Golden Globe nominated Nicholas Cage) They started to have a relationship and love was born in that moon scene. Also starred in Oscar nominated for Vincent Gardenia as Cosmo Castorini, Oscar, BAFTA and the Golden Globe that won the Olympia Dukakis award, such as Rose Castorini and John Mahoney as Perry. It ended with no marriage for John. Here and Loretta But she and Ronnie are happy together It won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay Writer, direct writing for the screen, and was nominated for Best Director for Norman Jewison (during the night) and the Best Movie Nominated for BAFTAs Award for Dick Hyman and Best Original Screenplay and nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Movie - Best Comedy / Musical and Best Screenplay It's number 96 in 100 years. 100 words ("hurry away!")
