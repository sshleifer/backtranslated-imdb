I'm not sure if this is a masterpiece or a soft fluff that is raised by acting and images. In any case, I'm sure I love it. From creepy twisted stories, interrelated stories to terrifying performances from Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone to bright and flashy colors that everyone can capture, this is a high-level trash and very fun Not to mention the ambiguous and ambiguous sexual feelings that infiltrate the entire movie and often threaten to escape from the image to the conversation. But never did that I will lie if I say that the true entertainment value of the movie doesn't help me love it. But there is something strange in the art that is not intended behind the scenes (Or what is it?) Really funny. I actually dug it. I really entered this melodrama.
