The best role of Arguebly Al Pacino, he played Tony Montana for a short time from Cuba, became a wealthy and powerful criminal in Miami and he did it with two things that he had in this world. And he doesn't break 'em. For anyone starting from working for a big Cuban dealer, Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and hurrying up on the corporate ladder with his old friend Manny (Steven Bauer) in He soon Sexy eyes for his wife's boss Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer), after the threat of Tony Frank comes to his position, he tried to kill Tony, but no luck, Tony upset, and now nothing can stop him. This film has a great role among them: F. Murray Abraham as a terrifying gangster. Another familiar face is Harris Yolin, a crooked cop who tries to shake off Tony Marry Elizabeth. Mastrantonio enters the Ecxellent screenplay by Oliver Stone. This film is one of Brian DePalma's brightest spots. In his long and long career, you can see that this man is very talented. This film has a beautiful look. Pay attention to two memorable scenes: the fancy restaurant scene ("Say good night to the bad guy") Another is the last shot that Tony shows that he still knows how to kick, ass and kill about 20 people who broke into his house. This is one of the most impressive endings for movies I've seen for Al Pacino fans and crime movies. It's not to be missed. For the rest of you, recommend 10/10.
