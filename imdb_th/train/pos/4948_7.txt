This film is a simple, beautifully crafted movie that explores themes and gives what each audience receives from different things. Location is easy: famous actor (Morgan Freeman) decided to research for the upcoming role by going to the store and watching people. He paid special attention to the cashier at the lane "10 items or less" (Paz Vega), which he found to be friendly, strong and curious. <br /> <br /> Both actors played. Well and brought A stable dimension to the characters in what is educational characters. Not general education They each represent the whole world. Life of the cashier stuck in The "real world" is cruel and frustrating while the actor is pinned in his imagination until he can't do simple tasks like remembering phone numbers. He admits that he is facing other people and when researching, the real person shows that he is not one of them. <br /> <br /> But not only is an actor inspired by real people for His work ; We see the reverse process as well. Many characters recognize "him" and refer to the way he inspires them with their movie roles. <br /> <br /> Cashier's favorite song "Al Pasar la Barca" about how women refuse. To hide behind beauty and Prefer to pay instead (eg: work with integrity) instead of the boat can not choose better It corresponds to the character Vega, who is the only employee with a brain or ambition that is willing to work hard to succeed. (This is a dream for people who look like Paz Vega.) It's a strange little movie that should be done on a shoelace. If you don't care about slow walking and "talking", this movie will entertain. The characters are completely different and powerful performances make them love. Look good.
