I like the serial of the Republic that exists! The story is one of the best things I've ever seen! The image quality is not the best, but okay. Fencing in this series is not as good But not bad They should practice more. As I said, the story is great! You are sitting there and waiting to see who is Don Del Oro! Great song! It was the same man who composed the song for Walt Disney's Zorro version. Clothing and buildings are very good. Zorro is really cool and is a soldier! I recommend this serial. Buy it! <br /> <br /> I love Reed Hadley playing Zorro! He is funny, clever and brave! Mark: 6
