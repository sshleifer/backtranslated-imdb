Othello, the classic story of Shakespearen of love, betrayal, lying and tragedy I remember studying this subject in high school. In fact, I found that Othello was probably my favorite Shakespeare story due to the fact that it was interesting. Shakespeare caught Feelings of friendship, love and complete nationality I mean, when you really study this, you can participate in many philosophies as to why Othello is jealous of jealousy in the blink of an eye. But later for my report, I watched this version of Othello and I must say that it is really excellent. Lawerance and Kenneth just capture the story well and understand that it's dark. <br /> <br /> Othello is a soldier. Great in his city, he is loved by everyone, including the king. But when the king discovered that Othello was with his daughter, Desdemona, the king was angry but, except Otello, welcome in the city and made his best friend Cassi. The man in front of Aigo, who stood by Otello Because of his jealousy, he went out for revenge Still pretending to be Othello's best friend. He just hinted to Othello that Desdemona was cheating on him and Cassio never said that they were just making Othello think that it was happening. Othello was insane and had no satisfactory plan. For Desdemona or Cassio and Iago is more than happy to help him out. <br /> <br /> Othello is an incredible story. I encourage you to read. It's an incredible story that makes you think after you read Othello. The movie is still great again and I recommend it again. It captures the story perfectly and has a large tearing sensation or you might be as shocked as what happened. Between Othello and Desdemona, how fast he believes his truth Love will betray him. This is a great movie, a great show, a good set and a good direction. This is what Shakespeare meant when he wrote the story <br /> <br /> 10/10.
