(Spoiler) <br /> <br /> I'm blown away with this movie. I rented movies for a long time and decided to watch this movie. Many boxing movies seem to overflow the blood. In this film, it shows an unfamiliar level. Although I hope that there may be more people interested, maybe she will improve her grades. This film points out the problems that some families face with sex. <br /> <br /> I'm quite worried about the ending. But the ending did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> I thought it was very clear for the position that she would win. The unexpected thing is that both of them come together at the end. <br /> <br /> I like the score for some scenes. Highly recommended <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Entertainment: 10/10 <br /> <br /> Repeat to play: 10/10
