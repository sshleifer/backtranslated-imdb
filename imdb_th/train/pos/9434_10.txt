I remember having watched this movie on TV a few years ago and didn't get fully interested, perhaps missing in the first half, so I concluded that it was boring and ranked. I decided to come back again tonight to see if I missed something. I certainly do This film is one of the most annoying and amazing movies of all time and has a great influence on current movies and maybe forever. I can't believe that this movie is boring! <br /> <br /> Jon Voight and the young Burt Reynolds give performances of their careers and are supported by Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox. This will make you feel disgusted and frightened after you watch it. A truly scary story Oh and I mention that the song is very good as well? Well, and this movie should be watched by movie fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see this movie to experience. Don't expect to go on a picnic.
