"Domino" is widely acclaimed on this website due to its excellent editing style and "scary" photography. The spokesman refers to superficiality and criticism of the deployment. "Above all," I don't agree anymore. I believe "Domino" means the height of Tony Scott's filmmaking career. <br /> <br /> After creating an action movie style In the late eighties and early decades, Tony Scott moved closer to a more personal style movie, as early as "Crimson Tide". His rhetoric to show the world under Of his characters - claustrophobia. And plays that are in conflict on nuclear submarines that embodied the use of long lenses "State Enemy" and "Spy Game" which represent the world of surveillance and espionage in the order of sight. <br /> <br /> "Man On Fire" is an extreme departure. This is Scott using a hand-cranked camera and an ancient flash frame to show the anger of the characters. Although not entirely successful But introduced various techniques used to find the full expression in the "domino" <br /> <br /> lying in the device with the frame of the FBI probe "Domino" presents the life of a silver hunter award Separate parts of memory She grabbed memories when we made flickering pieces and flicked briefly when Domino conveyed her verbal story with Scott's broadcast. But showed only the events she described But also a point of view that guides them. She has "traces of mescaline" in her system, but her individual vision is unusual - that is, a woman who avoids luxury life for hunting. Animals for Bounty <br /> <br /> When Domino begins to relate to events that lead to her captivity at Scott, let it be true. Together with cinematographer Dan Timmins Dale and composer Harry - Gregson Williams and Scott image post-modern contemporary Americana, we gradually began to realize that. Oddly, even though she was a domino, it would not be much more separate than the "90210" culture that she rejected as she walked through Scott. Combining this culture made his audience realize more innocence that destroyed children Which is underprivileged The grandmother introduced Finally, Scott shows their salvation as the only escape route we have from surreal trips. <br /> <br /> Criticizing this film because of its unique style Too much is like criticizing Picasso or Pollock because it does not represent what is human. Like drawing a wonderful image, the meaning of "domino" is in the surface and the surface is everything. <br /> <br /> I'm not involved with Scott for free, but still and always. Would be greatly appreciated for the work of Tony Scott
