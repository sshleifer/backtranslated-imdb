Fräulein Doktor is a good demonstration, no matter how big the film industry in Western Europe has declined in the last 40 years, then in the late 1960s, while the large Hollywood studios were on. The ropes of Italy, France and England opened the film to fill the remaining space from Hollywood's downfall. With a James Bond image (The Doctor is not a surprise in the United States. It was first released at the Century Theater chain in New York, with an afternoon admission fee of 99 cents), Spaghetti Clint Eastwood West (with Fistful of Dollars issued by distributors who have never paid a little for Italian producers) and French crime movies that often go to art houses with exceptions such as the Sicilian tribe. And being produced in Europe, such as Doctor Zhivago and of course Fräulein Doktor. With a great budget for the time and world-class capabilities involved, Fräulein Doktor is good enough for the audience to remember the movie for decades. /> Kenneth More plays the British intelligence officer, Doktor, where he tells the spy that was arrested to talk.

Fräulein Doktor, whose lesbian scene was buried with a cut version of the movie that appeared on the local station through the 80s. <br /> <br /> Kenneth More is more typecast, often a person. That failed when he grew up, especially in the BBC Detective Father Father When he was younger, as in the British Titanic, he played as a British officer who was reserved in Fräulein Doktor. He had more opportunities than I normally remembered. It would be good if my memory of this film was correct about his role and of course the soldiers were wearing gas masks and protective masks in the fight. That is, in some scenes, and Alberto Lattuada shows that he is the director of some people who helped in the espionage of World War 1 movies.
