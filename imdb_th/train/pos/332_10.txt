Although I didn't see this mini-series in more than twenty years, I still remember how the balance between the characters, the plot and the story of the great adventure succeeded The use of special effects is limited to using poetry rather than telling a true story. The two versions that I've seen are voiced. (English and French), but actors seem to speak their own language, not just Italian, so there is a synchronization problem. It does not spoil the story. Among the actors Irene Pappas as Penelope are most known in North America. Recommended for all Odysseus followers who come back.
