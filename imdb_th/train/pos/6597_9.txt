We often watch American movies with their specific accents from each region (South, West, etc.). We have the same here. All foreigners have to watch this movie and have a heart that is open to accepting other cultures except America and Europe, almost dominating the movie industry. <br /> <br /> This movie tells us about the parallel world that It's not 'not even thought of those who live in large cities like SÃ£o Paulo. All actors are very stance and realistic. The camera gives us ideas about a world that is confusing, the loneliness of each character and inviting us to share their world. <br /> <br /> It's a really great movie.
