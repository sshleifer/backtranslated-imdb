It seems that Hal Hartley's movie is a movie that is popular with most audiences. This film is no exception to that rule. Fay Grim served as a sequel to 'Henry Foole' from Hartley in 1998. This interest was at Henry's ex-wife (demonstrating perfection by Parker Posey who welcomed Always) which is being disturbed by the CIA His shady contacts In the meantime, all Faye ended up with Odyssey dealing with foreign spies, etc. This movie is quite submerged in the second half. If you've been a fan of Hal Hartley in the past, this is something you shouldn't miss. For the first Hartley novice who had just heard his movie making techniques, you might want to watch his previous movie before filming this story. (Especially if you haven't seen 'Henry'), I appreciate the camera's work, which sometimes reminds me of early Man Ray photography.
