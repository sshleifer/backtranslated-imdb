This is another favorite fantasy from Ralph Bakshi; After watching on YouTube, that is, located in the distant past, after the Ice Age, it is the quest for swords and magic, prehistoric art between good and evil, Nekron, the ruler of the ice kingdom and Queen Juliana, his mother. Have set their sights to conquer the known world When their glaciers destroyed the village of Larn, he vowed to take revenge on his people and kill the ice lord. At the same time, the subordinates of Nekron and Juliana capture Princess Teegra, the daughter of King Jarol, the fiery heat of Firekeep; But she escaped and eventually met Larn, who promised to take her back to the firefighters. If the sub man does not find them first, <br /> <br /> This movie has very little box office. (Like most of Ralph Baxy's movies) but became a classic cult for the quality of movies The art of collaboration between Ralph Bakshi and the famous artist Frank Frank Frazetta. In addition, I have heard that the screenplay was written by Jerry Conway and Roy Thomas. The two men who made the Conan comic book and the painter behind the scenes included James Gurney, novelist, Dino Toopia Although accepted, I never read Conan or Dino Toopia. And also as a painter, Thomas Kinaid, famous for his art work for the music box carving for The Bradford Exchange Company. And like Bakshi's movie The Lord of the Rings and American Pop, this movie is a spin But the process works better in this film than in the past. <br /> <br /> So overall, I think it's one of the best animations. A fantasy movie that has been created and an excellent collaboration between two great minds - Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta, full of fantasy, sexual satire and exciting adventures.
