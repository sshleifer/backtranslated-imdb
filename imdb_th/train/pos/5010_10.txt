Streisand fans are familiar with her work from the film FUNNY GIRL. Next, watch this show to see what Streisand WAS - WAS - the best actress before her goal of becoming a movie star. Never had a female singer like you before and no longer (Sorry Celine - only your dream!) But Streisand will never sing again with vitality, energy and above all, ENTHUSIASM and VULNERABILITY. She performed here - when she went to the Central Park Concert for only 2 or 3 years later, she filmed FUNNY GIRL in Hollywood and her acting style became less and more booked. Let's face it: more angry) - There is a barrier between her and the audience. Live performance is not something that she is really happy - she does because she knows that it's her ticket to Hollywood, and when she doesn't have to do it, you do it as little as possible. (And oh, the fear on the stage in the legendary excuses!). <br /> <br /> Her vocals here and at Judy Garland. Previously, her performance was unbelievable: Streets He was able to create a new old song again, and songwriters such as Richard Rodgers and Harold Arlen loved her. But in the 1970s Streisand tried to become a "rock" singer. Her album rode to an old audience. Less than by the shrieking of unreliable songs <br /> <br /> In the 80s, she came back with "Broadway album" is great, but anyway, and continues on what has to be struggling to get the way "they" tell her not to do it. Etc. Oh, please. - When someone tells Streisand what to do? She should have done good things at all times, bringing the audience to her level instead of looking forward to what she thinks young people want (the sequel of "Back to Broadway" is not as good as Streisand seems to feel the need to be. Improve the work of other songwriters: If he is still alive at the time, Richard Rodgers will remember him. "Enchanted Evening"? Rodgers, notorious for the singer's work to play with his melodies without a doubt after Streisand sings what he wrote! She also exploded Michael Crawford from the CD in "Music of the Night" - apparently reminding him that there is a CD. Why do you insist on playing music that is accompaniment and singing on your own and non-accompaniment and singing songs as Your partner and other people that you have reduced?) <Br /> <br /> Judy Garland took Streisand side by side and told her that "Don't let them do to you what they do with me." Streisand's advice had no time to pay attention - even though she certainly objected. Looks like it's always your way or the highway. Just imagine. - She told CBS Brass how to make her first TV show - no one guest. <br /> <br /> But no one can argue with The results are obvious here. Treat yourself to this wonderful musical phenomenon before you become a legend - you'll be surprised by the difference. <br /> <br /> PS - I watched it again last night. This (12/01) after not seeing it for many years - it's better than I can remember! The first show starts with "I'm Late" and includes "Make Believe" and "How Taste Wine" and the respect for Barbra's childhood, "I'm Five" - ​​it's the point. Excellent when Streisand appears full (and I mean FULL), an orchestra to sing "people" - she's not bored with music, and even though it's a shorter song But it was quite bad - compared to her "auto-pilot" version later. Scene 2 (after "kooky" Streisand's schtick-patter that has not changed much over the past year) is a Depression music series. That is famous among the extravagance of Bergdorf-Goodman <br /> <br /> The 3rd Act is a stunner - calling it "Streisand, the Orchestra, and the Audience" (although we have never seen an audience who saw this historical event) with fear that She has an audience and doesn't like the performance. This may be the hardest part for you. But if so, her credit will not show her tears through "lovers come back to me" and the torch "when the sun comes out" (although I can't remember when ordering!), Painful "Why am I Choose you? (One of my all-time favorites, Streisand performances) and a mix of FUNNY GIRL songs, including (certainly not) "Don't Rain on My Parade" and my favorite song from the score "The Music that makes me dance "Explain that" Fanny Brice sang that kind of song in 1922 and it gave her a Broadway award. "Streisand sang" My Man "and it was almost a dress code for rendering. Her screen in the movie FUNNY GIRL. Dress here without sleeves. - Her film set has long sleeves and with a black background, all we see is her hands and face), but the vocals here have an urgency and charge more than her film core later on. With Streisand and nothing related to Fannie Bryce who, of course, never sings in all nner styles, as Streisand did here or in movies - see THE GREAT ZIEGFIELD for a glimpse of the version There's more complicated Brice) The show ended with Streisand singing "Happy Days Are Here Again" /> <br /> In the credit when I say <br friends with me, too. "You've never done anything better!" <br /> <br /> And she's twenty-three years old!
