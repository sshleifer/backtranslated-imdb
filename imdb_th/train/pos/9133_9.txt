I am a child who has known many princes. But in the last few years I have seen the strange purple T-shirts of Purple and I think they are cool. But I don't want to buy a shirt that I don't know So one Saturday came to Fuse and I decided to watch. I don't know what this movie is about before I watch it. But it was great when I discovered In the movie The Prince is not known as the Prince, but is a "boy". All performances are wonderful for me. But my favorite thing is Purple Rain, Darling Nicki and I will die for you. All songs tied to what happened in the movie when his mother and father fought the song when the pigeon cried, explaining how he felt. I like the wise prince in the way he flirts with Apallonia. I like when Prince and Appallonia meet for the first time in the club and he stands behind her and when she turns back, he disappears! Great movie and now I can't even find one of those tee shirts :(
