Like the psychological analysis of the movie, but Psycho gives a better sound as a header Men who care for movies (The narrator, if you want) Show your own movie. Mostly classic But all are on the list at IMDb and I suggest you watch (Especially Hitchcock movies, Solyaris, Lynch conversations and movies) because Slavoj Zizek will reference them! <br /> <br /> In other words, he may cause you to lose. I do not remember that he lost more than the shows I performed. (I think the Chaplin movie as well) But as I wrote it would be best if you watch them all in advance! In the IMDb list, there are missing movies that I report to them, so it may be there soon. It's a Meg Ryan movie, but it's just a short example. There are not many offers. <br /> <br /> Zizek's perspective and opinions are crazy and fun to listen to if you open your mind to see things through Another view (Although it will destroy your favorite movie a bit for you ... It doesn't mean it will do that but can)!
