Kirk and the crew landed on an isolated planet where the sun was about to explode. They intend to evacuate residents. But finding abandoned places, except Mr Atoz, who operates some advanced technology libraries Although trying to get answers from him directly about everyone's address, Atoz ignored the question and confirmed that they must 'Make quick choices while still having time.' They don't know what they're talking about. But wandering about looking at a disk that looks like a mirror shining his way to the audience and they see the image of the planet's past Then, while the disk was in the view, Kirk ran through the entrance and was sent back to an astonishing time on Earth. It looked like Louis XIV's time (1660s) when McCoy and Spock tracked the disk Different in the viewer and they are sent to the ice age Everyone is too late. They know that the library is a time travel and storage. <br /> <br /> While Kirk's visit is quite short and unexciting, Spock and McCoy are very important. For Mariette Hartley - sent to this terrible place as punishment The scene with the spock is especially interesting and unusual for people with normal reasons. <br /> <br /> Spike leaves the normative script that is fiercely creative and the location is very diverse. It's a very special scene. <br /> <br /> The best male actor, Ian Wolfe, plays Mr. Atoz. I am a big fan of old movies and saw him as a sponsor and a bit of a player in the movie. Countless in the 30s Each age 40, and he looks almost like he does now from 1969. Interestingly enough even to see another 23 year old - died at the age of over 95 years !!
