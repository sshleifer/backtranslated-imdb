The Titanic movie makes it more than "The Night of Remembrance" It writes a tragic historical event that is always spoken and will never be forgotten. Why was it criticized? I don't know. Can do / They will create movies like Titanic that are moving and touching every time you watch. Can they change the masterpiece like this? Almost impossible. <br /> <br /> The director has no doubt had a huge impact on the film. Simple disaster movie (Boring to watch) converted into unbelievable love Yes, I'm not a Romance type, but I shouldn't bother you because you will never see such love. Guaranteed! Everything for amazing effects, music, great performances. <br /> <br /> Movies create amazing images and great feelings. Everything looks realistic and alive. Her own legend, "Titanic", has been shown superbly in all classes, including accommodation styles. Acting is the true result. Dicaprio and Winslet are the best chapters in this chapter. No one can do better than this. Partly the reason why this movie is so great. <br /> <br /> I guess it's not saying much. The plot is simple. Great performances are based on real stories. Maybe more than half of consumers who watch movies will share tears with an unexplainable end. If you haven't watched this movie, you'll miss Hesterical and the Hollywood movie that will create Hollywood. Will it be better? No. The most moving movie of all time doesn't listen to the audience by yourself. You will understand the observation point (don't be surprised if you cry too).
