I am from Belgium and therefore my English writing is quite poor. Sorry ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the little-known movies that played only once on TV and seems to have disappeared. Weather. I browse my old VHS video collection and found this name. I searched and had an IMDb score of more than 7/10 which is considered quite good. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that it is. Good movie collection and that's why I'm confused. This is the only film directed by this director ...? Why did he not make a lot of movies after this story is quite good ...? Many potential people should be forced to create another movie. Haha ;-) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I want to see that he pulled out his performance together .....?
