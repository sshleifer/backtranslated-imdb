I think you have to come from the United States to get a lot of jokes, but if you like Princess Bride and Forest Gump, you want this movie You cannot compare the quality of the shooting with certain things. But having a trip photographer is a clear action. Killer tomatoes are a hundred times better than Nepalese dynamite. Just my opinion I'm sure people from France won't appreciate the French caricature. Therefore, this movie is not intended for audiences around the world. And while I'm not a trained film critic, I know what I like. I can't stop laughing at all. My side and my jaw were hurt at the end of the movie.
