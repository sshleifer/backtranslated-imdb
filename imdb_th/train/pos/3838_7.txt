THE FOURTH MAN (Paul Verhoeven - Netherlands 1983) <br /> <br /> The movie is based on a novel by Gerard Reve, which works best as a thriller. It's quite surprising that the Reve considerations require about a hundred pages for planning and tension, the last thing I think of when reading his work. <br /> <br /> "The Fourth Man" is the heaviest symbol. In general, Paul Verhoeven is obsessed with proving what most critics are enemies and I'm not sure that he is trying to prove anything. He often insulted the audience and told his story in an unpredictable way. He distracted from the original concept or the story quickly and almost seemed to forget what had to be seen on the screen and what had to be left in "The fourth man" He is not clear in the details of the plot of sex and nudity. (There are many) But in most of his films, it seems that the audience won't get it and the hammer house. Stories with clear, revealing symbols mixed with shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes There is almost no scene that has no sex or full nakedness. Most of it is ridiculous and in your face. It destroys a good story. <br /> <br /> However, when you can handle Verhoeven's clear satire, it's a thriller Many fun times with interesting planning and performances around Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabb√© <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 7/10
