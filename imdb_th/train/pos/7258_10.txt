I was lucky enough to get a copy of the DVD of this movie recently and now watch it for the second time. The 1st time is a late night TV in Australia 20 years ago. But I can't forget this strange and cool movie. <br /> <br /> There are not many people who like this movie because it's not unusual - the fact that there is no dialogue in this position - we just Hear the idea of ​​the character - it's just an exotic aspect. <br /> <br /> Find a copy of this movie. I found that the producer is The main actor died. It was not stored in the British television archives or any movies that it had never been released on video or DVD. Television networks around the world were left in the trash after their copyright. Run out of When it first appeared on TV in Australia, there was no recordable device for consumers. <br /> <br /> In the second look, I recently saw why it was memorable. Sometimes it is too stressful and uncomfortable like the Harold Pinter stage. <br /> <br /> Again, if anyone wants to get this DVD, please email me and I'm sure we can do something with respect.
