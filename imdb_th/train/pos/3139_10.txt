These things have various results `Go back to Mayberry 'despite the idiot. But it's okay `Go back to Green Acres 'As an offensive (Eddie Albert uses words for scripts that I won't repeat here. But both the movie and the foul Will be weak Sometimes folly appears in a script that knows too? And in comedy, it is almost fatal for the character to know that they are funny There are new characters that are not suitable for the mix. Essentially, these reunions are relatively weak. The second series of shows is a genre in which the actors put the past on their side, but sit around telling stories, reminiscent of alternating events after the show.

This show has repeat actors for their old characters; Young actors playing movies about creating performances; Western actors and wards remember that; And a new movie with the real Adam West, who played Adam West, who has degenerated. It has everything if you like old-fashioned performances. This is a bottle on the bottle.
