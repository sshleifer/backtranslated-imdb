Classic series that should be repeated or released at least on the DVD by Bill Toth after knowing that he was adopted after the death of his parents, began a journey to find his true parents after various rituals. Discovering that his father's identity was stolen and used by human traffickers in Europe! If I remember correctly, the dress would end at the Austrian ski slope (?) And the ski slopes on the cliffs, which caused the death of the traitor to the Billys. Incredibly, with episodes crossing into the realm of film noir and thriller crime, the main arc is often overshadowed by parts of life at Billy. Find the secrets of his mother and father. Actions in class but underrated and forgotten.
