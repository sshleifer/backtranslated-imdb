"COSBY" in my opinion is CBS Hits! I'm not sure I have never seen every time But i still enjoy it It's hard to say which one I like. In addition, I really like the song. If you ask me, even if I like everyone, it would be good if Madeline Kahn didn't go through the show. Since then, I wonder what the program will be. Everyone always gives good performance. The production design is excellent. The costumes are well designed and the writing is very strong. In conclusion, although it can be seen on TBS, now I suggest you catch it in case it goes out in the air.
