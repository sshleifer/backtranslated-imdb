There are other reviews here, so I don't need to say how wonderful it is or what it is about ... My point is: I've heard about this movie a long time before it was taken. Come to show I can't even remember. I just knew it through the internet. The supplier performs before it hits! For a number of months I got a motorcycle and complained. Please note that on this page there is a link to buy this movie and the area that is highlighted is VHS at Amazon.com in Germany. You can use Babelfish's Alta Vista to translate. I know it's a PAL format and they change the text. On the screen in German and there is a small subtitle at the beginning that has also been dubbed in German! If you want to watch this movie and you have nearby places that make the conversion worthwhile! It costs about twenty dollars or so to go to the United States from Germany. Believe me, it may seem like a lot to spend time with movies. But if you enter the movie industry, you will have to lose money left and right to receive conversions for your friends!
