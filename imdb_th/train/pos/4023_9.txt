This is a very well-made movie. The script and camera performance are excellent. The music is also good, even though it was the beginning of the movie when things were still cheerful. There were no real superstars in casting, although many were familiar. All actors do a great job with the script. <br /> <br /> But it's hard to see because there is no good end to the situation as shown. It is now popular to accuse the Anglican and Muslim Muslims to split up and split them into two brutal countries. There are some advantages in this view. But it is true that no one forced the Hindus and Muslims in the region to abuse each other when they were doing at the time of division It seems that the British will see the tension between religion and smart enough to take advantage of their own end. <br /> <br /> The result is cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is Extremely unpleasant to remember and watch on the screen But it never painted like a black and white case There are wickedness and exaltation on both sides and it is also a hope for change in the younger generation. <br /> <br /> There is a redemption of the sort at the end when Puro must choose heavily between men That destroyed her life But still truly loves her and her family who rejects her then come to her later But at that time, she had no choice that would be extremely painful for her. <br /> <br /> The film presents a message that both Muslims and Hindus have serious flaws and both can be honored. The reality of partitioning makes that perception more fully possible because there is no real reconciliation across the Indian / Pakistani border. In that respect, it is similar to "Mr & Mrs Iyer" <br /> <br /> In the end, we're glad to see this film, although the resolution will break down. If the United Kingdom and the United States are able to deal with their racial history in a straightforward manner, they will certainly improve.
