I love Tudor Chirila and maybe that's why I like movies a lot. Two days before the movie premiere, I went to see his concert. I saw the preview and the video "zmeu" before the movie and I thought I thought everything .. I was wrong: instead of a good movie, I helped one great man! I feel that the movie is sad .. it's funny .. but the most important is the love picture .. I can't even describe the soundtrack .. so I won't :) I'm not a movie critic .. I can ' t explain in other words .. my vague explanation is all due to playing left, i say .. thanks god for the keyboard :) thanks Giurgiu Tudor Thank you Maria Popistasu thanks Ioana Barbu and thanks TUDOR CHIRILA Encore!
