'The Luzhin Defense' is a good movie that has a good central performance. But there is too much in the novel and not enough that the work of the filmmakers will shine through Feeling that most movies that the characters just helped push the story Marley Norris may explore Lucin's mind instead of showing that he is an innocent victim who is tortured and torn from the brutal motives of others. The screen is a particularly difficult task. A novel written in the early 20th century. This film is not deep enough to the relationship between Luchin Shin and Natalia. The divide of Natalia and her mother contrasts with the mother rather than the flash point in the movie. I felt that I was tortured by the torture of Lucin and ended up in a tragedy in the end without getting happy from his unusual and complex personality. However, this is an animated and entertaining movie. But it's not a great movie
