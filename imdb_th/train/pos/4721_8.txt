The tragic story of B-17 pilot Brady was shot over the occupied territory. Local farm owners help him to be considerate and protect their lives. I have never heard of this before and it hindered me for two hours. After the film ended, I'm glad I spent time. It is the whole story that tells the character of Brady's face at the beginning of the movie.
