This is a short friendly Casper Ghost from my childhood and I watched on YouTube again (Thank God! For You Tube); After that, I liked this shorts and it was one of Casper's favorite shorts. <br /> <br /> I like the way the shorts start like ghosts with annoying narration. Of Frank Gallop until we saw Casper sitting at his grave in the cemetery. While every ghost rose from the grave to "Boo", Kasper decided to go out and search for friends. But in trying to find friends who saw Kasper running away Casper is terrible, sitting on the log and crying. Until a little puppy came up, he was clumsy Casper and the little fox hurriedly bound and he quickly named Ferdie the puppy and thought he was his best friend. <br /> <br /> Casper and Ferdie's relationship is in danger. However, when Casper was not interested in Ferdie while they were playing Hide and Seek while Ferdie hid the hunters and his two hunting dogs and tried to kill the little Ferdie and Ferdie ran fast at For As far as possible, until he began to choke and gasp. While the hunters were shooting gunfire towards Ferdinand Casper, he noticed that they were trying to kill him and flew in the direction of the hunter and pleading that the hunters would leave the firs alone. And hunters and dogs are afraid of Casper Casper shouted to Ferdie, the hunter and the dog disappeared and everything was fine. But Casper saw that Ferdie's body wasn't moving and asked if he was okay. When Casper saw Ferdie's death, he began to mourn for the pain because he lost. "The only friend he has had in his life." Casper returned to the cemetery where he buried Ferdinand and made him a grave beside Casper's grave. Kasper still mourned in pain until he saw that Ferdie had resurrected himself like a ghost. Ferdie began to lick Casper on his cheek. Casper screamed with joy because he had reunited with Ferdie again. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was very short. But surprisingly disturbing, showing death in a family-oriented cartoon -
