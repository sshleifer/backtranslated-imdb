This is one of the best comedy / drama songs I've ever seen. (And since I'm in the age of 40, now and when I see this, I'm not an expert now. But I have watched all the well-known movies) when a lot of actors have been leaders in a matter of minutes. Usually comedians often interfere with musical pieces and often pieces of music interrupt the flow. Of comedians Call me with a crazy mood. But when I saw this in TCM Europe, I laughed out loud with pleasure! Who is laughing for me? There is no doubt that Mischa Auer helped to give me a shocking laugh. He also steals the ending. It's great! When talking about this, I think why this movie is because even though L & H is a selling point (and why I try to watch this movie (They and Hal Roach) I love them in the first things of Hal Roach) at least and in the adult fare (According to the standards of 1930 and not far from today's standards if you read between the lines) Jack Haley is still a follower. I admit that I only knew him from WO OZ and I loved him there and I laughed out loud at his waiter on the list. Patsy Kelly is the only "ugly" girl in the 30s movie that has made me a reality. (There is something telling me that you have to be open in real life); And the musical numbers are truly professional production quality (Busby Berkley'ish), which makes me different from what I used to be in this category I can go on But rest assured that I'm really happy with this movie. 8 out of 10. I saw it in TCM Europe and will record it to see again with my wife in TCM USA. Good thing!
