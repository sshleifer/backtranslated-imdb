This TV drama is one of the things I love when I was a child. Although I can see it now through the gray, pink glasses of nostalgia, I can still say that it is a very quality educational program but still funny. I have not seen the original French version in Swedish only. I don't know how good the dubbed it is. It's too long to remember. <br /> <br /> The evidence of the show is to show you how your body works. I swear the school hasn't taught me half of what I know from this list. It's linked to other things, such as what happens if you eat foods that are not healthy and do not exercise with good examples within the body. Who wants to have another chocolate bar when you know that a small virus tank can invade you? : D cartoon looks good, kids are definitely friendly But with caution, cells, viruses, electrical signals in the brain, antibodies and other things are displayed with a smiling cartoon that looks like you expect what they should be in a moving body. <br /> <br /> This series is about history. (Especially the terrible ending to the environment) is an important part of my childhood I am very happy that I found them here.
