Every episode that the movie advertises itself is scary or scary. Most modern horror movies in this category They scared you to a level that you never met. <br /> <br /> "Halloween" is a movie like this. Must take many risks to make most movie makers cringe But almost all of them work. "Halloween" is a game that inspires simplicity and horror. Overall, <br /> <br /> The story is simple. Laurie Salvation (Jamie Lee Kerr Baptiste, raising a child on Halloween night, while a madman was fleeing from a psychiatric institution after brutally killing his sister 15 years ago. Of course, a madman known as Michael Myers started killing local teenage people and eventually He After Laurie <br /> <br /> sounds familiar, right? Just another silly slasher filled with stupid and bloody teenagers, not an opportunity. <br /> <br /> I think James Berardinelli made it perfect in the review of "Halloween:" "because of its Halloween name. Therefore being grouped with other splash films in the late 1970s and early 1980s. However, while Halloween was considered correctly as the father of the modern slasher type, it was not a member ... "<br / > <br /> The point is, and for a number of reasons, first it was scary, seriously, while most items in a teen slasher genre fore gore - fests (One could argue that many of the latest tongue-in-cheek. But most fail as well) Secondly, almost no violence (Very little is blood) John Carpenter knows that violence is not as scary as it is and he relies on it very little. (In fact, the body is very small) In fact, we can confirm that this is not really a horror movie, at least not according to the standard of having the most deaths that can be crushed into a single movie. Each has more levels and sadistic He relies on ideas for fear and skill. Third, while some characters may do stupid things (Which sometimes sealed their fate) The characters are real people, so instead of thinking that the characters die because they are stupid people, we are afraid because they make mistakes. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons that makes "Halloween" is scary is because it's easy. To believe that it is real There is nothing difficult to swallow in this movie. There is no supernatural thing, there is no element of an ironic plot or murder, "invent" or whatever. But all the set parts and the camera can be used (Record the opening sequence) instead of easily. Carpenters just set the camera in place and say action. What we get is the feeling that we see the murder happening in front of us. <br /> <br /> Horror movies are probably the hardest movie to do because in order to have something scary. Must be perfect and the idea will not work twice It's a hit or miss game, which is why if I have to tell you all the good ideas that Carpenter has (which I can't) they will look as original. Over the years, <br /> <br /> The performance here is not a positive point because it doesn't have to be. This is a film about horrible ideas, not movies about incredible characters and conflicts. Actors act like real people, not characters from the story. Nothing more The exception is the The Shape player, later known as Michael Myers. It's scary to have people say nothing and just kill. But it's hard to pull out (And even more difficult to prevent people from asking why) but the guy pulled it out and the results were horrible. <br /> <br /> This is the movie of Carpenter all the time. He directed, wrote, co-created it, and wrote a cool score of it. This is a wise man and his next movie, "The Thing", supports this message. Although The Thing is not as scary as "Halloween", unfortunately, his success is greatly reduced as it happens when temptation. A lot of money for freedom that is less than that has been used by the big manufacturers once. As good as this movie, it's not without flaws. The famous opening scene is disturbing. But not very scary And not much fear for the first part of the movie Not that it's not good, it just doesn't have a good reason to be afraid. "Shape" Fortunately, carpenters spend most of their time creating relationships between the characters and the audience. While there is no intimacy in this relationship, it is suitable for the purpose. We grew up to know the characters. But not so much to discourage when they die But when the movie comes to Halloween night, that is when Carpenter sends high gear items and will not stop until the end. <br /> <br /> While "Halloween" may have mistake It's a terrifying movie and must watch for anyone who loves horror. Be warned that this movie will scare you with life in you!
