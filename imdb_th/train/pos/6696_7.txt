When I first started to watch these things, it became one of my favorites. Melissa Joan hart is a funny and talented person like aunt and other characters and stars of the show. Salem the cat. The first season in my opinion is the best thing that Sabrina is a teenager in a high school that adapts to the witch's life. They are the most fun, the most fun and the best ... Uh, I'm not a fan when they start introducing Brad and the dreamer because I rather like Valerie. But they are ok. The problem is that they are only in one season. If you have new people, at least keep them. I don't like Josh, he is a tw * t. I like Harvey. But then he disappeared And they eliminate Libby! It would be great if you quarreled in the last seven years. And Mr. Crave, too, if he and Zelda marry, that would be gold! Then Sabrina moved out of her aunt's house and entered the house of Roxy / Miles / Morgan. I don't like these people either. It doesn't seem like they like Sabrina. Sabrina seems to have lost his charm and things and it seems that her aunt is cut off from her life. I stopped watching it for a while and then came back to run again and I was like booing! Haha. I have to say that the past few seasons are terrible. They eliminate the aunt who is sucked because they are an important part of the performance. Suddenly, she let two independent people move into a beautiful house when they treated him like earth. And now she is working at some magazine stores, so they brought the famous guest star into the show if they were in every episode. It was ruins. The program just falls down really and loses luster. I saw the last episode. It has an aunt in it (Zelda was dropped as a candle) and she is getting married. But she eventually ran out with Harvey. I want to know what happened after that. My review is good and the only thing I can say is that the only thing that is worth it is to attract myself through seven years, namely Salem the Cat.
