Yes, the camera is in the right place at the right time. It is very interesting to see that world leaders (such as Chavez) who support the poor in their country can be placed in low esteem in the United States. In my opinion, his worst "sin" is to care for those on the bottom of the tank. What is bad about that? I received attention from the US government + media reaction to Fidel Castro. At first, Castro was a good person (about 1959) when he replaced Batista. However, Castro soon changed the company in Cuba to rely on the needs of the poor instead of the fat cat. We are a good country. But why does our media and government have problems with sharing with the poor? If these are "dictators", we can use more "dictators", especially in the places where the poorest people live in the world.
