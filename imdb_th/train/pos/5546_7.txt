Some people say that this is the best movie that the PRC has ever sold. I'm not as sure because I have a lovely place in my heart for some of their mysteries. I would say that this may be one of the most special movies that they or other studios, no matter how big or small the story. <br /> <br /> Simple story. The ghost of the seaman who had been illegally executed had returned to the swamp to kill everyone who punished him and closed all their spring. In this mix, the granddaughter of one victim who is a current navigator She took over the ferry business as the ghosts approached the people you love. <br /> <br /> Covered with thick fog and located on a single swamp forest, this is a musical poem rather than a general documentary To The rhythm of the conversation, especially in the first scene, is the rhythm of the poem for them. Similarly, there is a similar rhythm with the camera's work as it travels across the swamp as if crossing over the door between life and death, innocence and guilt. This movie reminds me of opera, oratorio, or musical material rather than ordinary horror. It is an amazing movie creation that may not be unique in movie history. <br /> <br /> This is not a guild lily creation. This is a horror / cheap puzzle that tells a little story that will keep you entertained. The story of love and revenge is important here, not the creation of movies, poems, and paying attention to you first and foremost. (The technique is just dressing with windows) If there is a real flaw, the fog creates emotions. But it hides the fact that this swamp exists all in a dry place Going back and forth is constant, that's fine. But after 58 minutes, you hope that we will see something else. <br /> <br /> Don't understand me wrong. I like this movie very much. It's a good little movie that I think the desire is a little less poor. It's worth watching if you find it.
