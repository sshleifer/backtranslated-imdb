ScareCrow is from the most fun killer I've ever seen! Including the most bounce, when he jumps around, which is awesome! He also has a great voice. I mean, it's perfect for him. The story is also great. I like the spirit of the children being moved to the wonderful ScareCrow! In addition, he has a reason for killing all I mean after what those people do to him ..... I'm angry with ScareCrows. His appearance made him a "OMG!" Reaction when they saw him! Which is a wonderful thing, staring at him as a joke! Those people are stupid to stare for a long time! They should look and run for their lives ... even if they don't make a difference!
