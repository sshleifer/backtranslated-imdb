This is a great movie. As a Canadian that grows with the rural lifestyle, most are familiar with winter, canoeing, hunting and other things. It's easy to be familiar. But after watching this film a few times, it made me grow up. <br /> <br /> The story of Gray Owl is well known to many Canadians who have received Attenborough credit for expanding the story. /> <br /> Brosnan shows very complex people. Annie Galipo is loved in her first chapter. The remaining actors are strong.
