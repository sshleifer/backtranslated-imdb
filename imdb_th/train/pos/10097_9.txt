One of the first OVAs ("original video animation") that I bought here still must be one of my favorite anime. A sci-fi movie about sci-fi, cyberfin and the background of pollution in the near future in a dystopian society. <br /> <br /> Dominion's "hero" is a tank police born with a philosophy "If we can't overcome crime We will get a bigger gun "and who is like the name, suggesting to patrol the city in a tank instead of a patrol car and those who are more dangerous than real criminals? Trying to catch Most if not all of these cops are borderline (?) Psychosis and neuroscience gives new meaning to the phrase "Loose cannon" <br /> <br /> Equally colorful and amusing is their enemy (wo). The Twin Cat Sisters, which seems to be alive, are related to giving the Tank Police difficult. <br /> <br /> Animation is not an art. But it is very good The colorful palette and the cartoon character of the character and Mecha fit into the funny atmosphere of Dominion. <br /> <br /> English dubbing is fun again. The soundtrack of the English version is also very good. I wonder if they used to make the soundtrack album of that story. <br /> <br /> However, the Dominion Tank Police is great. It is a Japanese cyberpunk SF with lots of comedies and characters. The most perfect situation ensures that it will not take seriously. Highly recommended
