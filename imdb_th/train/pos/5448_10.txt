This movie is probably my favorite movie forever. Miriam Flynn is great like Bunny Packard Zane Buzby while Delores is a comic genius The remaining actors are great and this movie is really funny. A horror movie that is clear and fun. If you enjoy comedy in the evening, then rent this classic. You will laugh all the way!
