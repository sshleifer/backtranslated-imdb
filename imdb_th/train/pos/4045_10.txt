I am very glad that I had the opportunity to see a rare little gem of this movie. I saw it at the independent film festival, so don't expect it to come to your city anytime soon. During the movie, I noticed about 10 people got up and walked away. Too bad for them. (Down here in the south, people don't want to read the subtitles) The movie starts slowly. But full of dialogue that I never felt bored When the action finally arrived, I found myself staring at the screen as if I was riding a roller coaster. <br /> <br /> I also played a big role that appeared before the script, especially the people. Recommended The characters that appear on the screen It reminds me of Zelda (Ocarina of Time) when you face a boss. <br /> <br /> If this is the future of the movie, "Video Games / Comic Books" I'm also happy
