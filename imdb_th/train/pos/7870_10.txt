This film shows how society is without compassion and selfishness. There are many characters and all the characters represent different types of people. There is no good character and 100% morality which is different from the hero of the general Indian movie and does not have 100% bad characters. different This film is the perfect combination of emotions, drama and entertainment. For the first time I like movies that ask questions about society. I would like to recommend everyone to watch the movie Madhavi Sharma, a journalist covering the most popular groups of Bollywood for page 3 of the newspaper. But this is the story of her becoming a crime journalist in a newspaper. But this is not all. It shows that she can't survive there, and when she saves some innocent children, her voice is merciless. Even though she was fired from work Then she could not find a job as a crime reporter and had to act again, not only her. But there are a lot of characters blending in movies and everything gives a different feeling while watching movies. I would like to congratulate the director who created this great movie. Please don't miss it.
