... but I like this program anyway I have read previous comments, some reviewers have to say about this program and I have a difficult time removing all criticism in my head. (Except one: the list is outstanding) This program is anything but old) many things that people have problems with this show are in money: pretending; force; exquisite; Lose interest in self-satisfaction; Forever annoying narration But you know what? I really like it. It's different. It's really original. Really try. And that's done for all the minuses. The show is bright, verbal, fast, witty, interesting and fun to watch ... You know it's only once a week. I can use it. Once a week and hope to enjoy it I will regret it. But I guess that no one will bring this thing back to life.
