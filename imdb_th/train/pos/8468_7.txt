Meditation is surprisingly interesting about the nature of regret in terms of methods associated with paranoia. There are many things that happen in this story, which takes only 74 minutes, but can be used. The horror movie is very subtle, not a horror movie that seems to be a horror movie in Asia. The latest "fear" setting method is similar to the annoying moment in "The Uninvited" (Episode 4 Inyong shiktak directed by Su- Leon Lee) But this is not a talent that is nearby. This film serves well to balance classical ghost stories with something more unusual and psychological. It's not perfect But do what you should do I suggest checking if you have a chance.
