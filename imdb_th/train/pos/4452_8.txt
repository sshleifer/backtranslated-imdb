Don't be influenced by parents. This is an amazingly creepy movie. This is a thesis project for JT Petty. He did very well by allowing me to be at the edge of my seat. I never knew what to expect and for the horror horror movie audience. This film involves an old man who lives in a log cabin in the forest. One day while searching for his cat in the forest, he witnessed the murder of a child or him? He suffers the rest of the film. The most unusual thing about this movie is that there is no dialogue until the last scene. I find this interesting. Writers try to capture your feelings and pull them relentlessly. Let this matter, you will not be disappointed.
