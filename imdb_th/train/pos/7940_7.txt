Gaze in the labyrinth is not your average Giallo ... and speak straight. I'm not sure if it's really Giallo, but Giallo or not. Despite some problems, this is an absolutely interesting little movie. I hesitate to call it Giallo because this film doesn't have the most features that make these movies real. But many types of items break the mold and this should be one of them This film does not have a brutal murder as far as Jello has done. But it was built to have a surreal atmosphere The plot seems simple enough to focus on the doctor who was killed by Julie, his patient, for some reason. She saw that he was her lover and father and was nasty when he walked out. From you Then we moved to a large house with a lot of people living. But nothing is true because there are many secrets around the events that happened before Julie arrived ... <br /> <br /> The movie seems to have something about the way. Where the mind is like a maze This thing has never happened and I just want to sit back and enjoy what is happening instead of worrying about the issue (if any). This film tries to do something. Eye in the Labyrinth directed by Mario Caiano, the director behind Night of the Doomed. Great years ago He didn't create the atmosphere as well in this movie as he did before. But the surreal aspect of the story came out well and the mystery remained constant, which made this film not boring. This film starring Rosemary Dexter, which serves eye candy and has good performance. Most of the remaining actors do not talk much about anyone except Adolfo Celi, who is as good as the villain and Alida Valli, which the cult fans will remember from all the wonderful flicks. The film describes itself at the end; Which luckily I'm sure I'm not the only audience that is more confused than that! Overall, this may not be a classic. But it's good and worth watching
