The meteorite crashed into a crater lake. The heat from the impact caused the prehistoric eggs to hatch. <br /> <br /> Okay, so this plot is just trash. But despite the obvious low budget, this became one of the most watched movies in the world. There is also a good time of humor. In an era full of things called "Monster", which is nothing more than creating a suit or a lizard suit that is ridiculous and forced to tear into pieces. Plesiosaur in this little gem is a wonderful stop-motion creature. Harryhausen style <br /> <br /> It's hard to find movies.
