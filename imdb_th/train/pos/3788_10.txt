This movie is beautiful. It's true and heart. But at the same time it was totally crazy The characters fall in love easily because they have many different ideas. But each of us can refer to at least In Canada, we don't have many movies from Eastern Europe and for some of the things I have seen, Loners is one of the best movies It's very funny and wonderful. If you want to see something new and refreshing, go to the Loners.
