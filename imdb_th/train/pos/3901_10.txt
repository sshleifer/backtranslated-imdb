This video rocked! Eddie is one of the funniest cartoons I've ever seen. Not only does he have classes, he also makes the most fun observations in history and culture I've ever seen. Eddie is the original and smartest cartoon I have seen for a long time. Tell others to get up from the stage and let "executives" reign!
