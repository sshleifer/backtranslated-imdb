I am still on hand for the premiere in Toronto. This movie is delightful when I think I won't be able to see my first choice. I'm blown away. By the time I reached the theater, I could remember no less than the basic story of the movie. (Yes, I forgot who that person is in). A great performance from the Carrie-Anne Moss actor. Great to truly leave as Trinity for Billy Connolly. Lin has an actor who is good at playing. Nothing will happen. Children are also great. Check this one for sure if you get the chance. <br /> <br /> And by the way, I've seen my first choice - and this is a better way.
