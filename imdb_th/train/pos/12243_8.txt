Kate Beckinsale is good if not better than Gwyneth Paltrow, like Emma in this movie, although I like Gwyneth Paltrow in other Emma versions. They are both different ways. And I like women who play Harriet Smith in this movie better as well ... she's cute and emotionally better There are a few things I like better about the Gwyneth Paltrow version, although it seems that the funny side is more clear.
