Before watching, make sure you see Night of the Living Dead ... This is probably the best 7-minute parody I've ever seen! 'Special techniques', nonsense, crappy, crappy (ropes, ropes !!!) and a piece of bread ... What more do you need? <br /> <br /> (Don't watch this movie while eating bread. .. You may be afraid!)
