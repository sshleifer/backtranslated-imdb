This is a great and wonderful work from the fans and the consideration made in the back bedroom on the green screen. It has a complex and distorted story, and the characters show depth and realistic dimension. The team is amazing. While the first season may be slightly shaky But in the end, there were some people who thought and shot well. Some fans might think that Star Trek Franchise ended with the cancellation of Enterprise, but these fans didn't get an answer. I recommend this to fans and newcomers alike. 10/10 Hidden Frontier Crew <br /> <br /> Make it ...
