'The Luzhin Defense' is a movie worthy of everyone's time. It is a movie that is intensely contemplating and makes me interested all the time. John Turturro is beautiful in the image of a gentle and unusual chess master. Emily Watson has a spell as a gentle daughter But the highly respected Russian rebellion of chemistry between Watson and Turturro on the screen is clear from the moment their characters meet in this story. Overall, this movie is one of the best images of chess life. Grandmaster and Turturro and Watson add a feeling that is not about movies. Most people will come out of the theater's ideas and feel the impression of a beautiful look in an unlikely love story.
