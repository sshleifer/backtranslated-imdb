This movie may have a budget of $ 750 and can still beat the Titanic. I rented this car on the day that my mother's car crashed and it was the only thing that encouraged me to believe! It must be linked to 'The Assult of the Killer Bimbos'. The thing to look for is: 1. The driving scene in the Chinese girl's blow job 2. The bleached blonde girl in the sassoon shirt that has never changed. 3. The screaming sound. Sing like Flinstone. Drive out. 4. The clash set with red hair before she gets killed (don't worry, I didn't destroy any surprises because it can be predicted). 5. People who think it's necessary. Must be mourned 7. A long chase at the end of the hour involves a teacher and a priest. 8. Womman writes grafitti on the bathroom wall. 9. Last but not least, the special effects at the top Great - especially the stabbing in the game that made ... Heaven helps me ... loudly <br /> <br /> Fun <br /> <! Br />
