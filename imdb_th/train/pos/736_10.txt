What should not be missed for punk players is that the movie makes The Ramones the name of the household in the early 1980s (when first appeared on premium cable stations). This is one of the first punk movies. The best American and have a classic religious status there with a rocky horror picture show. Originally, the manufacturer wanted Cheap Trick to be a star, but the release of the album "Live At Budakon" made them become superstars and was too hot for the program to be in a low budget movie. We are very fortunate for Ramones who are looking to separate from the punk rock, underground world and enter the main market. (Which never happened to be sad until after the band died) Dee Dee, in particular, didn't like movies throughout the 80s, but fans always loved and were able to surf most movies while waiting to join the Ramones movie This, like most classics, is foolish fun with classic Ramones videos in their heyday. Don't expect more, you won't find it. So much fun, enjoy it. Another classic movie of Allan Arkush in a similar vein is Get Crazy, which has Lee Ving from the legendary hardcore punk band Fear.
