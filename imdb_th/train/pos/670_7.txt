The final wave will not win over the main audience. It's a slow-moving movie. But interesting for those who are willing to go with it Australian real estate lawyers have been asked to take action in the case of five indigenous people accused of being one of their own murderers. All types of omens and ominous appear soon due to the death of a man related to tribal problems that are not intended for the court of white people. It seems that the end of the world may have arrived and he and the Aboriginal people may know this. But no one made Richard Chamberlain as a lawyer at his peak. Here, David Guptil, a familiar face from Australian flicks and many famous actors, was one of the five indigenous people in the trial. The last wave is no longer for everyone anymore than MAGNOLIA (both strange occurrences that fall from the sky). Let's see it on a slow Saturday night.
