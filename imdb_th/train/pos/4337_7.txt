I was disappointed that Reiser (the screenwriter) felt the need to use many profanity without any reason. Maybe that was his idea for the movie "Adult". Many nasty words with humor in the bathroom thrown in? I think it's better for him and think that he has less for this movie. <br /> <br /> Falk's performances and humorous moments, including some important themes that make me score high, like <br /> <br /> This may be a good movie for an adult child to watch and laugh about their people and their weakness. But the lack of consideration for the audience family caused serious damage to what could be a family movie, but failed. Of course, it was not worth spending money, even though it might be worth watching for free on television.
