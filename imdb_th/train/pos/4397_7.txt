Exotic historical drama with some fighting scenes. Tobey Maguire provides great performance and makes the backup quite good. The script is knowledgeable and is original, beautiful and the film has been independently preserved by the heroes. That said, it will drag the bit and the final reel is too much like a mini-TV series. Still, Frederick Elmes's camera technician is still interested in boring things (and every time you see a picture that reminds you that he works for David Lynch) it's worth watching
