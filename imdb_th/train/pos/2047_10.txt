This movie made me fall in love with 29. I remember that '80's and my father worked in the factory. I think if I work too hard, if I am proud and never give up, I can have an American dream. A few children, every car that will call me. But I noticed that if there is no degree in something (Unlike my father who resigned from the ninth grade) and greed and laziness, you can't go anywhere. <br /> <br /> I want to know if anyone has this movie on DVD or VHS. It's done for TV and I just saw it an hour ago. Not found anywhere! I like to show this to my friends, friends, family and other relatives. See what they think and remind them that once upon a time, Americans will work for honor and we are proud of what we do. success !! I think the feeling is still there. But in a heavily downward spiral with things that were created in foreign countries ...
