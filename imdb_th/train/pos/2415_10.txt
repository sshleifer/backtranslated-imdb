I stick to this show completely. I can't wait until the next week to see the next show. It's a great story and the best actors and actors in the program. I will adjust every week to see, even if I'm not at home. I always have my vcr set to tape the king. Simon rex is the best actor in the show It's suspicious and exciting. I think this program should be aired and I believe everyone should adapt to watch. I saw at first and actually I didn't see it. But I watched throughout my life one day and I decided to watch it because it was on and I absolutely loved it. I really mean it
