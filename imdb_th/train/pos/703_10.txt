I scored ten because I found it very impressive that the age of eighteen years can be done with a video camera. It's not epic But it has many contributions and I never get bored. If the tens of millions of dollars can go into countless bad movies that have been pouring out, this director will use the same amount of money and see what happens. I know I will line up in the cinema to receive her first big release. Condemning a good job and worth the money It's a script! It may be a low budget. But it danced to hell out of half the important images that I have seen recently. Nanavati knows how to tell stories both in writing and on the screen. Serious glory for you. Can't wait to see more.
