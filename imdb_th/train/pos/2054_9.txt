When I first heard the name, I missed 'The Simpsons' is like other critics, but when I saw the actor, I was totally shocked that many of the great character actors would be like this! First of all, we have Christopher Walken (Deer Hunter, Pulp Fiction), a character player named McBain. He was rescued by a Vietnamese prisoner of war camp by some of his friends, one of which was Santos (Chick Vennera, Yanks), who split the bill Hundreds of dollars with Macbain (Vietnamese soldiers were full of cash) and told him that if he had a problem, <br /> <br /> Then 18 years later, Santos and his sister Christina (Maria Conchita Alonso, The Running Man, Predator 2) Join the rebels. In Colombia, trying to get rid of their evil dictatorship. El Presidente (Victor Argo, Taxi Driver, King of New York) and when Santos fails in his mission, Christina goes to McBain for help. <br /> <br /> McBain asks Let his good Vietnamese friends help him. The first time a black man, a token named Eastland, played by Steve James Ninja, who directed the previous movie "The Exterminator" by James Glickenhaus, the real name of the devastator is Eastland. There are also many other references about The Exterminator, which is the most notable thing that McBain wore a welder mask when Christina saw him for the first time when he worked on sesame seeds. Connect at the top of the bridge! <br /> <br /> Other people in Vietnam pack are: rich people who can buy all kinds of equipment for the team, Frank Bruce (Michael Ironside, Total Recall, Starship Troopers) and Doctor, Dalton, (played by Jay Patterson, who doesn't look like the guy that IMDb is currently connected to, and I haven't seen him in other movies, so who knows) and last but not least, Gill's police, whose work is not satisfactory enough By Thomas Gewit, which some people may remember from The War riors and The Thing <br /> <br /> And in other important roles, we found Luis Guzm√°n (Boogie Nights, Carlito's Way) as a small drug dealer who couldn't work well. In addition, Dick Boccelli is important in the drug trade that was hung on a crane on the roof by McBain-gang almost the same in the same way that he had hung a meat grinder by John Eastland in the removal of termite films! Now I haven't seen Glickenhaus's "Shakedown / Blue Jean Cop", but I'm almost ready to bet the half-hundred dollar bill that Boccelli was hanging in this movie as well! <br /> <br /> Okay, go back to the story of this movie .. They go out to Columbia and save their lives today! But whoever is interested in the plot of the character is excellent and the action scene is very well done and you never get bored while watching this movie! Suggest to those who like action!
