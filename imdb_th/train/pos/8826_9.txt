If you are amused by the direct, rational behavior in an irrational situation, you will enjoy 8 minutes of strange Spanish movies. <br /> <br /> A woman enters a small cafe. But the opponent, the client and the two musicians seem to be quietly unusual. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the musicians played and a man started singing the first title of a customer that couldn't move. There is a periodic discussion (not good, but easy to play), along with phrases from songs, read from paper, slip on their palms, they rise and fall, jump up and dance. (Slowly but seriously) in dance moves such as backup singers <br /> <br /> But why ??? The woman wondered The answer was revealed when a single artist's jacket opened and she saw what was strapped on his chest - before reaching the peak that exploded ... <br /> <br /> Even if you Didn't catch the lyrics of the song Perfect performances in situations should make you smile and laugh ... I like to see it again!
