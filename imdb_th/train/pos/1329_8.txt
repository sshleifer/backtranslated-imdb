I grew up in Brazil and had visited and amazed at the beautiful coast where this film was filmed. The area called "Parati" and part of Rio de Janeiro's "Green Coast" is about 150 miles away from Rio de Janeiro. <br /> <br /> The film comes back to life. In the 16th century world in Brazil, which Europeans rarely began to explore the coast, which is still in its original state and Sparsely populated by various indigenous tribes France and Portugal fought for the land and in exchange for Brazil's timber trade all the time negotiating with the indigenous people who fought among themselves for whatever reason. <br /> <br /> The French language was not suitable ("a mercenary"). Left to die by his fellow countrymen But enough to escape and be taken captive by the natives who were all naked While he was the "slave" of the chief, according to the tribal tradition, he was allowed to live in relative comfort for several months until the right time for him to be killed and eaten in the ritual of revenge. <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie is that it creates new details in the villagers' villages and their way of life. (They walked naked and human) and asked us to recognize and accept life at that time. It was: In the beautiful garden of Eden, a violent life filled with pathetic superstition and strange traditions. Europeans arrive and bring their own problems, including more violence, with better weapons and greed. There are no "noble scholars" or "brave explorers" of romance here. It's just people trying. Surviving in a difficult world <br /> <br /> This film is not a sympathy and expulsion from the indigenous people. From what I know about this, the description is quite accurate, which adds to the unique atmosphere of the project: There are a few movies that you have seen about the lives of Brazilian natives and their first events with Europeans.
