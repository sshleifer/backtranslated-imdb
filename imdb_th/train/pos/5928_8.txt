This is not a good movie. But I still like Clovis. The cat is gold in the pitcher, as well as the location of the cat itself - as opposed to the true of the evil Sleepwalkers. Very severe But sometimes this ruthlessness may be good. It has a recurring line, an abrupt end, and a funny element that is conveyed by a failed police. <br /> <br /> Whoever finds out that the incestuous element is disturbing In the end, this movie is random and violent, which is quite effective. I compared Psycho - the relationship between mother and son, the transformation of the protagonist. I think the sudden is still working. This is not the movie you want it to be long. But it can only be used when it's short. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if the director lacks depth or not. We know that Stephen King has the ability, but I haven't read his book. But watching some movies <br /> <br /> Next, I like it. If you like movies that are repetitive and have a lot of excitement in the 80s, just watch it. But don't expect too much It's really terrible.
