Everyone knows about the 'Zero Day' event. This is what I think this movie is not because of the elephants. They show their lives for about a year. Throughout the movies that we like, they laugh with them even though we know what they will do. And that makes me feel cold Because I feel guilty of being encouraged by their opinions and I just think Cal is a cute person Although I know you will know what will happen. Even at the end of the movie when they were going to commit suicide and decided that they did it in the last 3 or 4, I think it's funny But still shocked to see their heads blown away Of course I am. I like them. They are evil. But I feel like they are really ordinary people that they don't really know It makes us realize that our friends or relatives or anyone can plan something crazy and we won't even notice. This movie is as good as it was, making me feel bad. And that is why I went to sleep now There is still a little feeling in my stomach. Butterfly
