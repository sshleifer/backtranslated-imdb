Please note that I am not saying that it is better ... more fun. The lack of social commentary and realism keeps things moving. <br /> <br /> Actually, I'm surprised that this is not. Troma movies because it contains all of Troma's trademarks, including acidic liquids The villain after every murder scene, ridiculous rape scene (Which is difficult to regret because the rapist is a snowman) and is a stupid agent. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of love: <br /> <br /> 1 The snowman who has noticed That he had no legs or feet, drove police around the city. <br /> <br /> 2 Although it should be close to the freezing point (Or below) the breath of no one is shown and there is no trace of the car's exhaust when the car is working. <br /> <br /> 3 Snow reminds you of flocking beans or peanuts foam more than real snow. <br /> <br /> 4 A teenage girl was popular with her boyfriend just a few hours after her brother was horribly killed. She spoke to him to go into every house of the sheriff to continue. But first she told him that he had to create a beautiful fire in the fireplace and open the wine a bit. <br /> <br /> 5 After the teenage Jake's head was cut by the runners, his father argued with the sheriff that Tommy. Is the son of the sheriff involved in this matter? The sheriff insists that Tommy will not fight Jake because Jake. "At least two feet higher than Tommy." At that time, some people in the background said that "Never again!" <br /> <br /> 6 When the evil snowman finally melted, the sheriff wrestled with a flat snow doll made of some kind of fabric for a long time. It's better than Tarzan wrestling with rubber crocodiles or ancient wrestling with stuffed lions. If I was an actor, I wouldn't be able to make a straight face now. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a fun movie. There is not much, even a lot of blood.
