From the opening scene on a crowded train that is a ruthless pickpocket (Richard Wide Mark) stealing women's purse (Jean Peters) came to pick up at the amazing southern road. Partly because the performance is consistently strong from all actors, B&W photography is sharp and adds to the story and character's appeal and due to Samuel Fuller's direction, Samuel Fuller makes him. In the same league. In fact, it has the same urgency as the Huston movie about a false robbery. But the payout is not as strong as it should be. <br /> <br /> JEAN PETERS is great with a young woman with a hard edge, which Widmark describes as a "knock around a lot". She provides raw energy and attractiveness. Sexual mind and the role of a woman that is not too bright, holding a microfilm in her pocket for her boyfriend (RICHARD KILEY), which is what the FBI already knows. They are on her path when the theft occurs. <br /> <br /> THELMA RITTER adds realism to the image of a woman called "Moe" who buys and sells everything to make a profit and pay for She lives. She was very impressed in her final scene with Kiley. <br /> <br /> This guarantee that you will get attention through one hour and twenty minutes. Good Noir from Fox and famous in the show Widmark, Peters and Ritter
