I think this movie is really great. But in every movie there will be hallucinations Now, some of you may not see Hilary Duff's 'Raise Your Voice'. But if you think of both shows, it is very similar in 'Brave New Girl'. Holly wants to be terrible in entering the Haverty Conservatory in 'Raise Your Voice'. Terri wants to go to the conservatory in LA (remember The name of the greenhouse is not there.) They both are in the music field and they both have to sing at the end of the semester. It's really funny that both of these films are the same. Personally, I like 'Brave New Girl' better than 'Raise Your Voice'.
