I don't like both Shrek movies. (Due to both their "PG" and their own words, I will not speak myself, so I do not like them. <br /> <br /> But when it comes Watched for the first time last month, I became an animated movie fan in addition to Pixar. *** The front spoiler *** In "Soul: Stallion of Cimarron" the baby horse was born and finally Became a leader in his hearing One night he saw a strange light in the distance and he walked that way. Eventually this action led to his arrest and many other things. Throughout the movie, we hear the narration. It passes through the mind of the soul, even if the horse doesn't speak. This is what makes this movie very thick. They (the filmmakers) recite the real horse to make the horse sound that is made. There is no sound created by humans. <br /> <br /> Soul meets Rain, a beautiful woman and Little Creek, an American native who owns Rain Little Creek, releasing souls and Rain, and then they return. <br /> <br /> <br /> I've never been a big fan of Brian Adams before. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and you won't regret. My rating: 10/10
