First of all, this movie should not be a great movie and think like other critics seem to compare. The first review says that there is something along the lines of anyone who likes this. Don't know about horror. If anyone looking back to this movie does not mean that it is really reliable, it is an economical ipecac, but that's all it's targeted. It is intended to make the audience explode with the shock. real (And all the shortcomings that the image is less noticeable than in the original VHS version) <br /> <br /> I give this score as high as the target, and even though it isn't quite scary (In an unobtrusive sense) but makes me slightly sick and paranoid / pessimistic (I don't 'don't trust anyone for about a week because I don't want to wake up, frustration and torture)
