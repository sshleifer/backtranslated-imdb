This movie is my favorite Disney movie. Then on 11/21/01, I saw this 30th DVD movie. Wow, I remember why I loved this movie. The DVD is great, with an additional 30 minutes, which doesn't have the original. I didn't know this when I first started watching. The movie has done more and more since the songs they cut out should have been left. You haven't seen this movie until you see the full 131 minutes. Many people say that this song is recognizable. I remember every song in this movie with all my heart, with my own charm, and came together as a hole. I remember when I was young, I had the song "Eglantine" stuck in my head for several days as well as "Briny Sea" (the song was meant for marriage with poppies. But being cut from the movie) Please see the movie Aniversy, the 30th edition of the uncut new 10 that is true.
