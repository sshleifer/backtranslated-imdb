This movie has a problem in presenting, it can be a nasty thing for those who are looking for worldly integrity and culture. But it challenges viewers to reflect on a variety of issues One of them is the nature and nature of the relationship between Jesus and Judas. Another is the historical nature of the Bible and faith. And the third is the humanity of Jesus The tension of the traitorous relationship of Christ has been developed and organized through movies. The passion of Judas is presented in a darker manner than that of Christ. When Judas used his own life, the audience felt the suffering. However, Peter's refusal and guilt, no matter how moving, was not shown as powerful as the drama of Judas. Chris Sarandon offers Christ and a provocative novel, whether or not to believe. I want to search for this movie on a DVD or even a VHS for education or discussion groups.
