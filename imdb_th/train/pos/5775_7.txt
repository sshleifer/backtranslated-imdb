People C'mon look at the name! Lol! I remember watching this movie last Saturday. It is a wonderful monster and flicked with a bad performance. Fun. 2 charlatans rent a movie! Haha and you will love the boat scene that the English people and his wife are talking about all the stars and are hilarious and noon sunshine !!! You can tell that they don't care about the plot. They just want to film this movie as soon as possible. Bottom line, you'll love it if you love the 70's schlock.
