This film is a great movie from the life of a man named Gray Owl. In the 1930s, Canada, I found it to be sensational and sincere, similarly as 'Rudy' and 'Awakening'. It received calls in Gray Owl's life. And follow him throughout his most hectic and influential moments. <br /> <br /> This film is about Indian Canadian reptiles. He also predicted the decline of natural lands and the use of global resources too. This was an evil concept in the 1930s and received surprisingly good responses. He became a well-known speaker and many people were ready to listen. <br /> <br /> Pierce Brosnan's casting performance seemed rather strange. But not angry Anyone who wants to argue at that point must watch the movie to understand before Brosnan delivers the same great performance as Annie Galipeau. Galipo is a strong actress with a place beside the Brennan, natural, refreshing compared to The recent pairing of Bond movies <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie. It is a movie for the family as well. But children under 10 years (depending on maturity) will have problems according to the plot
