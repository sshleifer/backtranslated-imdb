There are old words related to Joe Johnston's new film that caused this kind of story: "Those who think he can do it and those who think he is not right." That's a formidable statement. Very much which refers to the motivation and confidence in the person in which the film is true, even after the roadblock and family problems stand in the way <br /> <br /> "October Sky " Young men who believed in their own name Homer Hickman Cam grew up in a strict traditional family in 1950 with Homer's small coal mining town in which almost everyone grew up as mine. Every one of his friends, Quentin Roy and Odell, all thought that their life after high school would be like everyone else. Homer didn't get out about that future. <br /> <br /> One night while everyone staring at the sky, the Russian spacecraft Sputnik passed the head. This is something new for Homer and he finds it exciting and overwhelming. From this point on, looking at his life will never be the same. <br /> <br /> First of all, he told everyone that he wanted to work in the space of a rocket scientist to pursue a career. Dazed by what he said, his family passed that idea overhead and lived a normal life. His friends thought that this idea might have potential. In the end, Quentin was a very smart person when talking about it. <br /> <br /> When the four friends began to test simulated rockets and bombed a white wooden fence for the mill, what seemed to be The wild fire fears them. They are forced to end their progress. <br /> <br /> The performance in this movie is breathtaking from start to finish. All actors give the performance as if this is a real jumbo here. Stand out in all the glory: Laura Dern plays Miss Riley. This may be an Oscar if the referee remembers from the beginning of the year when the film was released. <br /> <br /> The character has improved a lot. Also, not only does the creator give clear and clear reasons why Homer is interested in this matter. But they also explained to the audience how they succeeded in studying rocket matter. We clearly understand the motivations and beliefs of all the characters, especially the father who is passionate about a long tradition. <br /> <br /> This movie, unfortunately, lost some momentum to Midpoint due to stupidity A reused romantic subplot involving Homer's love interest and the way his brother stole her from him. This type became very common in high school movies, not this film aimed at high school children. The actors stare at each other without reason, like being in a trance. I can do it without complaining. "Invent the Abbot" in 1997, but I have this thing enough. <br /> <br /> But that's just a minor complaint. With a real looking moment, valuable movies for Oscars and Homer clips in real life and friends at the end, everyone is fascinated by their dreams, especially Homer. Br />
