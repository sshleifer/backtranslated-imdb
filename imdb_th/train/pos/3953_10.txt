I saw this movie on TV when it came out and never saw it again. For my life, I can't remember the name and just stumbled while checking Roy Thinne's film credits. The terrifying, terrifying and horrible TV movie of the same genre as "Crowhaven Farm"; "Don't be afraid of the darkness"; And "Satan's School for Girls" all lost Satan's classics I still think it has many similarities to the "High Plains Drifter" classic of Clint Eastwood. Why don't they release these small movies, especially when you consider all the past junk that fills the DVD rack? Cheap at Wal-Mart. Most of these temples have religious rituals. Therefore, sales should not be a problem.
