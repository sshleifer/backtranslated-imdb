Recap: The next morning after his bachelor party, Paul was awakened by his mother-in-law and found a woman lying next to him. Unfortunately it was a waitress from the bar, not his fiance. Suddenly she appeared everywhere ... toll booths at the expressway and at dinner, parents, husbands. And it was hard to keep the secret when her ex-girlfriend was jealous that he tracked and photographed It's not just about saving his wedding. But still about survival. <br /> <br /> Comments: Really better than expected. Not a romantic comedy that I expected But there is something more fun This movie is not afraid to bring funny jokes again. And Jason Lee, how to do comedy, especially when his character is half awkward and in trouble because he is here And he is well supported by beautiful women, Julia Stiles and Selma Blair And the results are good I really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
