I saw this film for the first time in 1980 and now in 2006, this movie is still one of the best movies I've ever seen! I would like to recommend everyone to watch this movie. You will not regret It was made out really well and never had a boring time. Great performances and places that make movies seem like you are there. From beginning to end, this film is a genre that makes you not interested. The actors have done a great job showing the surviving survivors of the horrific plane crash in the Amazon and showing how she can survive in the Amazon Unbelievable that anyone can survive under such conditions. This is why this movie is very interesting. The fact that this is true makes this movie more interesting and thinks that a young woman can survive the overwhelming test. I found this movie that I can watch over and over again and it's a movie that I never bored. Of course, this is a compliment that I have hundreds of movies! I would say that this may be my favorite movie and the best thing I've ever seen!
