As a big fan of Dickens for the rest of my life, I am constantly disappointed with the adaptation of his novel. <br /> <br /> Although his work is presented in every human life story Class in Victoria in the United Kingdom The pervasive theme of humor that can be either playful or sarcastic as it is told. In any way, he is a caricature writer and cartoonist. He may be serious and hilarious in the same sentence. He is arrogant, proud, proud, modest, famous and attentive to loneliness and poverty. May be an ancient idea But he is a writer of people. <br /> <br /> And it's a comedy that often disappears from his interpretation. At the time of writing, Oliver Twist is performing in a series of ongoing episodes on BBC television. All suffering and cruelty belong to them. But not funny, irony and barbaric lamp The result is a gloomy and depressing experience: stories written by journalists more than writers. It's not really Dickens. <br /> <br /> 'Oliver!' On the other hand The words of the civil servants were completely interpreted from the fanfare to the drunken judges. A striking classic between the beadle and Mr Brownlow, in which the law explains that 'ass, an idiot' can't do better than Harry Secombe is an ideal choice. <br /> <br /> But the terrible brutality is. There, the indifference of the state, coldness, hunger, poverty and loneliness are all presented as well as Master Prasong. <br /> <br /> Then there is a crime. Ron Moody is a lazy Jewish fence. That Oliver Reid has Bill Sykes to Perfectness <br /> <br /> Lionel Bart - himself a Jew from the East of London - with Fagin's freedom by interpreting him as a kind-hearted friend of Dicken. Finally sent some of his boys to the gallows to protect himself. (Although he was arrested and hanged) while in the movie, he was presented as something of an overbearing father figure, a sort of charity rather than a child thief, the latter being a long-standing anti-Semitic conviction. Otherwise there will be little freedom with Dickens manuscripts. All the memorable elements are also included. Intimidation and violence are enough to maintain confidence in telling stories while at the same time helping children feel more sensitive. Nancy is still being beaten to death. Bullseye escapes from drowning and Bill Sykes gets credible graphics. <br /> <br /> Every song is great, even if they tilt. schmaltz, Mark Lester, amazingly sounding his voice Both the scenes that he and I like are the scenes that the world lives for. It is schmaltzy, but it is a ghost passing and passing. <br /> <br /> I'll go. I can praise the wonderful piece. The difference between the rich and the poor. There are more quality performances from British regulars than you would shake. <br /> <br /> I should give 10 points, but I feel like Scrooge today. Soak up your Christmas dinner. No better original recognition
