One of the best "Amitabh comeback" movies I like. This is a time when Govinda is strong with Dhawan. The song is totally fantastic when we call it "masti", a kind of lush entertainer with many aspects of Anupam Kher's passion. Hilarious twists and turns, known as David Dhawan's boiling pot, with the appearance of Mrs. Matari's "Nee", Dick Sit, was a complete riot at the end. It's great to see Amit performing with power and humor after being exiled for a long time. Although some people may think it is a typical "Bollywood Masala" movie, I'll watch it every day. I keep it simple. 8 out of 10 just to make pure Bollywood.
