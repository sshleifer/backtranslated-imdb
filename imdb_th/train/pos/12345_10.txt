Kurosawa has a story with a variety of characters like the drama of Shakespearean And that show is true, each star plays a role as part of a larger story It's funny and interesting in every part. The character development is nearing perfection, movies are lively and engaging and the stories attract you. <br /> <br /> I want to say that "Freaky Samurai" and those obsessed with the royal family in the late 18th and 19th centuries. The story of Japan may belittle the film because it is not the best work of Kurosawa. But even the worst, Kurosawa is still better than many others. This story is based on raising the world life of ordinary people in times of great change, even if being held in a distant past. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this. Fully For any movie and especially to those who tend to read novels that are the basis of the movie
