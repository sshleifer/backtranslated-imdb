The sharp documentary is well done by focusing on Mardi Gras beads. I tend to like this method of making movies - communicate ideas about phenomena that are larger, more complex and often unreliable by dividing the issue. Is familiar and close to home. <br /> <br /> I'm sure most people Have heard stories about sweatshops and understand the fundamental motives behind profits and capitalism and the impact of globalization on poor countries (But people feel it) instead of explaining these things and waking up on the soap box (Not that there is anything wrong with such a documentary in general to preach to converted people.) This documentary shows how Mardi Gras beads are what they produce. Under what conditions, how will the consumer use at the end of the process? It examines openly and clearly the motivation of everyone involved in the process, including workers, factory management, American importers, and ultimately consumers at the end of the chain. <br /> <br /> I feel bad. A little bit from this story; Equally by Mardi Gras revelers, but by the way, workers in China accept their situation as normal and equal for the course. (Although they have objected to the details of the management method) The image of the road sweeper sweeping the beads from the road at the end creates a special impression. But that's just my reaction I see that other people may read this documentary slightly differently. <br /> <br /> Unlike other documentaries in this story, I don't think you have to be affected by any political issues in this story. This is the story about humanity and our relationship with the products we produce and consume. If you've bought a product that is produced in the Far East, this should give you something. <br /> <br /> Stand out and highly recommend. Must see additional documentaries like this Would like to admire everyone involved in creating this movie
