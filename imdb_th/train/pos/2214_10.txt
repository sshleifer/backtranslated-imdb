My family returned to New Orleans in the late 1600s in the early 1600s and in watching movies I knew that it was a history that my great parents never mentioned. But we know that it exists Obviously I have a black cousin, also known as African American and others who can "pass" in white and choose not to do it. It is difficult to watch when you realize that it is your family that they are talking about and the Ken River is part of that history. It made me want to cry and it made me want to kick the 'goodbye' of my great grandfather who owned those gardens and wondered in the fear that the grandmother of my African heritage lived under. Under oppression At the same time, if I didn't come out of that history, I might not be a successful female businesswoman today that I succeeded in a world that has a fairly mixed world. The performance is both excellent and fair, depending on the actors. But it's a movie to do Ann Rice is incredible and I asked myself why she wrote 'symbols' about my family and I couldn't. I recommend this movie to everyone. Leza
