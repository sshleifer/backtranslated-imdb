Charles McDougall's personal history includes directing the 'Sex and the City' episode, 'Desperate Housewives', Queer as Folk', 'Big Love', 'The Office' etc. So he has all the privileges to create a movie. Television of The survivors of Meg Wolitzer's novel succeeded. And for the most part, he managed to make this story happen about the sudden death of a loved one and more than the manner in which people in her life responded floating. <br /> <br /> Sara (Alexa Davalos) Beautiful young singles Women are following her best friend - gay playwright Adam. (Tom Everett Scott), Adam's current Adam (Chris Pine) and Adam Maddy spouse for the summer vacation It seems that the group is jolly until traveling to a local ice cream shop by Adam and Sara) resulting in a car accident that killed Sara. At the same time, Sara Natalie Swedlow's mother (Diane Keaton) has a social life. But constantly calling her daughter, together with a greeting Conflict among Sara's friends slowly but surely Natalie discovered the secrets about each of them, flourishing in talking about Sara as if doing so would make her have Life Natalie's thirst for truth, for whatever reason, resulted in a huge change in the group and was the only love of Sara, who left all of them together. /> <br /> Diane Keaton walks between the drama and comedy and her presence holds the story together. The screenplay has a moment for a good song. But it has a lot of fillers that become heavy and make the actors feel uncomfortable with the script they've received. Yes, this story has been told many times - the impact of sudden death in the lives of those who have changed privacy from revelation - but this movie moves with the actors and has enough true entertainment. Will make it worth it. Grady Harp
