I like movies that don't give "Happy ending" as typical Drug after tips anonymously This film serves well to make the audience guess whether the girl is involved or not and Bill Pullman is perfect as their lazy lawyer. Jacqueline Kim appeared as an excellent example as his wife, Yon, a very kind lawyer. I hope girls will be more abused in prison as other reviewers recommend because I heard that Thai prisons are very cruel. That this movie grabbed me is the ending Alice succumbed to a total of 96 years for Darlene to be forgiven and we (the audience) realize that they are both innocent. All movies that challenge my anticipation at the end, win extra points with me and this drama that is well-received deserves a certainty.
