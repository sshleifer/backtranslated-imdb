I voted 10 out of 10 just because it is the best animation that I can sometimes watch. The animation is amazing. The artwork behind each scenery is very beautiful. From color to light to the standard fare of art, I am surprised. In addition to the beauty on the screen, you will absorb the timeless stories and at the same time. The character development is short. But during these standards, it is necessary to keep track of what the audience and what and why and where the character arrives. I was impressed with the whole story and thought that this was something to watch for the whole family.
