This is a cute little scary / horror comedy featuring Cassandra Peterson, aka Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, the most embarrassing horror woman of all time. This is a pilot vehicle for Elvira and was so successful that it was selected by the NBC Network. They filmed a drama about the pilot for the TV series to show that babies with big breasts are black. Unfortunately, sitcoms never go through the pilot process because they are sexual references. However, this movie is very fun. Elvira is a new Chesty Morgan and a queen in the fleet. This film was followed a few years later by Elvira's "Haunted Hills Haunted Hills", which was intended to be removed from the old Roger Corman movie. Watch this movie instead for a more entertaining experience!
