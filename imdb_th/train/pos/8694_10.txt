It was in 1988 when I saw "The Ronnie and Nancy Show" for the first time (on Austrian television). At that time I was a big fan of Spitting Image (since it was awarded the bronze rose from the Montreux Film Festival in 1986. ) Of course, I recorded every item on the tape and watched it over and over again - especially "The Ronnie and Nancy Show". I remember that scene when Ronnie stood in front of Abraham Lincoln's drawing. (Think of it as a mirror) and say to yourself that "I want to shave" or the most amusing when he plays ball with his dog - but on the other hand <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Spitting Image seems to be in being forgotten. It's one of the best and smartest TV programs ever. Compared to other satirical broadcasts, it is definitely the best. <br /> <br /> Almost 20 years have passed and I hope to see the show again. Is it possible to buy from someone ... somewhere?
