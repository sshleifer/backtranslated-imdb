Firstly, the only reason people tend to be persuasive about this film is because they can't stand a few parts of the true story. "Change" Guess what? Peter Jackson's movie is not a perfect interpretation as well. The background is beautiful and brought from well-known Tolkein artists. This film covers about half the trilogy. (The friendship of the ring and until the battle of Helms Deep in the two towers) and moving fast The sound was great and most of the characters seemed to think Samwise was too ugly for my taste, but Aragorn looked horrible. If you like good fantasy stories But hate reading (The book is better) Try to watch this movie by thinking that it was created 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> There is also a special note: Peter Jackson's adaptation. Will be the same as Ralph Bakshi (Jackson said many times that he admired Bakshi's efforts)
