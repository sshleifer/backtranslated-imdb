While I think that this film might have been a rap against Vietnam while watching it, I don't feel like this as much as this film is just looking honest in the perspective of a young boy. Training for war That the public does not support .... it shows fear, despair, their push ... all in the open naked As a soldier, I have many themes created according to the actual military experience - especially boots. Overall, this film, although it was filmed at a budget price But looks good, has a very good mix and has excellent acting and directing I would like to recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for another great movie about Colin Farrell 10/10.
