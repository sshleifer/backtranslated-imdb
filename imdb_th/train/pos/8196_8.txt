I don't know why people think this is a bad movie. It has a good plot and great action to change the location of Harry, it does not hurt as well. Of course, it is offensive and free of charge. But this is not the only movie that is. Eastwood is in good condition like Dirty Harry and I like Pat Hingle in this movie as a small town cop. If you like DIRTY HARRY, you should see this one better than the waste pool Very 4/5
