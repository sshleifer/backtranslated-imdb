'Before the demons knew that you were dead,' was one of the best movies I had seen in the period. <br /> <br /> The performances from <br /> <br /> that great actor It is incredible. Philip Seymour Hoffman demonstrates outstanding performance and generates electricity every time on the screen. Ethan Hawk matched the scene in the scene with him and Albert Finney, just chewing the screen. However, Marisa Tomei has a criminal offense. But it looks amazing for her 42 years. The script is very good. The story is not linear. But easy enough to follow Sidney Lumet, although it is not known about this movie But became a diamond with this thing!
