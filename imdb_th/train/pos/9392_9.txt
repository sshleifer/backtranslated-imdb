I came home late one night and then turned on the TV to see Siskel and Ebert summarize their choices this week. I didn't hear anything about "Red Rock West" except for two thumbs up and watched it before it disappeared. It will not stay in the cinema for a long time due to the supplier's money problems and lack of promotion. But they say they deserve something better. <br /> <br /> The next afternoon I followed their advice. They were right, it was the funniest I've ever had in a movie. While some readers point out that there is a little plot and the last 10 minutes doesn't seem to end. But it is worth it for great crafts that go into the first hour It's the best role I have ever seen for Nicholas Cage, but almost everyone seems to be perfectly handsome. Dennis Hopper jumps to the top, which makes him stupid. But emphasizes how well everything works The scenes and music have helped a lot in almost every scene. <br /> <br /> When I rent it later for my family, the long scenes that create tension in the theater are difficult to appreciate with the distractions Home It deserves your full attention. Turn off the phone. Make sure you are not disturbed. See and listen to all the scenes, especially in the beginning.
