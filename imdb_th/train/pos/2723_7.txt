IN COLD BLOOD is directed and adapted by Richard Brooks. However, it is very realistic, sometimes it's a clinic rather than entertainment. The narrative of the brutal murder of the Midwest family, author Truman Kaput, focuses on Minutia, wrapped himself and the reader in the story and subject! Brooks dispersed fiercely from such methods. Although he was filming in the real place But he kept the distance The murder is described as the image of the bad people that they are. They are not seen as misguided spirits. (Like in the Capote book) and the brutality of their actions is very scary. Scott Wilson and Robert Blake are excellent as an assassin, including John Forsyth and Paul Stewart as a reporter.
