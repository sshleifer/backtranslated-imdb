This is another movie from the 80s that most people don't know exist. (The image of the love of the Montana landscape is amazing and reminds me of Costner's latest "Open Range", starring Robert Duval) and films that create emotional satisfaction as the perfect movie for watching late at night. one Don't sleep or Sunday afternoon Those in the right mood will receive thorough care and close to the grief of one family and they reunite after the younger son accidentally shoots and kills the eldest son while Who are hunting Everything is perfect and excellent. Glenn Close, Robert Duval and Wilford Brimley are perfect in drawing, as well as supporting players and young actors. I like the way director Adam (Which, unfortunately, didn't save anything since this story, except for the first "Young Guns") gave us a glimpse of everyone's grief We do not just see how death affects the brother or guardian. But also the confused sisters, the stubborn uncle, his crazy wife and dead teenage girlfriend What we get here is the answer in the middle west of "ordinary people". There are also shades of David Lynch's "The Straight Story" in the middle of the house with great morals that appear here and in Lovely pictures of the agricultural areas they live in This is one of the "torn" better and more realistic in that era and is good for your quality movie hunters.
