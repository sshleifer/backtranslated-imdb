I admit that it is quite boring about the movie genre of young children, causing his / her heart to be reluctant. Have I seen them enough? Baby Boom, Kolya, about boys, mostly Martha, and to a certain extent, Whale Rider? Expect to be bored with the formula What I pay attention to in the King of the Mask is the horror of the place: China, a small town in the 1930s. Poverty is normal and girls are seen as worthless for poor parents who He killed them from birth or given to anyone who would take them to the black market. When Wang discovered the grandson he had bought, which he had earned the nickname "Doggie" as a granddaughter, at first he drove her out, even though she showed great promise as a famous heir. Even after he reluctantly brought her back, he was not upset when she was kidnapped. This film has the courage to show the length of the intelligent woman who has to survive in that society. <br /> <br /> The two leading acts are credible and deceptive in the social context of they In Western societies, anyone would expect at least a hint of resentment from a palace that was not significantly successful. Huang carefully accepted his station as an artist with a low social status. But I did as well. While Doggie exhibited a level of precocious and witty dubiousness in modern suburban children, it was completely believable in the context of children living in a society that treats poor girls. Like garbage And after learning that her seven previous owners had hurt her body and mind, she felt strongly attached to the palace. <br /> <br /> Looking at life in a small town in a foreign country. Surprising things and of course the warm resolution is what makes the movie look.
