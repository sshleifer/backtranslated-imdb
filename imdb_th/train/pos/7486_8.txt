I for one like this movie for some reason I will go late. But i want to touch why i think people don't like it First of all, there are many people who like to hate Tom Cruise. I don't really understand Secondly, Cameron Crowe, I think, was successful in eliminating two movie audiences with this movie. A group that looks relaxed, relaxed, "don't think too hard". The movie audience must be confused when the plot takes 180 times. The ending of the movie and the mysterious and mysterious puzzle fans are broken when Crowe has one. In his character that describes the mystery completely. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie. And Tom Cruise did a very good job I think it may be his best performance from all I have seen, even though I haven't watched all of his movies or it may be a big part. Supporting actors are also good. Penelope Cruz gave a stable performance and Jason Lee enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> I like the story and I think that's what Vanilla Sky is more than anything. It is a mystery, adventure and romantic comedy. But most are just good And there are many hidden philosophies and similar ideas and stories that occur in the historical philosopher David Aames (Cruise). People who have everything he needs, whether more or less, get a second chance at There is a catch to regain it and eventually confront the devil and the extent of what happened. Choose reality, simplicity and normal to see that he can finally find one thing that he has never received: happiness <br /> <br /> Many people are disappointed that Crow laid a complete puzzle in the episode. End I think it's necessary Then the audience knew better than the shadow that doubted that David was aware of his situation and that it made the final choice more powerful. <br /> <br /> And the music in the movie was great. It may be something that makes movies as fun as it is. especially "Njosnavelin" by Sigur Ros, which is an amazing song. <br /> <br /> All of this, I'll give you 3 stars and 4 stars. It's a movie that has some content for those who like to think about things and it's a story. Excellent for those who want to relax. The "moderate" method may be the reason why people don't like it a lot because it's not a mystery filled with breath or a love story full of wind. the It combines and matches different compositions and genres.
