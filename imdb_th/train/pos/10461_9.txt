A Vow to Cherish is a great movie It is based on a novel of the same name, which is equally good, although different from the movie. Makes you think you will answer if you are in the character's shoes Recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent, spouse or family member - in other words, everyone! <br /> <br /> Although production is not of Hollywood quality - there are no special effects, large - yet the value and ideals show more than makeup And the actors have an excellent role in capturing the emotional relationship between family members and the devastation that occurs when one of them is sick
