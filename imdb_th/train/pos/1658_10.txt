If you've watched this movie, you've been to Puerto Rico. I live in Puerto Rico all my life and have to admit that we (PR) are living a chaotic life now. Drugs are the main cause of the shooting and killing that we have almost every day. These people will shoot anyone, anywhere, anytime and many innocent lives have been lost because of this. We don't feel safe anymore and besides what is called Our "justice" is no longer motivated by truth and accuracy. But with money, influence and power, "Ladrones y Mentirosos" is based on miserable facts and shows the three main problems of Puerto Rico: murder, drug-related money, and the power to control the courtroom of We, Ricardo and his wife Poli, along with the true plot of their lives and their rewarding direction (**) are brave enough to present bad things like As it is: Puerto Rico is a beautiful country It doesn't seem to end !!! ** They recently received the "Copper Wing Award" for the best director in the World Cinema competition at the 2006 Phoenix Film Festival.
