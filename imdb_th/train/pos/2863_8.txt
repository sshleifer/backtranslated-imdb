Although this program will be aired since 2009 Fri. 1973 After watching a DVD set that I borrowed to our library, I felt compelled to talk a little about it. <br /> <br /> I can remember when it showed only one color. On television in the 1960s and sometimes with a small "Sunday Night Party" party with friends to watch this on NBC on one of the few color televisions. <br /> <br /> I enjoy history. Not much for Name and date But things that influence us today and how much can be very profound depends on the most important actions of the time. Case in point: Virginia City, Nevada, which became one of the richest cities in the world because of the money received from the characters named "Old Virginny", which on the first day of the city stumbled from the living room. Collapsed and smashed a bottle of his whiskey. <br /> <br /> Old Virginny didn't want to lose the opportunity because the precious liquid poured into the ground. He decided to make the town of "Virginia Town". The name Comstock Lode, because another Henry Comstock is famous for trying to cross everyone's claim and that area became known as Comstock Lode. <br /> <br /> I just watched the first episode that was handled. With these 2 subjects at other times Associated with an increase in the literature of Mark Twain, while journalists <br /> <br /> It ... Enterprise, Territorial is a family entertainment handy. As others say, each episode will be considered as a movie in its own role - scripts and various characters. <br /> <br /> One thing that distorts the truth is the proximity to Virginia City. And The Ponde Rosa In fact, riding from Ponderosa (all over Lake Tahoe), everyone had to ride his horse about 3,000 feet (1,000 meters) down to the summit of Spooner to the high desert (3,000-4,000 feet) from the Carson Valley 30. -40 miles to Virginia. <br /> <br /> There's no need to say that Cartwrights will have some back pain that is doing this regularly. But every writer should have truth. <br /> <br /> How can I miss this program even today?
