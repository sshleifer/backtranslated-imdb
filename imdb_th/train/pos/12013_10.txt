After reading reviews about this film and seeing various opinions, I decided that I would add my ten cents that are worth to say that I think this film is excellent. But in the beauty of the image, writing, music score, performance Is his path I am delighted to have a small part in telling the story of this remarkable man. I encourage everyone to see this when having the opportunity to present themselves, whether he or she is following the religion. Just cultivate this with a greater commitment to live the life that we should have. True love and forgiveness do.
