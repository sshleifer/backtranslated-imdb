This review is an extension of this movie. <br /> <br /> I watched the Dragon Lord for the first time when I bought it from the DVD many years ago. I always like this movie and you can read more positive reviews to get a general idea. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, I always find stories that are confusing. This movie is a love story. And it looks strange to me that the love story should end with a 20-minute battle scene. <br /> <br /> In the extended version, the old "traditional" version begins with a similar sequence of climbing / rugby. Big, which is a new ending sequence in the extended version. The opening sequence is Dragon (Jackie Chan) hanging around his house and pretending to be practicing and surfing whenever his father is around. <br /> <br /> The other sequence is changed. That's more when you watch it The pacing is still better and overall works better. It feels like a love story and doesn't let you ask the question of why it ended violently and violently like the normal version. <br /> <br /> I would recommend everyone who is a Hong Kong movie theater or just just Jackie Chan is crazy about extending the time and watching the movie as intended. (At least, as I thought it was intended), why did they create it again and set a new scene?) Look, finished. I felt like watching a new Jackie Chan movie, although most of the sequence is the same.
