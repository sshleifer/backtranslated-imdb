I'm not excited anymore Eight years ago, in 1983, I was going to watch Star Wars at the movie theater! The best day of my life is going to happen. At that time, my only Star Wars experience was a few HBO star's HBO screenings. I haven't seen The Empire Strikes Back yet. <br /> <br /> On that day, that boy sent me a less important sight to me. The big rebel spaceship. ! Wow! From the miracle day, I have to watch this movie hundreds of times. I can't predict right now. I have noticed that this movie - REAL Episode III - is definitely flawed. In the context of the Star Wars movie, the "defects" are very similar. Their wonderful day in 1977 and 1980 in May 1983. I have my own and this is my Star Wars movie.
