I do not understand why this movie has been damaged. Jeez doesn't care. It's not contrary and it wastes. The actors of this film play their characters for 'T' (If you watch Permanent Midnight and become a Ben Stiller's girlfriend, you will be disappointed) These are misunderstood and well-intentioned things that try to help the city / The world without anything but effort and determination The problem is that they are not aware of their limitations until the big showdown and that's the point! This is the third time that the movie The Spy Who Shagged Me has been panned by the same population, likely to be the same group that felt that the first movie of the AP began to weaken compared to the sequel. I just don't understand Jokes work more than one level. If you don't understand, I know what level you are.
