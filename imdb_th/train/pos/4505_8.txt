Eskimo is a serious movie about the cultural gap between indigenous populations and white men who invade. Although documentary filming looks like a non-professional But Eskimo is a skillful producer with a convincing story that viewers will want to see through to the final shot. <br /> <br /> Native Eskimos The behavior of women and life is more than a whaler who makes his landscape gloomy. When an Eskimo man loses his spouse, it is common for other men to share women with their friends. It is also normal for their women to want to replace their missing spouses. All of this seems normal in the context of a foreboding Arctic that is lonely. Inuit people who trust fall victim to unethical white whalers. (With a heavy European accent) which did not look at these natives as being equal to them Eventually, the Eskimo leaders (Mala) realized that he was trapped and revengeed him. The audience cheered in the theater in 1930. <br /> <br /> Enter the Canadian police and the moral conflict that will bring Mala back to trial. The mountain plays as the police feel that knowing that this is not the case is being cut and dry. Will Mounties get their people? Is it fair to hold Mala to code behavior outside of his traditional society? Is there a way that does not punish Mala? Does the law of white people have to prevail? No hope for innocence. <br /> <br /> This is not a great movie. But it is something that you will enjoy the depth of the problems mentioned in many different settings I wonder if the shooting of the sequel to the animal is complete before denying the responsibility today that no one was injured in the making of the movie - so be careful of the raw nature sequence. Highly recommended
