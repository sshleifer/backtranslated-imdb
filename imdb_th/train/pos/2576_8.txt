I am the person of "the Christopher Reeve Generation". It's fair to say that he is the best actor to play Superman, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying other actors in the role and George Reeves makes the auction. pretty good Chris goes out to the top even though he is just short. It didn't stop me from enjoying this movie. But there is plenty for it It has everything that a movie needs to plot with the beginning, the middle, and the end, as well as those parts that are written wisely. This film is frustrated both in the show and the story, which is a noir movie. The story is both exciting and meaningful. This is a movie with a message that doesn't preach too much. I'm still surprised that this thing has been shot for more than 12 days. Oh, Hollywood's glorious day when we don't have to wait 5 years to see if the movie will fall into the hell of development ... Film This has been created and mastered by Lee "Roll'em" Sholem is best known for directing with speed and efficiency. It does not slow down the limitations of technology. In fact, there is something creative to create the effect of flying, including placing the camera on a boom on a truck and shooting high and travel quickly to look like. That we see From the point of view of Superman, as well as George's few close-ups in the process of running and the long shot of the movie Superman, <br /> <br /> Now available The service on DVD is a special feature in the first season of the television series George Reeves. DVDs that have the value of owning their own. The combination of original movies is all about making cakes. <br /> <br /> Give blood today. God Bless!
