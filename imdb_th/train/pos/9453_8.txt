Liberation is an intriguing and haunting story that sometimes interferes with the story of James Dickey, becoming John Boorman's best film. About four business people are driven by manhood and male behavior that spends the weekend in Mountain canoeing There they are confronted with all the darkest aspects of mankind and all kinds of human misery ... poverty, destruction and physical abuse! These four men intend to travel down the river for adventure and excitement. But soon their journey changed to Odyssey through a violent and lurking land that separated from all forms of civilization All these elements make Deliverance one of the most horrific movies I've ever seen. Everything that happens to these men, you pray that you will not find yourself in a similar situation. The movie theater that truly talks about the rescue is a very important movie as well. John Boorman, the best (closely followed by Zardoz and Excalibur) is - and still - a very influential movie and it has a scene that Many memorable things that are featured in many other movies. Just think about the great musical score "Dueling banjos" and of course the rape scene. "Naughty like a pig" that will never be forgotten All actors give a perfect performance (ha ha), especially Jon Voight. Must watch movies too !!
