I am always eager to watch Hong Kong movies. But they all failed to meet my expectations ... until now! BURNING PARADISE There is no humor that most Hong Kong movies have and the second story is dragged into the movie. The story is not complicated. But there are scenes that have never been used to fill some "smart" areas (the only true martial arts fighting movie I have ever seen is CROUCHING TIGER, but because Hollywood is involved), there are incredible fighting scenes in the movie This story from the first scene (Which is the best scene I have seen but very short) until the last main scene! But the heart still has a lot of blood flowing out (People cut in half, cut, etc.) Production is quite good and special effects show that the writer's imagination can be filled even if some shots have to be beautiful techniques (please note: the paper he Throw and be pinned in the wall!) Yes, not Tsui Hark or John Woo, who created my favorite movie in Hong Kong. That is Ringo Lam! And I'm sure to see more of this director! genius
