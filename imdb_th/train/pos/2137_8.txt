This is more than a charming story of a middle-aged man who finds happiness in ballroom dancing. (Although it is like that) It is a story of a person who learns to love life again, pushing all the pressure of work and money to find happiness again. The bonus in this film is interesting insights about the slow changing attitudes of modern Japan towards everything from ballroom dancing to body touching. There are many scenes that will make you laugh out loud ... a few places that you want to get up and dance Tango ... and many scenes that you will feel good. <br /> <br /> This is A good introduction to creating contemporary Japanese movies for those who might fall under the impression that all Japanese films are strong and inaccessible. <br /> <br />
