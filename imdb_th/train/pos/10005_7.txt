Yes, it's an art ... that will make the thriller slowly succeed <br /> Good performance by Robin Williams The view of sex in movies seems to be unnecessary and may affect the fun of this movie. However, the main plot is very involved. This movie does not rush to you and still catch you enough to make you doubt that direction. Good use of light to get the desired result from doubt and unexpectedness. Very see 1 time if you are looking to come back and hear exciting short stories!
