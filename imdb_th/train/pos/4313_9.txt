The Grand Canyon falls under a very rare category: it is a very smart movie, with very intelligent conversations and food for every thought from beginning to end. I have the feeling that it never makes it a deserved rank (and will not) because it is simplicity. This type of flick requires sensitive watchers. Pity think that IMDB makes me write ten lines because it is not necessary in this case. However, in order to follow this request, I will tell you that the weakness of the movie, if present in the show: isn't that it's not good. But it should have done much better There is an exception for Kevin Kline that is perfect. Go ahead and watch it.
