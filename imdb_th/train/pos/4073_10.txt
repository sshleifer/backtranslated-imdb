Have you ever thought that you can escape from a boring and stressful life at school or work and go out on your own magical adventure with a close friend who is beside you facing all the dangers and villains and unlocking Puzzle of The lost civilization that is waiting for someone to discover all its secrets? Even if you are not a fantasy lover, have you ever thought that you will experience childhood again and don't care about this world in just a few hours? <br /> <br /> This is what Miyazaki's "Castle in the Sky" is available. Pazu, a brave young engineer But ambitious, living a rural life in a mining town until one day, a woman named Sheeta fell from the sky like an angel and took him on a journey to a place far beyond the clouds while All the time they have pirates and military units in their path. In simple terms, it is an incredible adventure that every child dreams of at one point and another, and I can't help but feel anxious every time I see <br /> <br /> Older works of Miyazaki and many occurrences in the world every day, this film is not impressive or deep in stories like Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle or even Mononie Princess. Even so, I find it difficult to say which one movie is better than the other because all three films, whether mysterious or mysterious, are not surprising, especially for young people. At the end of the audience, <br /> <br /> "The castle in the sky", on the other hand, does not try to be a comparison symbol of any kind, and it is not a story to be born. Which in that era as well. It may be one of the best things in the minds of children I've seen. Not just a beautiful artwork But using the view from the eyes of the children is amazing. Whether the appearance of the "camera" to see large trees or clouds over the head or incredible heights from looking down to the ground or the ocean while hundreds of feet in the air, I can't help. To feel I was there with Pazu and Sheeta, just a child in another world that is far from reality. <br /> <br /> Even children do not have complex relationships that point out the need for hope. Such as Ashitaka / San or Shihiro / Haku; Sheeta is Pazu's angel after falling into his life from the sky on one day, the perfect person for him from the beginning. When the movie continues, their true childhood spirits become more adventurous, coming out with kind words and realistic facial expressions. Not only will they be my lovely reminders. That used to be But their beloved friendships never give up throughout the story. But growing up until the end of the frame For this reason I fell in love with the two of them more than I had with other Miyazaki couples. <br /> <br /> At the same time, "Castle in the Sky" is a movie that is easily accessible. Because no matter how comfortable you are a movie watcher, you will have to find a solution here. Mystery, action, drama, comedy, suspense, sci-fi, love, even some western ... It's all here. Everything that people go to watch movies for (Except maybe horror) This is the reason I can easily recommend being Miyazaki's first movie. It's perfect for those who don't have the expectation of seeing the other incredible effects of his latest work. <br /> <br /> Even the ending of this film when translated into English. Discovering some of the lost civilizations and certain types of partners that cannot be found in our worldly lives. "The reason I pursued many lights is that you were there in one of them ... The world turned to hold you holding us, both of which will meet for sure." The song ends with the beautiful score of Joe Hiasashi. But this is the only thing I have seen. That is the love song that touches and inspires dreams. I found myself shedding tears. Just listening. <br /> <br /> "Castle in the Sky" may not be Miyazaki's most exciting, meaningful or exciting development. But it is perfect for what it truly means: the true vision of childhood imagination and the escape from the wonderful reality for adults who want them to have the same wonderful imagination when they He is a small child without concern. Lean back, relax and love what it is
