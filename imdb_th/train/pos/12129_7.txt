This is a great film directed by John Cromwell that is not a great director. But was a good filmmaker, including 'The Prsoner of Zenda' in 1937, based in London, where Hollywood can only manage the atmosphere But nothing like the real thing, it is a story of passion and love that is intercepted by Somerset Maughan's novel. <br /> <br /> I hope to see it. On a DVD that I have never seen before and is a great admirer of Bette Davis, wanting to see her in a role that is considered one of her first great ones. So I bought it. She looks good, but I'm sorry to say the London accent makes me laugh. Betty Davis is one of the great movie actors. Don't miss out. But here she has shown It is impossible to make her character serious. It's not as scary as Cockney Dick Dick Dyke 'Mary Poppins' accent. But close. <br /> <br /> Another important role is Leslie Howard. He is a smart and intelligent actor. Keep an eye on Ms Davis's vocal gymnastics.
