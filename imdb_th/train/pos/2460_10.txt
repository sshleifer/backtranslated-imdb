Hamlet is a favorite of all Shakespeare's works. Branaugh is one of the actors. His depiction of this story is excellent. His followers were amazing. As long as it is difficult for movies to pay attention to me I recommend this to everyone who is a fan of Shakespeare and not many people. This is everything the modern world looks for in movies: murder, betrayal and deception. Not to knock Mel Gibson's version, but Branaughs touched all the work. This leaves no stone unturned. When you finish the movie, it feels as though you have read the drama yourself Hmm, the way you say "Two thumbs up"
