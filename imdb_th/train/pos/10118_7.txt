I like the movie Miikes about this yakuza. I saw about 2 years ago and my head was real. Never seen before, such as what is sick and distorted. Good stories and actors do what they do very well. I haven't seen the UK or Japan version. But I must say that I believe that German DVDs are a bit censored. If you haven't seen this film before and live in Germany, you should look for DVDs from the Nederlands or the Austrian I-ON DVD. There are many difficult and nasty scenes. But at first I felt that something was missing about one or two very short scenes. <br /> <br /> All in a good movie. Crazy characters and high-level violence. That's what I like Miike for !!
