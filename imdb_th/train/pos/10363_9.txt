Track spoilers: I picked up the book "Evil Angels" when it first came out, knowing that nothing had happened. Just for the media and Australians to stop here, I am quite far away before I start to question Chamberlain's guilt. The author intended the reader to clearly understand why the public had reached the conclusion they had made. John Bryson tells the story presented to the jury. (And picked up by pressing) of the Axelone arterial spray (??). Dr. James Cameron sheets ensure that the collar is cut with scissors. Could not be taken from her clothes, with the button still printed out, bloody hands, etc. quite reliable After all, these are experts in their fields who testify without clear reasons to lie and the fact that completely wrong evidence does not appear to me at all. It is a very technical evidence which is difficult for ordinary people to understand. At this point, in addition to the testimony in the experiment, some people almost never heard of anyone talking about human harm. People do not believe that it is possible. Doubtful people in the Adventists on the seventh day, whose origins make them seem to be all kinds of wild beliefs and beliefs about them, contribute to the image of guilt If not a dedicated lawyer who relentlessly worked to investigate and respond to the court's testimony, finding Azaria's clothes later would not be enough to take Lindy out of jail. This book shook me for that reason. And I hesitate to conclude about anyone's fault since (except OJ, of course). I'm excited that the movie will be created about the case and don't think it will do well. More than this I always like Sam, which I can completely identify and Meryl is perfect like ever. Beautiful photography, haunted music I think it's not just But it is a very good movie But it is a very important movie Unfortunately, it has not been published more at the time of publication.
