The Odd Couple is a cartoon gem. One of the funniest scripts that strive to be celluloid - beyond, especially Strangelove, Spinal Tap and Lebowski! Lemmon and Matto are the best friends: Felix who has to repeat and provoke an irresponsible Oscar. Oscar's wife left him because he couldn't live with an irresponsible attitude. Felix's wife left him at the beginning of the movie, and after a suicide attempt was canceled, he moved in with his best friend, Oscar Poker. That is when the fun begins. <br /> <br /> All the scripts are great and are filled with one great lining. You may be familiar with "FU". Funny. But it still works great because of the timing of Matthau's cartoon. <br /> <br /> My favorite moment is when Lemmon tries to wash his sinus in restaurant From all his elements altogether This must be repeated!
