I don't even want to watch this movie after reading Maltin's reviews and level 1 1/2 stars. I continued to watch it on the advice of my son and found it better than I expected. 2 stars from a 4 star system. You have to watch the movie more than once to understand it all. If you do not know much religion, you will miss a lot. I graduated from high school in the year that the film was created, so maybe I could relate to it better. Yes, there is an excuse in the movie and it's strange. But that's 70s. So what do you expect? I can see why people don't like movies. However, I can't understand the people who say it's boring. This movie is boring. You will hate or love it If you find it boring, you may be dead brain.
