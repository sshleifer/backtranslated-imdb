I saw this movie for the first time when I watched through movie channels on DirecTV. My parents were Sundance channels and just started. I love music, especially in the late 60s, and this is what BJM sounds like (The Dandys doesn't matter). Everything about Brian Jonestown's massacre has fascinated me, from music to the personality of Anton and Joel to drug use. Illegal It's funny because when I watched the first party scene when everyone did as my parents walked through and decided to watch. (Their face doesn't have value) However, this is one of my favorite movies because it makes me know The Brian Jonestown Massacre, which is now my favorite band forever. <br /> <br /> Just watch it. ... Seriously
