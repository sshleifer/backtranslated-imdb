"Der Todesking" - Jorg Buttgereit, the second full-length feature film (First famous movie "Nekromantik") has no main character or character But with continuity in killing himself Each set of parts has complete self-destruction of strangers. Yes, the production cost is low and it is annoying, but in many ways the "Der Todesking" is very effective. More important than pure entertainment, unlike other people's work that is not scary. But there are undesirable images such as the episode scene on Tuesday, rotting corpses and various suicides. The last episode (Sunday) is very depressed and full of pain! - Amazing if you want my opinion. 10 out of 10 - Check out this post-modern shock! Disturb the art in pure form!
