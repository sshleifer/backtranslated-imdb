Spoiler alert !!!! <br /> <br /> I just watched the additional version of Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Although I like the extended version. But I hope they release the original version on DVD. <br /> <br /> Portabello Street may be cut down to its original length. It's too long and dragging the movie too. Although the dance is excellent But being on the DVD as a negative scene is much better. <br /> <br /> All of this is a great movie. My 5 year old likes it. And it's great that the movies I like when kids are being passed on to this new generation, and Mary Poppins is added to my collection. <br /> <br /> Like I remember! <br /> <br /> *** from **** <br /> <br />
