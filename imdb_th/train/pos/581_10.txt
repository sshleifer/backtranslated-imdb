The river flows through one of the films that are worthy of viewing in the cinema in order to watch the great movies of the movie. The performance was excellent and exaggerated with gestures and smiles and nodded to receive every meaning. Brad Pitt gave a brilliant performance and Tom Skerrit was powerful as a preacher father. This movie moves like a river. You must be willing to follow it through ebbs and currents. But it's worth it in the end.
