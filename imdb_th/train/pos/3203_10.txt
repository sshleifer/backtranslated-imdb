I think this movie is one of Kurt Russels' good movies. Kirk Russell is my favorite actor, so I think he is a good actor in every role he plays But this movie has a lot of action, and I know it should be more than 5.6 in the 10 meters of the meter, but many people don't like this movie. Oh well, I think it's good, so I think everyone should watch this movie. If you watch this movie and like it, I think you should see Back Draft with Kurt Russel as well. I give the soldiers *** 1/2 from *****
