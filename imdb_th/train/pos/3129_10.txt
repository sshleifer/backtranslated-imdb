This is one of the best combinations again, especially with Adam West and Bert Ward mocking himself and having fun while doing it. It is remarkable with the amount of effort that comes in particular details, adjusting the feel of the 1960s Batcave series, Wayne Manor, costumes and actors who choose to play the younger generation of the West, Ward, Burgess Meredith, Cesar Romero and Frank Gorshin! This 90-minute time is worth your time and is a pleasure for all fans in the "Batman" television series of the 1960s. I know that clips from "Batman" are from movies, not the series itself. Is due to legal restrictions, hoping that all three seasons of the program will come out on DVD
