Like his previous film, "In a Cage" Agust√≠ Villaronga succeeded in poetry, a poem that was more intense and distinctive than previous versions. Haunted Drama with originality, violence and violence combined with violence, threats to violence or laughter But never stepped into it In this way, it draws almost impossible abilities: above all heights and can still withstand a lot of pain, being charged and still not being punished for sure. Undaunted, gorgeous and tense ... This movie is great!
