I like the first movie because it tells an interesting story. But the story told in the movie feels like it has been shortened from a much longer story. Because this book has more than 400 pages, so there is a reason It covers the period from the 1920s to the 1970s in South America as well. I thought it would be better as a six-hour mini-series that would become a 140-minute movie. <br /> <br /> Even though it was hurried, the story didn't cross. A lot of confusion, what is said is quite good. One thing that is wrong is that the supernatural power of Clara is inconsistent. Whether they should appear more uniform throughout the movie's path or they should be left Two more mistakes (Which may be a spoiler): Esteban returned to goodness soon and Ferula's curse seems to have deteriorated even though the tone of the story indicates that it should endure forever. <Br /> <br /> The performance is great. Glenn Close As Ferula spinster, who is particularly tortured, Jeremy Irons, as a ruthless rich man himself, is also excellent. Even though she is good In the film she makes. Has a much smaller role that is well displayed as well The greatest mistake is that this film does not seem to be a local language coach. Each actor seems to speak different accents.
