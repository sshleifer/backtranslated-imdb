I enjoy this movie very much about the relationships that sometimes develop between American soldiers and Japanese women during the post-Japanese war - including obstacles that prejudice them Brando went from insulting Japanese people. (Which is common considering WW2) to fall in love with Japanese women and want to marry her His performance is fine. (I'm not a big fan of his acting style) and this movie has all the magic. The red button received an Oscar for his impressive performance from another GI who fell in love in Japan. But this movie is a good thing to watch with a tissue box. <br /> <br /> This film manages to say something and entertain at the same time. Gemstones that are of little value
