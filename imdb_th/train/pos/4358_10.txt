Okay, this movie deserves 7 out of 10 stars, but I voted for "10" to help compensate for the misleading rank from the handful of bozo that gave this review zero or 1 star. Each section for this poem shows. The great potential and promise for talented filmmakers ... Three people have achieved great success in producing Hollywood movies. The performance ranges from rough to impressive, with striking turns from Bill Paxton, James Karen, Vivian Schilling and Brion James. Martin Birdov may be a very cold temperament as a hypnotic hypnotist. The lamp flashes and looks like Lance Auguste is intentionally blurred as a victim of the lab. But overall, it has great laughs and some truly terrifying moments. Worth watching. Try to judge for yourself!
