Scoop *** from **** Woody Allen is not my favorite director, but I like "Match Point". It's a wonderful dark romantic thriller that is fortunate not to show Wood. It Allen has a beautiful Scarlett Johansson inside. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is Woody Allen's latest film, and although he appeared in the film In addition, with the qualifications of Scarlett Johansson and both working together perfectly. <br /> <br /> Johansson plays Sondra Pransky, a young college journalist who gets a moment of life from Joe Strombel's ghost. Joe heard The scooping sound on the boat, along with the terrifying harvesters and other spirits that the relic had taken One of those spirits was the secretary of Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman.) She told Joe that Peter could be a serial killer who roamed the streets of England. Joe, with the moments of his life, travels back to life and gives this information to Sondra during the magic show. Sondra is performing magic with the magician Sid Waterman. (Woody Allen) She became a volunteer in a lost box and while she was in the box, she was visited by Joe. Don't know what to do, she asks for help from Sid Waterman to help her solve the case. <br /> <br /> The film feels good compared to "Match Point" and still works. Johansson and Allen Can work together very well Allen's humor is perfect for this story and role. Hugh Jackman is a great man like Peter Layman, a "suspect" serial killer. <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie that you can see that you Looking for someone The band acted well together and the story was smooth and sometimes you forget that watching Woody Allen is yourself. I say give it a chance because you might like it.
