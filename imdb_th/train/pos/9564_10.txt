This must be the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Combining amazing movies with amazing performances and interesting plot. Made me catch my edge in some scenes, filmed with horror between others and let me sink in my tears after the end of the tragedy. <br /> <br /> The movie impressed me. It was a shocking violent scene compared to the intense and gentle 'love' scene. This film deserves the Cat III rating (naked); There are no nude scenes and the 'love' scene is not related to kissing or 'doing' <br /> <br /> The message that this film presented to me? Every human being, whether they look violent or cruel, is gentle. Edison Chen has done a great job by playing a part of the assassins. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie 10 / 10 It must look
