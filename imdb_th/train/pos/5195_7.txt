As a lover of bad movies, I am absolutely satisfied with this. The plot is not really bad. But there are cases where you have to ask yourself "What happened here?" <br /> <br /> There are many things that make this story the most fun. First of all, Rudy Ray Moore has fat and is very slow when the film was filmed with special effects consisting of speeding up the fight scene twice as fast. In addition, there are scenes that are slow-motion repetitive, slowly moving up to the top ten feet of the wall. (By playing from behind) naked men walking out of large letters <br /> <br /> Of course, none of Rudy Ray Moore's films will be complete without a blank and random comedy club scene at Rudy. Fun for every customer. There are many strange dances. The bad thing about this movie But they are not good in a fun way and if you take your eyes off the movie, you may miss the mistake again. <br /> <br /> Score: 1/10 for the true value, 10/10 for the cheese factor. , 10/10 for choosing errors and stupid people, average out to 7/10
