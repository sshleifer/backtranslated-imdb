This anime has been underestimated and is still The movie Daugherty's children are hardly as mentioned. I still come back here for 10 years after I first saw it. One of the better movies released I grew up in Genesis Evangelion and RahXephon. It's not near the depth. But try to look at it from a joyful perspective It's an entertaining story, not a question. <br /> <br /> Still one of my favorites, I came back as well when I felt like giggling. Don't say it's a movie that kids have a sad time in this story and you have to have humor to see it all.
