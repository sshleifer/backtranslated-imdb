I am always a fan of the full moon puppet. But I must say that Robot Jox is one of the better projects. Yes you hear me The story works well, the atmosphere is real, and the actors have scored well. Gary Graham, who made the mark on the TV program, such as ALIEN NATION THE SERIES and STAR TREK ENTERPRISE, shows that he can be a star-kicking actor and use name The motion stop effect may be slightly better. The wrong color. They look at the plastic for me instead of the metal they think is. But that's a minor complaint compared to all that is Robot Jox. If you like Gary Graham or other Full Moon movies, you will like this movie 9 stars out of 10.
