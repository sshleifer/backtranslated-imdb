I saw this last Friday at the Los Angeles Film Festival at Laemlee in Beverly. This movie received the most applause from all the movies that evening. When considering the two music videos that first opened, I didn't know what would happen because they were very fast and interested. I'm not sure I'm ready. But with my surprise, I really enjoyed this I think the devil's main character is really good. I was very impressed with his performance as I checked his name. I was surprised to see that this is a Witchblade man. He has improved a lot, especially since then! Regardless of whether he or he is given a role that is offensive or driven by the director in this short term The girl does not work well. I guess it's difficult because it's your first show and still young. Father is doing well as well. There are very good cg jobs for both of these things and the next short play "Mexican hat" which is good but I like this most because it has the deepest and most emotional and I also care about the other characters. It's very easy. The story is quite clear and gloomy! It handles real topics using more imagination, such as how to make people like me interested. We will not talk about the latest movie in the blog I left. My only complaint is that I only hope that I will see more demonic characters and start a little less, which is why I gave 9 out of 10. I still think that the end credits are a little slower. Otherwise, it was beautifully said, directed and edited. Time is very good with a complete change from fast MTV editing to everything nowadays. There will be more from this director in the future as well as actors. Now I will miss him as an actor missing from sadness, not a man. Witchblade
