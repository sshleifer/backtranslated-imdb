This movie made me a nightmare for many months and I'm 17 years old. This is the most horrible movie ever created. That's not an exaggeration !! I saw this film at school in English lessons and no one was afraid to surprise me. After reading other reviews, I am glad that I am not the only one who finds this thing very scary !!
