It should be a better movie. It was dragged to the score and the important story changed from Boyer to his mission as a boyer to avenge Wanda Hendrick's death. But Graham Green is a writer who is hard to break. His story is a moral tale due to his own consideration of Catholicism, guilt and innocence. (Conditions that are very relevant in his world view) and human condition. <br /> <br /> Boyer is Luis Denard, a concert pianist who joins the Republican Party in the Spanish Civil War. He was sent to England to proceed through the purchase of the necessary weapons. Unfortunately for Denard, he was himself - everyone in his dealings became the perfect cloak for Spanish Falagists, especially Katina Paxinou (Mrs. Melendez), a terrible home keeper and Peter Lorre (Mr . Contreras) International language teacher "esperanto" Wanda Hendrik is a boring person of a woman (Else) who works for Mr Melendez. Local diplomat Licata (Victor Francken) is a willing person of the Falangists. <br /> <br /> The Brits (Holmes Herbert, Miles Mander and the best - if not the worst - George Coulouris) don not Gave much hope to Boyer (Which he may soon be caught by England) Herbert and Madder have just escaped neutral policy, which has been ordered by the government of Ramsay MacDonald and Stanley Baldwin during the Coulouris civil war. In general, the type of blimp - always flawless in his original English words. He has a sharp edge in showing offensive foreigners in general. <br /> <br /> The only ray of hope is Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen) here Playing her role, as she did - but she did not really. She is a noble-daughter of the Bureau. It was Bacall's second film, and (sad to say) almost drowned in her long career. She performed well, but the spark she showed in her first film was due to a pair of performances. Humphrey Bogart and directed by Howard Hawks. Boyer is an actor. But he is not a bogie and Herman Chalmine is not a hawk Her next movie returned her to bogeys and hogs again and her star returned to the next position. <br /> <br /> It's a cool movie. Boyer's mission has never been successful, as he has too many enemies hidden everywhere. But the villain loses as well - often in their lives. <br /> <br /> With Dan Seymour as a suspicious foreign tenant of Katina Paxinou (and someone who destroys her) it is worth it. To keep an eye on the actors of Warner's role that works best because of weakness in the direction
