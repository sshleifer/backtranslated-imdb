Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) is unfairly accused of killing his unfaithful wife. The night she was murdered, he went out with a mysterious woman who refused to give her name. After the accused of the police murder came to visit wherever he was with her. But others remember that he was alone He was sentenced to death and his secretary (Ella Raines) set out to find the killer by himself because she loved him. <br /> <br /> This makes it a movie from Universal (see every actor-actor Characters and one star - Franchot Tone - when reduced) Budget is small and most actors do not know. But what came out as one of the best films of the 1940s, it was beautifully directed by Curt Siodmak and had a wonderful script from a great book by William Irish (Cornell Woolrich's pen name). Looks great And has an embarrassing jam session with Raines and Elisha Cook Jr., which just fell out of the screen with incredible sexual energy (I'm surprised that the sensor didn't cut it.) <br /> <br /> There are only a few. The flaw that makes this thing not perfect The sound gives awesome performance. He looks scary and he's scary. Curtis is also hard and gentle like Henderson. You really wondered why Raines loved him. But Raines is quite good in the lead role. She is beautiful and full of life. The last scene when the murderer was after she was never loud He was almost a physical threat and her reaction was too exaggerated. <br /> <br /> But I still give 9. This is a really great movie.
