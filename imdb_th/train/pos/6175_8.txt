I saw this pilot when it first appeared and I'm sure countless "souls" fans hate it because, like Batman, Green Hornet, etc. It uses characters in the direction of "Camp" but sees It was clear that I had never received enough Batman because I thought it was fun in the same way that was shown. There are two parts that are with me. The first time when Denny's partner was seriously injured and he spoke remarkably about the way he always stood for the law and obeyed its correct character. Then he said something like "My boy is stupid!" Which was his way of telling Denny to become a vigilante instead of what he did. (Even though it was Batman TV) then there was a scene in which he tried to seduce the villain to kiss him. But she was not deceived because he was too faithful to kiss her confidently! This is a good example of "camp", which is "underplayed" by both actors and actors.
