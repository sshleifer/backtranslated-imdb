Great quirky movie with enough twist for pretzels. Parker Posey plays a fragile and fragile sexy angel that may or may not be what she sees. This story is about a lot of cheeks and the dialogue is expert. Hints of humor and intrigue, which could not beat Posey's character well What are the disadvantages? This film needs your full attention, almost to the point of stopping the film and taking notes. Posey has more sex appeal than raising eyebrows over most female actors in the body. She is worth your time even if you don't understand the storyline.
