Wow, I love this movie! It's about normal life in a small village about hypocrisy and honesty, love and good surrender! It's about what everyone finds in life. You have to do things with passion. But some people will not appreciate your liking and will try to stop you There are people who search for opinions of others and 'What do neighbors think?' Is more important than following the heart. Don't let anyone's opinions prevent you from fulfilling your dreams and passion. I love the fact that all actors are really ordinary people. It may be my family. There is no great beauty. But everyone you love in the movie
