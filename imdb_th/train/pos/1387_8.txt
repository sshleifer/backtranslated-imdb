Somewhat slow (like the Sofia Coppola movie) but still an interesting movie about the discovery of sex among three teenage girls. The miracle of this movie lies in the ability to bring memories back to the senses of the era. Confusion and insecurity are expressed in a very simple way. But it is true to life The song is perfect and the performance is great. The camera works beautifully as well. I highly recommend for those who are not afraid to look back at a certain period of life when we discover our sexual impulses and desires. I would say it's a good movie for young people who have to go through that time. Many movies are created about teenagers. But this has garnered the true essence of discovering the world of love and the complexity of adults.
