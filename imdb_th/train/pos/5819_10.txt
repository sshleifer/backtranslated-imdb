I love this movie from the beginning. I am about nine years old and now I am 27 years old. I remember playing video games on Sega Genisis. I was very fun. I like to show my son in this movie. He likes Michael Jackson as well and I know he will love the movie. This is like I used to be when I was a child. Although he was younger than me when I first saw I can't wait to come out on DVD! I hope it comes out on DVD! Please leave it in DVD format !! I'm dying to see again !!! That is my opinion. I hope that one day soon I will go to see this movie again. I love all the videos in this movie. My favorite mini video is Badder!
