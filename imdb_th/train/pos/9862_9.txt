In the end I saw the shameful "ice age", in addition to not being funny and dead. The example I expected after seeing a great teaser, no bad words that I can talk about Of course, it's not charming like Disney production. (It is also Fox's first attempt in full length CG movies) but it has a great heart and on occasion (Like looking in the eyes of Manfred after us) I found myself tears. But when they reunited with their father, I couldn't catch them anymore. Movies that have no problem walking on thin lines of kindness and ancient thinking and manage to bring the best out The end result is creating the most impressive animation I've ever seen. Great funny character that grows quickly on you. (And excellent audio capabilities as well) and many memorable scenes, especially from the name of Scrat, make this movie more than enough to let it go Plus the Dodo scene, which is a funny scene that I like personally in 2002. <br /> <br /> I didn't get the truth. But for some reason it seems that CG animation will be the future leader. But if only means that there will be more movies (And those who can forget Pixar's creations)
