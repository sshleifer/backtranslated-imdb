Right. This movie is better than the book. Don't understand me wrong. I like books. But this movie is much better This film has the best Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall (I didn't see Scatman Crothers and obviously Danny Lloyd on other matters). Some ideas used in this film are better than the concepts used in this book. But I've talked about what is in my opinion in the mini-series. But I missed a few This film was filmed in a position that was better than the mini-series that was shot and the REDRUM scene was more scary than the scenes in the book. So if you are looking for a great movie, get Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, but have to rely on nightmares every night for 3 weeks.
