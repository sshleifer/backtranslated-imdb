Nothing (3+ outta 5 stars) Another strange place from the film director "Cube". This time, there are two main characters who find themselves and their home sent to be a mysterious white void. There is nothing truly outside their two-story home. Amazing to be sure But I think that the humorous tone created for this movie from traveling is a bad thing. Must have some humor. Of course ... and I have no problem with the humor that eventually comes from the fate of our two heroes. ("Their final showdown" is a hoot) ... but I think this movie really is. It would be much better if it was still rooted in reality at first. After watching the movie, I watched the "Creation" feature on the DVD and the short trailer at the end, almost without a funny "sillier" appearance ... making it look completely different. (And slightly better) The last half hour of the movie is when things start to come together ... similar to the latest movie "Primer". They would rather believe in the "normal" time than this. I might be ready to write this movie as a failed test at the center ... but it made me finish. (And watch the credit for the last scene ... don't ask me to explain)
