Like other critics, this movie is something I've always thought of. After 30 years, I remember going to the library, researching everything I could in this story. I also wrote to the PBS station for more information. Although all of this, all I can discover is that it was published in newspapers in the early 1900s. <br /> <br /> Fast until 2002 after many years of searching for eBay. Basic and there is a VHS copy of the movie. There is another bidder. But I am determined to win this movie The bidder who wrote the loss said that I asked for a copy that I gave to you. Even if I own a copy, I still find and search for it. Finally, searching for websites that sell DVD movies. You can find it at: http://www.johntopping.com/Harvey%20Perr/War%20Widow/war_widow.html
