It surprised me how much I loved this movie, even though I didn't really like dogs. Fox, Field and Ameche did a great job with the sound of Chance, Sassy and Shadow, and the animals themselves were amazing <br /> <br /> I've watched this movie for 72 times. It sounds scary, but it's true!) And every time the ending scene comes to me I recommend people of all ages and especially with animal lovers. Is the movie that I like forever!
