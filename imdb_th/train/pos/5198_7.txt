What can you say? He is the godfather of rap. He is the king of blaxploitation Z flicks and here he returns to be his most famous character, Dolemite! Can you dig it This movie is a politically incorrect joke, a parody of trikang, kung fu, nudity, cheese, violence and many other things that you never find in the most modern movies (Or any movie really, haha!) Should not miss the routine that he gave before! Whatever the way, D2 is a fun way to waste at least an hour. Dolemite: "He thinks he's not good and doesn't have a class! I gon 'rock this shotgun up * beep * a **! "
