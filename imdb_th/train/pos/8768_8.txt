I saw this movie at the shop in the cheap price. I remember seeing ads and trailers for many years. I thought, "What is hey?" Bought in general because the plot sounds interesting and Claire Danes is a person who has the ability in my eyes. Always (This is before I became a real fan of Kate Beckinsale) <br /> <br /> It's about two girls who secretly go on a vacation in Bangkok. (Which they were innocent) and then sent to Thailand prisons. This film will follow what will happen to them. <br /> <br /> Both Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale give a great performance and The story of this movie surrounds itself unintentionally and raises the question of good moral conversation. <br /> <br /> I think this is Good stable movie But there should be some improvement and it may be longer ... It will help strengthen these characters and the political understanding of the Thai justice system. <br /> <br /> In addition to that, it is a good movie with great performances. <br /> <br /> PS For your favorite things in pop culture, look for a two-minute role by Paul Walker. I watch movies
