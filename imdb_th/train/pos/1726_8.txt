While thinking of "The Great Escape", I allowed my mind to go back to the little gems of the movie from my childhood. I have read and read the new autobiographical novel since 1949, which is inspiring and when it comes to the cinema only. (We have never used that word) The second came, I was interested in exploring the reality of conflict, as shown in the memoirs and stories of the men who were there. Significant ago to buy any book on this subject, and finally read an interesting Hans Helmut Kirst and Erich Maria Remarque, who feel more deeply. However, the movie version is slightly different from the one that was originally delivered. <br /> <br /> The white-black-medium movies never served as in the past year. I have never seen any war in the form of Technicolor, which seems to be the real thing, as well as the deep chiaroscuros, such as "The Wooden Horse". In our childhood, I would accept it freely. <br /> <br /> And nobody likes Leo Genn as a British war hero anymore. On film, not even Sir Alex.
