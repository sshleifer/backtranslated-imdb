This great movie is quite scary, but it's very good for those of you who have heard of Columbine and know the story. In your heart, you know that people think about this. But you never know how bad it is and this movie makes you realize It's a serious matter. It also makes you think twice before you make fun of the exact person. I read a book about the Columbine massacre and made me think that this movie made me worried and scared me to death The downside is it's a way of killing people. Recommended for serial killers. I just received a threat and I didn't think of anything. But after this film, I think you should do everything seriously. Some people are crazy and you never know who they are. So be serious and don't evaluate anyone.
