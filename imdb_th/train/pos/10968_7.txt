The gray garden creates excitement and madness and you can't look out. It's strange and funny and sad and sick and really ?????? .. There are no words that can be explained. Gray Garden moves beyond the bizarre I found out about this film that read about my Uncle John's Big Big Reader by the Reader Reader and it was worth the rental and crashed to the top of my movie viewing queue. This movie is about the most strange people that may have ever filmed. One should watch it for their favorite Edie series, which I'm sure includes curtains. When I was older, I almost wanted to be like Big Edie, thumbs up her nose in normal and social conditions.
