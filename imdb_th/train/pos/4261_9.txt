I love this movie Not only because I'm a big fan of Moritz Bleibtreu, even though he's in all German movies. But because he is not the main actor Is a leader led by Barnaby Metschurat, which is the only reason to watch Julietta in 2001 and who brought this film on his shoulder. <br /> <br /> The family moved from Italy to Germany to find "German dream" (this is my own inventions and ironics) of cheap labor in the iron and coal industry However, they ended up opening a restaurant and traveling at the movie. At this point, only that was a good poem and at the same time was funny and charming. From this point onwards, most of the story is attributed to the two brothers of this family, Giancarlo (Bleibtreu) and Gigi (Metschurat). Gigi's dream of being a filmmaker was threatened by competition with Brother and mother's intention to return to Italy The following things are good - and totally neutral - see how life can happen from the choices you choose. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie doesn't say that life (Gigi's or Giancarlo) What is more Successful or full or more interesting It allows us to see what must be in the search for identity when two countries and the mind are involved. And this look is not driven by bitterness or disrespect for a particular country, which makes this film a great movie for every country related to the tensions caused by immigration The fact that director Fatih Akin moved to Germany from Turkey in the 70s was to borrow this film with credibility and emotional precision. The icing on the cake is a great show from all the actors, especially Meturut and - I have to stress. The performance of that child will be a difficult performance to follow anyone! Great movie to watch
