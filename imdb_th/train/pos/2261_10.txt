I saw this movie and playing and I have to add that this is the most impressive story I've ever seen. Until I saw this movie, I didn't know that the horrifying life and still existed for South African children and adults who were and lived in that era. It makes my tears and sadness to my heart that every human being should have fought like that just to live and to bring children out of that area and teach them to act and preform and make them. Loose to tell Their story is great. This is more than five stars. I rate ten people. Thank you Mr. Mbongeni Ngema for an amazing story. Although it has been 12 years since this story has been told But it is still a matter that is placed in my mind. If there is a VHS or DVD in the play, please let me know as soon as possible. Thank you. PS There is nothing wrong with children who want to be aware of the problems and conditions of They are interested in other countries in the hope that some people will have heart and help.
