Category: Dinosaurs, Animation, New York, Time travel, Circus? <br /> <br /> The main character: Rex the Tyrannosaurus rex, Elsa the pterodactyl, Dweeb the Parasarolophus, Ooo the Triceratops, a boy named Louis, a girl called Cecilia and Captain New-Ta. ? Actors: John Goodman (Rex), Yeardley Smith (Cecilia), Martin Short (Stubbs the clown), Felicity Kendal (Elsa) etc.? <br /> <br /> What happened: Four dinosaurs (see above) received some food. "Cereal cereal from the brain" and now is a cute and friendly dinosaur that is good for children. They go to New York with a big plan. <br /> <br /> My thoughts: This is an animated film that lovely The animations of dinosaurs when they go cute and friendly are quite floppy and not very good. But they also look satisfactory I like dinosaurs when they look cute and friendly. They are cute, friendly and good. I like almost all characters, especially Elsa and Cecilia. But of course I like other characters too. Overall, I like this movie a lot! :-) <br /> <br /> Recommended: people who like animation movies for good children, people who like dinosaurs, John Goodman and those who think that the circus is not something that seems fun! :-)
