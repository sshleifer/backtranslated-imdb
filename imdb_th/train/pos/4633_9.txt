This is another beauty in the movie directed by Eytan Fox. The movie presents the story of a cross-star lover. (One Israeli, one Palestinian) in Tel Aviv, modern The performance of this film is not only But comes from describing transnational conflicts But including personal conflicts and internal politics as well For example, there was a time when telling one of the gay secondary characters revealed into the hospital by his girlfriend who gave him flowers and tried to kiss him in front of his family to visit and suddenly we saw a wave of unrest. Conveniently washed through the room, apparently the young man did not reveal as much as he saw and the family did not accept as much as he might want them to be while the fans were confused and refused. Many complexities are contained in the fleeting moments. As we know from Yossi & Jagger, Fox is an expert in effectively filling the emotional and psychological complexities in a short order. The film is also effective for methods that present even cruelty together in Israel. And Palestine damage If you are not heartless, you will cry for the last three of the movie. Although the plot is about the story But it is written and executed wisely to remind us of a good, satisfying approach to sexuality.
