This film is one of Tom Cruise's best films. He embodies the imagination of the audience with the role of David Aames. His characters can relate to us in every aspect, whether it's a clever story and making audiences across the movie I never watched the movie of Cruise as I had before. But after seeing this, it shows his true talent. The part that I like in the movie is the end where everything comes to a great conclusion and he discovers the truth. If you haven't seen this, you should try It is one of those movies that when you start watching, you have to watch it until the end or it will make you think and you will regret. My opinion is that you should go and buy it and risk what I do and it will become one of my favorite movies of all time. Like it forever
