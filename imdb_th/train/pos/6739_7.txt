"Film Noir" is too much expression when talking about explaining movies. Every crime drama seems to be "noir", but "Where the Sidewalk Ends" is a good example of this type of story. <br /> <br /> Short, detective, crazy (Andrew) Life without intention to work for a villain The killings blamed the father (Tom Tully) of Andrew's woman who met and fell in love (Tierney) to protect his father from Old Sparky. Andrew swarmed the rest of the people and turned himself. <br /> <br /> Police with a moral offense are driven by motivation from the past His father is a bandit who is killed trying to shoot out of prison. But that did not justify his actions after he disliked the self-defense He immediately went to the phone to report the incident, but he hesitated. He was in hot water with the department and this could end his career. Then, at the wrong time, the phone rang. It was Andrews' partner and Andrews told him that the suspect that followed was not at home. He hid the body and then closed it by stared at the guard and left his body in the river. <br /> <br /> Encourage men to do stupid things? Was in his job at risk But now he committed a crime many times At least I think they must be doubly I counted the obstruction of justice, hurting, eliminating the body without permission, leaving garbage, first level mopery and having false witnesses with his neighbors. <br /> <br /> In the end, we don't know how to. Root for Andrew? The suspect didn't really die. But after the accident because Andrew didn't know he was a war hero and "There is a silver plate in his head." Perhaps it is such an ambiguity that causes nothing to happen above anything else, such as light. If Noir was nothing more involved than shooting blacks, murders, mysterious criminals and suspicious women, we would have to combine all Charlie Chan movies in that rubric. <br /> <br /> Andrew Beautiful. He is Mark Macpherson (from "Laura") who is bitter. He never laughs and doesn't smile even when sitting opposite the dining table from Gene Tierney. The situation seems to encourage smiles in many men. person He has no sense of humor. His anecdotes lay down. When he pushed the stool into the cab and said the chair "Be careful, I almost hit the head." Andrews riposte is "Never mind a taxi's insurer." Sometimes, Andrew may look like a stick. But this is a role that calls for a stubborn and humorous determination, and he manages well. His underplaying is perfect for now. A little jerk or flashes showing his thoughts and emotional state. And I guess director Otto Preminger stopped him from pronouncing the sub-topic "BOO-let" and the policeman named "POE-lice". I can't decide on Gene Tierney. She is a good role model for the daughter's role. Tom Tully But she is like Marilyn Monroe, who you can't separate the character that is adopted from the true personality traits. Tierney has a man who is innocent and almost a saint? When she answers the phone at home, does her voice have the quality of the vocals that appear on the screen? Poor Tierney had to go through bad psychiatric issues before having effective bipolar disorder. And Andrew, too, a cute guy, even though he seems to have been an alcoholist before finally recovering and declaring public service. <br /> <br /> The DVD commentary by Peter Muller is unpretentious. Information /> <br /> However, this is a good movie and a good example of Noir movie. Good people are not good at all, even though the bad guys are all bad. Perhaps ambiguity may be something that makes it an adult image instead of a popcorn movie. For kiddies, there is only one shot that has been fired on the screen and no one blasts an apology.
