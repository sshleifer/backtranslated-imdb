My favorite character in the movie But in almost every story, the character of Zorro has a little veil, and if the villain can't tell who is under that cloth, they are crazy s Fighting Legion "(Series 1939) His face mask makes it a real mystery for who Zorro is. <br /> <br /> However, Zorro is one of the best characters in the movie and always updated. Anthony Hopkins in the movie "The Mask of Zorro" (1998) <br /> <br /> The interest in my movies is vast. But I have a real passion for the cereals of 30s / 40s .... <br /> <br /> Bond2a
