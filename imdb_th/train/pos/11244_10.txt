One of my best movies might be because I entered the punk scene in the late 1970s and went to the Hazel concert many times. But this movie is a good story and a very good performance by Hazel and Phil Daniels. Sure about his latest Eastenders project !! Great performances from many unknown actors, which if you make your eyes peel off, will see them in many UK soaps today. Exp: carved from bill. The more I watch it, the more they I see if you don't see It still has a night in the video. Don't forget to dig the safety pins for your nose and the heavy black eye makeup and shave your Mochanian style head .... Have fun.
