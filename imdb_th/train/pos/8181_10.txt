Dentist Finestone is a dentist. He has a beautiful wife and a large house with a swimming pool. Suddenly he finds his wife going out with the pool attendant. He realizes that behind everything is clean. Corruption ... Corbin Bernsen is great because he is a dentist - he can believe completely. There are a few surprising scenes. But the dental torture scene is quite nasty and grotesque. Very recommended "The Dentist 2" is worth it to go out!
