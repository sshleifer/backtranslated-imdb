A great movie that shows how people connect with beads that have been exchanged during Mardi Gras. This movie is more than a description of globalization. In fact, it made the workers in China be the owner of a bead supplier factory in New Orleans and even a stranger in New Orleans. The most striking thing is the director's ability to tell complex stories with complex details in a simple and glamorous style. The access to his factory is amazing, another interesting aspect, and I just wish I could know how he got inside. It is a beautiful story without feeling or feeling guilty about it and the conclusion gives hope without making people feel alienated.
