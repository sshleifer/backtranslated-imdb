The minute I started watching this, I knew I was watching quality production, so I was not surprised to find that the screenplay was written by Andrew Davis and produced by Sue Birtwhistle. Both of these stories made us proud and Prejudice. 1995! So the only thing that caught me here is that Emma didn't run to 3 or 4 or maybe six episodes like pride and injustice. The performance is great. I think Prunella is great like Miss Bates, but I like Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong. The language is happy to hear. You can imagine today and the age where people go without having to say vows. True or not, Samantha Morton is great as Miss Smith. In fact, the casting is very similar to Pride and Prejudice. I like it so much that I watched it twice in two days !! Therefore, thank BBC again for another quality TV program. I've seen the Paltrow version and it's ok, but I think the BBC version is much better. Excellent production that I am very happy to own on DVD !!!
