The straight story is the story of an old man who decided to visit a sick brother who lived throughout the state. He decides to travel on his mower while he can't drive, and he wants to tear himself. This film demonstrates his journey and the life he has touched beautifully. <br /> <br /> Richard Tennworth turned out to perform beautifully, just like the rest of the actors Sissy Spacek. The most striking of the performances that were loved as his daughter and Harry Dean Stanton in the extremely small but important role. <br /> <br /> At first I felt the story of an old man's old journey across. The country is boring. But soon I discovered that Lynch, with in-depth information about human life, made this movie I would recommend to everyone.
