Good movie Tell the story of the fantasy that children tell us about how we are trapped in social situations and what measures must be taken in different ways. Or at least a feeling: you must violate every rule If you want to show love for someone you don't know, what do you do without creating an urgent social situation? It is also about fascism in making decisions about other cultural life, which is a culture attached to our throat. What makes Disney or Fox or a suicide bomber have the right to decide what is our choice? A person who is not allowed to drink only one morning coffee by himself We have to listen to NRJ's shout, see headlines, stupid news, and street advertisements before we eat coffee in the morning?
