Garam Masala is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen in every age. Akshay Kumar is great as a flirtatious woman who has engaged in 3 women and is involved at the same time. John Abraham enjoyed sometimes, and this is one of his best works. Up until now, Paresh Rawail was as wonderful as most of his films. Director Priyadarshan delivered great movies in the past, Hera Pheri, Hungama and Hulchul are the best people. Garam Masala is the most fun movie he created. Three new actors are common. Rimi sen doesn't have much scope in this film. I was impressed that Priyadarshan created a movie with a simple story of a man who had a relationship with three women at the same time. The 3 girls had a holiday on the same day and ended in the same house. Full of laughter, this is a complete entertainment provider.
