One of my favorite movies It has everything, including the soundtrack of Eddie Clark's ex-motorhead, many motorhead action figures, lots of laughter, totally ridiculous plans. Eddie, a guy who wants to be left alone, is broken. Leslie (About wet as they came), Nuke (burnt stone), Eddie's mother and Ozzy as a preacher (Of course he was in America?) Then there was a boy. (Rich man, stone man and fool) and girl (Empty, nonsense, and foolish people) What would you ask for? <br /> <br /> First of all, there is Sammi Curr, a rock star, a group of 80s alchemists, everyone you think. How about a rocket guitar that fired rockets? Then there was a scene where Sammy pulled an old woman through the TV screen and broke her. What does Roger do? Why lift her up like a good person My favorite scene is that Tim Hainey has won his long overdue award from Sammi through the wet fingers in the plug-magic! <br /> <br /> If you become a rock in the 80s or just love a movie without The material that I do Then check this It is available on DVDs and very cheap (trick or) take care of yourself.
