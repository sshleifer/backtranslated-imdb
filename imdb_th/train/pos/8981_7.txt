dig! I will tell everyone, even if you don't like Metallica to watch 'some kind of monster'. It is a documentary about one of the biggest bands in the world that behaves like a mental child during the collapse. It's fun and fascinating. In the same direction, dig in! A film about 'the Dandy Warhol's' and 'the Brian Jonestown Massacre', two bands from Portland that started the music industry in a city with a hometown for a band to become a big band, a book from the beginning of the band Both will pull in the opposite direction of being able to decide whether good or bad. Filmed for seven years and sometimes painful to watch, we saw the rise of meteorology for fame (thanks to vodaphone ads!) And Jonestown from the creators of the scene to the impatient. When the band became more engaged, the friendship stretched tirelessly, and in many ways there was controversy and even on stage battles. All of this is half funny and sad, and believe it or not, there are people who look wrong as I said. At first, you can watch Metallica movies, even if you don't care about digging! On the other hand, will be slightly different and more fun and much easier to see if you are interested in both bands. Is still a good movie and is a proof that is not in the band rather than encouraging a career path. Dig! Is sitting on the tail of the rock and roll and is a good example of the error and satisfaction of being or wanting to be famous
