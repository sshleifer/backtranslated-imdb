There are many people who are not fair. Sh! T in this series, but many videos of Guinea Pig are quite fun. In particular, the experiments of demons have some wonderful effects. But the shameful eyeball scene only But there are also very realistic skin parts on the hands and hands that are hammered with a huge hammer that is very realistic, especially the ancient video. <br /> <br /> Let me start at the beginning now for those who Unknown: This movie is a movie "Torture / Counterfeiting" extreme "that happened in Japan in the mid-80s. It's a simple plot: There are a few girls forced to accept. The cruel torture to see where her breaking point is. This caused brutal violence - effective real effects, including what is mentioned in the last paragraph, as well as the use of painful hot oil on the arms of a woman who was caught and placed worms in the wound. <br /> <br /> The least effective sequence is at the beginning of the video and consists of an unbelievable slap session where three men take turns. The placenta leaves the girl while her head falls, and the second that the three men take turns kicking women. And pushed her to the ground Both of these scenes have clear scenes and deviations from the realities of the remaining litigation. <br /> <br /> Actors who play as victims of "trials" are quite convincing to be painful and spend enough time. appropriate Things that are inappropriate and rough on the camera Her reaction while she had the earpiece next to her head and the loud sound coming up for hours ended. The other harassment she received was frustration in the net from the tree during the time she had rested. There is also an annoying scene in which the captors giggled through her courage and another disgusting scene in which she spun in the office chair and forced to drink Jack Daniel's bottle until she pukes. <br /> <br /> If you don't see this series, I hope I can help you decide if you want to be a shock or not. 8.5 / 10 For the demons experiment
