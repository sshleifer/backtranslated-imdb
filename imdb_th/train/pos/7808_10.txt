This is a movie that everyone should watch. In addition to adding enormous points (While South Africa is undergoing recovery, there are still many other countries in similar situations at the moment.) It is a great thing, while Denzel Washington gives the best of his career. A good job, though not as amazing as Washington, John Hawthorn is focused on the police chief. <br /> <br /> There are many areas where the film of apartheid may fall. But these things can be avoided It's easy to show that white people are bad people and blacks as good people, but Attenborough doesn't do this. Of course, there are some white characters that seem inherently evil, such as the captain at the Soweto protest. But adding additional dimensions to every character will make this film unbearable. Some people complain about the length of this movie. But I think it takes two and a half hours to tell the whole story because it's really incredible. <br /> <br /> The best scene. In this movie is the funeral of Steve Biko. When the whole crowd starts singing the national anthem of South Africa, it may be one of them if not the most exciting scene I've ever seen. Watch this movie: Look, it may not be easy to watch. But certainly worth it
