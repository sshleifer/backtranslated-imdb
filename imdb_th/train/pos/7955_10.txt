This is one of the greatest children's pet movies ever created. I cry every time I see the shouting shadows. "Wait, I'm Peter!" While the family car is pulling out. This is a must see that you love animals! The best movie! The lines in the movie are sometimes stupid. Like when Sussie spoke to the prospect; "The rules of cats and dogs drool!" These lines that I can do without But when I was six years old, I bet I liked that line. The story may seem to have something, but I like it as a big dog that is preparing the opportunity to take over him when he is gone. It reminds me of my childhood dog. I think everyone can find their own pieces in "Homeward Bound".
