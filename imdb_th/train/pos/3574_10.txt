It's hard to say sometimes why movies are effective. From the first moment I met "The Stone Boy", there was something that told me that it would be a great movie. Although it seems unlikely that I will have the opportunity to see myself. Then one day, while watching the online catalog of my local library, I saw that they had just bought this movie DVD. Which I am very glad because the movie has incredible depth and quality, which the old VHS copy cannot reproduce. <br /> <br /> And talking about movies, I have to do it as far as possible. The most amazing thing about this movie As a photographer who is looking for a style that is almost like the picture in "The Stone Boy", I believe in the fact that the great filmmakers are able to shoot movies by hand alone. Here he has received a lot of help from highly talented actors and directors who understand that the story needs nothing but the presence of Juan Ruiz Anch√≠a behind the camera, making almost every scene beautiful. And you almost never have a way to speak Most movies never expect anything like this to you. The behind-the-scenes scene captures some details, a little visual magic that makes you breathe out. <br /> <br /> Director Christopher Cain has a long and interesting career. As far as I can gather, this movie is not very representative of it. But sometimes capturing the director near the beginning of his career before the budget and loss of concentration will have a really delicate magic. Cain stepped back in the film, allowing things to happen to his life. They themselves and then again Like the first John Sayles movie, the characters have space to breathe when talking. Side stories happen because they do and that is life. Adam and Eve show an amazing, raw and painful understanding, even immediately about the human nature of this film. <br /> <br /> The show connects this story together. When people talk when they are in this movie, they do as real people, not because they play. The script characters of Gina Berriault help talented and famous actors such as Wilford. Dubrimley, Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Frederic Forest only spent time. No matter what they say is important or deep, it comes with the weight of pure reality. <br /> <br /> When you look at the related actors or the wonderful songs of James Horner looks strange that the film is almost forgotten. Perhaps what made "The Stone Boy" was the time when it was created, there was a hangover feeling this 1970s with this image which reminded me of my childhood deeply. People talk about the 80s in terms of style and modern music. But that's not the 80s that I live or remember. The appearance of the image, the perceived quality of the show is low and gloomy and the overall results should be under the skin of any person who grew up in or near the era of time in North America. I see myself in this story. I see that I see the world. And movies like "The Stone Boy". See how the world really is. <br /> <br /> For more of this feeling please see: <br /> <br /> The Black Stallion (1979), never cry Wolf (1983), Gentle Mercy (1983), Wills (1983), Place in the Heart (1984), Matewan (1987), High Tide (1987), Miss Daisy Drive (1989), Secret Garden (1993) , The Secret of Roan Inish (1994), Wendy and Lucy (2008)
