In the 1990s, the world of cartoons on Disney TV was important. Performances such as Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers, DuckTales and Gummi Bears were already popular, and now Disney has created another great cartoon. The cartoon is called TaleSpin. It's about the old Jungle Book character Baloo the Bear while he was working in the plane business. In this series, he met former Cloud Clairker, Air Pirate, and a great cloud surfer, businesswoman Rebecca Cunningham. This series is very funny and there are many penalties that you may not understand as a child. But understand later in life This is a series that is cleverly written and is great to add to your DVD collection. Parents buy this thing for your children instead of allowing them to watch all the awesome jukebox cartoons. If you like TaleSpin, go to "Darkwing Duck" and "Goof Troop". Spin it!
