** warning! Front spoiler! ** <br /> <br /> This short part is the second part described in the short section of "The Matrix", in which Morpheus explains that the matrix comes. Because we already know the story, the story is not surprising and short, it does not entertain as much information. But that is the method presented as a file in the history archive The image is better than the average and the color is generally cool. It helps in short-term issues. <br /> <br /> A few problems. The violence of the story is a little bit of story, and when combined with occasional political correctness (Scenes of the United Nations) Keep away from short lectures. In addition, must also look at the second part completely. <br /> <br /> Animatrix's concept is great and even if there are some issues It will not fit the original movie in the style, content or flow. This is the perfect way to reveal history. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Good information should be told a little better. But still solid 7 out of 10
