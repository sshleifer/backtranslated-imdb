Carmen is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It is difficult to say which performance is the best: Antonio Gades, Christina Hoyos and Laura Del Sol are excellent. They dance spirits out. It is a beautiful story of separation from life and mythology; Legend permeates daily life Dance became a life and danced to life. Real people at one time use their own lives and become others to act as loved ones of old people. The magic is in progress.
