I saw this film in the sixth grade during the Christmas season and I was very excited to see it and when I heard that George C. Scott was there I was really excited because I loved George C. Scott! When I and my class were watching this movie, I really came in and when it ended I was really impressed. I thought it was really great! This is the best version of Charles Dickens's classic novel I've seen! George C.'s performances Scott, because Scrooge is something else, I think he is the perfect choice. He is Scrooge. He is the last Scrooge! I've seen two different versions of A Christmas Carol. Another version is Patrick Stewart. But this is a better one! <br /> <br /> The great thing about this is acting. I think that every great actor is the soul, Tiny Tim, Bob Cratchit. Everyone, they can't find anyone better than those. he They make parts! But the best part of the movie is George C. Scott! When I saw him, I thought he was the best! He is a clear Ebenezer Scrooge. I don't think they will meet someone better! I don't think they will find anyone better to replace anyone in the movie! <br /> <br /> This movie is probably the movie adaptation of the classic movie by Charles Dickens and I think you will agree. You will think that this movie is great! I might have to buy this movie on DVD because I think it's really great! I advise you to see this masterpiece completely! This is the best version of A Christmas Carol. <br /> <br /> 10/10
