This is a great example of what can be done in a small budget movie. The performance is great considering the script & the whole atmosphere of this movie is very intuitively stabbed and used as necessary (Beware of death, excellent barbed wire) and alkaline action when using Is the fact that there are times to avoid the script in the script But compared to other movies with the same budget Overall, I recommend Trust me, it will be better than it appears! 8/10
