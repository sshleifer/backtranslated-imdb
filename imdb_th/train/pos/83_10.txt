A few years ago, I added comments in IMDB on "The Real McCoys". I have already spoken and repeated. Now it is a charming, funny and entertaining program performed well with great characters. < br /> <br /> I just saw on the old four episodes plus 2000 reunion with Richard Crenna, Kathy Nolan and Tony Martinez. As other authors have mentioned here, it is surprising that Lydia Reed (Hassie) and Michael Winkelman (Little Luke) are not referenced. But maybe they can follow through SAG or AFTRA. <br /> <br /> Reunification The performance was very good and gave us a lot of insights in the show. One of the insider information that we didn't receive was that Kathy Nolan was sorry for stopping to show up in an unwanted contract dispute which caused Luke to be a "widow" last year, which was not very good. Nolan made a burst of comedy "Broadside" about a female nurse in the Pacific in WW II. Get it attacked? No, no joke. <br /> <br /> Unlike the dirty, disgusting and violent tracks on TV right now, which destroys our values, "The Real McCoys", which provides entertainment with reasonable values ​​and good humans And I thank everyone involved, including the creator Irving Pinkus, who brought it to my family We never miss it.
