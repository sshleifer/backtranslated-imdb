In 1954, Marlon Brando was a popular actor after performing in the Streetcar. Named Desire and On The Waterfront, Frank Sinatra has yet to invent himself on the silver screen. But Sinatra's image before Nathan Detroit helped to create Sinatra for his fans again. <br /> <br /> It's a great screen version of that play. Excellent and the choice of leaders and excellent players Imagine a movie that Brando sings? This was his only singing role as he performed Sky Masterson. In addition, female lead actor Jean Simmons and Vivian Blaine (Showing her role as Nathan, a long-suffering girlfriend of Nathan) tried her best The special mention is Stubby Kaye, the great man (as well as Nicely Nicely) and with respect to Eric Clapton. There is no Rockin 'The Boat. Which version even comes close to Stubby Sheldon Leonard Famous people as TV producers like The Danny Thomas Show and The Dick Van Dyke Show do wonders. "Harry Whitehorse" BSPulley great as courteous and polite parlance rough "Big Julie" and even Regis Toomey was delivering excellence to him as "Brother Arvide" <br /> <br. /> It is one of the funniest musicals that have seen good humor and you have received Sinatra and Brando Soooooo "Luck A Lady Tonight" and brother ... "It's your dice"
