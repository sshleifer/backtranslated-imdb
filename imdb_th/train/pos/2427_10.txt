This is an excellent unknown movie. The perfect dialogue with no old ideas. This movie relies on the actor's ability and it is pulled out. But it's not too much in life The crime drama should be non-special that affects the garbage and the sex that is thrown in. I especially like the race. <br /> <br /> The actor now Laurence Fishburn is a great person to play as a crime assistant assistant. It's a shame that he is only allowed to show his abilities in his own movie. Titus Welliver is a novel as Fishburne Eamonn Walker's half-sibling adds flavor to the perfectly cooked movie. Paul Calderon is excellent as a grease monkey / drug addict. I have liked his performance since "The King of New York", but the best performance in this film comes from Gregory Hines and Michael Paul Chan, who were perfectly matched as Calderon's two followers. <br /> <br /> Once in Life is the absolute goalkeeper **** 1/2 * from *****
