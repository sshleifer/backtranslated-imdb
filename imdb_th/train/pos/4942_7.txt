I have to admit that in the first half of the movie I lost my way. There is a little funny humor, but the best is the naked outline and the general pointless feeling that is going to make me think that I am wasting time from that - without a clear reason. With this There was no unaware of the moment and there was no dramatic scene that made me. In fact, nothing exciting happened in the entire movie. As if I just knew immediately that the film had no great purpose and in its pointlessness was its charm. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman is an actor with no small project name. Little "to start his career He will play as a supermarket manager and spend the day in a supermarket in the neighborhood to research the role. At that time he found and bound with Scarlet (played by Paz Vega) - the cashier who wanted more life. He helped her prepare for a job interview, as if she were casting herself for the role as she introduced him to real life. It looks really funny. "He" (because that's the way the character is identified on credit) is dominated by going to the Target Store. <br /> <br /> Freeman and Vega are great together Convincing sort of romantic chemistry But father and daughter If you feel lost in the first place Eventually, it became a delightful charming movie. 7/10
