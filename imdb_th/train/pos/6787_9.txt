Last night I stumbled upon TCM. <br /> <br /> I have never seen it before. But never forget. <br /> <br /> I forgot how beautiful and Signe Hasso was when she was still young. For Shelly Winters before she went out /> <br /> Ronald Coleman, though, is an important state actor of his time and hates it after seeing "A Double Life". <br /> <br /> The Gordon / Kanin writing team is at the top of the script. This is finished - <br /> <br Movies that should be worth remembering and looking new.
