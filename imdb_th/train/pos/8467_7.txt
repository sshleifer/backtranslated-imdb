I like this movie because in general it can do less. It's more interesting if they keep it in the studio even more. (Although some elements of the plot are more difficult to develop) <br /> <br /> People who play DJs work well. From showing someone who was deceased and possessed in his memory I also found his conversations with people calling into funny people. <br /> <br /> While some parts of the movie can be seen a mile away, <br /> I think it's a ghost story. At the very least, most focus on the housing side of the last 5-10 minutes is quite good when it is revealed. <br /> <br /> While it's a short film But felt the right time to tell the story Again, it will start dragging
