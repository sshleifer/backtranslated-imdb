This movie is great! While funny and entertaining, it is a deep and eye-opening story. I'll watch it again and again. Bruce is a man who is not satisfied with his life. He has work and life. But it's not what he thought would lead him to happiness Bruce is a bitterness, resentment and displeasure that his life is not the way he should be. As a result of this mental state, Bruce broke up his job and blamed God for everything he thought was wrong with his life. God came to Bruce and gave him the power of God. Bruce used these powers to get everything he needed. Finally, his life is what he imagined to make him happy ..... With one exception In the process of receiving everything, he truly lost the person who loved him. Bruce knows that the real changes that have to happen in his life are not situations. But his perception of what was there This film is inspiring and profound. If you really pay attention, it will force you to look at your life with humble respect for the fact that when we are happier than we remember As my wife said "Since when did anyone know what made them happy?" And besides my humble addition "Let us not lose ourselves and those who are important while we try to search."
