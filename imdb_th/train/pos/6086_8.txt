I saw this movie about a year ago and found it funny. Laugh-Out-Loud completely true winner in my mind It has underlined the stupid comedy movie. But there are real stories as well In fact, like the popular funny elves It has a few important moments that are separated between the buzz. When Stiller shoots Black's horse, which is a normal time, you will find yourself laughing at humor. You can find a real co-spot while I'm sure many people do what they don't want their friends to know so your friendship will end. <br /> <br /> When I know how much People don't like this movie, I feel completely ashamed. The horrible movie like Napoleon Dynamite has a higher rating, which makes me wonder about the reasons for people in IMDb. Use my advice and rent. If you don't find yourself laughing at least once, I will compensate you for rent = D
