Fearful Symmetry is a satisfying and slightly flawed episode. The first thing about now is happening near the Mountain Home Air Force Base in southwest Idaho. Season Deep Throat takes place near Ellens Air Force Base, which is in the southwest of Idaho. I wonder if the air base is the same or not. But they decided to use the real name in Fearful Symmetry Mulder and Scully had a good conversation. Ed Meecham, the zoo keeper, reminded me of the cranky teachers. Just as he had to take care of more animals. At one point I liked the concept of now. But I feel that it has some inconsistencies If aliens are proficient in human abduction and safely return them, why can't they bring the animals back to the right place? And the aliens now have problems in returning animals? I do not buy Mulder's theory that there is a problem with the continuity of spacetime. As if he were an expert in that matter I still think that Jayne Atkinson's performance because Willa Ambrose is not doing well. In addition to those nitpicks, I still enjoy now because of the interesting idea of ​​aliens harvesting animal DNA and human DNA
