This movie has no part in which most hilarious jokes are just funny units, but it doesn't have any really bad parts. The worst part is Sid's voice. He was too sluggish for me in about 5 minutes. I wasn't comfortable hearing him speak. In addition to the annoying sound that is annoying, the movie is good. There are many jokes that if you catch them will make the movie much better. This is a good movie for children. There is enough in there to provide adult and sufficient content for raising children. This is definitely worth it if you have children and want to watch movies with them.
