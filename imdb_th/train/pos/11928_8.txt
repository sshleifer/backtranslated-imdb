This film, while watching from the same movie in 1951, screened by MGM and starring Janet Leigh, is still a great movie. Danny Glover, one of his best works, made George Knox a baseball manager. Fortunately, there was a bad mood. For this film is "Stack". How about adding Christopher Lloyd. (His stage experience works and shows through in his performances on the screen, great actors) Joseph Gordon-Levitt and experienced Irish actors) Tony Danza (yes, even though he Will be good at this) Matthew McConaughey (he stole the performance in Dazed and Confused and his role may not be important in this film But he revealed) Adrian Brody (What I said about Matthew McConaughey is the same for Adrian, except for the confusing and confusing part) Some of the great actors, such as Taylor Negron ( David), Tony Longo, McDonough (Whitt Bass) and veteran veteran in his last performance, Ben Johnson (Hank Murphy, owner of California Angels) and the rest of the actors, doing great work with great stories. I don't care what you are falling in love. I like this. The movie as a child and bring memories back when I watch today I need this on DVD. I advise parents who are looking for things that their children don't see and others for that matter.
