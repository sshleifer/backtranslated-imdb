Creating The Thief Of Bagdad is quite a story of himself, almost as a miracle as described in this movie. Alexander Korda almost invaded the movie. <br /> <br /> According to the book series about Citadel Film The Great British Films, the adopted son of the United Kingdom, Alexander Korda, thinks of it since the beginning of 1933 and spent many years. Planning and preparation But World War II, unfortunately, with Korda and the cost of filming a great movie. <br /> <br /> Budget expenditures also occur in US movies. Cecil B. DeMille always has free hands. At Paramount after 1932 when he returned there But DeMille or one of his American people had to worry about bombing the enemy while filming. As part of the filming, Korda relocated the entire company to America and filmed the sequel to Rex Ingram as a genius in our Grand Canyon. Of course he would not get that kind of view. In the UK, Korda completed the interior decoration in Hollywood all the time for the Christmas debut of 1940. <br /> <br /> The image was Nominated for The Thief Of Bagdad, four Oscars and three Academy Awards Art and best direction for color film and special effects Only the original music score of Miklos Rosza that was not awarded in the genre that was named Korda had to be truly happy about the decision to shoot in the Grand Canyon because it was impossible to get the color image. Not good from that place. <br /> <br /> Special effects But does not overwhelm the simple story of overcoming evil The good thing is that the two young lovers, John Justin and Jupiter Prez and the evil, are Conrad Veidt as a magician who tries to steal both the kingdom and the heart. This is the occupation of Veidt until Casablanca, which he plays as the major stroesser of the Luftwaffe army. <br /> <br /> Of course, a little help from an unlikely source. Boys and bandits, Sabu, may be one of the few people who can call themselves an international movie star. Indeed, the rise of poverty that worked as a stable elephant boy for Maharaja of Mysore, he was seen by Alexander Corda, who wanted him a local leader for one of his forest qualities. The innocence and malignancy of every child as he fills the dream of the Arabian night of the boy who overthrew the tyrant Not a bad message to send out in 1940. At that time, <br /> <br /> The Thief Of Bagdad is outstanding today. It's an eternal love story and an adventure in any order you want to wear.
