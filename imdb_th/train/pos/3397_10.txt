Soylent Green IS ... is a really good movie. <br /> <br /> I never thought of it. I don't like Heston in his sci-fi efforts. He is one of the actors who like Superman, dealing with scoffing and invincibility at all times. I like the weaker heroes And of course he ridiculed the way through Soylent Green as well, but since he should be a highly confident bully, I don't really mind. <br /> <br /> I can understand why some people change their nose he At this film, Soylent Green does not require any effort to create a future image. (What you know - looks like in 1973) and no movement But I admire the vision of the film about a society that is complex, highly damaged and stratified, and I'm glad to see that Edward G. Robinson has a funny and impressive final role. A good little character moment - like when he shared precious food with Heston - making a real movie. <br /> <br /> Soylent Green's message is related today when no one knows what the government is or the company. Depends on jokes, right? Seeing Heston in the master Michael Moore movie ...
