The United States continues to fight the Second World War. (The movie was released during the VE day and VJ day) Any studio that has the value of salt is to create a fight film in which brave American soldiers defeat the enemy or the American people in general, singing and dancing. Technicolor Musicals is What America thrived in the era of decline when everything was allocated Most of the musicals today are just a group of musical tangles and the best plot there is to fill the time for the next musical! I feel that now people who watch this movie happen after the 1970's fall. We forgot this soon. <br /> <br /> This movie may be called "The Search for Jose Iturbi" but now every People wonder why. Let me explain from 1929 - he came to America - until he died in 1980. Iturbi is one of the best pianists to organize concerts. He agreed to make a few movies in 1942, but Hollywood after him for almost a decade at that time was not only a great pianist. It is also a successful band. Iturbi is a household word for over 40 years. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Iturbi and 17 other pianists played one of Liszt's rhapsodies was planned. From the beginning - and no one noticed that other pianists were all children, right? Joe Pasternak, the producer of this film and many other MGM musicals, is credited to Iturbi and America's interesting youth in the music class. Classic Grayson wanted to experiment with Iturbi in the movie, unlike real life. At that time, everyone wanted Iturbi. Back then, the joke among the soldiers was "GI", meaning "Get Iturbi" (he performed many concerts at the military base). <Br /> <br /> Gene Kelly is a great dancer and Frank Sinatra is a great singer. When the film was created, Sinatra was only 30 years old and was under contract with Columbia Records for four years. Kelly is well known as a dancer. But then Itber is known around the world for over 20 years. <br /> <br /> And for the lack of a plot, Americans don't want to plot. They are tired of the war, they are sick with fear for the people they love and worry about the future. They want happiness and hope and confidence that things will eventually work. They want music and smiles, happiness and romance. This movie and others like it. Deliver the necessary things. <br /> <br /> Lecture enough. The mouse dances together. The best scenes in the movie take place between Sinatra and Iturbi, where each of them "doesn't know" to compliment other people's songs. <br /> <br /> If you have an interest in Jose Iturbi, the Spanish conquerors are more.
