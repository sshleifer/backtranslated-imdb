Wonderland is an interesting film that is associated with the famous movie star John C. Holmes in the brutal Wonderland murder case <br /> <br /> Promoting this movie makes us misunderstand that it is the media of Boogie Nights's romantic industry. And that's not the case. A few references to the writer John John Holmes as a porn star and editing the John Holmes movie in real life. With murder and how did it happen? <br /> <br /> Although it is misleading that this film is actually involved, the performances from all the actors are excellent and I want to say that Valki Almer is great in his ability. All courtesy of John Holmes. I am fully convinced that I am watching what John C. Holmes might look and act like in real life. <br /> <br /> If you are a John C. Holmes fan or like stories about Hollywood, then I think you will enjoy watching the Wonderland
