First of all, I just want to say that this movie is more raw than the shit that has passed from Hollywood to the stomach. McBain is a real action movie that is more violent than most viewers. Able to cope It has all the classic elements of action movies in the late 80s / early 90s ... Random violent actions (for example, when Walken and the crew go face to face with drug dealers to get their money Will appear and kill them Instead of allowing them to live and take their money only Is the best in this picture, which has memorable lines like "Come sit on the deck" and others that make this movie the ultimate purchase from Clearence shelves at local video stores. If you have bloodthirsty for unnecessary random acts of violence, rent a movie today and satisfy your thirst.
