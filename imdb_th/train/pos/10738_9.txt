The 9/11 spoiler is a very good and realistic documentary about the attack. WTC.2, a French filmmaker based in New York to film the actions of the NYFD, is facing this event and making it the most useful first. At 9/11, nothing actually happened, which made the horror movie even more like the scene. On the day of the attack, it seems to be another boring day. But soon it will be transformed into one of the filmmakers who traveled with the firefighters that he first shot the plane crashed. This is the only image of the first impact. He drove the fire truck to the WTC and entered the building. When the second plane collided, people understood that this was not an accident. In the next phase, we would see a firefighter planning to save as many people as possible. While we heard the sound of these bumps being the sound of people jumping down from the tower and falling on the ground, this was the most grueling moment in the documentary. Then when the tower collapsed and our French friends had to run away. Go for your life Heard his breath like a madman while he ran out of the building. Then the sandstorm gusted and the screen turned black. He was very lucky to survive and now he can shoot empty roads. Blank of Downtown New York because this film has a long history and because this film is completely different, this documentary may be in everyone's memory. Saw the attack live at home because I had an afternoon of days to see 10/10
