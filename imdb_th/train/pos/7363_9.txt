This is not a love song. <br /> <br /> One of my conclusions in this movie is "Great." <br /> <br /> It might not attract people to watch public movies? It's a movie. <br /> <br /> Forcing you to join. You observe and ask questions. <br /> <br /> Can compare with Deliverance (topics / themes) and <br /> <br /> Maybe with The Blair Witch Project for the overall shooting style. <br /> <br /> However, this movie is unique, both. <br /> <br /> Movie effects (Photography with solar light, frozen frame, blur etc.) <br /> <br /> Have seen before <br /> <br /> To emphasize the natural tension of the story. <br /> <br /> The performance is raw, scary and most reliable. <br /> <br /> The true theme of This film is about friendship. The title helps <br /> <br /> the game go out. It may not be the friendship that <br /> <br /> most of us have experience or want to do. <br /> <br /> It's music. love
