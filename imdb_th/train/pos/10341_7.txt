Comedy movie, funny screaming situation in the mid-70s, this movie has been very popular for about 5 minutes and disappeared from the world. I am constantly amazed at some comedy films that have been released one week and then disappeared: high anxiety, legitimate detectives, blackbird priests. Don't look at it now. Today and without a profile, NORMAN is a comedian of the month whenever 1976 and everyone seems to see it laughing about it and never talking about it again. Famous for filming videotapes and transferring them to experimental films. At that time, NORMAN was a particularly disgusting political wardrobe. If they do it at first, there will be no complaints about the content and tilt. It's very funny and yes, very rude and totally wrong. Have fun. Just as it should In fact, it is the movie Groovy 1976 with all the colors and horror clothes. It works better now.
