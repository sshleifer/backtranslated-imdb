This film is one of the black and white movies that occurred in the early 1930s before the Hoyt code was enforced. It is the story of a beautiful woman who moved to New York and traveled to the top of the business using her body as a tool to get there. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwick shows Lily role, girl power Who can perform quite well with her performance? Lily moved to New York and did her business by sleeping with all the men. Stanwyck performed an excellent performance as a strong woman who used men as a one-time deal with almost no emotion. They are premiums. Lily Powers is a woman who doesn't have a love for her, just power and money. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is a little different from other movies. I've seen it at barely hear the music, I believe it is because this is the first time people have been introduced to the sound and dialogue between the people in the film. A few times that the music was heard at the beginning because we showed how she created the chain. The shooting and the scenes were great! The director of this movie made the right angle and the right technique to make this movie full of realities. <br /> <br /> This movie is a movie that everyone is all about. As it should be But it does not destroy it all. Baby Face has a slow-moving scene throughout the movie and may be partly predictable, for example, she will sleep with the next page. But this is a cute movie that can be watched more than once and introduces it to some people and friends.
