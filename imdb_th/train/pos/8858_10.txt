I have to admit that this is a type of movie that I normally avoid. But I rented it as a star. I certainly do not regret. In fact, as you can see, I gave five stars. This film is a perfect blend of sharp and superlative acting. <br /> <br /> Andy and Hank Hanson are brothers who decided to commit an unreasonable crime in robbery. Parents jewelry store The crime was terribly wrong, so began to investigate three men in the Hanson family. We know Charles Hanson and understand the tense relationship between father and son. <br /> <br /> The younger brother, Hank, is a coward. He often has problems in work and often goes in the wind direction. Hank is not stable, cowardly and under the influence of his big brother. Ethan Hawk has the personality of Hank. "Arrested as a T" and giving what seems to be his best work right now He showed us a man with a good heart. But was influenced by external forces that could not fulfill any important mission. <br /> <br /> Andy on the surface - seems to be a successful businessman But soon we found that he was addicted and embezzled money from his company to pay for his habits. Andy cooks plans to rob his parents' shop and he gets a weak hangout in action. Philip Seymour Hoffman - Sure, it's one of the best actors of our generation - playing Andy Feng. Afman is an actor who has the ability to describe a man on the surface as a charming businessman that his acquaintances like. But is a slime ball on the bottom He is absolutely perfect for Andy, or it can be said that he has excellent acting skills, making Andy the perfect part. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney plays as Father of the same generation Charles Hanson is not a bad person or without feelings. But he had a relationship with his son because he had never understood what was needed to maintain a good relationship between his son and himself. He is often too early to criticize and warn. He often makes it clear that he likes his younger son more than his elder, causing an emotional divide between him and Andy. When we know Charles and Andy, Andy's thoughts on the plans to rob his father are less convincing. <br /> <br /> On my personal record, I don't want to believe that Charles. Hanson reminds me about myself Father and Andy and Hank remind me of how much brother and myself Perhaps this is one of the reasons that I enjoyed this movie a lot because of the story of a far-away father, a more successful brother, and a less successful brother. Fortunately, my brother and I never came to a state of crime against my parents - guessing that we were made from more cruel and moral things. <br /> <br /> The complexity of personality and Acting director Sidney Lumet at the age of eighty-three, he still has shuffling for viewers to be interested in characters and action scenes that will hypnotize. 12 Angry Men is his first movie, created five. Ten years ago before The devil knows you're dead But he did not touch his magic in showing us the long-remembered characters. <br /> <br /> The events and characters in Before the Devil know that you are dead, cruel and unattractive. Movies that feel good However, it is a maximum of two hours of entertainment that I thoroughly recommend.
