This is a beautiful movie. The true story of the bond between father and son This is the last time Tom Hanks is his best. Tom really hangs out of the box in this movie. He always plays a good male role. But in this film, he came out in this film with courage. But still smells like a rose, even in the final scene, assassinating his character The actors of this film are well collected. I still love the silence when Tom Hank's character shoots and kills all the men in Mr Rooney's group. There is something cold and deep yet there is no sound in that scene, just emotion. I like the face of John Rooney, the face of Paul Newman's character, when he realizes before seeing him that it's Tom Hanks' character to take revenge. The first time I saw this movie, I was blown away and knew that I had to go outside to get the video and since then added to my favorite movie collection all the time. Show my favorite people, so this movie has a special place in me.
