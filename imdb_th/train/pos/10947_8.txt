The program Sarah Silverman resembles Sarah standing up. It's a scandal that you can't imagine. The truth is, though, while most everyone will "get it" doesn't mean that they all will appreciate it. It's a polarization and one dimension, so if you don't like it after 10 minutes, you may give up. If you like it after 10 minutes, stay tuned because every last episode is as good as before. <br /> <br /> Like every item, even if it's not perfect. I personally like the program. But there are many flaws Racist music is a joke. Silverman seems to understand - the problems I have with "Jesus is Magic" as well. It looks like Silverman will give you quota for songs that don't need to exist. Not to mention that while the lyrics of the songs she wrote are good But the song is not good Python all day long But as far as I like this list, I can't watch more than half an hour at the same time. It's very fast flat. The repeat value for this program is also low. The second time around was quite funny and the third time in my opinion it was boring. <br /> <br /> Still the first time around, very funny. Try. Shoot
