I love this wonderful movie. Farrah Fawcett plays this role miraculously and has a good heart. She plays a woman who is driven to take extreme measures to protect herself and her friends after she is attacked by strangers. After being denied by the police, she realized that she was her own. <br /> <br /> Then one day when she was home alone, a stranger broke into her house and attacked her again. No need to call the police or chase him out. She is forced to spray him in the eye and detain him in her fireplace. <br /> <br /> I think there is a need to wake up. Land laws. They are too easy with these criminals. It's time for more severe punishment.
