I really like this movie I have read other comments and even though I am sorry for those who do not understand But I agree with some criticisms Which in a strange way makes me like this movie more I agree that they have very beautiful actors in creating intelligent movies for the general public. But there are many levels and still great to watch I also love movies like this which cause debates, many theories, possible endings and hidden narratives. Congratulations to Mr.Crowe. Of course, in my top ten At my hotel and I have important travel trips! The dream ends and where the truth begins
