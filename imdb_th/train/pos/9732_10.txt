Best performers include: Kirsten Dunst (Spiderman, Virgin Suicides) Danny Huston (The Number 23, 30 day of night) Gillian Anderson (The X-Files) Megan Fox (Transformers, Confessions of a Queen Teen Drama) Jeff Bridges (The Big Lebowski, The Vanishing) Overall, the way to lose friends and strangers is a joke. I think Simon Pegg and Kirsten Dunst work together well and I think you should see it, even though there are strange nudity. It's a hilarious comedy and one of the best in Simon Pegg. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: Sidney Young journalists from England, traveled to New York to work at Sharps magazine.
