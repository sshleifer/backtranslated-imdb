Just think of what the school will be like in the world like this: Children are big gangs with musical tastes and good compatibility with the principal and bad teachers. "Rock 'N' Roll High School" happened in the world. this It's like recording the Ramones that come to life. The characters are all innocent, innocent and charming like Ramones songs. Of course, the music itself is wonderful. High school comedies have changed a lot over the years, if you compare movies like "American Pie" and classic movies in the late 70s that do not have tasteless jokes. Obviously, the remake of the work may be expected that the original charm will be lost and will be replaced by a half-joke funny joke, as Bill Hicks once called them. However, the main problem is not being able to change the Ramones. They are the perfect band for this movie and no one can approach their place. So the best thing to do is leave the manuscript alone, strange and charming, as it is Gabba-gabba. Hey!
