I didn't expect I never heard of Jamie Fox; All I know is that this movie has some strong actors in it. I think it's very fun. It's fun. The story is different and unpredictable enough to make me interested. For me, Foxx is the original David Morse. Great (actually, this is not his best role). I think the chase and pyrotechnics support this film and do very well. I didn't expect much and I was pleasantly surprised.
