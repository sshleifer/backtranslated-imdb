Rated PG-13 for violence, short sexual humor and drug content Quebec Ranking: 13+ (should be G) Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> <br /> I've seen Police Story a few times in my opinion, Police Story Chan's best movie from the 80s. At first, it was made because he didn't like the police movie, other things that he had to star in, which was a guardian. The plot is quite me. Well i don't want Can't remember the good story because I've seen this movie for a while now. But what I can remember is that this movie has great action scenes, comedy scenes and what the movie Chandi needs to use if you can find the police. Buy this movie! <br /> <br /> Runtime: 106 minutes <br /> <br /> 9/10
