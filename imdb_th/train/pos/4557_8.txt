I think Hugh O'Connor is astonishing as a young boy, Christy Brown and deserves a lot of recognition in his role. I can't believe how well he played. Of course, Daniel Day-Lewis is also great. My favorite scene is where kids are playing football and Christie uses his head to stop the goal and kick a penalty! Amazing performances by two Christie (and others)
