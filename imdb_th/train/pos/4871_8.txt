Must use Serbian or Balkans, at least familiar and understand the situation, situation, characters and jokes of 'Zavet', including other Kusturica movies. Preview the opening scene with a remote village in Serbia mountains with technology equipment Low that protects the integrity and way of life of residents, misses the good days of communist rule and waking up The rest of the children watched his nude teacher with Soviet hymns. Kusturica not only tried to leave the tragic history of Serbia described in his previous films. But creating a whole world of self in the process. <br /> <br /> This is not a political film or a political film. In any case, it's a fun movie before. Kusturica creates a set of characters that we care about. The song has an active role in this film, just like in his other films. His style is straight and bizarre. Now we feel his character and we know that he wants us to feel the same. The areas in which he developed together, present, history, and the magic and colors that appear to be Douanier Rousseau's modern cinema. <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect movie as well. The main flaw is the length, editing and truncation, some of which may be useful, since the director sometimes seems to have lost his thoughts and performances repeatedly. It is one of the most interesting and amusing movies that moves me. Have seen recently
