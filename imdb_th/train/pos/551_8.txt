Four-fifths of the West, which Anthony Mann did with James Stewart, this one involved a bite of a cow named Jeff Webster, who drove a cow from Wyoming to Alaska through Seattle. He connects with Seattle with his partner, Ben Tatum. (Walter Brennan) and Reuben Morris (JC Flippen), who sent him in advance to prepare for a northern boat trip. <br /> <br /> But first he must endure. With an unstable hand, cheating the boat captain, lobbling and the charm of shyness, using magic Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman), who believes that Jeff may be a valuable ally in the future That's why she hid him on the boat while the captain was looking for him for the previous generation assassins. (And reasonably) <br /> <br /> Jeff also has the misfortune of having to meet the lazy Judge Gannon (John McIntire)), Skagway city manager, Alaska Shannon Jeff, to prevent hanging. Public by running buffalo throughout the city He adjusted Jeff to be the owner of his cow and Jeff had to eat Ka at that time. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Jeff agreed to sit Ronda until Dawson to deliver supplies. But this is just a trick. So Jeff, Ben and Rube are able to get back into Skagway and steal their cows. Of course, Judge Gannon finds out about this and is behind. But Jeff had a delayed rifle while Ben was racing cattle across the Canadian border from Gannon. <br /> <br /> After avoiding the avalanche and shooting again with other Skagway people, eventually He came to Dawson, where Jeff sold the cow to the highest bidder, which had just happened to Ronda, who set up a new home gambling immediately in Dawson. Then Jeff took his money to buy his own and began to search for gold. <br /> <br /> But then Judge Gannon came to Dawson to join the activity there and told. Jeff said he was bored with Skagway and wanted to try his luck in Klondike on his own. That involved the gunmen hired with him and forcibly demanded some miners. Now, Jeff and Ben felt that it was time to clear while the good behavior went out of Rube to take care of himself as the most inefficient sheriff to Gannon and his gang. <br /> <br / > They look for a way out. Found himself ambushed by Gannon's people because Ben made a mistake in opening his big mouth Ben was killed and Jeff was seriously injured. But that didn't help the judge Shannon be free from mistakes Shooting at the end of the night on a muddy Dawson road is quite interesting. First Jeff kills two of Gannon's best gunmen (Jack Elam and Robert Wilkie). Then when Ronda comes out, warns Jeff that Bannon is trying. Fleeing behind him, immediately shot her in the back and she died there in Jeff's arms Then Jeff killed Gannon while he was hiding under a wooden sidewalk. The vengeance has already been spoken. <br /> <br /> This is another formidable statement of the Westerners who were hit by the spurs and people from Lara. Why does Universal DVD use printing? Pan and scan instead of using a wide-screen TCM type, which is beyond me. You will wind up missing half of the glorious Alberta movie of William Daniels. So if you like the Westerners who write 50 people, this person is the moderator. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
