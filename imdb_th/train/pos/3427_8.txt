This film shows the worst part of the war that survived memories. For many male and female soldiers, returning home may be the beginning of a real problem. I thought of my father and his brothers who had returned from World War II. For one of my uncle, the war never ends. He survived the D-Day invasion, similar to the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan. For him, the memories were not only lingering, but suffering him. Jump ahead 60 years and put soldiers in different wars in different countries. The result is the same. When I saw this in the KC FilmFest, I was warned that there was something about war that never changed. Ideal women do not suffer emotional pain from what has happened in Iraq, and especially if you do war, you will get more sympathy for soldiers trying to do what they believe. /> <br /> The tag line from the Vietnam War movie Platoon tells everything "The first accident of war is innocence."
