After watching "Whipping" in the film's dealership at AFM last night, I must say that I was very impressed. The audience laughed all the way. Unfortunately, all lands were sold, so I didn't have the opportunity to buy this movie. But I truly believe that it will be very popular both in the country and in the sea. I agree with the opinion that "whipping" should not be pitched as "Sex and the City" is mostly because it's not the same as "Sex and the City" "Whipping" is a word about dating, "Whipping". Enjoy the relationship that most comedians won't dare. In addition, the movies I screened at AFM have more stories and stories than "Swingers" "Clerks" and "Sex and the City" together. "Whipping" has never slowed down for rhythm and audience with comedy, not stopping the show. Of Amanda Peet and the rest of the actors But it is hard rock which makes this film more impressive when considering the budget
