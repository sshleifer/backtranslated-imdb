I just watched this movie in Showtime quite accidentally. If I didn't sleep for just 6 hours in the last two days, I wouldn't go home before work. If I didn't go home before work, I wouldn't have watched this movie. I won't even know what I'm missing. But I'll miss it. <br /> <br /> That's the way this movie is. Almost playing with Kevin Bacon's effects and fate (So ​​my extravagant words above) The characters that used to be intertwined in some way Reaction, reaction, non-response This movie is great. I have to find a buyer
