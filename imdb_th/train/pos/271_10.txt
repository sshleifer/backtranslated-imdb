It's all about Mitzi. I love you about this. And she doesn't look great! I love popcorn movies on these Sunday afternoons. This is like one of the nailers they go to do business at the most annoying time. The character Richard is completely creepy. I'm dating a guy like that Unlike that I hope Zack will not be killed. He is very cute and comfortable. I like these types of drafts. It got me up and made sure my door was locked. My husband doesn't like this type of movie. But actually I sat and watched the whole story with me I can't wait to see what Mitzi does next!
