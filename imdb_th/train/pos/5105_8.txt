Anyone can argue the fact that Urban Cowboy is and still is the best document of Texas life over time. Consider the following: Men beat a drunken wife at the bar every night, marrying to end the fight for adultery and join a mechanical bull race. Try and name the movie that clearly shows real life. They didn't make them anymore. It seems that today's movies are often about people with a lot of money. They live in a big house, drive expensive cars and don't work This film has a celebration scene about creating a trailer for the benefit of Pete. <br /> <br /> However, I watched it at least once a week. Not kidding. I edited this film from beginning to end. Do not hesitate to email me to learn more about my reasons for calling it as a documentary. Consider the following scene: Bud saw Sissy - they were separated - he squeezed the horn and waved his hand to be friendly. She threw the bird for him. br /> <br /> <br /> Bud, my mother called him about 18 hours after he entered the city on Sunday to see if he had a job or not. Help from his uncle and aunt who watch He <br /> <br /> "You live like a pig" Imagine how this scene would like to think it necessary. We can't figure it out without showing dirty tubs or not. God, I love that. <br /> <br /> The sisters let Wess help her ride the cow. Only a few days (Or maybe the next day) after Wess had just kicked the shit out of her husband. Steve asked - Hey, Sissy, remember West? Oh yeah, you didn't beat my husband the night before, so let's take this lesson. 'Not to mention the fact that she tried to comfort him later in one of Bud and Sissy's many battles, which all happened in public - in Gilley's! <br /> <br /> Get a wedding, take a session. (Oh, humanity!) At least they can arrange or move the chair away. "My legs are my mother's sweat." <br /> <br /> In summary, you didn't put this kind of scene in the movie to try to show human psychology. It's a documentary about real life. <br /> <br /> I'm just hoping to have a director ...
