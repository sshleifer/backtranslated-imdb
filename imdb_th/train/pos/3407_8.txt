Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give a strong performance in a beautiful but empty film. The irony is that Trish plays a beautiful but empty girl, filming movies and scenes. True beauty and yes, the endless clothes of Dietrich are excellent as well. She looks very good. Boyer looks young and has cut scenes. <br /> <br /> The story of a woman who is about Looking for meaning and Switching gears, the former priest seems to be quite lovely. But posing with a scene that is not worth seeing by Max Steiner and a good supporting actor This film takes about 76 minutes and seems to be poorly resolved, including some characters that appear or disappear. <br /> <br /> Joseph Shield Great is a joke like a Syrian Arabian guide. Bray, Tilly Losch, dancer, John Carradine the diviner, and Basil Rathbone play .... Well I'm not sure. He just rides from the desert and destroys everything! As others observe, John Gilbert is scheduled to perform with Dietrich. I can't help but think that he should be great. Boris's weary role in the world should be well suited to the great Gilbert. And after the success of Queen Christina (with Garbo), his career may come back to reality. <br /> <br /> I can't think of other movies in the 30s at Trish. With colors, she looks good and wears great clothes My favorite thing is Valentino, like the Shiek dress that she wears by the pool. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's worth the lush green dress and the colors and the two stars.
