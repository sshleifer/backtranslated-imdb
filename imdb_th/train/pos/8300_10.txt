Not surprisingly, Busey has developed a tumor in his sinus cavity later. This film is a bad decision. But one that I like fully, the first 5 minutes is the movie that is not the most watched 5 minutes; Boring, poor dialouge Some eggs don't laugh hard. The line reflected well despite Clooney's "Hi Freeze, I'm Batman" rating. Other classic moments were Busey being constantly upset for people warning him that he had his former CIA partner Was killed ... which he accidentally shot him in the chest (All possible Dry, exciting.) There is an ashtray for them to punch their faces and "That's not my fault, and you know!" The picture shows that he disappeared from a bad person and hit his friend. So ... The other loud moment must be a former girl friend. His bomb dropped on the ground to allow him to escape - all challenging plans, logic, physics, and absurdity. And finally, when McBain jumped out of Thunderblast during a violent guerrilla war and began running away and hindering small objects, I almost wet myself. The best work of Busey from long distance for rent or buy today "butthorn!" My vote is 10 perfect (on the poo meter, that is)
