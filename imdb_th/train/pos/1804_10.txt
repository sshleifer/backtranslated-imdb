The first thing, first thing, I never fear the jewel that is priced as low as the child ("The Little Mermaid" on the other hand ...) as my name says, this is one of my favorite childhood movies that I still love. During adolescence It was a beautiful and bitter movie about an improper German shepherd called Charlie (Burt Reynolds, which was bizarrely voiced) that was killed by his boss / partner in a crime. Charlie was sent to heaven by default because "Every dog ​​goes to heaven because it is different from the average person. The dog is good and honest and kind." Charlie was sent back to the world because he stopped using his life clock, which he received more damage to a good friend. Most of his cars and little orphaned girls, Ann-Marie, I've watched this thing all the time as a child and sometimes I still watch. However, it's a beautiful bittersweet movie as I said earlier, which may make you tears ...
