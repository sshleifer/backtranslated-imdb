Good yarn cracking with all the actors for the best value. Michael Curtiz is his best. There are many good twists and turns and probably the best in the Philo Vance Series. William Powell looks amazingly relaxed and looks the best. The pioneers of the Thin Man series recommend it to everyone. Do you think everything?
