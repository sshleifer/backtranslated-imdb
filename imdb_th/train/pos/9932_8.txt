If you go to this movie, expecting something that is not, you will be disappointed as with all movies. This film has what Hemmingway describes as being "Iceberg effect" on the surface. It is just a cache of random movie clips that are smashed together to create a movie. If this thing is written in the book, it will be a short story because the action in this movie is fast and if you really try to catch it, the reason behind the plot (With a little speculation) passed you well A movie that you will have to watch twice in order to fully appreciate. Experimental movies hardly describe this movie. The work of the camera and post production enhances the overall taste of the film, making it an art at some point and opening the interpretation from others (something that is needed in American movies at the end of the year). Although in some parts it may look obscene, scary and too heavy for some viewers. The characteristics of the movie that I will write out "Needing improvement" is the selection of the soundtrack. There is no good movie if there is no suitable soundtrack and although the soundtrack is quite appropriate But the opening is a little too long and other rap songs in the movie may be replaced by something more appropriate. (Heavy rock or psychedelic rock Electronica should make this movie a real trip.) The flood of imagery and dynamic ... The color palette adds another "art" perspective, combined with the events that occurred throughout the movie. It's not a movie that you can think about and can understand. However, that makes the favorite movie to watch, not the movie you are bored quickly. 8.5 / 10
