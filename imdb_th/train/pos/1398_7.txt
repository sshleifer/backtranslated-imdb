At other times, from an adult childhood, I look back with a different perspective. This is one of my favorite episodes when I love this show. However, in watching it now, after 20 years, I can say that it is one of the lighter, playable games for laughing and entertainment instead of the amazing story and well built in the previous episode of the first season and the best season. Maybe now is written for R&R fans as well! As Mr. Spock says the story is not reasonable But there are some amusing stories, of course, that the final chapter of Mr. Spock at the end - when he asked Captain McCoy et al that they enjoyed R&R or not, they responded with a response. He raised his eyebrows and said Saying "interesting ..." in the way Mr. Spock can do Of course, an interesting story. Of course, the theme of the amusement park is amusing. (For example, the "fun" of Disneyland that is often disguised and annoying) can make a wish come true. It's a good idea. But did not do well and came from another great short story writer SF Theodore Sturgeon, which they used in the first season. One surprising thing was how much scripting Sturgeon changed. br /> <br /> The little story that I learned on this website: In 1987, James Gunn established the Theodore Sturgeon Award for the best scientific short story. And I will reference the rest from this website: in 1968 he {Sturgeon} wrote "The Joy Machine", the third script of the Star Trek series {Amok Time}, which was never shot. The main reason that is not used in the series is that there are too many expensive effects sequences for their budgets. However, the script was adapted into a book by Sci-Fi writer James Gunn (Star Trek # 80, The Original Series) and published by Pocket Books in 1996. <br /> <br /> I'll summarize this to say. Now it's still fun, especially if nobody thinks too much. Just laughing and enjoying it and the next episode we can go back to the serious matter of protecting the universe.
