It's a bit strange and evil and I enjoy it a lot. The characters in the show are also great and compliment well. I regret seeing it being cut off .. I like to see where it goes. You find yourself heading to Lucas, who has more secrets than anyone else. Lucas is awesome and charming. And I want to see him more and what his character will be However, I will buy the item to enjoy. It is good for something different on TV and Paige Turrco, who is Caleb's cousin. She is a great mystery about the place and what she wants. It's a shame that never ends or never finish. I want to see what will happen.
