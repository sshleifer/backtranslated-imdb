I found memorable words that searched for video clips; They forgot one of my favorites ... <br /> <br /> Seniors 1: You know, I remember the first time they played that thing. <br /> <br /> Old person 2: You Remember pterodactyl. <br /> <br /> Old people 1: And I remember you failed. <br /> <br /> Seniors 2: Oh, I didn't do it. <br /> <br /> Old woman: You do that You put a large bucket on your head and take it out with the army boys to fight against the Martians. <br /> <br /> Seniors 2: Are you still dead?
