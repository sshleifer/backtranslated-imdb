As a person who lives near Buffalo, New York, this film has scored with me before I can see because the story is based here. There are even parts that have real-life TV announcers from Buffalo .. and for one time it doesn't make Hallelujah! <br /> <br /> wise theology, puh-leeze !!! God is still being created to look and think like a human being ... and of course being liberal. It is something that should not win any awards, but it is still fun and a good way to kill. 102 minutes <br /> <br /> There is a funny scene, flick out loud and hope the audience - from Christian to Those who do not believe in God - receive something from this story, in addition to a few laughter, such as what prayer should be about. The writer's glory at least makes theology correct and gives the message. The good <br /> <br /> Overall, it is a film that has a great offensive mind a little more.
