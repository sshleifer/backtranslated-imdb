This story is a complex and wonderful story of the last harem of the Ottoman Empire, telling and provoking us to see the inner workings of the lost world and learn about the people who live there. <br /> < br /> I enjoy stories, characters, performances and scenes. A few scenes that are suffering from quick fixes and sometimes sub-headings disappear too quickly, otherwise a wonderful scene. <br /> <br /> Safiya's main character is played amazingly by Marie Gillain, who I'm happy to say that I made it a scene with her and Alex Descas (the nadir), charming and cute. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see something that Less than Hollywood
