Watched this movie on DVD yesterday and was hit hard and confused. Undaunted performances with DDL just made my heart and I was surprised by all the actors and the great performances. All characters are genuine. For me, I received a DDL for Christy Burns and Brenda Fricker for his mother to see! You will cry out of your heart. But you will experience the wonderful belly! It also teaches you one important lesson: Determination is everything. You may be disabled in the poor suburbs of Dublin. But when you have enough stubbornness, you won't have a problem at all. If you can use your left foot, you are still good enough to be a painter or writer. The worst thing you can do when you are mentally challenged is to indulge in self-pity. It won't get you anywhere and the only one who will pity you will be yourself.
