Yes, it is quite a nostalgia to watch Episode 1 because this is the episode that I definitely remember. I enjoy watching the first season and yes, compared to the programs that are packed with what we have now. This list seems to be weak. But honestly, I like the part that "Less severe" of the program and the story has more content than the new episode. I think it's interesting that Belisario's Airwolf and JAG have similar themes - Hawke and Harm. Both are looking for relatives. MIA (Brother Dad) suspects that Robert Belisario's personal life mimics these 2 themes <br /> <br /> Question - Does anyone have a photo of Hawke's cottage? I like that cabin. (Like my dream room) and that's one of the scenes I remember about Airwolf
