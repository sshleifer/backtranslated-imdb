First of all, the release date is 2009, not 2007. For a long documentary film, this story should be called "Earth, 2009" more accurately. Secondly, allow me to answer the complaints of some examiners who used to watch TV series "Planet Earth" in 2006. <br /> <br /> I didn't watch this TV series. But learn here that this movie is full The long version of the TV series in 2006, I judge a movie with good quality, not from the source. I judge the results myself and the results of "Earth, 2009" are really great. I canceled this little complaint from some commentators: It's just a TV series "Planet Earth" in 2006. What does it matter? <br /> <br /> As a film director and Those who have watched dozens of natural documentaries in my life, I was surprised and very impressed with "Earth, 2009". This film is a film released from the new department. Disney's "DisneyNature" and follow in the footsteps of Walt Disney movie pioneers and Oscars winning natural documentary films in the 1950s and 1960s. <br /> <br /> Movie editing, music movies All votes and narration are excellent. There are a few documentaries about nature that are excellent in these categories. What really sets "Earth, 2009" apart is its scope. It truly covers the entire world, covering all seven continents. <br /> <br /> After my first look, it's clear that this documentary requires a lot of effort and time and talent to create. br /> <br /> Three production companies need to create amazing documentary films. <br /> <br /> "Earth, 2009" tells the story of the four species of animals that let them know that they migrated through. For one year The season begins in January and ends in December from the North Pole to the South Pole. <br /> <br /> Two new high-tech cameras have been used for this film: one camera with computer-controlled rotation. 360 degree lens and the other one is an HD camera that is set at 1,000 frames per second. This shooting technique added some drama and beauty to the scenes of "Earth, 2009", especially the cheetah chase and the giant white shark that jumped from the water to catch sea lions and aerial views. The highest waterfall in the world There are many stunning images in this documentary. <br /> <br /> Through cinematography, music scores and subtitles, there is drama, sadness, humor and great beauty in this documentary. With a great music score from the Berliner Philharmoniker Which is famous for world class creative and technical movies, and the narrative of James Earl Jones. I think "Earth, 2009" is the greatest natural documentary film ever made. <br /> <br /> Five Years of hard work, patience, talent and dedication can be rewarded here. This movie needs to be watched in every school around the world. I predict the Academy Award for Best Documentary in the midst of other awards.
