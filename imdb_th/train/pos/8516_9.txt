This movie is a very funny and warm story about an orphanage that faces financial problems. When the director went on vacation, his father agreed to come to do temporary activities. <br /> <br /> This is the best work Leslie Nielson has done in a positive way. His thoughts on movies for renting children are instant innovation and his sales techniques will definitely make you laugh. <br /> <br /> The little girl in this movie is so cute and charming that I Know that I will never forget you. Just make sure you don't miss the first five minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> This wonderful family entertainment is rare today. If you go to find a picture with a slightly happy angle, go to this picture! I can see this thing over and over again and I always do! My only complaint about this movie is that it's hard to find a copy.
