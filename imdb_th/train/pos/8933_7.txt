Claire Denis has repeatedly shown that movies do not need to tell the story that it is enough to create an experience that allows viewers to bring ingredients and do what they want. <br /> <br /> Clear thoughts. Within the framework of the most non-linear movie, an old man living on the French-Swiss border, a man dedicated to his dog, who still has a lover. But the heartbeat status threatens his life more He had a son and a small family who met him very often. But when he discovered that he needed heart transplantation, he chose to go to Tahiti through Japan to receive a heart transplant in the black market and for a long lost relationship. With the son that he had created the Tahitian woman many years ago Interaction with humans and people With animals and others. Most of the time, 'movies' are not reasonable. But that is because we try hard to connect every point placed in front of us in a beautiful picture. That life is like that: we see, observe, combine processes and do what we will do. <br /> <br /> In the use of making movies in this 'Beau Travail' format) Claire Denis developed a unique technique. The audience found that providing a complete product award was related to how our image and concept data were processed. This is an interesting and visually appealing movie. But many viewers will find that it is too long a discourse about the subject. Sometimes watching again will change that. Grady Harp
