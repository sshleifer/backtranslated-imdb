This is my favorite childhood - I remember seeing it on television and excited about it every time. Now I grow up and have my own children. I want to introduce him to this classic movie. We watched it last Friday and he likes it. During the battle with the giant spider Abu, my son's hand dived and caught me - he was truly scared. "Will he win the Spider Poppa?" Just watch. You will see. He has no historical reference frame to speak of (eight years old). Therefore, Bagdad, under Haroun al-Raschid's grandson, may be Oz under Ozma. <br /> <br /> I think he likes it very much. The heroes and the terrifying people are stolen by the devil and not the grown-up king. In fact, if you distinguish the story of the movie a little, the king is a close friend of the thief, not a hero at all - which must be very satisfying for a young boy who loves adventure. <br /> <br /> It is. The exact moment - I suspect that when he was eleven or twelve, my son would find it 'repetitive' or whatever the next generation would use at that time. The love story is almost one dimension - as another friend commented. "Why does Ahmad love the princess because the story demands it?" Abu's willingness to put himself in danger (repeatedly) for a king without love who is hit with love But joking about things while accepting a mechanical horse that can fly, a fifty-foot gene and a temple of eyes that can see everything will be exhausted in the end. The satisfaction of seeing the predictions made at the end of the movie is a big deal, just like the last image of Abu flying on his magic carpet (stealing). Finally find fun and adventure. !
