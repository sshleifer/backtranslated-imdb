Adam Sandler is a Charlie Man who lost his family in the 9/11 tragedy and since losing his career, his reason for living and his mental health. Don Cheadle starred as Sandler's former dental school roommate who seemed to have a perfect life. (Obviously, Sandler, before 9/11) <br /> <br /> Of course, the lives of these people. In fact, it is refreshing to see the feelings of men appearing in movies ... other feelings than sexual desire and revenge. See if they really help each other, just stay there with pain and sincerity. Author / director Mike Binder ("The Upside of Anger" and Sandler's accountant in this film) brings a different look and feel. Out of the movie Some scenes do not work as well as other scenes, but overall, they are well written and tightly directed. <br /> <br /> Sandler and Cheadle are great. Sandler's character reminded him of his excellent performance in "Punch Drunk Love", but here he added more depth. Cheadle worked well and showed the burden he was carrying ... just Just watching him work on jigsaw puzzles. <br /> <br /> The support work is excellent by Jada Pinkett Smith (as Cheadle's wife). Liv Tyler (as a very patient psychiatrist) Saffron Burrows (in the role that Attracting bizarre attention) Donald Sutherland as a cutter And annoying Melinda Dillon and Robert Klein are the laws of Sandler. <br /> <br /> How much of a tragic event that day affected a man until he was destroyed In addition to the interesting stories and great shots of NYC, you must love movies with singers from Chrissy Hynde, Bruce Springsteen and Roger Daltrey ... as well as Eddie Vedder who disguises Daltrey as a movie. an upbeat chipper but a quality movie with unusual stories
