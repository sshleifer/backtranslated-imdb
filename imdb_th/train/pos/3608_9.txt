Sports movies never belonged to me at all. But there are only a few things that suit me The best thing is something that focuses on less sports and other characters such as Raging Bull, the Wrestler and Girlfight. This is a great debut for Karyn Kusama and a great first performance for Michelle Rodriguez. Girlfight feels that it's true and relevant. That's enough to make it a memorable movie. <br /> <br /> The story is very narrow. Diana Gusman is in her fourth year of high school. But since she chose to fight in the hallway, she was close to being evicted. As possible in releasing her anger, she registered to attend boxing at the club where her brother was practicing. See something special Diana almost changed from a girl to a woman. We saw it in her body as well as her behavior, especially when a boy in the club found herself attracted to her and she went in there. There are no bad or momentary scenes / drowsiness in the movie. The only mistake I can say can be solved is that one of the subplots ends in something that feels like an unfinished note. Girlfight is also a great movie.
