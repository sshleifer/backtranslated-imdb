Batman animated film that is fun Not always with "Return of the Joker" or "Mask of the Phantasm" but still strong I like the way this movie makes you guess who Batman is. With a good twist Good action sequence I tend to see that Batman is better than that, then the sequel to the poor action movie of Batman. The trend continues here. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10
