"Vanilla Sky" is a miraculous movie or rather "Abre Los Ojos" is a good idea. I watched a movie one night, excited about what would happen. I'm not disappointed At the end of the movie, I was shocked. I can't take it out of my heart. All of my thoughts made me confused. The ending was more surprising than Shyamalan did. The plot line is something that keeps me interested all the time. Excellent actor It's a great movie around. Types of movies that you can watch over and over again and always find new things I saw it four or five times and I always searched for new things. It's a movie that will keep you interested forever.
