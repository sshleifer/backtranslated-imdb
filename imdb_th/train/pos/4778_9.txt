Like his early masterpieces, "The Elephant Man" Lynch proves that he can tell a simple, straightforward story without losing his artistic sense. This is the true story of a retired old man (played by Richard Farnsworth), who decided to drive a few cross-state tractors to visit the last time, with a separate brother who now stands at the door of death Beautiful scores from Badalamenti. Beautiful photography of rural life. (Love the image of the corn field in the air) and the crafty director hand that reveals the basic humanity of mankind. This is a beautiful life movie. Very slow speeds may cause some viewers to sleep. But those who are on the path will eventually receive good returns.
