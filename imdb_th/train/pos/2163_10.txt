I just love this movie It is a perfect example of an astounding story from the Asian cinema. Hollywood movies have been created recently, with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez scary. Please do not confuse the two movies. The original Japanese movie has a gentle and powerful touch. The Hollywood version is the opposite. I was shocked to see the first example for the US remade version and those who starred in it. It is a normal, unusual commercial that is the worst of Hollywood. The remedy makes the argument that some foreign movies cannot be improved. The only reason that the original movie was not viewed more widely is the hatred of the American audience towards the subtitles. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons that this film is not able to work in Tell the story of the Americans The characters of public Japanese movies have problems in this movie. Of course, the main character wakes up for a deeper understanding of the lively life through dancing. But half the tension of the movie comes from the style and the ballroom dancer in front of the Japanese laughing. <br /> <br /> Please try to watch this movie. In the traditional form, not scary full screen And please don't cross the remake of the US .... It's a shallow imitation compared to traditional Japanese movies. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that "traditional" movies are much older and this is just Japanese. Accepting the story, but only two people have the opportunity to see this soon is the creator and new creator of the United States. <br /> <br /> Talking about foreign movies, Monsoon Wedding-I gives a list of films First, for outstanding reasons! 2.Johnny Stechino- Very funny, misunderstood about the Italian identity! 3.Shiri-A, a Korean action that combines Asian flames and American style plot. 4. Run Lola Run-A, a German movie that combines intelligent techno scores. <br /> <br /> Well, just a short list next: -)
