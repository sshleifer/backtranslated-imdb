This film has the most funny and memorable dialogue ever made in a movie! The story is quite missing. But the delightful thing is enough to make a difference. This is a timeless movie for sure. As an art form in movies, it is very entertaining. And with important stars such as Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas ... How do you make mistakes? <br /> <br /> This funny and funny conversation has not been evaluated for a long time and is difficult to imitate. A good example of this story is seen in this film in 1986, "The Pit Pit" with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. Despite the physical abilities and comedy of these stars, the film also dragged and received criticism. Bad and the opinions of viewers Receiving a truly humorous conversation is an art.
