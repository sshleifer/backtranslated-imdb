Of course, if you read my review, you saw this movie. 'Raja Babu' is one of my favorite characters. I like the concept of the rest of the child with a servant 24 * 7 on his motorcycle. Watch movies and imitate the characters, etc. I like this scene when the rocks crack in the mouth of Kader khans while eating. In addition, where Shakti Kapoor recounts the obscure story of the king's affairs of Babu on the dinner table and Govinda wears uniforms. 'dharam-veer' makes emotional quotes That was the scene that I liked in the movie. The scene of 'Achcha Pitaji to the front of Chalta Hoon' was just a chemistry between two great Indian actors who made funny scenes without dialogue. It's wonderful. It's a cat movie. Just watch these actors help each other and continue to take the scene apart. All its entertainment If you like the chemistry of Govinda and Kader Khan, I think RB is ranked 6th in my list by David Dhawan 'Deewana Mastana', 'Ankhein', 'Shola or Shabnam', 'Swarg', Coolie no 1 'Bring the jewel face of this movie 7/10
