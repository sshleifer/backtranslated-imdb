One of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes And the next day we were in a supermarket at Hollywood Blvd and Labria, my father and me and guess who is coming to us in the corridor! Barney Phillips, but without a hat - at least I don't think he is wearing a hat. <br /> <br /> We asked him about his third eye and he said something he had left at home. And everyone he met that day asked him about it. <br /> <br /> Friendly men We have seen actors of all kinds of characters in LA in those days. <br /> <br /> BTW I am a teenager and it takes longer than I will pass "three hands" with other aliens! <br /> Robyn Frisch O'Neill <br /> <br /> Hollywood people and residents in the years 1947 to 1963
