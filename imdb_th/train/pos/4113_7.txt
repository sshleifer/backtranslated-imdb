The name is the sound that one character did when he drove the cart, imagining across the garbage dump where the character lived. This film is based on the stories of Shugoro Yamamoto and tells the story of a group of people who live in houses around the garbage dump effectively. It is a combination of laughter and sadness. <br /> <br /> The first movie made by Akria Kurasowa is something I want to see for a long time. It is often indicated that it is just strange in the shortened version of the original three or four hours due to errors at the time working on certain promotional materials. I am waiting for the full version, waiting to see what Kuruso wants us to see in order to know the latest news from Criterion that the full version is 140 minutes full version. <br /> <br /> Finally sit down. Last night I had mixed emotions about this movie. The first and most important thing is that it connects with every movie that follows. You can see the rest of Kurazawa's other six films that are reflected in this film until the sunset is painted. It is a movie that is outstanding in color usage and you can understand why it takes time for movie stock as long as he is happy with him. This film is a work in the visual arts. (Even if receiving a warning if you will see this on your wide screen TV that is shot 1.33, so will appear in the normal TV ratio). The rest of the film is a mixed bag. Part of the problem is that the lives of these people do not come together. They all work well. But as a separate story, they are not one. I do not blame Kurazawa because nobody can always hit things out of the box, especially when someone like Robert Altman, who specializes in many movies. This character explodes himself. <br /> <br /> This is not to say that there is no reason to watch the movie Kurasowa. Every thing has a reason to watch his movie, whether they work or not. The first trip of the "wheelchair" is one of the best things that Kuruso has ever done and is worth the price of the rental. One of the most magical moments in film history while the cart was checked and brought out Father and son who live in the car are touching (But in the end it's very sad) and there are bits and other pieces that shine (like the actors on the opposite side of the big board) and at least should try this movie as something different from men We are often associated with samurai movies or crime dramas. <br /> <br /> It's an interesting misunderstanding from the original filmmakers, which means that in this case it's better than other filmmakers who have experienced. <br /> <br /> Between 6 and 7 overall, much higher
