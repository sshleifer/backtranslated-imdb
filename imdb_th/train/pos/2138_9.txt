This film revolves around Japanese culture as much as the lives of modern Japanese families. Those who are over 7 years of age (especially in public), those who feel physically feel dazed instead of hugging even if you are a friend or close relative Ballroom dancing involves putting your arms around others and in public as well! Less ballroom dancing is very popular. People in ballroom dancing in Japan seem to like westerners naked and many want to do more. But was interrupted by culture A delightful family movie where every amateur dancer will enjoy the dance sequence alone. I understand that it is more popular than the Titanic in Japan. I think Japanese people are like the rest of us - they like to hug as well.
