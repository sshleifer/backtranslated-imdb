I happily accept that I am a beautiful movie sucker and enough movement and camera angles are enough to make me interested in a relatively long movie. Not the length of Gojo, although it has the most amazing movies I've seen since MUSA in the Korean era. However, Gojoe gives more than beautiful images. (Like Musa ... which does not mean differences) - The second greatest strength is great performances. I have to admit that it is quite certain that the point is what it is trying to do in the end. But it stimulates some thoughts along the way Vague people But definitely think: p <br /> <br /> One department that this movie is probably better is action. There is a lot of blood shed in the movie. But all actions were filmed with hyperkinetic close-ups and were often obscured by objects in the foreground. It creates images that are very dark and impressive. But it is good to see more real movements, something that makes it more convincing that the villains can wade through the entire army, causing everyone to lose. Have been seen for a while and recommend!
