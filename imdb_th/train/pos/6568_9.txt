I enjoy this movie since I was a child and to this day still do A simple story about finding a kidnapped girl and a true adventurer from a paperback book. It has more actors that go back in time. This should not prevent the audience from spinning. Wayne City is the main character in Jake Speed. Of course, it may be bitten by some elements of Romancing the Stone and Indiana Jones, but this movie is good enough to make it out Basement I'm surprised that there are not many people who know this. It must be obscured by other films in the cinema. In 86, I watched it on cable TV. It may be difficult to find because it doesn't print on both VHS and DVD. I managed to get a DVD from eBay at less than 8 bucks! Cool flick
