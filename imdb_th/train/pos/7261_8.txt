I strongly disagree with "ctomvelu" about Jim Belushi's abilities. I like Belushi very much. I admit that I wonder when he first appeared at the scene because I was a big fan of John the younger brother His death But Jim has a charm on the screen that makes him very far away and he has developed it for many years. <br /> <br /> Lonsu is one of his previous movies - his weight is a free gift. (Not true for most of us?) - And I like this movie. Yes, it touches and warms, so if you come into the car to chase bombs and free sex, you may want to pass on this - it's a warm film of the three lost that meet. Don't understand me wrong, I have all three keys mentioned in the successful movie. But I like this good and stable story. <br /> <br /> And even though Belushi and Kelly Lynch are performing well The true star of this movie is the real cute Alisan Porter. <br /> <br /> I don't know what happened to her career. But anyone who is responsible for throwing the ball should) be shot. You can't ask for a perfect introduction to fame over this film. But haven't heard from her since then. <br /> <br /> Hollywood story is sad. Another story ...
