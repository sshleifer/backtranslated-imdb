Embarrassing. I just watched this movie for the first time 13 years after the launch. It is a story that any father or brother can relate to ... one brother is a 'wild'. Another brother is a typical child. Craig Sheffer is a person who is not too frantic as an elder brother. But Pitt is great. The fishing scene filmed in Montana is really amazing ... I don't know if fly fishing is attractive. The movie closely follows the book, with a few modifications to suit the movie style. Unlike most books related to this film, the size is the same. It's a perfect movie for everyone who wants a quiet night with powerful and emotional movies.
