I watched the program 10 years ago and liked it very much !!! Now I'm in the possession of the DVD and watching the series and waiting for the scene I know in the list. (When Lucas encounters Gail in his house) and realizes that it has disappeared - suddenly I was tempted without a leader That's not a mess thanks !!!!! But there seems to be a conflict Some comments indicate that "Strangler No. 19 and Triangle 20, when there are others in other ways and Potato Boy 5 and Dead to the World 6, too, can some people explain it?
