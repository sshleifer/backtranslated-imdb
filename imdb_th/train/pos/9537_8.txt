Some people may feel that the rating I received is quite generous. But for this film, I think the director has done very well with what they have for them. This is a movie with a taste that has come! <br /> <br /> My immediate idea is a direct connection to the classic cult movie 'The Thing', a parasite alien from space. Outta interferes with the host man to cause damage wherever possible. <br /> <br /> You can see how this film shows respect for this type of film and others in the horror / gore genre, but still maintains its own initiative wisely. These continue To each other and then to eat Kill and choose humans when needing a new host! To choose a fight again with another infected host! And this movie still has a love story But I won't say anything more than that. <br /> <br /> Great! But as I said about the taste, so don't be surprised if you don't like this movie. It is a low budget and yes, it will be blood thirsty with creatures / aliens / things that make their limbs become rude weapons such as saws, saws, blades and even my strange guns. Found myself being flattering what I was showing But at the same time stared at the screen, wondering what would happen next. <br /> <br /> So if you like blood, you like aliens, you like fighting and even There may be a little love from somewhere, then I have to recommend this movie as I have to see. I just hope that I will find this thing earlier and then I do!
