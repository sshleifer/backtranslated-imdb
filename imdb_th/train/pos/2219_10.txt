This film is an interesting image in the Creole culture and society that a few African Americans are aware of. My two children are from the product of the father's grandmother, whose father is a member of the Gens de couleur libre and the black woman whose parents had been a slave. He married outside and resisted his culture and was cut off from every family except one sister who had pity on her siblings, raising 8 children during the Great Depression of 1929, providing food for the family whenever possible Of course, she helped this family secretly for fear of communicating with her. My daughter is passionate about movies. We made it part of our library.
