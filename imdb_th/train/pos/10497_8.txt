I just think it's great and I still do I am grateful that we can still see things that are different from what Hollywood almost flooded us with. Saving Grace is intelligent and fun - those who are offended by what marijuana should go to watch America's bride's movies. <br /> <br /> Saving Grace also shows that comedy movies don't need to be. Stupid I laughed and resigned in most periods. But still pondering the question about the female lead character that should be done to pay off the debt of her deceased husband. <br /> <br /> In brief and good acting and directing You can't ask anything. <br /> <br /> 7/10
