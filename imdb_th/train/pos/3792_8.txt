I saw this movie recently today and I am amazed by the authenticity of the dialogue for the main characters. It doesn't feel like a movie - it feels more like a documentary. (When I like it the most) The woman who is leading in this movie is a true story for me, like a fifteen year old girl I know. <br /> <br /> All of this is a fun movie.
