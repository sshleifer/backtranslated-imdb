This is a great movie "Call Me Anna" because it shows how long a person has to suffer for not knowing what she is for Patty Duke to come out in the public eye and tell her story Inspiration for those suffering from this disease I respect you very much The only thing I don't like is that I can't take it on tape. I try to find it. But without success Anyone know how to get?
