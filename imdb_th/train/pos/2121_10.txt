This is a beautiful movie that every player acts as a miracle. It will make you laugh and it will make you cry. The end of the movie makes me confused every time. If you want to watch great movies, this is it. Jimmy Stewart gave a witty performance and Frank Morgan as Mr. Mosscheck spelled out. The diversity of Morgan's characters is not surprising. William Tracy is Pepi, a great cartoon and the most important film, and the show Felix Bressart presents the same great performance as Perovitch, who runs a shop that stumbles upon the ambition of life Making the person he works with satisfied It is a simple matter that close co-workers can become and the way in which two people with good hatred continue to fall in love, even if the situation is unusual.
