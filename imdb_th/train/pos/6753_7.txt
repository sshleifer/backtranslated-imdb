Otto Preminger's classic Noir works almost as a flip side of Laura ... while the film is glitzy and features Clifton Webb high-luting blue. The film is very seamier, both Dana Ann. Drew is a little less than a policeman, who accidentally kills a single man, so sticking with the father of the woman he loves. Preminger helps things move quickly with a clip in order to overlook the logic. easily Andrew is quite good. (There is much less wood than before) and Gene Tierney, beautiful, amazing, very beautiful! The creepy Craig Stevens plays the victim of the WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS, a must-see and excellent companion for the equally awesome WHIRLPOOL of Preminger (also starring Tierney).
