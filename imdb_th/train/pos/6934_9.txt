Winchester '73 is a wonderful story and that's what I like. Not your western every day - use a rifle that passes your hands from various characters - a mechanism to tell stories about these people. Rock Hudson plays the head of an Indian. Jimmy Stewart plays a great leader with heart and strength, and Shelley Winter plays a girl who has to deal with her husband's reality Her west The important thing to note for the correct type of politics is that they kill many Indians in this movie without repentance. According to today's standards, it still has violence. But it's a great story and worth watching. Have fun!
