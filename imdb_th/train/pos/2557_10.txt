I myself am still a child in my heart, meaning I love watching cartoons. Still doing! I remember watching Bugs Bunny when I was a kid. He was still my favorite. I think men, this is a great "new" program on TV and than my father says. "Bugs Bunny. I remember watching him when I was young." And I like "Father Bugs doesn't exist when you're younger." So I think he is more than satisfied with one version. Excellent for children and adults. Okay, everyone. It's very funny. My husband and I, both in our 20s, like to watch programs and we don't mind going back to work again. This item brings many memories back to happiness. I love Christmas special. Tweety is Tiny Tim. It's cute. I can't choose the favorite Looney Toons character because it has changed for many years. When I was young, it was definitely a bug and Porky Pepe was cool. I always loved him. In fact, I must say that there are all my favorite things. I gave this show 10 out of 10 because it was a great performance for all ages. Very funny. The acting with the voice is unbelievable. The only flaw is that it is a shame that it ended two decades ago. !
