No one understands the true logic behind the counting of the zombie numbers of Italy, but ?? Honestly ?? Why do we worry? All the movies in Zombi- "Series" provide great fun, horrors and nakedness, and "Zombi 3" is not an exception to this. The film began as an interesting project, Lucio Fulci, which had to explain more about his "Zombi 2" success, but it ended up being Bruno Mattei's typical product that had flaws and ideas stolen from the movie first. page The screenplay is hopelessly incompetent and ignores the continuity of all forms of intelligent thought from George A. Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" and "The Crazies" over and over again. this But all this did not disappoint me for a moment because it was more noble than the wonderful blood. On the secret base of the Philippine army, scientists have infected the bacterium "Death One" and prepared for transport. After a failed attempt to steal the corpse virus, the terrorist infection was burned and the zombies ashes were contaminated with the entire population of nearby tourist villages. The last survivors must fight with zombies that are violent and inhumane, including white soldiers who are ordered to kill everything that moves in the contaminated area. This movie is comparable to the "Nightmare City" of Umberto Lenzi. It is not really good ... but provides incredible entertainment with fast action scenes and creative crazy zombie situations. For example, dead birds are the birthplace and the sequence of births of all zombies that the abandoned hospital is quite cool as well. The infamous flying scene is not as scary as it was thought of, and it is the perfect thing to flick the amazing and fascinating Italian zombies. Recommend to fans; Don't mind negative comments
