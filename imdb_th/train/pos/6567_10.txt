Most people (36) give this movie 10 stories and people that aren't too important or might expect something else. This is one of my favorite movies from the 80s. It grows with you and has everything. I just get on DVD and 20 years later, still not disappointed. There are plenty of action, drama, romance and comedy. Add to that the excellent car chase, automatic weapon shooting and explosive things and you will get a fun ride experience! You will have to hum or sing the main song for many days after seeing this. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie with your wife / girlfriend and you will enjoy it a lot. The evidence is that the hero of a paperback book like Doc is cruel and really helps people fight evil so that he can write this story as a true story for life here. Actress Jake Speed ​​is also the director director. Creating and authoring many movies In this film, Jake Speed ​​(character) is a type of adventurer, Indiana Jones. He often uses his head to get out of a tough situation. But sometimes will turn to use fierce weapons (yes! And good luck!) Watch the high-tech "James Bond" device, which is his best SUV on the road, falling from the sky. <br /> <br /> The heroine is a very interesting young love from The first vampire Jim Carey The movie "Once Bitten" and here, she is older and is still amazing when compared to her little blonde sister. <br /> <br /> The bad guy is a "real bad guy" and The worst in your life Love to hate The ending is perfect and can stand alone or invite the next part. Never be sad - but you can imagine what will happen next. <br /> <br /> You have to watch this movie because it will create. Entertainment and make you fun And that is the ticket price that is worth
