What do you say about a man who is getting married and has his bachelor party with his best friend at the Hawaiian men's bar? Smooth sailing until he took off the "tri-cap" out. What would you say about him talking to one of the dancers who had guided and slept with her? What would you say if the woman was the cousin of his finances? New low, right? D Paul Coleman, played by Jason Lee, brings this experience from the unclearness of nausea and the new low point. I must say that this is one of his good roles. However, I believe that his role in Vanilla Sky is better. <br /> <br /> His finances, named Karen, played by Selma Blair, the actress - up and down while Becky is the character. Lovely and talented Karen Julia Stiles returned to where we left. Now, Paul must deal with one of the problems that arise with another problem. He received the disease, had to contact some people and had to play the game, his lies with smuggling, or each family member can receive P.O'ed, including one of his relatives who do not have "Bowel movements" for 14 days * Vomit * All of this led to a long-awaited marriage with one hilarious scene before returning all the hell that Paul and his brother had to pass. > <br /> Overall, what a guy is funny and is okay, sometimes the story may look like nowhere and you're tired of the scene here and there. But it is a mixed movie And if you are a Canadian and a big fan of CTV Brett Butt, Corner Gas sitcoms, you will recognize the small role of Fred Evanuk, the same man who plays hilariously in the series. This movie is all right. It is another feather in Lee's hat (an empty hat) <br /> <br /> My score: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
