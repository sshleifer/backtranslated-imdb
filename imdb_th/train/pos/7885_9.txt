First of all, I have to start this opinion by saying that I am a big Nightmare on Elm Street fans. I think it's the greatest horror movie ever for me. Freddy is a boogeyman! Of course, Freddy's Dead, who tried to be the last chapter at that time, was a strange movie. It didn't have the same atmosphere as the previous movie. Freddy had a lot of screen time. Some people think that it makes him less scary, which I agree. And that is in my opinion on the point This movie already exists, so we can know Freddy better. Who is he? Who is he who haunts our dreams? For some people it is a bad thing. It would be better if we never knew because it was scary to not know why evil is evil. Obviously, these people don't like Rob Zombie's remake. To truly enjoy this, you have to see things. It's not about strange men hiding in the forest in the dream land. You who are going to make you scared This is the first time and it's great. Many years ago, Freddy killed more and more people and no one could get rid of him. Now it's time to learn about the nature of this evil and the psychological aspects of Freddy's Terror Kingdom. In addition to Freddy's past stories, I also like the atmosphere of the movie. No more children in Springwood. There are only crazy adults. The nightmare scene is great. Great soundtrack, especially the opening song called '' I'm Awake Now '' which was performed by Goo Goo Dolls. In my opinion, the Nightmare Final is a horror masterpiece and I can't believe it is worth it. Too low Maybe it is misunderstood or I have different tastes! However, all Freddy fans should watch it. It has many awesome moments and funny moments as well and lots of hijackers! Get ready for something different and you may not be disappointed.
