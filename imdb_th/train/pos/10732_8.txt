I was able to watch this movie superbly. He was not surprised by himself when it happened for the truth to himself that the flight to a place without a place. But it's just a conspiracy theory. <br /> <br /> I like to watch this movie very much as a child. I'm interesting that if it appears that such a flight really happened, of course it is not a belief because it is a denial of logic and common sense. Anyone with a healthy feeling sent to children with the space shuttle into orbit. I like reading about American and Soviet space programs. I know that some missions of the Space Shuttle are still provided by the CIA with absolutely secret sentences. These are just my divorce, but who knows?
