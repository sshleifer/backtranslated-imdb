Hello everyone. This is my first post and I love movies. No my children and I can watch over and over again !! I recorded the tape for a long time like a few years ago and I dropped it and broke it and I didn't see it in the last few years !! Can anyone please tell me when it will come again !! I would really appreciate it !! You can email me if you want to make it, that is my favorite movie, including Empty Cradle, and if anyone knows when that happens, please let me know! <br /> <br />
