The prince is shown as a 'child' in a semi-autobiographical movie of a talented young musician. But was fascinated by himself who had a very poor home life True performances make it a must (except Morris Day and especially Clarence Williams, which is perfect for playing), but this film is still excellent and is the best in the 1980s. It has a soundtrack. The best of any movie in the last 50 years, at least the highly copied lines and trash scenes are very popular !! Plus Apollonia is just beautiful. Not about unrelated matters when I saw the prince in a concert in 2004. He burst the stadium. He is an expert actor and one of the best concerts I've ever met. <br /> <br /> My class: A DVD / CD Special: Disc 1) Explanation of the director Albert Magnolias Creative Director Robert Cavallo and Director of Photography Donald Thorin; Movie trailers; Example of the movie "Under the Cherry Moon" and "Grafitti Bridge" Disc 2) A 12-minute short story at First Avenue Club; "Purple Rain: Bachstage Pass (half-hour feature in the movie which I will review later on this page)" Riffs, Raffs and Revolution: The Effect and Influence of Purple Rain "10 minutes of featurette; 30 minutes of MTV Premiere video (when MTV doesn't suck goodbye) 5 Prince's music videos (Let's Go Crazy Take Me When Doves Cry I will die 4 U / Baby I am a star and purple rain); 2 Videos by The Time (Jungle Love and The Bird) and music videos for "Sex Shooter" by Apollonia 6 <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Apollonia shows her good ass titties
