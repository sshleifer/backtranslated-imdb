This is the first trilogy of the 3 Somerset Maugham short stories. The first is The Verger, which is about 15 minutes long and very entertaining. After 17 years, Albert Foreman was laid off from his church work because he could not read or write And what will he do Of course, opening a tobacco store <br /> <br /> The second is Mr. Know-All, which is actually a story that I read for the school six years ago and immediately forgot until I heard another familiar introduction. One minute 15 and still very good. It works better on film than in books for me. But perhaps because I was just 14 years old afterall <br /> <br /> The third is almost empty. Almost an hour long, it just dragged It's not all bad. But not as fast and as fast as the past 2 I watched the first quarter of it, then skipped forward in the last quarter and found that it was still reasonable and really I didn't miss the thing <br /> <br /> Overall, I gave 8, 9 and 6 out of 10, respectively.
