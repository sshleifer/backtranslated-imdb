This film is one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen. Suitable for everyone in the family to watch. Thoughts may look a little deeper But it's a funny movie that feels good and the performance is excellent Love little boy And the Academy Award winner adrien brody may be very short but very memorable Highly recommended
