Before Kuku had a demon dog in 1978 on Halloween night, the movie "Devil Dog, The Hound of Hell" premiered. The story of a family that has received a new puppy (From a farmer who just happened to sell fruit and vegetables in the area) because their dogs were killed. Skipper believed? Everyone loves a new dog. But there is something strange about him. <br /> <br /> Not long until Father Mike Barry (Richard Crenna, First Blood) begins to notice his wife Betty (Yvette Mimieux, Where The Boys Are, Jackson County Jail, Snowbeast) is different and his children Charlie and Bonnie (Ike Eisenman, Witch Mountain and Fantastic Vourage and Kim Richards, Witch Mountain, Nanny and Professor Hello Larry, Tuff-Turf) also change. Does the dog have something related to it? He is determined to find and do whatever it takes to help his family. <br /> <br /> This film is great because Ike and Kim played more of their dark side than we saw in the Witch Mountain movie. This is one of the horror movies created for the TV, which is scary for horror movies created for TV. Creepy music and even the ending that I will not tell you to think. <br /> <br /> This movie also shows Ken Kershaw. (Cliff Barnes of Dallas) and RG Armstrong (who can't stay away from the devil movie. Remember "Race with the Devil"?) <br /> <br /> It's worth it. Value to watch
