But there are only a few that can affect the mood that this film does Adam Sandler dragged you into extreme heat and frequent violent eruptions.

But there is one scene that should keep your eyes watered and vibrated Even though most men have to be merciless who do not feel anything while watching this movie, Don Cheadle offers great performance again. But Sandler was shining out. Liv Tyler and Jada Pinkett Smith gave a strong performance. But nothing in the line of both leading roles Sandler's humor still appears, which actually helped the film not to fall. There are many things to laugh.
