The movie has a very low rating (for me). What good writing in the movie should be about Kasdan. Find the meaning of our lives and put it for everyone to see and wonder. This film is about the divide that people create to protect themselves from violence, hatred and fanaticism in everyday life. <br /> <br /> On the way we were asked questions about the life of Davis. (Steve Martin with a great beard) Ask yourself, 'I'm creating a violent movie. (And expanding enjoyment) causes violence in society? 'Claire asked, "What kind of world makes something equal to human life? Mac doesn't have immunity as he asks. 'There is a possibility to pass the boundaries of competition and finance. (It's a more difficult step) or not. Of course, these things are not from movies. It adds more than the answer. <br /> <br /> But that is the nature of life. We try to make all of our lives find answers to questions that we will not answer at all and in some cases must make the answer appropriate to us. The needs and desires of our own, while human beings grow in the question that we cannot answer, some answers are true. Claire and Mac realize that even though they can travel easily. Her life was in their hands. Some answers were not. Davis `saw the light 'and decided not to create a violent movie. But the next day turned around, searching for answers to all things. This movie didn't respond. It just reminds you to look for answers. <br /> <br />
