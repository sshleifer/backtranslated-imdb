There are very few movies that are funny like this. I'm lucky enough to watch this movie at the "reserved" theater for people who like movies like me, so it's not embarrassing to sit there, laughing until my jaw is very hurt and my sleeve gets wet From dry eyes ... <br /> <br /> Sometimes the story is quite "slow", but that may be the best thing - resting while rolling between the corridors. (I almost dropped out of the seat ...) The most welcome.
