This movie is an hour or more for good entertainment and a truly funny time. I love Matt's character and still tiny. It seems that they are the most attractive and funny characters and the most interesting. Matt is very good. (As well as his cousin who is not very good) and female police and female biker, blond hair, gives a delightful eye I must say that I saw the impressive similarities between Matt and Eric Bana, another Aussie actor. My favorite part is the brothel like that. Overall, I like this movie and will rate 8 penalties. However, I was disappointed. It was a curled foot instead of a suitable shoe lasso. <br /> <br /> I'm joking :)
