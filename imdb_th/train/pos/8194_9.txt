Although there are other comments outlined here, it may be the best Dirty Harry movie. The film reflects the social and political feelings of the country during Reagan's prosperity in the early 1980s. Kickass with <br /> <br /> launching with independent female judges overturned the murder case due to lack of concrete evidence famous "Go ahead, make my day" line), "sudden impact" is a non-stop roller coaster of action movies. The first time you breathed is when Inspector Sittichai was sent to a nearby town to investigate the background of the murdered Hood. It will be better from there, with a group of overly thugs for Sittichai to deal with the Sheriff and the mysterious past. Great direction and photography and hilarious chapters that helped make this film one of the best movies of the 80s.
