I bought this game on eBay because I heard that it is a game similar to Elite. The playing style is very similar and very addictive. When I played it a few times, I went back on eBay and bought a copy for all my kids so they could join in the fun as well .... I played this game through and the story made it feel. as If you're in the movie, it's great. If you have trouble exploring because of the limited story of a single-player game, just install the Freelancer server on your PC (easily and with software included) and play with the content in your mind. There are still many Freelancer servers on the internet, so many players have no problems and are not threatening because you don't mean other players unless you want to. So, get a copy of this game, learn by playing a single player campaign, then set your status online and enjoy yourself. The depth of this game is staggering with a huge system for exploration and destruction to find, including many other things to discover - hidden planets, worms, secret worms, almost endless lists. Great game and especially you will get it for a couple of quid on ebay. Get the full guide if you can. (Blue box is not a red Xplosiv box) It loads better!
