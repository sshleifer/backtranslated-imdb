It is predicted that between 2000 and 2020, 68 million people will die prematurely due to AIDS. The most anticipated death toll is Africa Sub-Saharan, which is expected to have an additional 55 million deaths. In addition to the horrific statistics, it is a personal story that we rarely hear. The most in Close to Leo, a film produced for French television, which is part of a series related to the problems that young people face Even though the character is related to a very deplorable situation - the result of a diagnosis of HIV in a loving family. <br /> <br /> When Leo is twenty-one years old (Pierre Mignard) tells his parents and two teenage brothers, Triton (Rodolpho Poe) and Pierrot (Jeremy Lipmann) that he is AIDS. The family is completely destroyed. They decided to stop information from Marcel, his youngest brother, 12 years old (Yannis Lespert), but he heard the conversation and began to insult and commit mistakes. When Leo went to Paris for treatment, he received Marcel with him, but the little boy faced Leo and wanted to know the truth. Leo tells him that he is sick and Marcel is sad, but admits when he takes Marcel to meet some gay friends. Earlier, the tension between them was boiling up on the surface. <br /> <br / > Although I feel uncomfortable with the bed-related scenes that involve physical contact between brothers and sisters. But I feel that the sincerity of Close to Leo and the great performances by Lespert and Mignard are more than scales in favor. Seeing the events that occurred from the perspective of the young man made this movie a genuine one that reminded me of the movie Quebecois Leolo and The 400 Blows of Truffaut. Close to Leo. Tell the brutal truth. But do it in a gentle and amazing manner
