I will be honest: It's not Sholay for sure, but you can't get Sholay every week. In fact, you can see a clear signature of "Not my daughter" (Sally Field, 1991) in this movie However, while the movie "Inspired" Most of the time, this movie is a well-inspired movie. Nana Patekar, as usual, tends to be hysterical, but all others are praised Special about Dipti Naval: see her after a long time But she didn't lose grace at all In fact, she did much better when I saw her last time. Another of the Bollywood stars that seems to grow more beautiful at an older age. <br /> <br /> All of this is a good watch.
