But the ending is only meaningful when you watch movies from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The alienation of youth in the late 1960s from the perspective of young men and women is a clear theme of "Zabriskie Point "Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin do not have much acting experience. The truth that enhances the text of the movie.

Except for the first ten minutes, it is the most obvious image. Beautiful natural images are about the world and in full accordance with Mark's and Daria's emancipation. <br /> <br /> I will replace the weak Pink Floyd song with many of The Door's songs. Come for "Riders On The Storm" <br /> <br /> Even then I like this movie. It's different; It's unique It is art and imagination.

And the last eight minutes of this film make people fascinated by philosophy
