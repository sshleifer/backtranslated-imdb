This movie is very fun. I suggest you look at yourself and watch with your friends again. Last night and it was a very interesting story that Norma Khouri could draw everyone into her world. I felt a little strange to see my friend walk through the same roller coaster that I did for the first time. But they all thanked me and loved the movie You know it's a great movie if you spend 2 hours after the movie talks about this movie! <br /> <br /> I once saw a convent man almost at the level of Norma Cory. But nowhere near the same size ring He deceived the gullible and wealthy people at Berkeley CA A.A. A group that everyone trusts in others, he will "sponsor" only those who seem to do very well. Who knows that he will be stolen more than 100k (in 1987 when it was real money) after being in the city for just 1 month. His victims were very fragile because they were in the first month or week of consciousness. He is a wicked person with great laughter and a smile on his face. <br /> <br /> The above-mentioned offense is not about what Norma Kuri had done with his old neighbor. you But I don't want anything at all. <br /> <br /> I just met last night in the late-night movie channel "Showtim". I think this is the greatest experience that a movie fan has to be obsessed with seeing. Something Just drag your friends to see this and don't tell anything. It is a very entertaining movie. It moves quickly and doesn't make you bored. <br /> <br /> This should be an international classic movie all the time. I believe that all the great movies will rise to the top. Time is very good for this movie. I'm just sorry that no one has heard of this in some way that makes it even more strange. <br /> <br /> The director and the editor are great. They deserve a great documentary award. <br /> <br /> Just watch this movie!
