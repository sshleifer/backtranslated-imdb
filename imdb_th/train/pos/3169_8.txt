I rented it many years ago. The video store has only one VHS. Go straight to the video pressing the button. It's a progress. (You know that the box covers using the same font and color of the successful movie) I don't know what to expect except what is printed. The first thing I thought while watching was "What is wrong with the sound?" - Obviously there is no dialogue. So loud words, so I stopped chewing whatever I had to pay close attention to - you don't have Shakespeare here! In simple terms, this story is simple, as the boys find women, etc. The thing that makes me a funny and sincere person in this movie seems to not have written a parody cartoon. But not the actors pulling out of their real work temporarily (collective uniforms) as you begin to feel how the filmmakers are afterwards, seeing that there is no cheap humor effort (People hurt their organizations using rudeness. This does not damage the market. If they have more budget, it will be better, which I'm sure they consider every day. But they go ahead and do it. I feel that it's what makes this movie independent. "Indie" was thrown as if it were a genre.
