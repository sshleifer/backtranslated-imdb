Katherine Heigl, Marley Shelton, Denise Richards, David Boreanaz. Even before I knew what the film was about, these names were enough to attract me to be beautiful, talented and popular. To be careful, <br /> <br /> Ok, where do I start? We already know what this movie is about. Five beautiful girls who are targeted by the successive 'romance' slasher. Men that they all turned to dance at school 13 years ago. His trademark includes subtle deaththreats disguised as Valentine cards, chocolates, worms and Bleeding nose The weapon he chooses: the ax, the knife, the power, the drill, the bow and arrow, the iron, the heat, etc. OK. So, in general, it's a horror movie that has a distorted sexual feel. <br /> <br /> Movie Horror should not be Shakespeare. But I won't go there I love horror movies But not all of this. I love it there with my other favorites. It's funny, sexy and scary. The killer's mask looks creepy and sees Cupid shooting arrows and arrows at the victim. The performance is top: Denise Richards, Marley Shelton and David Boreanaz. It's fun. I want to see Katherine Heigl more. I am one of her big fans and want to see you working. Bring some things soon. Jessica Capshaw is a very talented actor and Jessica Coffee will act as the perfect blonde girl in Urban Legend 2, too. Hedy Buress It is a horn ('bleedmedry.com') and the younger generation Denise Richards looks scary like you. <br /> <br /> Highlights: Every scene of death has a special difference. Creepy is the opening scene in the morgue, the hottest scene while laughing is well done. And scary mazes and sounds Great soundtrack with creepy music and good alternative music. <br /> <br /> Lowpoint: I feel as though the killer is not outstanding enough, we barely see the mask. During Climax I still think that the climax point is not really focused, but it's fun. <br /> <br /> The twist at the end is not surprising. But I'm glad that the filmmakers decided to help us all. 'Explanation of the killer'. <br /> <br /> I don't like telling people what movies they should watch. But if someone asks me to choose a horror movie that I think is worth it to see it <br /> <br /> My score: 10/10 (Bullseye!)
