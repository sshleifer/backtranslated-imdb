Green Eyes is a great movie. In the current context of supporting our troops, it is interesting that this film shows that the respected soldiers are not received from their duties during this time. From a historical perspective, the end of the Vietnam War makes us all have things to remember and learn from. Gene is very proud of this film and he deserves the credit he received from writing "Green Eyes". I agree. I don't understand why this movie doesn't appear more often This movie is a movie that should be screened on TV every year, like the Wizard of Oz. The dedication of a man towards his lost son is moving completely. I am a friend of Gene Logan and I am proud to know him. Full of stones
