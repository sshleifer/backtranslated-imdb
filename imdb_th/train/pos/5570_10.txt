This movie is Sophmoric, but it's a joke that everyone goes out. it represents "Children's room ideas" played by "the other side". It is good to see such currents and how stupid they are. But that may not be news for most women 'cause (just ask one person) "They've heard of' em all before" <br /> <br /> Watch with a small group or a group of mixed sex and 97.3% from the room Will laugh for 2 hours straight and 2.7% ... will you really satisfy them?
