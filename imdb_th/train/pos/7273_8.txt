Carlos Mencia is great. This is an extra hour. He worked hard to show everyone that he was real. I know that people say that he has stolen the contents of this special program. But that's not true Carlos presents a joke in the way he wants, not everyone else wants. It is the reason why he is good. People said that he wasn't funny because he said it was too good and they still didn't realize that that was part of his actions and that they didn't want that. But he brought it like that. Laughing. For those who hate everyone here, this is the message. Carlos is here to stay. You have no issues to disappoint him.
