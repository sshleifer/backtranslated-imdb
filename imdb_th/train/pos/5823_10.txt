In Micro Phonies, the stooge is the best. In this short term, the three men are working artisans in the recording studio. They ended up looking at Alice Van Doren (Christine Mcintyre) singing with the voice of spring. Amazing sound Mrs. Bixby hears a trance in the cabinet (Symona Boniface), a pot called the senior Kukaracha. The three stooge ended with a party that Curly would dress as a drag. They played a recording of the spring and everything went well until the record pot broke on the head of the curl. They ended up using Lucia sexlet until Baritone would memorize them and unplug them. Alice Van Doren catches the man screaming and hiding behind the curtain to help them. Everything went well until Baritone wondered how Alon sang with the help of the record that Alice found behind the curtain. All three were revealed to be fraudulent. But Alice's father discovered the ability of his daughter and agreed that she should be a singer. The stooge was thrown out of the great room.
