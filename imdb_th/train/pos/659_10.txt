One of the last classics of the French New Wave for the movie direction, Jean Eustache draws from the simplicity of the cinema at the beginning of the century. For the story Eustache draws suffering from his own complex love life. Many things that can be said in this film - excellent observation; Prolong yourself Sometimes hilarious; Emotion, drainage ... etc. In my opinion, no matter which complaint can be adapted to this film, will be overshadowed by many strengths. Film students, writers or anyone who is willing to handle 3 hours of movies without sudden cuts. There are no music videos, no plot twists, plays like opera and no boring dialogue. Everything must be appreciated: writing (concise, intelligent, surprisingly funny). Performances (everyone is quite simple, perfect in their roles) and simple directions. (The audience feels like a casual observer in the movie.) Memorable movies This is the movie that is with you for sure.
