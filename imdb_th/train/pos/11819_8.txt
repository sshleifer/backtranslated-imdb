Just picked it up on the DVD and watched again I love the bright colors compared to the dark pictures. Not a fan of Beatty, but a great popcorn movie. Pachino is as surprising as ever, and well, this movie is a time when Madonna is her sexiest person. I hope that she will be stuck with the "breathless" look for a long time. Charlie Korsmo's first big role, besides "Bob?" Mainly maintained Beautiful scenery and emotions bring you into a cartoon environment. Cars, wardrobes, buildings and even street lights and a great tone, not to mention the perfect light, even though the scenes with a lot of red can annoy you Just hope that Beatty will be given the opportunity to create a sequel. All in all, enjoy for a few hours.
