Watch this movie in the opening and have value since then. It's a great group. (I often find the most interesting actors in the film) Really happy to see actors Jacqueline Bisset in this role, and Wallace Shawn often honk the script, which is clever and shy. Like "Beverley Hills" love "Doctor" of Paul Bartel and Ray Sharkey's servant This is filthy and harsh. But thank God! I would like to recommend this film with FYI for everyone who likes to play Kevin Bacon in six degrees, Mary Woronov and Paul Bartel in "Rock & Roll High School". Mary Woronov and Robert Beltran are in "Night of the Comet" together. All three "Eating Raul"
