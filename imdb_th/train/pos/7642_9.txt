Not really drawing a large box office But I was very surprised. <br /> <br /> With this movie, James "I do something with Farragh Fawcett" Oror. <br /> <br /> Join and write. Directing this movie about an ordinary person named Larry Burrows, who thought his life would be like that. <br /> <br /> Incredibly different if he hit a homerun in a baseball game. Important <br /> When he was 15, but thanks to the deep bartender /> <br /> Mike Marvel and Larry <br Marie gets his wish. But soon realized that his new life <br /> <br /> was not exactly what he hoped for. <br /> <br /> I must say that this movie really impressed me. <br /> <br /> Critics give me a mix and I must say that the concept is really interesting and <br /> <br /> being pulled out well. Yes, it's a little standard. <br /> <br /> Funny moments, great plays and performances so well <br /> <br /> Well, James Belushi (I think) is Oscar worthy of his role. Jon <br /> <br /> Lovitz is perfect and Linda Hamilton and Renee Russo shine in their role. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is perfect for the bartender. <br /> < br /> It's just a good movie with good lessons. If you have never seen me, <br /> <br /> suggest you check
