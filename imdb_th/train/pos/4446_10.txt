Yes, I call it the perfect movie. Not one second that is boring. The great actors of the actors and actresses who are little known, most of them are characters that are clear and everyone has motivation that can be understood. Intelligent and harmonious scene design and story that attracts and works. It is one of the best quality pictures that all Hollywood pride should be a mark that everyone should try to reach. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwick is just amazing. one There is nothing that this actress cannot do, and she is always an easy person in terms of charm. There is no serious eruption with this woman - I tend to think that she is a better actress than the screen goddess, such as Bette Davis or Joan Crawford and this film confirms my opinion. Always strong as well as nails and at the same time convey the true feelings. It's fair to add that she still has many good parts in her long career and this is the least interesting. <br /> <br /> The name that fits this movie is good. It is a matter of desire, human desire that I think everyone can understand. Actually, it seems that no one likes to plan in this movie. Every character has motivation. Everyone wants to be happy without hurting anyone. The sad truth that this thing more often than not leading to complications causes amazing content that I will not go here. <br /> <br /> I like what this film talks about youth. To compromise The movie that I linked most to this film is Alfred Hutchcock's Shadow of a Doubt, creating a similar ideal atmosphere and at the same time. This story is very similar to the movie Fritz Lang's Clash by Night, which has a very brutal appearance a year earlier in which Stanywck stars in a similar part. I can recommend
