Go to Wal-Mart and find this movie on DVD and don't know if I bought bad or bad. It was the result of the fact that I watched all the movies from beginning to end. Michelle Rodriquez (Diana Guzman), "BloodRayne", '05 gave a great performance and her look was beautiful, sexy and at the same time being educational About true performing arts Diana did not like her home life and especially her father who made him illegal for her mother. She decided to attend boxing training in the Brooklyn gymnasium and was not accepted by male boxers. In her high school there was a lot of friction between her classmates, women and men. There are many actions in women's bathrooms and personal references for men. If you like boxing and seeing the hottest sexy girls do wonders in the ring and make them know what they know, this is the movie for you.
