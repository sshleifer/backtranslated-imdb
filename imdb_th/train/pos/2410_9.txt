This movie is one of the most exciting Jesus movies I've ever seen. It doesn't try to tell the whole story. But only to express the meaning of the last day of Jesus Christ It is witty, gloomy, playful and faithful to the elements of Jewish tradition and modern Bible interpretation. Judas is more common than other images, not the dark and evil evil that we sometimes imagine. But a person who is misunderstood without deductions Christ of Saranendan is a playful and serious person, faithful and committed - very human, at the same time as God. The last conversation was made with thought and served as a small word that two powerful men might do when they had just done evil. I will watch this movie again and recommend to others.
