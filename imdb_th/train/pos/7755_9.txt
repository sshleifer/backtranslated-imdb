"Written on the Wind" is an amazingly irresistible and amazing movie that only the director Sirk can do. This film sank in a tank full of Freud's symbols, strange melodies and colorful differences. The link between financial success and moral decline is the main theme of the film. Sirk seems to suggest that sexual dysfunction is one of the side effects of capitalism. However, I like to watch movies as a good example of what Sirk can do with worthless material. An especially impressive color palette The performance in the movie is also great. Rock Hudson and Lorraine have a lot of charm and make the movie an elegant aura. But this movie is owned by Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone (She deserves an Academy Award for Best Actress) Kudos to Frank Skinner's is a stunning rhythm. Russell Metty's excellent camera work (every single shot is a masterpiece in itself) And production design department In addition, the song's name is beauty. It's a memorable movie.
