Spielberg's first drama movie was not disappointing. It is a beautifully crafted movie without any shortcomings about the lives of African-American women. It also proves that every movie that has African-American descent is the center of the story. Helped by African-American directors <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie It is very true, despite the fact that it depends on the book. In addition, Danny Glover is also great as a master, and usually he is only himself in most of his films. But in this story he broke out completely and once again But the resistance to the performance of all movies came from Whoopi Goldberg. You will never forget these characters when you watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I heard that its music version will be a movie as well and all I can say is: I hope it. About as good as this, because it's a movie that shouldn't be missed.
