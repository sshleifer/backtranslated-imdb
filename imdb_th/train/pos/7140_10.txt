20 of 10 This is a truly wonderful story about immigrants in the war and Tom Oakley, a carpenter curmudgeonly boy (William Beach), was paired with Tom and apparently he had a serious problem when he Sleeping on the bed the first night William is illiterate and frightened In any way, both find comfort in each other's loneliness. It appears that William has the talent as an artist and we see Tom's talent as a choir in the fun translation of Jerusalem. William is a friend of Zacharias Wrench, a Jewish boy as well from London and both Tom and Zacharias. He eventually learns to read and write and feels that he is part of this small knitting community as he sits down. William recalled his mother who returned to London and here we see why he was drunk. His mother was mentally ill and when Tom didn't hear from William, he traveled to London to find him. Eventually he found that he had held the dead sister whom he was bound in the basement. After a period in the hospital, Tom realized that he had to kidnap him and bring him home with him. The key point is the sweet end when William says he must be raised by Tom. At the same time, learning that his best friend, Zacaria, is killed in an air attack in London. For me, one of the most moving scenes is when Tom is talking to the staff from the home office. <br /> <br /> I love 'im,' for something worthwhile. I think he loves me too. br /> <br /> Isn't it better than this?
