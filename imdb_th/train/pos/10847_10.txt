I am 60 years old, guitarist, (as a leader / rhythm) and for the last forty years I am in four bands, that is all with a foul fight Travel frequently, little or no money, and everyone is drunk or high, but clubs, fans and music make everything worth it! Like strange fruits! Now I'm old, it's old, and arthritis in the hands and hips doesn't mean that I have to rock anymore. But for the length of the video, it comes back again Both birds, brawling and drinking! And I'm still young again! It's like Billy Connolly's voice. God likes that in the 70s! Rock Forever!
