Running Man is often dismissed as Arnie's thriller that is full of explosions, bad play and gun shooting and justice. There are many things in it. People used to watch and compare with the Terminator series, saying that it is one of the poorest Schwarzenegger movies. <br /> <br /> But for 18 years and you find yourself able to appreciate it in Different light Instead of being a stupid action movie, it works well like a reality TV parody. It's actually quite different from Stephen King's book. But I wonder if Hollywood, with its love, the ending, the rhythm and the so-called "ordinary people" that became a trained commando skill will accept it in Current format <br /> <br /> But continue with criticism <br /> <br /> Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a police officer working in the United States where democracy is the past. And the whole country is governed by a merger of government / economic media in rags, rare foods and states, causing people to distract by producing sadistic games for them to see, such as jumping for the dollar that people Jumping for money over the pit of crazy dogs and the most popular ones are The Running Man, a game show organized by Damian Killian (played by Richard Dawson for entertainment) where "criminals" are followed. These thugs by pro actor 'Rowdy' <br /> <br /> Some people try and speak against the government. When a group of hungry people protested in Bakersfield, California, a helicopter that was driven by Richards was sent to 'calm' (ie, killed). The protest when Richards refused to shoot the innocent people. He was arrested and convicted of killing people in the crowd. He was sentenced to stay in a slave labor camp. But escaped with the help of the resistance leader (Yaphet Kotto) and proceed. <br /> <br /> However, his freedom was not long and after he kidnapped the network Marita Conchita Alonso, in an attempt to escape from following him, found himself in prison again. But this time he was forced to appear on The Running Man. <br /> <br /> And of course, the whole movie started into the standard Arnie mode. Richards launched into the post-apocalyptic land of Los Angeles. Los Angeles (Why is LA always destroyed in these dystopian worlds) and forced to flee from 'Stalker' with two other prisoners Amber also wanted to know about Richards's protests about innocence and discovered that he was framed. Guess what happened to her? So while Amber Richard and the other two men tried to avoid the stalkers, we realized that Richards was not an ordinary cop. He is a super-arnie, unskilled human army that can collapse the dictatorship of an evil organization and fight with a fat man covered with Christmas lights, all while being your ordinary American person with an Austrian accent. br /> <br /> Yes, the rest of The movie became a dumb, classic 80s Arnie fun with many exciting battle scenes, terrifying play of trademarks. ('He must separate' to be my favorite) and general final confrontation and happy ending. It was so fun to watch. Killian responded to it in the form of a 'wholesome' general, and during the most fun time of the show, revolves around the difference between his interaction with the crowd as the host. kind For the cursed old woman!) And the cold and cold man, he is true to do everything to increase ratings. <br /> <br /> If you expect movies that are smart and have high eyebrows, you will Must be disappointed But if you want a good 80s flick, this is it, but the great thing about this movie is that it's a predictive prediction. <br /> <br /> If you watch the entertainment we have today, you'll notice that the way How does the reality TV run today? Himself through anything for fame, five minutes, and all manufacturers are willing to let them sell on TV Not too far to imagine that a vicious TV has been tried to show people that they were executed on TV. However, we have such videos along with the terrible hostages of Al Qaeda posted on the internet. It seems that in the current weather, at least some people are comfortable watching the true death on their television. <br /> <br /> In the heart and in parallel with the fact that today seems to be The revival of the 80s, you will be impressed with the far-sightedness of this movie. Of course, we are not there because it is more terrorist than the mainstream media that has purchased programs that are easily available to us that are really human deaths, but you have to wonder how long before the executive decides. He was able to find a way to cast a show that combined people's desire for entertainment and the desire to indulge in their curiosity ...
