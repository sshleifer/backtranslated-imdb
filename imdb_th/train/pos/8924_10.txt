This movie is excellent. The thing that separates from other people's sci-fi is the fact that aliens are not qualified, have no faces, no eyes at all. But it can't kill I like the idea that this movie didn't happen in a few days. It happened one night, which was at midnight long ago. You are stuck in it because it dissolves your flesh and gently swallows your body. The sci-fi movie, 50 stories that I like all the time and sometimes things that are considered as a quintessential movie I can see why this makes Steve McQueen a star. All this and catchy songs! How do you make mistakes?
