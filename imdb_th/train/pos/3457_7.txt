This is Columbo, directed by Steven Spielberg from the beginning of his career. It's nothing exciting. But there is something wonderful for Spielberg that can be seen in this movie. In general, this film has the same style as most Spirberg movies and TV's in the 70s. That means that some characters tend to show strangeness and no, I'm not talking about characters in Colombia only. The type of quirky character that may be best seen in Spielberg's 1975 movie "Jaws", but apart from the small hint of the typical Spielberg element, you can't call this movie a good example. Of the director of the Morning Star No matter how bad it is, it certainly isn't. But as I said before, it's not exciting either. <br /> <br /> This movie is good and very promising. But after launching well Just like the murders that occur, the movie looks slow and looks boring. Boring because most of the movies are Columbo from books that don't have a really memorable time, not boring, because it's a boring movie to watch. <br /> <br /> The murder itself is quite clever and has a concept. Having The crime writer who killed his partner, his writing, showed great potential and interest. However, the story does not explore all the possibilities of it. At least that was the feeling that this movie left me. <br /> <br /> This movie is still a good thing to watch. But thanks to the character of Jack Cassidy, who thinks he's smarter than Columbo due to his mystery / crime Writing experience and trying to give him every possible advice. Of course, Columbo knew better and he was his number one suspect from the first moment. But he plays the game as usual. <br /> <br /> The movie has a good overall style and uses a good camera position and funny editing that sees most of all in line with Spielberg's work. Greatly some camera angles <br /> <br /> Great Columbo movies and see them perfectly. But did not give Spielberg's name attached To increase your expectations too high. <br /> <br /> 7/10
