I think this movie is very compatible. The voice-overs are also great. I like how they overcome conflict and achieve their goals. I would like to recommend this movie to everyone. Of course, it's worth the time and money to watch. Atlantis has a cartoon scene that makes me laugh. Other scenes make me sad. And others make me happy It is a movie that all ages can enjoy. From the moment Milo is a "crazy" maniac or until he gathers the crew for a journey under the sea After watching the movie, I read the book. It is also good But this movie makes you imagine better It's like a book But go ahead and watch this movie!
