Classic drama / western action with amazing movies, which is the time (1954). Production is very good and you can tell that it is made with pride and love. In the northwest American pioneers, there is education and entertainment. This film is very high, because most people do not like "lawyers" during this time and place is very crooked, like The countries that are developing most of today's action might look more realistic. Still, this movie covers the most important content, not necessarily for audiences who want purity only. Western type testoterone for this film is more for those who have a sense of history and philosophy .......
