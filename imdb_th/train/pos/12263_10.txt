This is a wonderful documentary that tracks the life of Herge and the creation of his TinTin. It is based on a series of interviews conducted in 1971 and covers everything from his early life and "Nazi collaboration" to the last moment of his life. <br /> <br /> Great editing, movies and fast enough, not boring. This film will make you appreciate the work of Herge. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers create more movies than other documentaries. Using the latest modern technology and for a useful change. <br /> <br /> Recently, more and more documentaries have been used in theaters. But this is the best thing ...
