I watched this movie Sunday afternoon. I absolutely love this movie I love everything about this story from the sad moment of the mother and daughter to the scene in which Mamie Gummer (Lila) is crying because of her bad decision to marry a man for her parents, not because of her. Is true love I love these moments because it's real. At first I was seriously scared because I hoped it would not end like Bobby, a great actor. But it is a movie that is not well written and does not have real texture But in the middle of the movie I felt completely different. You will laugh and you will cry But in the end you will want to see the evening again Trust me when I say go see!
