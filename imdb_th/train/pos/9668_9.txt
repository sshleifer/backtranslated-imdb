This is a small movie, a few characters. But it tells you something about Ireland that you won't find anywhere else. This movie is Iceland. In everything there is sadness. It is a self-delusion, a man who is a teacher, Doyle SP Donnell, a cannon, a senator's daughter. Kneel and pray with them They are our sad history and they are our gifts.
