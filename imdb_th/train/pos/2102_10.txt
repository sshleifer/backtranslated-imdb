When I sat down to see 'Largo Winch', I expected more than the action scenes and interesting cars. When I stood up, I saw both of these and many more. <br /> <br /> Finally Karl Roden was not an enemy in the movie. Christine Scott Thomas plays her role well. But my opinion is Tomer Sisley and Miki Manojlovic, both of which are excellent in Radivoje Bukvic. The Goran image is good. <br /> <br /> Mixed linguistics brings good colors to movies. But I understand why people are bored with this. <br /> <br /> Hong Kong scenery And especially the stunning Croatian coast, both me and I almost never want to take my eyes off the screen when Largo enters an incredibly beautiful island. <br /> <br /> Rolls Royce Phantom; Mercedes S500 and BMW 7; If anyone loves expensive limousines, this is their movie. It is also a movie for those who like action scenes, good performances, beautiful scenery and, above all, action movies with fast writing and exciting battles. I, as I had enlightened the dark days, were: 10/10
