A There is a female friend who is pulled into a relationship with SOB with a long-term boyfriend. Of course, SOB looks good, charming and so on. And my friend is a very smart woman. Viewing the characters in the work of Jean Pierre Leaud is like watching what happens in real life when that person destroys our women friend's life. It is sad and you know that you will be very hurt. But there is nothing you can do. Leaud is great. Totally empty He pulled his face and told the story that he thought he would receive the response he wanted. <br /> <br /> The scene was two hours when Leaud and Lebrun were in love and the next morning Recording and melodious and charming, singing to make her fun "What I'm doing here with an idiot" that flicked over her face will be in my memory for a long time to come. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie. At one time, especially in cinemas Take a moment to enter But time will disappear
