A truly cute heroine who turns out to be amazed and frightened by the machine in the goose and wrestled with a futon running into the door - closing ... only a few moments that sparked my memories. 'The Naked Truth 'I like what I have seen in this list: a fun plot and some good characters, giving preference for the diamond of the list - Tea Leoni is' Nora Wilde'; Lovely, funny and amazing by chance - a refreshing way to see a comedy actress - it's not surprising that Hollywood seems to know how to cast her. Where - Oh - Where is the DVD released? The number (treble) that they release is so incredible that this small gem is still buried. (Someone please fix me if I'm wrong)
