Let's talk about another thing about gentleman Jim. I agree with all the assessments that make this one of Errol Flynn's greatest places in a great travel career. I think Jim Corbett plays the role of a fighter with his true personality. More than a skater Flynn looks like a pet from his memory and is a man who has a real life that is more exciting than his screen life. The special thing I want to point out is that the excellent editing, transitions, and still insert the punctuated beads. Although the director is Raul Walsh who collaborated with Flynn, often with filmmaker Sid Hickock. But the editing was created by an editor named Don Siegel. I never knew that Siegel went so far. But he was listed on the credit He will go to a great career as an action director.
