I watched this movie when I was a child and naturally the story of a fox family tears. Beautiful scenery in Hokkaido. A wonderful storytelling and lastly is an excellent soundtrack that gives a close feeling to the protagonist I still search for beautiful soundtracks. For German audiences, it may be useful to know that DEFA settings are worth listening to alone. I recorded both tapes (DEFA and BR) but I only watched the first program.
