One of the three best Stooges shorts that have ever been. The scary home that is full of evil people and "The Goon" challenges the best of Alert Detective Agency Shemp in the top of the famous scene in the dark. Emil Sitka provides excellent support in the role of Mr. Goodrich Which is the goal of the killing plan Before the end Shemp's "reliable little shovel" is used for excellent results. This 16 minute gem moves as fast as the Stooge and packs twice. Highly recommended
