With 'Twelve Monkeys' you have to pay attention. But if you do that, you may find that there are many things to admire. I know i do Interesting stories and related time travel The virus killed many people in 1997, and a man named Cole (Bruce Willis) was sent back in 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus. In 1990, he was arrested and sent to the hospital. Psychiatric nurse There he met Jeffrey Goins (Brad Pitt), which may be related to the virus. He also met with a psychiatrist, Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) who didn't believe him in 1990 when Cole disappeared from a mental hospital while he was chained and locked in a room. Br /> <br /> Movie Continuously playing with time Cole called and left a message in 1996. It was picked up in the future and "they" sent someone for Cole who appeared only a few seconds after the phone call. This happens throughout the movie, so you have to pay attention. You can ask questions. But because you can't answer the question yourself better than agreeing with the movie And it works like a thriller You are not sure what will happen next and that will help the movie. It may be because there are some shortcomings in the story. But since it is about characters such as time travel, you should accept what the movie tells us and just try to enjoy. That's the easy part for me.
