First of all, I want to say that I am a big fan of Bette Midler. Stella is a very good movie with a great actor. (Betty Midler, John Goodman, Trini Alvaro, Stephen Collins, Masha Mason) This is my favorite movie. It involves a mother who is raising her child. She has to go through many things that make her daughter Jenny marvel at Trini Alvarado. This movie is very good and I suggest you get a copy to see Roger Ebert. Get is 3 1/2 stars! And it deserves 4! Great! I give 4 out of 4!
