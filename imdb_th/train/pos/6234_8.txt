This is the movie Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers that I always loved. The conversation between the two is cute and funny and very smart. Not to mention the film has some of the best songs recorded by both; Like I'm laying all my eggs in one basket and let's face the music and dance If I remember correctly, this is a movie that introduced me to Fred Astaire, so I think that because it always has a special place in my heart. (Sorry for being sensitive * cr but p i am a woman) in this movie received 8/10 from me. The choreography is excellent and the fact that Lucille Ball is in it makes it even better.
