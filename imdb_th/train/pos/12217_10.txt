I went to see Ashura as a 2005 Fantasia Festival Kickoff. That guy is a great thing. The director should be in Montreal to premiere Canada. But for health reasons, he is still in Japan ... Oh my God, I hope he will be better and make many other movies. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple, but it's original ... The demons are traveling. Going in Edo in Japan and Swordsmans called "Demon Wardens" are killing them and being afraid of the new birth of Ashura. The demon demon who is asleep. Some excellent swordsman called "D Emon Slayer "and his friend Jaku, who is a jealous person with a violent general ... <br /> <br /> Looks boring? Now it is thicker ... <br /> <br /> Izumo retires from killing the devil because he kills a little boy who is "impressed" that he is a demon. He never knew. But he killed her So Izumo then spent his life and brought himself back to the Kabuki Theater. In the boat for a good night, Izumo finds a young woman hiding on a bridge and changing his life and starting a new one to kill the devil ... because of the good cause of love ... and ... People who know how to deal with the sword and pull the fun-filled massacre fighting (Yes, he knows.) He's witty, intelligent and witty. You don't have to shout: "No, IZUMO. It's difficult." This guy already knows that he has common sense. He is a really perfect hero. <br /> <br /> As far as the movie is filmed, the aesthetics are quite interesting. It is the movie that looks like the most manga. It is a cream filled with special effects and free of charge. In any way, it makes the film look realistic ... it's amazing. There are many colors to shoot "not true". Besides ... It's quite straightforward ... but as I said, the main characters are showing the movie A that must be viewed and the story is led by good hands.
