I love Paul McCartney. He is the greatest of all times in my resistance. However, I couldn't buy his concert tickets at Tacoma Dome during the tour. Back in US I was upset to say the least. Then I found this DVD. It's almost as good as being there. Paul is still a man and I will enjoy this thing for many years. <br /> <br /> I have one complaint. I want to hear all Hey Jude <br /> <br /> Paul is not dead ****
