Although John Woo's hard boiled would be my number one favorite movie But I must say that the police story is my 2nd favorite movie. I say this because I have to stop fighting and my favorite action in this movie is when Jackie Chan jumped on the train at the top of A The scooters at the mall grabbed to the pillar that is surrounded by Chrismas fire through the skylight and eventually placed on his back on a solid marble floor! Buy at amazon.com at 14:98 (or something in 14 dollars), home video, new line, VHS. Any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to answer. (I'm only 14 years old but I know Which movie can you find?) If you are looking for every movie and can't find it, please reply to me. Thank you and good night!
