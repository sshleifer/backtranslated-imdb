I have always believed that David and Bathsheba were movies that were intended for the Tyrone Power in the 20th century. Fox, although Gregory Peck, gave a good story about him as King David, a king with a lost eye. /> Many Bible stories are mentioned in this film, fornication, redemption, sin, punishment, and in general what God expects from his followers. <br /> <br /> When you are king Of course, you have many kingdoms that are not open to the rest of us. King David had many wives, including a bad woman in Jayne Meadows, the daughter of Saul, the ancestor of David. But his eyes watched Bathsheba in her garden one evening. It turns out that she was unhappy with Uriah the Hittite like David with a few women. Uriah is one of David's army captain. David sent to Bathsheba and he was a king. She came to her because she was staring at him as well. <br /> <br /> What happened about the pregnancy and death that was set for Uriah? Thoughtful fighting, but what has been seen and know that the gods have captured all these things and not just But punished David and Bathsheba only But the whole kingdom of Israel was punished with drought, disease and epidemics. <br /> <br /> Women law That day demanded that Bathsheba die with stones. David shows weakness in his previous actions. But here he stepped on the plate and asked what he had put He put his hands on the ark of the covenant, which was immediately dead as seen in the movie. <br /> <br /> My interpretation is that God admires courage even if you are wrong and he gives up to David. And forgive them both Bathsheba became the mother of Solomon and she and David were the ancestors of many descendants in the divisive kingdom of Israel and Judah until they were both defeated. <br /> <br /> Susan Hae Jayard And Uriah, played by Kieron Moore The only thing that made Moore wake up was a good fight. I like Kieron Moore's performance as a brave and somewhat stupid horseback. <br /> <br /> No one can put the law down like Raymond Massey. His prophet Nathan is in line with John's character. Brown, which he played in two films that are equally concentrated. <br /> <br /> So when His own law died, why did God please Bathsheba to David's throne? Maybe it's the fact that he doesn't want to train a third man for the job. He wants to replace Saul and David. <br /> <br /> But I think Christian interpretations may be that this is a hint of the new covenant that is about to come so that the person may sin and Receive mercy if someone asks to sin I will let the scholars of the Bible send the interpretation. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie and you may think of a whole new theory.
