This is quite short. First of all, don't listen to critics because it's not as bad as most people say !! Sniper uses classic movie formulas, which many people immediately quit while the movie is flawed. While the gunman doesn't reflect 100% truth about how the military sniper works in our country And yes, this movie has many flaws But what movies can't? There are many good scenes and good performances by Tom Berenger. I must say that the two worst scenes are the beginning of the movie with Billy Zane in the helicopter followed by Zane in the Marine's bar scene. With Berenger in the middle of the field with the force that swept it !! There are also many good forest images and some classic images that use the camera as if you were looking through a rifle. And yes, Sniper's motto is "One shot at a time". Judge Sniper for yourself !! <br /> <br />
