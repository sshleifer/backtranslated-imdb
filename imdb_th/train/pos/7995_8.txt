This is the story of the revenge of the bad guys starring Denzel Washington. He is a person with three personalities here: a former mercenary who is drunk and driven out. The key is now a kind, loving father to a small girl and a madman in seeking answers. And revenge at <br /> <br /> The story about Washington hired to be an escort for an American girl living in Mexico where the kidnapping of a child happens on a regular basis. (At least the movie) He became a child attached to a child. The actress in our time, Dakota Fanning. When Fanning was kidnapped in front of him, Washington was looking for a responsible person and no one else. Beware: This movie is not suitable for nausea. The movie has a style that is good and bad. I like it, but a lot of people find it too strong for their taste because the camera is a job that causes you headaches. I think it is suitable for a tense story, and it looks fascinating, but it (shaky camera) is not for every taste. <br /> <br /> In addition to the two stars, Christopher Walken is always interesting. The low-key role and many actors. <br /> <br /> This film is hidden in the basic emotions in all of us.
