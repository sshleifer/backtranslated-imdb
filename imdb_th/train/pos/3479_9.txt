This performance begins with a great mystery episode. I think everyone is in the first 15 or 16 episodes. After that, the program starts playing a short episode with Shaggy, Scooby doo and Scrappy doo. <br /> <br /> I think Hanna Barbera Productions must change 20 minutes into episodes. In short, some voice actors do not work after 15 or 16 episodes of Frankger. (Fred player) is not available. I think Velma's voice changed after 12 at first because the first voice actor who played Velma didn't work. <br /> <br /> And the network ordered Hanna Barbera to do shorts with Shaggy, Scooby doo and scrappy because of the high score So they have to do more shorts I hope they will be a mystery like 15 episodes. Still a good show.
