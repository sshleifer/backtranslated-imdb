So we compromise. This is a fairly charming movie. I like art direction. (It feels "real" more than most children's movies) and costumes are not too cute. Child actors are not bad at all. (Adult performances tend to be wonderful.) It's great that they show how children are being bullied, bullying others, and children standing up for bullying. <br /> <br /> I don't know if there's How many adults want to see this by themselves? The movie that will take the children and because "Barnyard" has more than 100 participants at the same time, I'm really glad that we chose to show "scattered worms" instead.
