My personal opinion is that this film has no real story for the first vampire of John Carpenter. But I don't care. I love it. Jon Bon Jovi (Derek) is a great person in this movie. He's crazy. I really believe he is the person you won't think he is a famous ROCKSTAR. There is something bad about this movie. Like the story should have more, other films should be sequels of movies that follow the story of the movie and they should keep the main characters in the three vampire movies. I like the clothes that people wear and the atmosphere they choose in Mexico. I like it old, Mexico and not new Mexico. With clay houses and old fashion churches I'm a little confused with vampires and how they can walk in the church. But it was cool that they didn't follow the rules of Dracula vampires
