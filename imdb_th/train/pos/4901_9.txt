No messages, no symbols No dark streams, just a beautiful mix of music, nostalgia and fun that people who clearly have time to do. It is a refreshing antidote for some types of solid waste in the studio. Of course, what is unparalleled with Judi Dench is worth watching. And Cleo Laine's great jazz singing is a bonus. This woman is in the same league as the late Ella. This thing put on my movie shelf to pull out again whenever I felt the need to have a warm experience and a good laugh. It's just a great movie!
