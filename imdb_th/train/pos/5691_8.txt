I am very interested in watching this movie when it's first screened in the cinema. However, I can't go anywhere. So finally it hit the floor and I picked it up. I don't know what I would expect. I put the DVD in the player, put it in the evening of murder and hit play. What followed was one of the more interesting movies that I had seen in the last few years. <br /> <br /> * Some spoilers * <br /> <br /> This is the story. Of murder in wonderland which leads to Went to LA's most insidious part and went straight to the greatest pornography beginning in the 70s. John Holmes (Val Kilmer) <br /> <br /> I'm addicted from the first place. Until the end of the blood I was surprised to find that this film focuses on less real murders and in previous events and investigations later. In addition to a few blood-stained walls at first and the true show of murder until the end of the movie, they participated in all the wonderful conversations and excellent performances. And even "beautiful, but that's it" Bosworth is a pleasure to watch (And just for you to see your heart) <br /> <br /> I feel best The aspect of the movie is that I mentioned the lack of acting immediately. Murder It shows in a very dark atmosphere, so you can't see the cruel baton completely. In addition, the sound effects of such murders are more than enough to make me want. They are dancing with lead pipes. There's nothing to say anymore. <br /> <br /> My only real problem is the short appearance of Carrie Fisher. I think her image is about people. Exceeding the religious truth is that I think she is too boring for her appearance. Maybe that person may be part of the story. But I'm not selling and for some reason Fisher looks quite "akward" in her description. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a great movie. Worth the watch, even once. <br /> <br /> *** 8/10 ***
