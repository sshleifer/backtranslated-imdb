I like it because of my latest personal experience. Especially the idea that everyone is free and that everything is limited. Characters in the company do not enjoy their "real" life, but they enjoy themselves, like what they This film has done a good job, making it a memorable day. Not only good memories But has a romantic feeling about beautiful strangers and beautiful European cities only Many movies are like this in terms of discussions about the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or certain categories. Before sunrise, it will be handled in a good way, which allows the audience to stop and think and adjust her breath and watch movies. Before sunrise, don't try to cultivate specific ideas in your head. It encourages you to think about some problems in your daily life and give you the opportunity to choose. This makes the conversation between the characters interesting, not just the usual whimpering or stupid ideas. You will still think about those problems yourself and want to know about the next line of the story. In the end, it doesn't matter much. You can take something out of it and feel something positive or positive about yourself after the movie. The movie should be fun. This is a fun movie and worth the time to watch. I'm traveling as well The movie is part of me and answers my questions.
