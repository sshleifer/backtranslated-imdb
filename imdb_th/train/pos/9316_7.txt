Walter Pidgeon is a civil law lawyer Braley Mason in the criminal case of The Unknown Man, a 1951 movie starring Ann Harding, Barry Sullivan, Keefe Braselle and Richard Anderson, who believe in justice. Pidgeon accepts a pro case that protects young men. Rudi Walchek (Braselle), accused of murder and made him acquitted Soon after, he realized that the man was guilty of extortion and protection from his victims, including other shopkeepers in the neighborhood. He was advised by DA (Sullivan) that Rudi was a small change. A little that is to get rid of crimes that happen in the organization. Mason is found to be the best person and faced with embarrassment. <br /> <br /> "The Unknown Man" is a small, black and white movie that can attract the attention of the audience by plugging. There are a lot of things to be planned. Is the story of a good person who seeks God, justice and what he is willing to do to achieve And that is the most planned part of all I think there is a time before O.J. Menendez brothers, etc. etc. When people believe in justice and honesty of lawyers. For this audience, those days are a long time. <br /> <br /> Walter Pidson works so well - his handsome and graceful gesture that is handsome and the sound that has deteriorated shows us to see people. Successful, Pidgeon has a great career, which consists of 60 years, but never rose to become a real star. He is a strong actor who can play anything. Probably because when he was leading, he entered the age of thirty and missed being an idol. Or it may be because he lacks something; Or that he was printed as early as the second, leading to a big female star such as Greer Garson, hard to say. He gave an honest and impressive performance here. <br /> <br /> Good movie A lot with good performances
