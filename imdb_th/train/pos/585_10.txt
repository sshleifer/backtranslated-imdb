When I watched this movie again, it was better than I did this time than the previous time I watched. The performance was great. The characters are very clear. Brad Pitt was great as a lost son who rebelled. The actors and other actors have all the equality. Robert Redford created a wonderful time from the 1920s era. The scenery is unbelievably beautiful in the mountains and streams of Western Montana All of this is one of the best movies created in 1990. <br /> <br /> You have to watch this movie! <br /> <br />
