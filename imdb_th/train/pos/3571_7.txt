I used to watch this movie twice with a teenager who loved it. This one should be a cult like! The best line "Your outfit is super cool!" The Prince said to Cinderella. Kathleen Turner shines like a stepmother. I like cars and motorcycles in the 1950s. The sad prince is the departure of a typical killer. He tried to calm down. But cannot hide the love for the fairy tale princess Her sandals are not glass (truer to the original story), but Cinderella lost. But still brought it back from the heir to the throne My only complaint is that it doesn't show up and seems almost impossible. Hopefully Blockbuster or Amazon will start releasing this product shortly.
