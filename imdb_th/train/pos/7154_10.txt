I found out about the movie "Holes". From hearing from the general public that it was not unusual for Disney, both children and adults came into the story. People let me tell you that I'm not disappointed. "Holes" is based on Louis Sachar's novel and follows the adventures of Stanley Yelnats, a boy who was sent to a strange youth camp in the desert. And they shared an adventure that changed their lives It is an interesting, exotic, different and funny story. I don't know what will happen when I watch it. It's interesting to see the story come together like a piece of the puzzle. The boys, the young players who do wrong, everyone is funny and Jon Voight is funny, hilarious like Sir. Now I watch movies. I have to read books. The most recommended!
