Atlantis: The Lost Empire has some of the best soft animation and cleverly written dialogue of any Disney movie, and I'm confident in the first 15 minutes I love the voice of Don Novello, especially with Vincenzo Santorini And Phil Morris while Joshua Strongbear Sweet. Unfortunately, this movie seems to be twice as appropriate - at least in the first scene. One of the most important aspects of Disney movies is the satisfying antagonism - which Atlantis does not provide. He's the best on average. Halfway through the movie That's all It's a great movie. Everyone should check it.
