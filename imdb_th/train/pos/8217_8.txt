With this movie, it's the only Dirty Harry movie that Clint Eastwood not only performed but created and directed as well. You know it's going to be good. Although some people say that The Enforcer is the best in the series. But I completely disagree In my opinion, apart from the original Dirty Harry, Sudden Impact and Magnum Force are two things that should be worth in the series. Although The Enforcer is a movie with two great action scenes. But it was not as dirty and violent as the other three movies do This film captures all the excitement that makes Clint Eastwood's movie look good and there are words that make Dirty Harry the best movie in Diry Harry. "What to do? Punk?"; In the Magnum Force "A man must know his limitations"; And in this is "Go ahead, do my day". In addition, in this film, it's a good thing to see the change of scenery as you get tired of seeing the old streets of San Francisco in Other movies in the series With the great performances of Clint Eastwood and Sandra Locke, who co-starred and directed by Clint, this is my idea of ​​the best Dirty Harry sequel ever.
