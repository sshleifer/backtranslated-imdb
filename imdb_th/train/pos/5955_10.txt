As the creator of "This Darkness" I agree that we neglect 3 very important responses on our end credits. Ignoring is something beyond expectation that cannot be resolved at one time and is not related to the party --- who sees the movie --- talking about it at that time On behalf of the great actors and the team of this film, I apologize to them. Obviously some criticisms posted here are violent in terms of their credit being intended. Our production value is small and Our "special effects" are quite special. But the plot is very strong and the movie by John McLeod is great. We hope your readers will enjoy. "This darkness" and the efforts of those who respond to independence. Thank you. Director Dylan O'Leary
