I just saw this movie in my international business class. I didn't expect anything. Then it was a boring documentary. (Not saying that I do not love the documentary. I am extremely unlucky with the film in that class.) Imagine my surprise when this movie is a real movie. <br /> <br /> This film tells the difference. All cultural differences in the workplace and the way they have to work together to get anywhere The clash of cultures shows how the world is different and how we understand ourselves until someone comes in and makes us wake up. I would like to recommend this movie to anyone in the business or who wants to laugh because it is a joke. <br /> <br /> Okay, that's all about it! cheer
