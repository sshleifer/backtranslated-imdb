Insomnia's nightmare is an incredibly interesting movie created. I like that it will make you fall into the subconscious mind of the main character without confusing the audience ... The performance is excellent - to speak directly. I'll watch Dominic Monaghan read the phone book - but every People, especially young girls, are also great. I am very impressed with the look of the movie as well. Usually, "independent movies" look grainy. I watched myself. But this director knew what she was doing, light, film, ... quality work I am looking forward to a long qualifying job from Tess Nanavati!
