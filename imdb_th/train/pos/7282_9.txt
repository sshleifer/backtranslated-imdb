This is a very good and unjust movie to judge, regardless of the time it was released. There are some movies that are not older. But it's too old However, I saw this movie when I was a child and for over twenty years, the whole picture was an unforgettable story for me and most of my friends until we again admired it on the DVD. In fact, I remember this movie as a topic of chat and a meeting where the old man talked about what we had together. So there was a slight disappointment and sad when we finally had a DVD. First, there is a theory about the innocence of our generation. Secondly, I think there is more to this. I want to know that this film has something interesting for modern filmmakers, especially those who focus on the rotting horror genre. This is a cut of the image that is linked to the movie. The truth of the destruction of man causes horror movies deeper than death and torture. I remember what the sensation was when the monster tore off Kurt's arms. And at the end; When the creature bites the doctor's neck to remove parts of his blood vessels Another amazing thing is the scary atmosphere, which is not violent in every scene, whether it is acting in a secret room, a lonely street where a man in the car is looking for a female body, a distinctive dressing room and so on. Making the movie no longer good is just a technical matter. For example, at the scene and this man helped his fiancee work more accurately, making the second and modern director interesting. The same thing with all the action scenes, including Kurt's arm. Also, there are some things that can be done with the makeup of some monster remakes. Well, I think in this case the effort will be worth while. However, black and white should be conserved.
