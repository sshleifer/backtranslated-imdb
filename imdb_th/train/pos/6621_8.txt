I just came back from watching the presentation of this great sci-fi movie. Its style is very different and different. It was filmed by real actors. But changed to a black and white cartoon style that you have never seen before It went one step further than Sin City and did well. It is a successful combination of French cartoons and movies. Stories and emotions remind you of Blade Runner and if you like it you will like it too. The story is intelligent, never bored and has a slight twist. This movie is a movie that should not be missed for any cinephile movie, except maybe those who do not like sci-fi movies.
