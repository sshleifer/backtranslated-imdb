This is the ultimate - great performance, clothing set, music - but the most important is the whole story. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that there are no more reviews of this movie - of course that is one of the good things. At the end of 1980 <br /> <br /> It was a great movie that was seen alongside the great "Harvest Random" which had a very similar launch crisis. <br /> <br /> - WWI Middle people who do not know English The officer is in the hospital near the war, suffering from gunshot wounds and amnesia, without knowing the name, origin, or wherever he owns - he proves that he is a very rich man - when he "revives" he will Do not remember the years before the war - <br /> <br /> But the similarities of the movie ended. <br /> <br /> My warmest thank you for everyone who participated in the movie - especially N Actor Ian Holm, Alan Bates, Ann Margret (A wonderful and surprising choice), Glenda Jackson, Julie Christie <br /> <br /> This is with you forever.
