Kalifornia is a movie about the lost ideals. Traveling on the darkest road ever Road that doesn't return The story is about a couple who finds a better life in California. This man (David Duchovny in his best role until now) wants to write a book about famous crimes that have occurred in America and his women - which As a photographer - going to take pictures So they set out to follow the famous murder, not knowing what was waiting. In sharing travel expenses, they decided to find another partner and put the ad. But the pair that answered it was not just any pair. It was one of the strangest pairs ever. The woman is a delicate innocent animal that dreams and loves cactus. That man is the opposite. Cruel Manhunter We learned that at the beginning of the film and we followed him throughout the journey to Kalifornia (not with C as usual, but with K, which is the symbol of the murderer) during the journey of murder. All the leading actors Duchovny, Pitt, Lewis and Forbes give a really good performance and you have to take into account that when this film is filmed, not even one of them is a star. The photography is amazing with the darkness that covers the greatest parts of the film and the music is suitable for the dark characters of this film. Overall, this is a really good movie. Don't miss. You will think again before taking a stranger into the car to share the gas too!
