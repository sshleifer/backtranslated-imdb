There are no movies with Dennis Hopper, Gary Busey, erika eleniak, Tom Berber, Dean Stockwell, marilu henner deserving a score below 5 here. This is a male movie of the generation. The poor, such as 16 blocks or timeless midnight runs, except for the prisoners sent here, is very easy for Ms.Eleniak Tom Berenger to play as a maverick soldier and William Mcnamara plays as a beginner That must be removed from work The plot is ridiculous because I lost the amount of time Eleniak should have and able to escape. But this is a movie that gives fun and has a great pendant from all the top performers that make the film rolling. This is not a real family movie, because there is a swearing and a rare nude scene with eleniak, but it's better than any other guff that came out in this period.
