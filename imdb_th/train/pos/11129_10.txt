I do not think so But my friend told me the first thing he thought when he heard the name "Midnight Cowboy" was gay porn. At that point, all I knew was the reference made in the episode "Seinfeld" and Jerry tried to take Craig. Mercury goes to Florida on the bus and Kramer, everyone is sick and bloody. <br /> <br /> This film is fantastic and has a surprising rhythm and not everyone who sees the world in Pessimistic, like some movies that I don't remember Because they /> <br /> featuring all the crap basically consists <br cowboy Joe Buck is innocent. Arrived in New York, trying to be a businessman (Being a male prostitute) thinking that it is easy to just hit the brick wall very hard when a woman becomes a him that hastily charges him for a sexual encounter. <br /> <br /> Then he met Enrico Salvatore Rizzo is called "Ratso" by everyone and cute gay guys that make him fun all the time. You think he's a scam. But a cute person (Such as Han Solo or Lando Calrisian) and he and Joe become surprisingly friends and the movie is so cute and warm when they look friendly. Rizzo reveals himself as a person. Sad and distressing, which is seriously ill and depressed and very nervous, hates being called "Ratso" and wants to go to Florida where he thinks life will improve and solve all And he will learn to cook and be famous there. <br /> <br /> It's a delight to see Joe doing everything he can to take them both to Florida with the moment. A lot of fun time (like Ratso tried to steal food at that hippie party and was arrested by a woman who said "Gee, you know for free, you don't have to steal it" and he says "If it is free then I will not steal 'it" and the classic period is not defined and does not determine the time when Hoffman almost got that taxi and shouted, "Hey, I'm walking here! I walked here! ") And the show is convincing Never believed that Joe Buck would grow up to be a famous and respected actor. Jon Voight and Ratso Rizzo grew up to be a legend and loved by Dustin Hoffman, not the first time. They have worked together in a leading role. But the chemistry is thick and intense. <br /> <br /> Then there is the sad part that I believe is an exaggeration called "depressing." Ratso Rizzo is breaking down throughout the movie, hardly able to walk. Coughing and seriously ill until one point on the bus on the way to Florida He attacked violently and was only a few miles from Miami. He eventually died on the bus. The bus driver reassures everyone that there is nothing wrong and still continues. Sad but not in a way that will make you go home and cry and miserably go around as if you just lost a dog. Up to 13 years <br /> <br /> All great movies And the soundtrack consists of "Everybody's Talking" "that plays throughout the story at the right time Strange movement, but it's a great song because the song is good and fits perfectly with the tone of the movie. Go to see it. It's great. Buy now.
