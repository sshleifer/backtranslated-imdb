Many people hate this movie. But I blame the two truths - 1 - they want it too much like the first pair of American Pie movies and 2 - they try to be too serious. <br /> <br /> This thing that I find best From all six and I love Dwight for sure The plot can be predicted. I'll tell you that. But which teen comedian is not able to? Traveling on the road, dirty actions, etc. etc. They are all incredibly predictable. But still funny! I said it's worth watching. I love it. I found it hilarious. Don't just look at it while comparing it to the first movie because it's nothing like it. <br /> <br /> After watching the Naked Mile and the movie, it became clear that every American Pie movie was about FINE. Which is right for me. <br /> <br /> Look fun. Love. XD
