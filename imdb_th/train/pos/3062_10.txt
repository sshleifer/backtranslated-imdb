I saw this movie a few months ago on the cable and it's wonderful. William H Macy is one of my favorite actors and his performance is great. He made you care for his character, even though he did something clearly wrong and Neve Campbell gave the performance without a doubt the best performance I've seen this year. She is a wonderful girl who is clever than her age. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland is a creepy person like Macy's father. <br /> <br /> I hope this thing will be in the cinema because I feel that it is a movie that the audience should watch more. Unfortunately because it is a better hell than most new movies come into the theater now. <br /> <br />
