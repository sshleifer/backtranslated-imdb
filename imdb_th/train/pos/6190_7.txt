Fay Grim is a continuation of the story that started ten years ago with Hartley's Henry Fool. I have never seen a movie before and I don't know if that is good or not. I can consider the current movie from my own advantage. <br /> <br /> For most people, Hal Hartley's movie style is something you like or don't like. The combination of action, drama, nonsense and humor that amused and echoed me truly and Faye Grim was no exception. It has an air of intelligent parody written sharply, which has myself and many others in the Melbourne International Film Festival audience laughing loudly in the first half of the film. It doesn't stop and deliver like Straightforward It's a sad style of humor that doesn't exist in cinemas and a warm welcome to the teen comedians that Hollywood emerges like pancakes. <br /> <br /> In the second half of the movie Is a thriller / international conspiracy Whether Hartley's intentions or whether he has an ambiguous idea But I think that editing or rewriting to cut out for fifteen minutes, this movie will maintain the original motivation of the movie The performances are generally very good, especially Parker Posey and Jeff Goldblum, who have the most selection time. Saffron Burrows, James Urbaniak, Carl Montgomery and Elina LÃ¶wensohn all have good supporting roles. The picture of this movie is very good. (Located in New York, Paris, Berlin and Istanbul) and the song (by Hartley) did well without being intrusive This film is well written and I like it very much. If you like Hartley's previous work, you might like this.
