There is no doubt that the best of John Le Carre's novels became elaborate classic movies, performed by Peter Egan (Magnus Pim, Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, intelligence officer, Czech Magnus), Ray McAnally (Magnus's father) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, mentor 'Magnus' believers and British controllers), along with other characters And natural. Those who are responsible for selecting them should receive reward Even small parts such as Major Membury can show perfectly. It says a lot for the power of acting and the strength of the characters in Magnus's repetitive novel. We can't help but feel closer to Magnus and Axel than Jack Brotherhood and Grant Lederer of US intelligence. I read At least a dozen books and watching movies almost many times and both are still enjoying. If I have a book that will go on a deserted island, A Perfect Spy will be the choice over all other books.
