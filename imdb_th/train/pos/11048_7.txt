I do not feel that this movie is quite clever as it seems to think. However, enjoy it. However, <br /> <br /> It is original, although it reminds me of two other French films, namely Vidocq and City of Lost Children, mostly used for coloring. But for the close quality of the characters in the near term.>> <br /> Set in the cell But don't let this make you look like this movie will go beyond the many blockbuster positions. <br /> <br /> Always interesting, with the 'Black Arts' that is perennial, good character and very good. People believe just too! <br /> <br /> Scary with some blood. It's worth watching.
