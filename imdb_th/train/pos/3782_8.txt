When I was a kid, I loved both the Bill & Ted movie last night. The trip was a scam, and since it was at least 5 years since I saw it last time, I decided to adjust and I loved it more Again! This film is still funny after many years. 'Great adventure' is better, but this one is the same stone. Of course, some perfumes look a bit magical. But wait, this movie looks interesting. Moreover, it also has the greatest identity of Death in the movie! Summary: All like fake movie friends! How wonderful! Station!!!
