Will Smith once again delivered in a film about the worldly weighted man on his shoulder and his crusade to correct his fault in a way that would touch even the hardest heart !!! Italian director Gabriele Muccino gathered and created a masterpiece that I recommend buying and storing in your movie collection because you will not be bored with watching / feeling movies. This !!! I have the utmost respect for Will Smith as he not only But is an excellent actor only But still able to tell that he has a true love for people and lives, which without a doubt makes him perfect for the character (IRS Agent Ben Thomas). You will find yourself feeling the pain and anger of He was disappointed with the love he had for Emily, played by Rosario Dawson, which was a wonderful story. I found myself falling in love with the fact that their characters fell in love. Woody Harrelson also starred in the Top Notch film. I find it very difficult to write this review without leaving important planning issues. ... all I can say is look and when you are sure that you have nothing to interrupt, you take the phone off the hook, sit down and pick up Ready to start trying to solve the mystery and past life of IRS Agent Ben Thomas ... I would like to thank Will Smith for another great movie !!!
