I just read the latest observations about this movie and I want to respond. You may not be familiar with the original story of the rap group. Which dates back to the beginning of 1988 in 1989. The ice cubes left the band alone and eventually in 1991, the band broke down when Dr.dre released, which led to a large amount of meat beginning with the departure of the cube Ice and dr.dre in 1991. This story is quite dependent on whether <br /> <br /> more. They explained that the fruit juice song, the form of a political order, is hilarious. Not to mention the delicious "love song" is asking. And when Vanilla Sherbert was kicked, as if the record company executive was hilarious and had a manager who was shot every time. <br /> <br /> People who don't like this movie may not. have Pick up or be an idiot who complete my thoughts.
