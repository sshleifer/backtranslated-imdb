The hilarious line is typical of what Naughty Sisters say. (It's funny according to my own condition and unintentionally funny) Two sisters, only really bad. They are not good boys too! One pinup has been poses and an evil comment she has been to. The other person rose to look like Marilyn Monroe. She has lips that are seductive and slightly separated. And in order not to let anything go, she is even worse. <br /> <br /> The three starlets are played by male starlets stumbling into their lives, played by John Bromfield. He has some career. <br /> <br /> Today seems to have the first softcore porn. Of course, not the first time. But it's the strongest race at that time. <br /> <br /> The girls wear as little as possible and don't forget about female audience members: what is this fetish? - He's unfaithful. He also shows that he is wet in a swimsuit. <br /> <br /> There is a real plot here: the family of the girls. They tend to kill themselves - or death that can make them look like suicides. <br /> <br /> The movie is not bad. I don't really know where it appears. Maybe it was made for the drive-ins in some way and I might be wrong. I feel that the male audience is generally not the main goal here. Women dress up low They usually look at covering lags of mags such as police, detective or jacket of little fiction. <br /> <br /> But the guy looks like a center. Not everyone in the movie likes him. But every woman loves him And I think the audience has a purpose too. <br /> <br /> It's fun - and in my own sense as well.
