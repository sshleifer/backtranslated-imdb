Like The Jeffersons, Goodtime is one of the classic American sitcoms that has never aired in the UK and has not spoken about it in the 1970s - the decade that I have not been born. <br /> <br /> But like the fans of the program, I watched a few episodes on You Tube - and after that I loved it. <br /> <br /> The Evans family, led by James and Florida - both parents tried to make end See you and those who lack the motivation of their children who are inspired in life to fulfill them and use their opportunities. James is a strict father. But full of love that did not dare hesitate to practice discipline, JJ Michael and Thelma - if they crossed the line While Florida, on the other hand, is a kind-hearted, kind-hearted and loving wife, although she has many ways similar to James about their attitudes towards parenthood and family values ​​from <br /> <br /> <br /> Children are lively and fun like their parents: JJ is an artist with a crazy personality and humor that often wears many colors and 'DY -NO-MITE 'Infectious Poem And familiar as Arnold Jackson's 'Whatchoo talking' 'Willis Competition?' From Diff'rent Strokes. Michael is a clever man who dreams of being a lawyer while his sister Thelma. Have their own dreams and hopes Most of her jokes and JJ are funny, as well as the relationship / hatred between brothers and sisters, which play very well by both Mike Evans and Bernadette Stanis. <br /> <br /> Throughout the season There are very few hijack appearances, especially from Janet Jackson, Debbie Allen and Gary Coleman. Be yourself! I like the better times in The Cosby Show, which is a show in the 80s because a) I like the Evans family more than Huxtables, both in terms of style) and b) because I feel that it handles serious social problems and difficult In a manner that resonates with a large audience It was a joke But it is a social opinion that focuses on the life of the American working class in Africa. In the 1970s, the Cosby performance tried to respond to the main audience in a 'candy-coated' style, while the Huxtables were described as black people. That easily integrates itself with the high culture of the United States. We will connect with white people while the time is better than 'edgier' and are not afraid to talk about issues such as drug use. As a child abuse in a way that is true, I found that in reality, while The Cosby Show was fun to watch at all times, there was no 'sassiness' that Good Times had and made it look cool and cool. /> <br /> The item jumped up Shark later in the season after the character of John Amos James died in a strange accident. (In fact, it was known that John had resigned from a good time, so the death of the character in the show) without John. The show had to suffer and alas, it was. Lost a lot of charm. <br /> <br /> But for the sitcom, Good Times marked all the correct boxes. If they show this in the UK in the 1980s, of course, JJ will put the word 'DY-NO-MITE !!' <br /> <br /> My score: 8 and a half.
