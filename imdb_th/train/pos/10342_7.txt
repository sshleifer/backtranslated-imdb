Melvyn Douglas once again gave a beautiful performance, this time he relied on the role of a detective who was unable to lay down the previous love and adventure and Joan Blondell, who was warmly beautiful. (Who is far from illiteracy Writing a novel about her childhood life) is as fun as he once loved his sweetheart. It is a joke about ball screws, almost as a Thin Man movie. It's almost a series. I think it doesn't make it. The sequel does not reach the classic status. But it has all the ingredients for 85 minutes of fun with the script, but it's the rhythm, the actor, the good character, and the direction that makes it move fast enough until you almost don't notice that Williams (Douglas) is not Columbo. To detection I hope to have more movies like this.
