Herbet Clutter, his wife, Bonnie and their teenagers, Kenyon and Nancy liked and respected in the small towns of Holcomb, Kansas - but at the beginning of November 14, 1959, all four were brutally murdered. Quite unexpected, the crime impressed the author Truman Capel, who rushed to the scene and followed the guidelines of the case to conclude The result is the book IN COLD BLOOD. It has become an international bestseller and is still a standard for crime writers to this day. <br /> <br /> Cap ote's film work in 1967 is almost outstanding. As well as this book itself, filmed in black and white in various places in real life. It has a quality documentary, a little ice and solo - and the actors are especially special. This is the movie that Robert Blake's reputation as an actor lay and deserves. As an assassin, Perry Smith Blake will intercept you during the deep dissatisfaction with unexpected sympathy. It is a work that specializes from beginning to end. As Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson does not matter. <br /> <br /> Like Capote's book, this film debuted with Smith and Hickock as they traveled to Kansas and brought them to the Clutter house. Only the crime in the investigation details that eventually resulted in their arrest and conviction The center of the film is the moment when we finally see what happens in the house of the real city and then shoot in their own home. spinechilling Scary and extremely annoying. <br /> <br /> Director and writer Richard Brooks brings this film with a powerful feeling. Allow the movie to become a little sermon. Considering the overall power of the movie, it becomes a little annoying. The strongest thing - and recommend <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon's critics
