My friend borrowed this DVD, which he received from the director at the festival. I think I warned that some technical aspects of the film shook a little bit and the writing was good but not good. Maybe that was my decision. But I have to admit that I like this movie Justin Lane is great as a roommate who makes Ernie mad. The character Bill (Justin Lane), who spends most of the time in the movie, dressed like a panda. He looked the least in one dimension and reminded me of a very old college roommate. So I called this person after watching the DVD. Really cute and funny. Some other performances are good, but some are not good at all. I like the vigilante couple too. Nonsense and funny. <br /> <br /> I give this high rating even though it has some problems because you can tell when you see that these people care. Well done for Adam Jones and the team.
