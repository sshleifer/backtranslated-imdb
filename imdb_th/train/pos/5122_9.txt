# 3 in John Travolta's blockbuster trilogy He danced with disco, rock and rod. He headed to Houston to find work and Gilley's love was a hot spot and was the time of a mechanical cow. In order not to be a little, I rode a bull at a club in Nashville. I just saw this film almost forgot on television and remember how good it was and in the 1980s I was wearing a black cowboy hat that year like Travolta. Debra conservatives were in her prime. She looks beautiful in her red shirt. There are many special talents. Bud and Sissy look like an ideal couple, even if they are trash trailers. They separate just because they feel good to be back together. Urban Cowboy has an amazing soundtrack. We will hear Lyin 'Eyes by The Eagles and Lookin' For Love by Johnny Lee.
