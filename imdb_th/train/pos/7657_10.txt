This is a very brutal and cruel movie, even a cruel movie about the destruction of the death row. It is a black and white photo that prevents it from becoming obsolete. Mickey Rooney is great as a distorted lead actor. One of the first films showing the psychological sorrow of the death row. It is also quite painful.
