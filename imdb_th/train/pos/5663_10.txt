14 years since this show and still is the best show ever. Writing as 1st grade and production is second to none. This performance will not happen today and this is a shame. I hope that if you are thinking of finding this item to watch as you do, <br /> <br /> AG came out last year. I left high school when my favorite TV show was the x file that was provided. The idea of ​​why I entered this program for the first time AG is a better program with better writing. But there is only one reason? I know that this is not the only program that can only get one season, and another example that can be thought of as a single gunman (file x is separated). It has good and funny writing. But still only one season Seems to be wrong! <br /> <br /> We have to remember that this program has come before the program, such as Twilight, making the show dark 'cool', so I think this may cause the show to be down. <br /> <br /> See this program And enjoy it! 10 out of 10 for me
