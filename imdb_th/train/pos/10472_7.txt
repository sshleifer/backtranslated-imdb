Everyone who loves Rheostatics' music will enjoy this movie. I have a small amount of complaints about walking and selecting some actors (not Mori) that are unbelievable in their roles. But I don't have the time to write a detailed review I just want to remind everyone who have seen this movie or plan to watch this movie as presented by CBC Television in Canada: the CBC broadcast version is the same as the Reader's Digest version of WHALE MUSIC --- don't watch it cut scenes And all sub-schemes (If you can) from the CBC movie, which offers the most movies that are untouched, half the courage from WHALE MUSIC. I don't know why. It's scary that they make movies. Rent a video or watch in a movie theater But do not have to watch on television CBC
