I just came back from the Montreal premiere of Zero Day ... and I was astonished as hell with the negative comments in the movie. In general, the offense about Coccio made social messages easy and overplayed ... well, Mr Mr-I - criticism - it is easy and overplayed. Movie reviews with social costs <br /> <br /> No I want to reveal my life here. But I came from a small town that has more similar schools than them. Deny & don't know in the menu. The thing is ... I understand how young children can drive to do horrible things. High school has become a battlefield of consistency. It's a really ugly image. You have to fight the way you are. It is difficult to explain so many people are unaware that high school is becoming a human cemetery. At the same time, parents are closing their eyes and smiling about their lives in their comfortable suburbs. <br /> <br /> The true inspiration of this film is not about what is pushed. Push them It's about a quiet suburb like death and everyone closes their eyes and tries to create the atmosphere of this perfect city. Cal shows well It is a wake-up call. The drama is everywhere and can have all shapes. In that case, a small drama (like Andre was called a fagot for wearing JC Penny shirts) was forming as a terrible nightmare for the entire city. Andre & Cal used the most intense way to show their pain. he The unrest in the era that you want more than acceptable. <br /> <br /> I like the last scene that some men are burning Andre & Cal's cross, like the pain they communicate. Cal & Andre Communicating the blind anger towards their community, refusing to think about the cause of certain actions. <br /> <br /> It may seem aggressive as a movie, but Coccio is meditating more than moaning or moaning Cor The thing that Andre & Cal is living is the reality ... and the horrible things that may cause other children <br /> <br /> movies that are disturbing ... building houses and feeling strong. Causing Ben Coccio to make a very annoying movie
