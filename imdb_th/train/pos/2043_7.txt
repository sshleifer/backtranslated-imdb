I just saw this movie last night at the Toronto Film Festival, which is played in Midnight Madness to tell you the truth. The only reason I went to watch this movie is because it uses its name together with Radiohead music, and because my friends bought tickets, so I had no real choice: - I expect it to be like Silence of the Lambs, but it turns out to be a semi-gore. Some people have said that there is no satisfactory character and that is absolutely correct. I don't care if the character of Potente pulls out her internal organs by Creep. I am deeply rooted for the homeless to make it alive with Potente's character. She only has sweets. Christopher Smith Making a great contribution, of course, with images in the movie's perspective. However, the story is quite weak. But then again, the whole point of this film is to put the crap out of you and it can be done efficiently. The score by the Bristol band called insects is important. More than anything else, I am afraid of shit coming out of me. <br /> <br /> The director is really good and fun during the quiz. I sincerely hope that he will make a better movie in the future. <br /> <br /> This film is for fans of the genre, but I recommend that fans who are not people to try. It's a fun ride.
