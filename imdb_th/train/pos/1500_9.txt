That is a stingy thing. <br /> <br /> Most old movies like this are unique masterpieces in their own way. Just because back when these movies were thought and done, that is when fresh ideas Now people are stressed just thinking about new ideas. <br /> <br /> Continue to the movie. For the big fan of classic horror movies This is for you. The film has detectives from Scotland Yard inspecting the actors' disappearances and stumbling across three strange events that happened to former residents in the same house. Will not speak anymore because I will destroy more movies than I already have But it is a great movie for the age as it is And will not mind to watch it again!
