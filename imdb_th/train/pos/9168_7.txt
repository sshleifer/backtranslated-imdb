This is Jane Eyre's great adaptation. The only problem I have is that I don't like Zelah Clarke. I think she's too old and makes Jane seem shy. In the book, Jane looks like a much stronger character. I was really frustrated by her description. The part that was in the morning after Rochester asked her to marry him, then she ran to him. I think they have a good selection for her selection. But Dalton is great, like Rochester. He makes this version of Jane Eyre look good. Another thing that makes this model not quite 100% is the quality of the movie. I know it's built in eighty for the TV. If it is a documentary film and better quality, it will be perfect. My main complaint is that Zelah Clarke is too old.
