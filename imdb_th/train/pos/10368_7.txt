Meryl Streep is great in this movie. She has a special ability to focus on sounds and she shows great skills in this film as a whole. I really felt her when Lindy was bullied. She played as well as she was cranky, upset, and unpleasant while the media and the government continued to use the disobedient witch. At first I didn't expect much from the movie. But I am very interested in it and this movie is based on real people and real events It turned out to be better than I expected. Sam O'Neill is also outstanding. This is the best work I've ever seen from him and I like him a lot in other movies. (For example, The Piano) I gave this movie 7, but if I can only rate the show, I'll give 9.5 and 10 perfect for the stream.
