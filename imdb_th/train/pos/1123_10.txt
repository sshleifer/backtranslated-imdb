But I still gave 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Four college girls (Baltron, Kelly, Stahl and Cadby) are driving to Florida on their way. They meet 2 people (Turner They didn't add anything to the plot. But at least quite satisfactory The girls agreed to meet men in Florida for fun. But they have problems with cars and never do One girl decided to go to a nearby gas station for help. The other three were on the car. <br /> <br /> Soon, a girl had to use the bathroom in the middle of nowhere that she had. There is no choice but to go into the bush. Soon she found that a man (March) strangled a woman with fear that the woman had fled from the area. But when lost, <br /> <br /> Her friends looked at the car for her. They entered the forest and ran into the same man. One of them saw a woman who had died. The man responded by shooting the girl. The other woman's head ran out to deal with the car that she was killed with. <br /> <br /> Finally, the remaining girls met and because they broke into the gas station, they were arrested. This is when I became angry with these poor women, afraid of their lives, and the police were unruly. They didn't believe them. <br /> <br /> They were treated badly and one of them was left to the people. Single for the madman to kill The rest of her friends in the cell got away. But without being in a dangerous situation Some women may find it a nasty and sensitive person who doesn't like the ending. But overall, this is a movie that little is known.
