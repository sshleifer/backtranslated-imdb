Freebird is the perfect marriage of Road Trip movies, comedy, caper, "Stoner" movies and British films that give good feelings. <br /> <br /> It's a great lead character that makes the film. This is different from other movies of this type. Phil Daniels, Gary Stretch and Geoff Bell stars have excellent chemistry and make their characters a favorite and realistic. The main story focuses on traveling from London to Wales and the adventures and accidents that take place on the way. This small movie still has a great heart - it's not only for bike fans, because it connects the character's relationship with each other, including dreams and regrets, such as Gary Stretch's Fred who longs for the family he left. hold This film is also excellent - a love letter to the countryside of Wales, including capturing the fragility of London streets and the typical pub life in the rural town of Wales. <br /> <br /> Smooth, stylish soundtrack Slick, cute character Funny story - I would recommend Freebird with heartbeat!
