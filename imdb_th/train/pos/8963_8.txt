The popular movie of John Van Druten Broadway was brought up on the screen with the highest star power in this romantic fantasy about a new age witch who seduced Manhattan's successful publisher James Stewart may have been The highest charge, but Kim Novak, who stole the performance, is one of the most charming witches ever spelled in the movie screen. In fact, pairing is one of the few weaknesses of this movie: Stewart's gray hair seems to be old, and while it's easy to see why he fell in love with Novak, it's hard to understand that Who are you Found that there was a charm about him because they did not match the mood and perspective (It was one of the humorous stories that witches and witches were portrayed by Greenwich Village Beatnik and Bohemian). Curiously, Stewart-Novak's match would cause a lot of heat. In this movie, then "dizzy" has an interesting and useful story of the direction of Alfred Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> Most of the time the cartoon of this film comes from a supporting role. The protagonist includes Jack. Wind Diamond, Elsa Lanchester (their aunt playful) and Ernie Kovacs (!) As the author of confusion. Hermione Gong Gold appeared in a hilarious cameo as a grand witch. There are many things I like in this movie - with wit, romance, and a great actor - that is, if you can take your eyes off the fascinating Miss Novak, I've watched half a dozen movies and I can't do it.
