The horrifying and bloody adaptations of Stephen King's great novel has a central performance featured by Dale Midkiff, Fred Gwynne (who died a few years ago) and Denise Crosby and A. True scary blood effects And manage this to be one of the few versions of King that not only should look But very shocking, the image of a child Gage Gage (Miko Hughes - later in "New Nightmare") is equally noteworthy Is a laughing character that makes it dangerous and scary for people who think this is not terrible - see it alone in the dark (Finally with your nauseated girlfriend) and I guarantee you that "Pet Sematary" will creep you out. Some horror films like this or "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" should not be viewed as a recommended group for horror fans. !
