I have a two year old son who suffers from the same conditions as Jonny Kennedy. I never had the opportunity to meet him. But I never heard anyone say bad words about him I hope he knows how much this transaction helped his victims by raising awareness of this terrible condition. This man has touched people in the way that millions of charity brochures can't do. I believe this should be a compulsory look at the school. I agree with other opinions - what do I have to lament about? He uses everything that life can throw at him and still tries to keep humor. God bless. I can't see the part that shows that his dress has changed. I have enough problems with my son.
