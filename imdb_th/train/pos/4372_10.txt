Rob Roy is a great man with passion and action! Liam Neeson gave a towering performance as Rob Roy McGregor, one of the best of his career. Jessica Lang was the perfect character as his wife, Mary. The most passionate and chemically I've ever seen in a movie screen. The most vile performer, Tim Roth, plays one of the great screen villains. Mary's rape is disgusting and harrowing. He is a great bastard in this film. The final between Rob and Cunningham scored ans script and the direction of Michael Caton-Jones was perfect. 10 out of 10
