Wow, I love this movie. There may be no funds and advertising that the latest Hollywood frauds have received. But it is twice as tight The story revolves around a family from Utah and is a link between the people in the family who gave punch to the movie. Main lead actor (Giovanni Ricci) shows his role very well in a short time. He will let you believe that he shows all his feelings. It was his brother (Elias Koteas) who stole me. When the two are in the scene together, they limit the boundaries of each other, making the performance great. Excellent movie actor
