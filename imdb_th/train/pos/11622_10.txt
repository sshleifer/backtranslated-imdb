Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams starring the action / thriller written and directed by Wes Craven, the head of suspicion. All movies started with some problems at The Lux Atlantic, a hotel in Miami. The problem was solved by Lisa Reisert, the manager of the hotel. Then she went to the airport and that was the beginning of all the problems. She met Jackson Rippner who didn't like being called Jack because of the Jack the Ripper's name. If you know you and I mean Then they boarded the plane and were crazy enough. Rippner and Reisert sat next to each other. Half an hour later, Lisa was threatened, tortured and frightened by Rippner. I wouldn't leave anything at all. Then we went to the place where Jack chased Lisa in the airport. Then Lisa went to her house to see if her father was okay and crazy. Rippner was there. There was almost twelve minutes of violence and violent violence throughout that scene. Overall, the action that is concentrated for about 25 minutes comes to an end. <br /> <br /> Not only movies are concentrated. As I said, I will not give anything because it is shocking and exciting and quite annoying / frightening and acting from all the characters in the movie, even those who don't have a complete line. It's incredible Everything is great in this movie! Music performance, makeup effects, director, editing, writing, everything is great! Wes Went is a teacher of suspense. Red Eye is something that should not be missed and should be worth spending. You can watch this movie over and over again and it won't make you bored. <br /> <br /> The red eyes I have to say are better than 10 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Original MPAA level: PG-13: Severe violence sequence and language <br /> <br /> My MPAA score: PG-13: Partial violent order and language <br /> <br /> My rating Canada: 14A: Violence, scary scenes, disturbing content
