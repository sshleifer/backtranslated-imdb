Thsi is a great movie. Maybe the best movie I've ever seen I watched it over and over again. I had to give 10/10 stars. Because as I said it would be the best movie I've ever seen This movie + Popcorn + Coke = The best ingredients you can imagine. If you want to watch a certain movie, then I recommend this clearly. The first time I saw it, I liked it, so I bought-ed it and now I own and watch it, maybe every day. My son likes it and thinks this is the best movie ever seen. This movie is about Guy In Fantasy World. I don't want to destroy all the movies so you can enjoy it after you read my message. Lovely movies, cute characters, cute stories and wonderful things. Must watch movies. Hope you enjoy my comments.
