The fascinating story of love, jealousy and vengeance can be more fun to see over the years after airing on PBS with sharper images and sharper sound. My only booking is the plot. There are times that shouldn't happen and the stronger Manchester accent is sometimes difficult. Fortunately, there is no vocabulary here and will not spoil the fun: the main performer is chosen superbly. Robson Green brings a mysterious smile, uninterrupted emotions and athletic strength to his role as a young surgeon Who fell in love with the wife of his master at the hospital where he had just started working. Francesca Annis was one of the most outstanding 50-ish women to imagine Her performance is a rival to her beauty. (The love scene between these two shows better than the words saying how much age differences are important to them!) The characters that support each of them are drawn up perfectly. A mix of important conversations and overwhelming passion makes this drama delightful. As Russell Baker notes in his introduction, you may not be morally developed by watching "negligence" - but you will have lots of fun. (The sequel, which is part of the DVD box set, offers a full fun But satisfied for two hours, you won't want to miss if you enjoy what has happened before)
