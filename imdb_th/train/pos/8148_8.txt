I have zero interesting rap and in the slum culture I am white and like classic rock. But that didn't stop me from admiring the great comedy. It was the sequel to This Is Spinal Tap, in the sense that it was the same movie, but it was hilarious with lots of jokes. But not just a few jokes that fall in love with the characters, all funny and reliable I watched just because it made me laugh at 3 and any movie that could do that, at least, had to have a screening test. One of the reasons that this movie is so funny is that it makes fun of rap from elsewhere. Rap today involves something wrong and received from the sound in the studio and a little talent. This movie comes from the time the rapper deserves more credit. Overall, it is a comedy that has a lot of jokes about culture, ethnicity, sex and music amid the clear humor. Highly recommended for fans of this spinal cord. They are the same movie, a different world, and yes, the same joke works in both films.
