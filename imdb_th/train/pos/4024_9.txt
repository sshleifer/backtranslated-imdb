I like this movie a lot. It made me guess until before the end of what would happen. One of the great movies about partitions I've seen Urmila Matondkar is also beautiful. This is one of the most personal movies and the real story I've seen in the block. It is less mainstream than Gadar and is an emotional roller coaster that you start with one opinion about what happened and came out completely on the other This is not a common value. But is an art house movie The best part of this movie is that it does not diminish humanity on one side of the conflict in the block when focusing on another story It is not a fault or castigate, but will allow you to summarize your own about things.
