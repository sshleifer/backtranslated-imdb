The key to happiness and beauty, the pain and sadness of life is our ability to accept that life is something that is so we do not fight with the tempting truth. In doing so, we find peace. Elegant in simplicity But difficult for most of us to understand. <br /> <br /> In this film, the director shows us this truth. This is a beautiful story. But simple, with more stories that play very well Watching actors is like being in a room with real people rather than just watching actors. <br /> <br /> I'm trying to struggle with how to write this great movie review. I'm losing Stories about men in the bathhouse Listening seems like a real closure, right? But nothing is far from the truth The American name for this film is The Shower, but almost the opposite of the important elements in this film, which is a bathtub. I still lose Talking about stories or characters won't make them fair. <br /> <br /> So I'll tell you how much I enjoy watching this movie. I was quite happy I pay attention to the character very much and I deeply care about what happened to them. For any matter, that is the highest praise form. <br /> <br /> If you are motivated by movies like The King Of Masks or Not One Less, make sure you see The Shower Netflix. There are DVD video quality and The sound is great. I watched the original lanquage with goodness and placed the English sub-category.
