When I saw it for the first time, I was really impressed. The director created a mysterious atmosphere, especially at the end. From the whole story, the audience can expect Richard to really kill Thomas or he will do it first. Life is great. Every time I watch, I enjoy it. Of course, it's quite as violent as every action movie. But I think it's acceptable. Thank you very much. Louis Liosa and Tom Berenger! Amazing movies! I advise everyone to see I'm sure people won't regret and will have a really good time.
