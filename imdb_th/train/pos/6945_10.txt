My favorite movie type is Western. It's the only movie that comes from Americans. And even though it was Sergio Leone, but no one acted like an American. <br /> <br /> At the top of my top ten favorites was Western Winchester 73. It was the first match and only a black and white movie of Affiliate director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart, it is a landmark movie that Stewart chose to use as a percentage of profit instead of a straight salary from Universal. As well as a moguls who hire them, Anthony Mann, the point is made mostly of B noir without a real budget. Before Winchester 73, Mann made a good Western match with Robert Taylor, the devil's goal, who had not received enough praise. I'm sure James Stewart had to see it and decided Mann was the man he decided. To be a partner <br /> <br /> In this movie, Mann developed a small company in the way John Ford was a legend. In addition to the other stewards in the drama, such as Millard Mitchell, Steve Brooke Dandy Danryah John McIntyre JC. Flippen and Rock Hudson will appear in future Mann movies. <br /> <br /> Finding a man named Dutch Henry Brown and killing him Why don't I speak? But until now, we never saw the wrath of James Stewart appearing on the screen. Anthony Mann reaches the spirit of Jimmy Stewart and draws some demons. We are all afraid of us. <br /> <br /> Hate is shown perfectly in the good times of the beginning. the movie After Stewart and his close friend Millard Mitchell were disarmed by Wyatt Ear, adapted by Willer because there was no carrying a gun into Earp's Dodge City. Spurs in Dodge City and favorite bets are Dutch Henry Brown, played by Stephen McNally that is dangerous. Stewart Mitchell and Gear go to the living room and Stewart and McNally meet at the same time and have access to weapons that aren't there. See Closeup of Stewart and McNally. They can speak more than 10 pages. <br /> <br /> Other characters that Stewart found in this movie are Waco Johnny Dean, played by Dan Duryea, who almost steals this movie. This is probably Duryea's best moment on the screen. He is an outlaw murderer who died like a left hand, even though he played two six-gun guns. <br /> <br /> Another one that Stewart found was Shel. Valley Winter, in which Duryea's fiancee is killed, her best scene is with Duryea, who imagines her. She played for a long time until she could safely escape from him. Guess who she will end up with? <br /> <br /> There are great performances in some small chapters. There are notes that are not sour in the drama. John McIntyre as a famous Indian merchant, JC. Flippen was the gray-headed army sergeant and Rock Hudson was truly first noticed as the young Indian leader. Even John Alexander, better known as 'Theodore Roosevelt' in Arsenic and the Old Lace, had a brief but impressive role as the post-trade owner that both McNally and Stewart stopped at the time. <br /> <br /> Mann and Stewart made eight films together, five of them from the west and ready to do western movies, the sixth story, Night Passage, when they quarreled and Mann walked out. From the scene The end of a beautiful partnership that produces quality movies.
