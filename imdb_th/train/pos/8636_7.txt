The thrilling movie, starring Brad Pitt and Juliet Lewis, who travels with David Dookni and Michelle Forbes, travels west. The couple is researching the famous murder scene for the next book. Pitt is a serial killer on the ship. (Didn't know Dave) and Juliet were his poor friends. This is a good actor and the story moves along. But Pitt is not terrifyingly scary as a serial killer, although it is one of his better previous roles. The best thing is here, Michelle Forbes, who often shine, whether in her role in "Murder: Road Life" or in the short series "Wonderland". > <br /> Vote: 6
