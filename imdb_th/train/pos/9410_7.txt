I enjoy this movie But I was surprised to see people talking about it as a joke. Sometimes it's funny. But actually it's not funny at all If I expect it to be a joke, I might be disappointed with the movie. But with expectations, I found it fun and engaging. Probably because as an engineer I identified with the protagonist. I have less concern about the words of capital or labor and is the basic story of a man who fought for his invention. A person who is not interested in the financial benefits of his invention is less than he sees when it comes to results and is produced. He was certainly brave when he refused to accept a large sum of money and a hot young woman returned to suppress his invention. So I think it's interesting that people here compare to Jurassic Park. I compare it with The Fountainhead.
