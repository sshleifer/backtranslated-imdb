I can not say that this film follows the novel closely, never reading the book. But since this watch lasts about six and a half hours, it's good that most bases are protected or at least we can speak. With confidence that this is not an abbreviated version of Reader's Digest. <br /> <br /> The production value is very high according to the standards of other BBC classic series, such as Inspector Morse and Sherlock Holmes. We believe Dickens' London looks at it. And think very much like this Some athletes shoot a pistol with a hat impacted in the year 1840 or 1820 or whenever that happens. <br /> <br /> The performance must also be appreciated. Suzanne Burden is a polite and honest heroine. She is also cute in her mature beauty in nature that her sympathy is not in flirting. Denholm Elliott is her protector. (And more as it appears) Burden and Elliott are two of the three great characters Another is the sergeant who was forced to do evil by the wicked. Another is a poor and useless boy. <br /> <br /> I don't think anyone can write this story. It has all the weapons of Dickens - poverty, tragic death, capitalism in the raw, rich-minded in his gated home, parents who conceal motivation in shadows and weakness. Not an overall justice system But it is a court which is clearly a court that judges matters relating to property distribution. (So ​​I compiled from Wikipedia.) It became a notorious and harsh story that was thoroughly revised in England in 1973. Elliott's character twice described it as "the curse", the most impressive scene involved. Creditors, creditors who chase retired soldiers in the back gym during fencing The sergeant is more masculine than the original character, more than any other character I remember from Dickens. The worthless lender and lessor is screaming for threats from his seat, and Sergeant turns to him and performs delicate exercises with the sword. After one more time, each progression brings him near the torment. <br /> <br /> Two things disappear. Often, ghosts are stuck in at least one or two lines of dialogue ("Humbug!" Or "Law is ass"). Not here. House "Bleak "Is the right name want Secondly, no "The ideal type" of Weberian - No Mr. Micawbers or Artful Dodgers or Scrooges. Thirdly, the whole atmosphere is relentlessly dismal. One of the hardships that followed again often involved the shameful money or peccadillo in the past. <br /> <br /> My God is depressed. As if the writer drained his spleen in everything he hated in the world he knew Poverty doesn't matter. He knows that poverty But one thing that suspects that the sins of Dickens is what it deserves this kind of treatment. <br /> <br /> Maybe I should add that I just watched the first episode of the 2005 series - and Better in two ways There are more zippered directions, so the pace will be a little faster and Jarndyce's business compared to Jarndyce has been satisfactorily explained from the beginning instead of being lurking in the shadows as if a "mysterious" curse.
