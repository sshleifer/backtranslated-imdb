I gave 10/10 to this film with hesitation because it was hard to praise something that haunted and scared me for many years. The harsh threat to women in the face of black is just a horror movie, and the accompanying music makes even more horror TV when I was 10 and it disturbed me for many years. I was intrigued by the fact that there are many other users who say this. Many movie reviews about disturbing or scaring movies But you can believe everyone who posted on this board is an incredibly powerful thing. I mean, I like horror movies and often find that they are quite funny than usual. But this is dangerous and likely to disturb most people I haven't seen it since I was 10 years old and I want to see it again. But feared that I might not sleep for many nights I can't tell what it is. But I think it is related to the fact that fear is the greatest weapon of women. It's amazing that the feelings of other audiences are very unanimous. <br /> <br /> I've seen the stage plays, which are great performances ... but nothing can compare.
