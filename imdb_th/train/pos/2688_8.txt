******* Spoiler! ******** <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie in gr8 a few years ago. It's a lovely story about a young man who wants to drink breast milk at the breast. But she thought he had to be old. He became a brave man after another woman's breasts and ended up competing with his dreamy brother. Throw the envious husband of this woman who can't "stir up" and you have a warm story. But warm about love, friendship and a cute pair of pitchers. Hee <br /> <br /> It's wonderful
