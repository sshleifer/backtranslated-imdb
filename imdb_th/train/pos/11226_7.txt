Star Trek Hidden Frontier will surprise you in many ways. First, it's a fan-made series that is only available on the web and it has friends and neighbors, mostly with computer and video camera programs at home and sewing. The fabric for Mickey and Judy used to put on the list. You can tell that it is a friend and neighbor. Many of these people are not the most beautiful people you have ever seen or the youngest or the thinnest? Some people stumble their lines like they are walking on marble? Some people have thick accents or don't seem to speak well. At first, the voices make it almost impossible to understand the single words they speak. You must accept that all of these friends and neighbors are together. Fun to watch Yes, some conversations are hokey. Yes, it's a little weird (even though it is acceptable to look too cool). See two guys kissing Starfleet (although some kissing scenes will continue to appear). Yes, you cringe a little when they speak clearly from ST: TOS, TNG, other shows and movies, or when you hear the theme from Galaxy Quest. Play at the beginning and end of every item. Why can we get by that? The graphics are the first rate. Better than almost everything you've seen And sometimes one or two performances are more prominent than the real thing? Some of them are real, really torn. <br /> <br /> Hidden Frontier is happy overall in every sense of the word? But you must give credit to the people involved when determining credit Needing a lot of effort to create this size. People, dresses, dresses, graphics? It was a lot of effort on the part of many people. We watched us come back and we thank them.
