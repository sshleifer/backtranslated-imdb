Part of the enjoyment that I received from this movie was the fact that I didn't know anything more than the story starring John Turturro and Emily Watson (2 reasons enough to watch) for a period of time and relevance. With chess Everything that was developed in front of me was unexpected. So I didn't give up more Suffice to say that Turturro is as beautiful as the unusual chess genius, obsessive and sensitive, and Em paired him to the stage as a woman with a strong heart that attracted him. It's about love and passion rather than a respectable board game, and after drawing me in the first half hour gradually becomes completely interesting. And I challenge everyone to guess the ending
