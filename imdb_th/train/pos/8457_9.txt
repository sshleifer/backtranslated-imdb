Gundam Wing for me is a good anime. Slightly slow movements (especially around the series) but above all Now before anyone jumps in my case and calls me "Conservative" I will admit that I have watched all the original Gundam, Gundam 0080 and 0083, Team MS at 08 and Gundam SEED. <br /> <br /> I will admit that there is a small problem with the narrative And a few characters may seem "torn" (such as Zechs Marquise and the original Gundam Char), but this is an alternate universe show based on the original series as well as SEED. <br /> <br /> If you To see this series, make sure you see the Gundam. Ing, then know that you are viewing the series AU.
