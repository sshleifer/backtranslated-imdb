Great show in Gretchen Mol's section. This movie is one of the best biopics to watch on the screen sometimes. Although it covers most of Betty's childhood life But still on the most focused path, which is what most biographical films seem to lack There is a lovely and impressive conversation and performance. This movie is a great break from Dir from "American Psycho" and I think this will show that it is her best work to date. Oh and as a film director, I gave this movie 100% in the movie department. It's amazing that they pulled the 50's image with modern movie stock. Honored by D.O.P all around. Very fun. I recommend any interested to see it: 8/10
