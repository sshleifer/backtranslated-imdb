I accept for the first time that I watch. Even the cowgirls get blues. I don't think it's very memorable in all things. But now, after watching it for the 7th time, I admit that it has grown a lot with me. Sissy, Ms. Jellybean characters and Empress became very loved. And the love between Sissy and Jellybean looks very cute Although the plot is very weak, I think the humor scoffed more than done for it. Then there is a kick-ass soundtrack which has a very capable KD. Lang (which reminds Patsy Cline a little) as possible. I can't think of any movies that "grew up with me" after the first inauspicious impression that the Cowgirls have.
