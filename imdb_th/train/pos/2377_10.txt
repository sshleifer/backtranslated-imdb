I waited a long time for someone to shoot an honest classic novel of H.G. Wells "War Of The Worlds". Timothy Hines has finally done it! I can't believe how good it is! From acting to the use of special effects sets outside of this world, I just can't say enough! It's great! Full of great performances from top performers! It must be seen that believing I am not sure and I have read all negative comments from others and cannot believe what they say. We have to watch other movies, right? And those bad comments, actually, by the vepsaian guy who he is, he doesn't know what he is talking about
