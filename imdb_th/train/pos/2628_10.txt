I think the Lion King 1 1/2 is one of the best sequels ever, if not the best in the three Lion King movies! In the movie Timon and Pumbaa tell us where they come from and have problems with others like Timon. Having trouble digging tunnels with other Meercats! Timon and Pumba traveled to find their dream place and search for it and soon found it and the lion they raised. But soon they will have to choose between the places in the rock dream! Full of great new characters such as Timon Ma (Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max (Jerry Stiller). I think my favorite character is Uncle Max because he is very funny and is voiced by the actor. Funny Jerry Stylist, Ben Stiller's father Disney is wise to choose Stiller in that role! Full of characters, animations, stories and 1 1/2 Lion King songs. In my opinion, it is the best sequel and better than Simba's pride. Although I admit that I like such. Together, Lion King 1 1/2 is a wonderful Disney sequel that everyone in the family can enjoy! It's good and very fun! 10 out of 10!
