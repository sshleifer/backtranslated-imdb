OK. This is a personal list of my most popular Nicktoons shown today: <br /> <br /> 1 Grown Up / SpongeBob SquarePants all <br /> <br /> 2 My Life is a teen robot. > <br /> 3. Invader Zim <br /> <br /> 4 CATSCRATCH / Rugrats <br /> <br /> Observe words with uppercase letters only? This means that this is Nick's performance that I will talk about. <br /> <br /> "Catscratch" is a simple comedy. But lively about three wealthy cats: Mr. Blik, Gordon and Waffles - in a really strange situation from trying to join Human Kimberely's sleeping party to drink beer root to save the world of slugs From evil spaceships This is one of Nick's performances that you will have your funny bones that tickle sooner or later! The song's lyrics are catchy and memorable. The voice actors - including Wayne Knight from the "Seinfield" franchise - bring the characters to a new life with strange characters, fun stories (the fans' episode will be " The King of All Ranks "and" Gordon's Lucky Claws ") and the humor is made in the form of Earthworm Jim. <br /> In summary," Catscratch "is one of the Nicktoons series such as" Invader Zim "and" MLAATR ", which became very popular around the world in just 3 seasons Or less
