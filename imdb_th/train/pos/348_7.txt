These slasher images are sold by date. But this one is fun. <br /> <br /> That Valentine card is witty and well thought out. <br /> <br /> This movie has one peach of the line ... "He's not an angel .... "When he really is an angel !!! Seeing the replay of Buffy will never be the same. <br /> <br /> Actors are new talent actors. But the story does not provide sufficient true depth Denise Richards, on a special DVD, seems to think that women are bound together well and this will give you the feeling that you are involved with their characters. Sorry, but not! <br /> <br /> The direction is very good. Manage to show real little blood and rely on your imagination by threatening implications.

Ideas from slasher Previously, Psycho's shower scene was accompanied by the "masking" of Halloween. <br /> <br /> The killing of someone hiding in the bodybag, even though it is as original as I know !!! <br /> Looks light, not scary. But there is a good jump time if it is an option between The Hole and this. Choose The Hole. Slasher movies have their day. A good slasher, but nothing unconventional !!!
