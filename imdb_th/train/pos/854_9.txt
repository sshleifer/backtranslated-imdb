"Margaritas and Cock ..." <br /> <br /> This movie makes you very entertaining from the opening scene and never stops laughing, surprises and unexpected moments. I enjoy watching "The Matador" more than any other movie. In 2005, it was a strange movie with a memorable character played by the perfect Pierce Brosnan. <br /> <br /> Julian Noble (Brosnan) Is a hit-man who specializes in corporate high-level gigs (Assassinating the rich) He is experiencing something that is close to the mid-life crisis. After realizing that he had no real friends, no permanent home and no planned future, he stumbled in a Mexican hotel bar one night and ran to Danny Wright (Kinnear) <br /> <br /> Danny worsened. Family members are fortunate to be losing a big business deal that may make things around him. He loves his wife deeply, especially when they lose a little son a few years ago. <Br /> <br /> The two men are chalk and cheese hardly have any other common ground at night. And sometimes the conversation happens which causes various events to change their lives. /> <br /> forever friendship they <br build reminds me of Laurel and Hardy. One is a straight man and the other is a fool who is patient to cause them to suffer. The collaboration has been well defined and finely tuned due to the small part of the great performances from Brosnan and Kinnear. <br /> <br /> But don't make mistakes ... here Is Brosnan's film. He is one of the most memorable and admirable characters of the decade. He can shoot your mother and apologize immediately, and you may forgive him. Brosnan may be the most attractive person in the movie. But this is his most complete and lovable work to date I wouldn't mind seeing Oscar nod to this role. <br /> <br /> Consider a scene in which he revealed a high school girl with a bad idea .. no word sucky. "He did that. With the familiar Smirk and managed to escape He told a young man that "Tell your mother to lose 30 pounds and 20 years, then come back to me" without having to find something you don't like. In fact, it makes us like him more than ever. <br /> <br /> And the movie also surprised us with the truly touching scenes, which mostly ended when the film couldn't turn. However, when Julian lifted his little black book to find someone who would call his birthday or when Danny and his wife (Davis) comforted each other in their bedroom. One night, this movie <br /> "The Matador" is stylish and bustling. It provides continuous entertainment. And it has a role that determines the career for Brosnan because lonely people are looking for normal conditions, friendships, and how to do at least one good thing in his life This is an overlooked gem in 2005 and you should try to watch this movie as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> TC Candler from IndependentCritics.com
