When I was very young at a local TV station, they were shown all kinds of kung fu movies. On Saturday I saw a lot of kung fu movies over the weekend. I remembered a lot. I saw great flicks like Crippled Masters, Blind Fist's Bruce, Kung Fu Zombie, Shaolin Drunken Monk, Rage of the Master, Tattoe Dragon and ... Venoms are dead. All five remember the day clearly. Me and my father just had lunch at Burger King. We competed at home. Watch this movie that will be this Saturday. We ran into the house and jumped on the sofa, opened and flicked to 56. The general introduction of many kung fu movie clips in the background with the word kung fu on Saturday. Then, under the title of the film, it said that Five Deadly Venoms. Then the movie started me into my comedy burger shop with the first credit sequence. I loved this movie in the minute that my favorite character was Toad poisoning plot is difficult to follow by age. But that's not what makes me fool ... It's a fight. It's a fight ... Amazin g.I groan every time the movie is launched and soon the best 2-hour movie I've ever seen ends.
