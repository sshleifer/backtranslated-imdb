This is one of the best movies I've seen for many years! I am not a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but she is good as Emma Woodhouse. Alan Cumming is great as Reverand Elton and Sophie. Emma Thompson's sister is hysterical as Miss Bates and Check out the beautiful Jeremy Northam like Mr. Knightley; A gentleman! Anyone who says that you want sex and violence in the movie so well never saw Emma. I think that's what separates it from many others - it looks good. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie that you can watch with the whole family, no more. Emma is that movie. With beautiful settings, excellent costumes and outstanding performers (I used to talk about how beautiful Jeremy Northam is.) Emma is the perfect tenth!
