The conflicting time is a devil's snare at the full-time mind. They are fun to consider in 'What happened?' Sort of way Film makers and authors have dealt with this time and again in a host of movies and television, including 'Star Trek: First Contact', 'Back to the Future' ending, 'Bill and Ted's Adventure Adventure, Groundhog Day. 'And showing respect SG1' Window of Opportunity 'Heinlein' All You Zombies' was written decades ago and it will also make people read the short stories for the first time. <br /> <br /> In the case of movies Terry Gilliam's fantastic '12 Monkeys' It's hard to create something that might be a problem. Compared to the plot elements that intend to make us rethink about the concept of the movie Repeated views will give us a different conclusion if we remain open. <br /> <br /> Some people watching movies for the first time will be considered Cole, played by Bruce Willis. Which is schizophrenia Most people will see that Cole is a person disturbed by what Adams describes as being "Uninterrupted experience" that he visited by time travel Future history can be changed by managing past events. Cole told his psychiatrist Railly (Madeleine Stowe) that time could not be changed. But the phone from the airport was intercepted by scientists after he was sent back in 1996 at his own time.> <br /> This could be interpreted as an event that must occur in the timeline universe to Make sure that the timeline will not change ... Cole must die before his eyes. Self for the fate that will be realized If so, time is like a liquid, it always finds its own level or path, regardless of the external force that works with it. It interferes with these things too. <br /> <br /> If you can change future events that will bring the actions of those who have the power to send people back in time as we see on Board The plane at the end of the movie means that the future can be changed by dealing with past events ... or not? This movie may lead to many drunken quarrels at bars that physicists and mathematicians use often. <br /> <br /> Bonus materials on DVD make the look very interesting. Gilliam was under normal pressure to bring this film under budget, which was not surprising after the fall of 'Munchausen' and in his efforts to film the movie 'Don Quixote'. 'I will rate the documentary.' Create 'is one of the more interesting things I've seen. Of course, not baptism and observation of the difficulties and conflicts that arose between the creative people involved. Gilliam's explanation about this film in his "7Â½th" release, because this film was written by other writers. From himself - so his movie is not an unfair movie. <br /> <br> The image of Brad Pitt's goines is interestingly engaging. That his characters are not particularly sympathetic. Look at his eyes slightly in one of the scenes from the hospital. It's disturbing and distracting. <br /> <br /> May be a coincidence. Louis Armstrong's song 'What a Wonderful World' is used at the end of '12 Monkeys' and the last episode of Serie A. Television of 'The Hitchhiker', a guide to Galaxy 'Both movies and TV series, also have British actors Simon Jones <br /> <br /> '12 Monkeys' are science fiction that will entertain in the same way. And that the stimulation of the chess game may create Entertainment It's not an unreasonable rest, of course.
