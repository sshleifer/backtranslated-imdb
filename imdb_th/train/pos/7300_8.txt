Just like the gentle giants that created the name of the second half of this film, Michael Oblowitz's latest work is elegant. But it was slow and reflective The final outing of the manufacturer "Mosquitoman-3D" has the same problem. It's hard to imagine a boring shark movie. But in any way they manage it What is drawn from Hammerhead: The only Shark Frenzy is that it is an animated animation that can always be enjoyed when dealing with the wonderful world beneath the ocean surface. But that is enough The focus is not good in some scenes, making it seem that the manufacturer is not skilled. With dolphins and whales, all technology But waste Cloudy scenes and excessive close-ups of giant objects in movies do nothing to take advantage of the amazing 3D capabilities of IMAX. There are scenes that are too deep or diverse. The close-up images of these wonderful creatures look smooth and often have only one creature in the camera field, so there is no depth of contrast. Michael Oblowitz tries to follow his father's footsteps But when you get Shark-Week through the cable, his lamenting and boring treatment is very disappointing.
