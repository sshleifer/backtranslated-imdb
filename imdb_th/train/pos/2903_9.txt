Tiempo de valientes is a very fun action comedy after his first film, El fondo del mar, and the amazing television program Los Simuladores, Damian Szifron, once again works at the wonderful Tiempo de valientes movie. Luis Luque is two great actors and here they have great performances, movies, fun and funny and it has a great time. Tiempo de valientes is a funny action movie that I recommend if you A. a Time and I have to congratulate Szifron for all the abilities he has. <br /> <br /> Score: 9
