Modern and original romantic stories <br /> <br /> Very good performances of both Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin. <br /> <br /> Miss Kidman works well to imitate Russian accents. Ben Chaplin is good as a shy clerk who is boring for men (and some women): Ms. Kidman looks amazing and is very sympathetic. I forgot what she was a beautiful woman It is not difficult to imagine that John will fall in love with her. Unexpected turns in that matter are good for the suspect. Although I hope to be happy at the end, the final part of the movie is a surprise for me. <br /> <br /> Summary: Good movies <br /> <br /> Les Pays-Bas: Huit score
