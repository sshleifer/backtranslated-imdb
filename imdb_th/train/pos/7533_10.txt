I love this series when I was a WB child. I don't believe that Batman would spin out when the original program ended in 1995 and this performance came in 1997. First, he solved the crime on his own. It is an interesting perspective on their relationship. I also like the addition of Tim Drake in the series and again, as before, this show has a great story, excellent animation. The only thing I don't like is when in America, it usually runs in the 15-minute story. I just hope that some episodes may be longer. When I liked all the Batman cartoons in this series, and it was called "Over the Edge", in my opinion, if not better than "Heart of Ice" and "Robin's reckoning". Well, with Superman, this program makes my childhood very happy.
