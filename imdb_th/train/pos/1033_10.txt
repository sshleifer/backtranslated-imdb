Say what you are about schmaltz. One of the beauty of this movie is not a pro. It is morally about some American people who are called to have a high purpose and they increase the opportunity. It is inspiring because it is about people who have a high purpose. <br /> <br /> For me, the most interesting part of this movie is Fannie's education and David Farrelli. (Betty's mother and brother), as Fannie said "We have been eliminated from Magnolia." <br /> <br /> In today's political climate led by unscrupulous presidents who lied to us and used 9/11 to eliminate the worst. The nature of human beings has sunk to the level of the 9/11 murderers to search for bloodthirsty revenge. It can't be totally blamed on Mr. Bush - after all, we allow him to lead us in that direction and even choose him again after his lies are revealed. Now, for the perfect reason, we, the Americans, have been flattering all over the world. <br /> <br /> Today we watch this movie with a new awareness: the rise of Nazi power in Germany is not due to Defect in German characters But the human defects that allow us to find rationalization of anything that will show our immoral and evil acts I didn't compare George Bush with Adolph Hitler, but I'm pointing out that leaders can overcome us with fear, hatred, and too much nationalism in doing nasty things. <br /> <br /> Sad to me. Renegade, who will do everything that needs to be Made for insulting himself, no matter what morality would be like the leaders in our country, those who supported them and those buried in the sand so deep that they could not vote. <Br /> <br /> Movies like Watch on the Rhine reminds us of what we have ever wished to be for the betterment of humanity and we have it in ourselves again to achieve the noble goal.> <br /> Geoff
