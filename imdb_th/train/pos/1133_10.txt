This movie is so delightful that my wife, daughter and I find it irresistible. The story is crazy, but "so true" to the world of soap operas in the probability and all the evil impossibility of it. <br /> <br /> I like the performance of Kevin Kline and Sally Field. I do not have anyone better than Kline in playing head-to-head. Field's characters need real attention and confirmation - and her two-pole mood swings play well with the famous Field background (embarrassing?). "You like me!" Prof. Mary J. Oscar. People who can get these big salt on their own are too rare in this world. <br /> <br /> I think this is the only movie that I didn't find myself having patience and style. Of Whoopi Goldberg; I think she is a "point" in every note that she beat Robert Downey Jr., Teri Hatcher, Cathy Moriarty and Elizabeth Shue as well. It's a great movie if you want to travel with a laugh!
