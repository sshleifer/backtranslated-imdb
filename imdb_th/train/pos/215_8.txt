The word 'classic' is thrown away today. But this film deserves praise for the combination of Neil Simon, Walter Matthau (probably the best comic actor in the world) and George Burns, who lamented late, making it a comic masterpiece It is interesting to consider how this movie will be without death, so Jack Benny plays George Burns' role as planned. When combined, the scene in the Matthau's apartment is unlikely to be seen as a fighter. One movie in my desert island, of course. <br /> <br /> "Enter !!!!!!!!!"
