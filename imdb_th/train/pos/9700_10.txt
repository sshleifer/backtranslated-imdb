Anyhow, this movie will be energized, bittersweet and warm at the same time. Stars like Tony Shalhoub (from Providence) bring stories to life. The story is inspiring. We see life that is hopeless, up and down, through the most innocent eyes that can be imagined: birds <br /> <br /> Polly begins his life as a baby parrot given to girls Small character (played by Holly Eisenberg) As Pepsi, a young woman) with barriers to speech As she learns to speak correctly, Paulie, too. However, unlike most birds, he can speak and understand everything he says. The military's father did not like birds, so he was sent to a pawn shop and bought by an old artist Ivy. She taught him etiquette, etc. while traveling across the country to find the owner of Polly. The film continues with a variety of fate until Polly ends up in the laboratory, where he is eventually hiding in the basement and is found by a Russian guardian who touches the story of the bird. The plot corresponds to a simple theme. The parable is that the language is a gift and a curse. I want to say that the soundtrack is surprising. The beautiful combination of digital base flutes and trumpets adds to the film in the pure joyful spot. Wide camera angles and breathtaking views make this story more beautiful. And as a last word, all believable puppets (Unlike Star Wars, which Yoda is similar to the Muppet), this movie is one of my favorite movies, along with additional observations that my wonderful parrot died four years ago. Overall, I gave this movie **** from four stars, thumbs up two fingers and a big hug.
