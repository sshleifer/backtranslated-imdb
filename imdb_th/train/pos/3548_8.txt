Just saw the version of Frank Loesser's Guys and Dolls for the third time with my mother who had never seen this before. She was surprised by the singing of Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando and she thought that the order of Havana that Simmons and Brando danced together was great. These things are impressive to me as well, and are often the highlights of the film, directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. This movie, which originated from the story of Damon Runyon, takes a moment with the slow walk of the scene. That is not music. From the beginning, other stories with Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine were not interesting for me. But still have their charm, especially during "Sue Me" still like the number "Sit down, you're rocking the boat" of Stubby Kaye and Sheldon Leonard's performances and B. S. Pully. When watching the drama throughout the Guys and Dolls, it's not a great movie. But of course it's a very good story.
