This is my first comment on the IMDb website and the reason I wrote it is because we are talking about one of the best movies ever! 'Ne goryuy!' Will make you laugh and cry at the same time. You will fall in love. (If you are not yet a fan!) With the Georgian choir singing tradition, and you may accept the difficulty of your existence and feel good after watching it. Show who is not the leader, creating bright and memorable characters and is interesting and important as the main character. This movie is starring Vahtang Kikabidze (the great person), but you will remember every face around him in the movie. You will find yourself talking about their line, which has become a household name for many Russian-speaking people. The movie will be with simple but deep. You will want to look again and again.
