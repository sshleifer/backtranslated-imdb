I just watched "Kalifornia" in Showtime for the fourth time since I saw it for the first time in July of 2001. You probably thought that when there was a serial killer movie that had just recently been mentioned but not Maybe if this movie was released between 1996-1999, perhaps more successful In my opinion, "Kalifornia" is different from most serial killer movies released in the late 1990s. It has a completely different atmosphere from most current serial killers such as "Seven" or "The Bone Collector "Many killer movies have shown killer. But that person is always behind the mask or we have never seen them enough to learn anything about them. "Kalifornia" is a movie that tries to break through the wall and understand the real criminals. Try to answer questions like "Why do they do what they do? Is it because of what happened in their past? Does it make them feel better or have power? Or do they because they like the thrill of killing? ? "Here are some things "California" tried to answer, but there is still a place for us to try and think out for ourselves. Brad Pitt created an endless impression as Early Grayce. When we first met in the beginning of the movie, we saw that he was clearly disturbing one person. When we first saw him late at night, probably drunk, then we saw him picking up the stone, throwing it out of the bridge, and later fell into the windshield of the past. Pitt fierce in this movie It's good to see him always when he plays a psychopath or is a bad person. It's funny to lead him into real play in "12 Monkeys" and he will be at the other end of the spectrum in David Fincher's "Seven".
