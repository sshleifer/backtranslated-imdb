Father is a short Tom-Jerry. In general, the situation is designed to be a conflict and subsequent physical abuse. The characters have appropriate behavior, natural tension between the various characters leads to general chaos. The best part (And the most fun) is when the peace treaty is in effect and respected by all the strange wonders appear before your eyes. Warning - it's too clever to allow Tom to help you do the morning cleaning routine! Highly recommended
