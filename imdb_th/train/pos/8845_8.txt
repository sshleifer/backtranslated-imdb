The beginning of this movie is a small and confusing story. But sit tight because you are in your life This concept is interesting, along with interesting equipment used to tell the overall story. There is a good performance around by Phillip Seymour Hoffman who is not surprised at all. Ethan Hawk deserves credit for strong performance as well. The direction of Mr. Lumet is outstanding. This film is seventy in the sense that there is a risk of telling this story. But unlike most repetitive films that live in the landscape today, thriller based on sincere relationships rather than special techniques. You will be rewarded for the time invested in this film.
