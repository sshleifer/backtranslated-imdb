In what must be one of the most frozen movies ever, people who pretend to kill people in New York and the answers to everything may not be what people suspect. It can be seen that Brian DePalma is influenced by Hitchcock in the corner of the camera and the objects. Michael Caine plays the most stimulating character while Angie Dickinson is generally a boring woman. There is no good hair. Keith Gordon (who later performed in "Christine") may be the most interesting character in the movie. But you can't really understand this movie without watching it And after seeing it, you may not know how people you trust Also starring Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz
