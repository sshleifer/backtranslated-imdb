I came to Nancy Drew by expecting the worst thing ... because of other people's bad comments. I think: even though I didn't read the book But it didn't seem like Nancy Drew I had heard, but I was wrong. Of course, it's not a carbon book. But when you create a movie out of something, you have to edit it to be a big screen entertainment. The storyline is fun and exciting, along with many real fears, and I think Emma Roberts believes in her performing this classic character. There were many funny moments, and in contrast to many texts, there was no point in this film that Nancy came out as a ditz. One thing that this movie does well is to balance the mix between comedy, romance, suspicious moments and real heart. I love this movie Flick anything, flick anything! And if you are wise and decide to trust me and go see this, prepare for SCARY as an impulsive moment because I am such a freaking out! Go watch it or be a dummy person and let others decide what you think of this movie for you ... it's a mistake I almost made. I love it. I want to own this movie! I love Emma Roberts now as well. She is like a mini Bree Van De Kamp from DH. Love it. Love it.
