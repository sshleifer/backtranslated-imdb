Whether this movie is propaganda or not (I believe that it will not be true) It shows the power of the media. The significance of this documentary does not show how good Chavez men are. It shows how Bolivia saw how it happened. Although it may look wrong and have a bias in supporting movies But I think the view that is shown in the movie is fully legal. The Venezuelan people, through Venezuela's private media companies, see only one aspect of the Neo-Liberal coup. This movie shows us how Bolivia sees. Call it propaganda. I think it is a decision on your part.
