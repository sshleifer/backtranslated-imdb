What happens to you, if you are not blown in the sequence of the action scenes and Jessica Simpson is hot, you will be very drunk. Of course, this movie is not a masterpiece, I don't think it will be the goal. It's fun and funny. I've never watched the program when I was young. I just saw it once and when I watched the movie I felt that it had the same atmosphere. The leather seats are shaking and the order of the cars is good because it doesn't make me bored and dragged out like a scene in 2fast 2furious and Jessica Simpson is hot. I just want them to use her more in the action scene. Action In conclusion, I have time to watch this and I will go and see again soon and I will buy it on DVD. People enjoy what it is.
