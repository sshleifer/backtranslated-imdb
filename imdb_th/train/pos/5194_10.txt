This film is one of my favorite martial arts movies from Hong Kong. It is one of John Woo's oldest films and is one of the few traditional martial arts movies that he directed. You can see his influence from work under Chang Cheh in this movie. Good action, fighting posture, performed by Fong Hak On, which appeared as one of the bad guys in the movie. Is the star of Pei Pei from the famous "Five Venoms" and the face that is familiar to the fans of Golden Harvest and Shaw Brothers. The story is interesting, has a reasonably good storyline and the creation of characters and their relationship with others. Can do it wisely This film is only published in the UK VHS. Media Asia has released regional DVD 3 and has a DVD version in the United States. This movie looks cute, whether it's the original language or the English dub version. I would like to recommend this movie.
