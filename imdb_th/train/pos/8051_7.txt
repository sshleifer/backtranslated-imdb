"One of Hung's early attempts at humor is death in part when Hung tries to imitate Lee's attitude and expression, and where Hang comes to enjoy Jackie Chan's Drunken professor. When Hung joined three people with martial arts experts at the end, it wasn't the best movie. But good for kung fu in the 70s, especially if you are a fan of Hung and / or Lee. Be careful: most videos This version of the movie is of relatively low quality. There is also a character in blackface, which some people may find dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> Sammo Hung is a pig farmer in the countryside who moved to Hong Kong to fight the bad guys. Sammo Change the impersonation of Bruce Lee's character when fighting! <br /> <br /> The film is often billed in Bruce Lee's "Enter The Dragon" parody, but not ... Sammo is a pig farmer in the countryside - obsessed with Bruce Lee. He moved to Hong Kong to help his cousin in opening a new restaurant. His new job was forced to protect a restaurant from local thugs to earn money. When Sammo turned into a fight mode, he opened Bruce Lee's role. Which will Must have faith! The film is quite sloppy in many fighting scenes. Sammo fights with the more evident martial artists and has one character that should be a black person played by Asian people in heavy makeup. At this film, lack of budget and accuracy, it is more in the atmosphere and energy. Highly recommended for a good mood "
