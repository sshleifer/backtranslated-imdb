I remember having watched this movie when I was a child. I can't remember where I saw I have to be about 14 years old. I think this movie is incredible and I want to see it again. It comes in one kung fu channel. But I missed I really hit it. It's the best Kung Fu movie I've ever seen! I highly recommend and now I have discovered a place to get. I can enjoy it again and for many years. I have to watch the movie Return of the Venom that some people say this too.
