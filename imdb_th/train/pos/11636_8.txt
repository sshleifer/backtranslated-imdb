Filming the suspense movie performed well, beautifully beautiful Got me at the edge of my seat I like many leading actors and think that the villain is doing very well. Not much to chew here in the form of a theme. But if you just get up, sit off the brain, watch the fancy camera work and enjoy the plot, you'll have a good time. The plot is well worn and the general movie audience may know what to expect more than about ten minutes. But that didn't bother me because I liked watching it a lot. In the past, they might not have focused on only two characters and had a fascinating time when I hoped they would let others have a few lines But these people may be right in order to make the movie focus heavily The plot gets me by the neck quite fast and never let go. It's not a good idea to think too much during or after the movie. Because I'm not sure if it's very reasonable Just sit and enjoy
