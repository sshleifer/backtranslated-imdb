I do not doubt that the critics of this movie, especially the art art, want laxatives. This is an excellent vehicle movie in the tradition of Abbot & Costello or Don Knotts. Last, it won't shake the world or change movies forever. What to do is entertainment. When everything is said and done, that is the next most important thing. Watch this movie and forget your problems. It also has a simple and generous moral message without additional costs. I always like Elvira's TV program. When I live in LA, she doesn't steal her schtick from Vampira more than Vampira does from the original Theda Bara. & Cassandra Peterson do the best. Elvira is fresh. We want more of this type of movie. Never had enough The villain William Morgan Sheppard is also excellent. He showed great malice. I didn't find any technical flaws. The executions are close to flawless, just as art has been given. My deep admiration for director James Signorelli and his entire team
