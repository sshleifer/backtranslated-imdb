The Good Earth is a great movie !!! Everyone must see ... It is a jerk and anxiousness. It values ​​the value of the formation of diligence, humility, and the love of the family ... The story can be linked to our lives today. The way we respond to such problems is extremely important and if a person is not strong enough to face such problems, he may be left with protection and uselessness I am very pleased that the characters show their roles appropriately, even the young actors ... their emotions attract the audience. This movie may have black and white colors. But it's a fascinating story that you don't want to end That makes it really great! There should be a new creation for this very good movie.
