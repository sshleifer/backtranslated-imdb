"Home Room" such as "Zero Day" and "Elephant" are inspired by the new wave of school shooting. But unlike other two movies, "Home Room" focuses on two survivors. (Not a gunman or a person killed) after shooting Making it less disadvantageous and more useful because it takes a little effort to ask questions without answers. <br /> <br /> Don't give up on this movie in the first 20 minutes. It should be set up. But played like the "Hill Street Blues" episode that was rejected. It was crippled but tolerated with it. At least it ran at enough lengths to make the movie be classified as a feature. I suggest skipping this thing completely and just jumping forward to the hospital scene - there's nothing here that you can't choose from the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Like a little movie Any good things like this The only item that Paul F. Ryan is both a writer and director. Although this agreement does not guarantee good movies But it is a good sign because it means the unity of construction and operations that often lack the remarkable qualities of a large budget Since the script of "Home Room" is its true strength, luckily the author produced and guaranteed that his vision made it appear on the screen. <br /> <br /> Ryan takes a big opportunity. With the ending that tests the limits of tolerance to the average sympathy He ran to the edge. But with all the logic you cry instead of cringe Why the final work is a combination of audiences needing to be rewarded at the end of this journey. Songs (Sarah McLaughlin's "Sweet Surrender") that he went out and a remarkable revision of the last minute. /> The other strength of this film is the selection of Busy Phillips (Alicia) and Erika Christensen (Deanna) as the main sponsor. Although Phillips shows off her standard teenager and Christensen is the smartest daughter of a good family. Both girls' family lives are more than satisfied and not interested in Ryan. What happened here is all about both of them, despite the lame story about the detective. The police suspect that around the city trying to tie Alicia with a single athlete. If they ever cut and trim the movie, the side story should unite. <br /> <br /> The story of binding two different women and helping each other is almost impossible. New ideas Is a clich√© and forecast But his script makes them participate in a compelling and credible practice competition, gradually flicking, putting together and sharing moments of vulnerability just to dodge back inside himself. The line of "DR forces Will die. "Dina should tear you apart - I can't think of any moments in other films that I feel intensely like that. She needs a connection that Alicia strongly resists. Deanna can only progress when she retreats. The audience expects the embrace of a group that seems to never happen. <br /> Finally, this thing is not only But created many doubts But also makes you appreciate both the character and the two actors that make them alive. <br /> <br /> Again, I know what? I am only a child
