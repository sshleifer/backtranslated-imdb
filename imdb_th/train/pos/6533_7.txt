I must say that this is not exciting. But talking about fashion and strange ways to solve puzzles It's a little too easy. Nancy Drew (Emma Roberts) uses IMDb ... It's great! I like about that part of the movie ... <br /> <br /> Corky (Josh Flitter) is very hilarious ... and Ned Nixon (Max Thieriot) seems really hopeless ... Will be more Angry with the way she treats him ... <br /> <br /> Okay, this movie is a tour and disguised fashion. Anyway, I recommend this film for Nancy Encore summer fun just for fun. More teen spy movies by Emma Roberts .. Spymate ... Remember? She is a good person in this tricky detective work.
