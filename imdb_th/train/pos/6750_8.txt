This is a well-made film that is meticulously directed and has a wonderful character that sometimes moves deeply - for example, the scene with the police, a faithful close friend. But not complicated and his wife This plot is effective and exciting. The gangster characters are especially interesting and play a role in the metaphysical life of the hero. Clearly, the police were rude and ready to be a character in hell. <br /> <br /> A few small reservations: I found a little one end because it was a celebration of the successful combination of the hero with the structure. The police system and the justice system, which collapses the ambiguity of the police character that has been maintained until that point. In addition, I also found that the female character who was the leader was quite weak: more than the catalyst for the hero's salvation, all she seemed to do was cry and dizzy while the tough people fought.
