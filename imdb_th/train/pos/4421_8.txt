Gojoe is part of a new wave of Japanese movies with very creative directors, editors and photographers, and working on historical topics, what Japan calls Kojo has a lot of creativity in terms of color, photos and excellent editing. The new wave of Japanese samurai movies helps to look at the traditional beliefs in shamanism, demons and mysterious powers that are part of their ancient culture He certainly Another good example of this type is Onmyoji (2001). I will let director Sogo Ichii be one of the most interesting and creative new Japanese directors. Other times in Japan, I recently highly recommend it. Including Twilight Samurai (2002) by Yomada and Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman (2003)
