I give 10 because other people seem to like it and it's not bad. The reason I am worried about you is to increase your personal observation of the castle's work. <br /> <br /> I've seen "Homicidal" and "The Tingler" (a version with a smart color sequence that everything except blood In white and black) a few times and <br /> <br /> Even though I am not old enough to see them when the castle is based on his acting technique, so I can Thank them for their own merit And while most of them send him to a second rate, schlocky, hammy, etc. I believe they cause him to be hurt. <br /> <br /> The end of "Homicidal" is shocking and the work in Now - and the evidence of "The Tingler", while stupid, is highly original. <br /> <br /> But "House On Haunted Hill" is TRIUMPH after using the house. Vincent Price and a strong actor, plus a good score and value The production - when I first saw it in the late-night shows in the late sixties.

So I hope this document will accept that I hope to see it
