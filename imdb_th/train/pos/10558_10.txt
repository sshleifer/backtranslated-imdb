<br /> <br /> Charlie Kauffman makes the strange metaphysics popular. But this Canadian jewel makes it hilarious. <br /> <br /> Like most strange movies, less talk about better stories. But staged two friends, Anthony and Dave, together since they were youngsters, they could no longer cope with this world, but that was the place with more problems. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, it makes me smile long after the last credit, and that is a rare experience with lots of "no" out there. <br /> <br /> Don't miss out. This thing <br /> <br />
