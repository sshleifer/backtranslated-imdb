I saw this thing since I was a child in the late eighties and I must say that Galaxy Express is one of those movies that are stuck in your imagination for a long time. If you have never understood the interest of anime, finding this movie could be your golden ticket to Otaku. <br /> <br /> The story is delicate and poetic, like the Blade Runner. Ridley Scott's cell animation, while quite primitive, has a bright style that shows Leiji Matsumoto's great talent in character design and visual narrative. <br /> <br / > This is one of The children's film like no other. The Wizard of Oz that transcends the status "Family entertainment" completely and stand as a classic cinema in your own sense. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie.
