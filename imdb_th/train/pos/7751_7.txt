I really like Tom Barman AWTWB. You just let it come to you and enjoy it while it lasts and don't expect anything. It's like sitting on a caf√© terrace with beer in the sun in summer and watching people pass by. Of course, it won't make you ponder after that. But it is not necessary for a good movie It's just an experience between great movies. <br /> <br /> I feel that there are a few lines that can work out a bit more. But being a fan of Lynch, I don't care anymore :) <br /> <br /> And I like the style or flair of this movie. It's slippery but fresh and the soundtrack is beautiful. Which music lover will get his kick from AWTWB? I can assure you. <br /> <br /> I'll give you 8 points. 10. <br /> <br /> (wise song 10 of 10)
