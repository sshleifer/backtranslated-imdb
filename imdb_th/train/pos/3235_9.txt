Great movies, realistic images of contemporary Finland, touching and profound. One of the best Finnish movies ever. Capture amazingly everyday life in the small Finnish city center, the wishes and weaknesses of people, happiness and sorrow. The bright autumn sunshine that creates a cool atmosphere for a clear examination of people in the welfare society. Lampela is one of the most promising Finnish filmmakers. He shows that it is possible to create a movie that can be captured without a machine gun and bloodshed. His next film is Eila, which should be worth watching, although the story of cleaning women who fight for their work is not universally attracted like the fate of Joki.
