You know this - a group that doesn't dare jump into a competition that looks like they don't have a chance to win - it's a story done by Hollywood (Bring It On, Karate Kid, Escape to Victory, Best of the Top, etc.) Korea now goes with the Taekwondo team that is struggling for glory ?? And guess what the results are predictable <br /> <br /> The fact that this movie is not reduced to the face of a talented young actor who makes you really interested in the character. /> <br /> Fans of your typical martial arts movie may be disappointed? Taekwondo does not send the usual movements and acrobats seen in Kung Fu movies. Most of the actions are limited (although impressive), kicking and punching occasionally. It doesn't matter, because it's the interaction of the characters and the struggle to create something of their own, which makes this film a success.
