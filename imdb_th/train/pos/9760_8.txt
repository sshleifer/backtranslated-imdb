I have very fond memories of this movie when I saw it with my two sisters when it first performed in 1977 and I was eight years old. Obviously it's a failure - and now it's really forgotten (videotapes, scans and scans - which have never been fair with Panavision's ambitious images or elements. Print) The film is very modern, submarine) and accepts unevenly. Some characters and sequences are beautiful, while other characters are quite young and not outstanding. The sad blue abandoned camel (Eeyore's shadow) and his blue song are truly delightful. Joe Raposo's song is the most beautiful song. The curiosity that is definitely worthwhile may (sadly) fall into all confusion.
