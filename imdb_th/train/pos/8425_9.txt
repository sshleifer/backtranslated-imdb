In the end, I watched these episodes in 2008 and I had to go back continuously and check when the actual production. They are very scary to make them enjoy what will happen in the future. Parker and Stone live in Texas and see the stupidity of Bush Gov, or they are strange, interesting, Naboo. Awesome! Bush's frat bros stormed the White House, wearing a dress to wield Arab bushes 'intentionally' to carry someone? (No, he'll do that as a government). This may be a failure as a sitcom at that time. But now must be considered excellent if deuce
