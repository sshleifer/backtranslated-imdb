I saw this film on TV many years ago and I saw this movie when I got this on tape. I think it's doing well enough. It's not the best of all movies, but it's good enough. This movie is capable enough to inspire many people, especially younger children. Performing well with Danny Glover as the lead actor. The subject line is not very reliable. But the script is well written This movie may be of interest to avid baseball fans. It does not apply directly to action-packed sports movies. It applies directly to a good movie that you can watch with your family and learn the hidden text in this film. Overall, this movie is good. But not very good I gave this movie with 7/10
