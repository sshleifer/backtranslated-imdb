In my opinion, this must be one of Barbara Stanwyck's best performances. She is one of only a few actors and now that can speak more with one face than all conversations. And i'm lucky enough to watch the original and uncensored movie with an additional 4 minute video. Unfortunately, the movie is very short Lily is a young woman who barely handles it, working for her father in his illegal things. The only thing that she connects to everything is her close friend Chico, played by Theresa Harris. Although Chico is an African American (And there are white women who are the best friends with black women in the 30th century. It is debatable as to the content of this film) and Lily is not, they have special ties. And it is not about sex. Only 2 women are stuck or are driven in an uncontrollable situation. After Lily's father died and she didn't know what she was going to do, she said that she had the power to go out and get what she wanted. Yes it is immoral But that's the whole point of this movie. Then "they" have to go and break in the last few minutes. So until the last few minutes of the movie, it was a great movie and it was amazing to see. "The lesson" of this film is still in use today, and I'm sure it will be 100 years from now. As she wants But it works for men
