This film is a masterpiece of short-term movies. This film was moved together with a strong image that made the audience feel sensitive. This film opened during the Spanish Civil War as a group of children tried to avenge another child. In fact, they are showing the world what they have seen in the adult world around them. Later, we found these three children again as adults at the hospital. Here we see what life has to do with each person. One is a patient who is repressed for sex. Another man is a sick businessman. The third child, the girl, became a nun and served at the hospital. This film is a comparison of the effects of violence on the mind. <br /> <br /> The film has a point that is not suitable for members who look nauseous. Great performances and scripts can be written quite well. There is a musical score that provides a stream of fear throughout the film. This is not a movie for thrill seekers. But it is a movie for a considerate audience
