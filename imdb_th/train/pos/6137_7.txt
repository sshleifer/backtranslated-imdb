It's such a wonderful jewel. It is strange to enjoy watching. Yes it has singing But it was created well in the story and was very beautiful to hear It was very pleasant to watch; I enjoy from beginning to end! <br /> <br /> This film happened in England during World War II. It's about a witch, an apprentice who is searching for the missing spell that she wants. She uses her rough "magic" to transport her and her 3 children under her care to various destinations to find it They joined by her letter teacher, who was surprised to learn that the lessons from his school actually work! <br /> <br /> Although special effects may look a bit old at first when you are familiar with it, they become part of the charm of this movie. In fact, this film received an Academy Award from these effects! <br /> <br /> This movie is innocent and fun - and it's hard not to like beautiful music. The characters look very interesting. I think everyone of all ages can find something like this movie.
