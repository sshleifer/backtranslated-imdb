I just hope that the Return of the Jedi has been directed by other people. I mean there are too many ewoks. In addition, this time, our heroes look like other people: Princess Leia, no longer having to fight with the look. Darth Vader's boring look is not as bad as before and Yoda is dead. <br /> Go now that I can't hate it. <br /> <br /> Partial spoiler 1- Jabba the hut 2- Order of the 3-The Emperor sailboat attack (now it's evil. ) 4-The Speeders chase at Endor Woods 5-The Last Battle 6-The Dark seduction Scene 7 Anakin's return to the good side of the 8-power <br /> <br /> Some people are so good that their tears can flow. If there are some scenes that have been cut and hired by another director, this scene will be perfect like Episode 4 and 5, but still not unusual. 9 out of 10
