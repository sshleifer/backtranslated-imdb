Fido is a story about zombies that have better manners that have been trained to serve the human race. Everyone dispersed when Timmy Fido, a small zombie zombie, had eaten his family's neighbor since then. (It may not be a disaster Most people treat zombies with justice and one character sleeps with his zombies. (The very funny part of the movie, if not disturbing as well) and we find Fido dear, no matter what he does. This is a funny and unique movie, especially for zombies. It may be one of the least violent zombies. (There is no denying this statement.) I advise people who are looking for something very funny and different. I give this score 8/10. Score R for violence related to zombies.
