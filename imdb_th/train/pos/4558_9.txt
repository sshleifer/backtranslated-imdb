My left foot in my opinion is a wonderful biography about one of the best writers and painters in the world. Great performances, great soundtrack and perfect casting. I think Christy (Daniel Day-Levis) is a very talented person, even though I don't understand what he says most. In addition, when he threw anger, I was a little scared. It was so sad that he had to suffer with cerebral palsy. In conclusion, if you are a big fan of Daniel Day-Lewis or like biopics, I would like to introduce this great biography about one of the world's best writers and painters. You are in real practice and a good time, so don't miss this one.
