Although too young to remember the first show of the series (Just a baby) I have caught it over and over again in television in the late 80s, just when I received attention in the war and all aspects of it. It was my grandfather who let me see the first series and also gave my first attention about his time in the fleet at Malta and later in the Pacific. Since then, I have eaten many books and watched many TV dramas about the Second World War with various opinions. British television stations are generally very good at producing these things, because The World At War can be easily confirmed by the large number of gems produced by the BBC and independent companies. , "Blitz" and the BBC series about Dunkirk "United Kingdom is at war" with the "Japan" series "Germany" and "America" ​​is a very high standard. World At War is great. The last and although age as them. There will be new revelations about the war that will make the crop clear, which is not included in the series, and of course the Second World War takes place on a large canvas that produces every detail set. More time and money If so, it is possible. What I feel I have to say to those who condemn that it doesn't include everything: The World At War can't do that. But it will help you research faster and make it more fun It works great for me: now I have a very comprehensive library of books, videos, DVDs and tapes and CDs. Recommend to anyone who has an interest even through This series has been created so well that they find it difficult to accept that it is high quality and informative programming.
