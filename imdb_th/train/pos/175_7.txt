The average movie is quite good. But is a movie that creates courage from Ms Hawn to promote this vehicle as an Exec Producer & as a lead actor Although she ended up proving, she was willing to show herself as a brain bizbo. How many other actors have been injured due to this film? Not a lot. Does this mean that the female butt is not funny? Goldie is better than other actresses because she still maintains the role and investment in other projects. Sometimes Sandra Bullock goes there, like Miss Congeniality, but Nicole Kidman doesn't have to deal with the pratfall. Excellent Great to see my favorite actor Chris Sarandon & Cliff DeYoung especially
