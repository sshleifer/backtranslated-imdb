If your plane type movie fans have to watch! Scenes in the 20s and 30s. Johnny has no dangers, only with excellent actors. "Falling the wall of data, falling down the wall and falling down # # $% # @ $ wall" "You should not hang me on Johnny Hook" or "Looks like Johnny will be put "It was a spoof of the old James Cagney movie and refer to them very much. There was a wonderful scene when Jhonnys walked down the death row and there was a priest set up to escape him. Listen closely to reading fake monks. It's funny. Another great scene is when Dom Delauise plays the Pope. Watching his reaction to Johnny after he gives advice to the Pope, many people speak without voice. I recommend this movie to everyone who likes to laugh.
