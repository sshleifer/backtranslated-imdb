Will request her signature The film has slow tempo and gloomy dark quality. It has a cinematic look in the 60s and still reminds me of Polanski's Rosemary's Baby without supernatural horror. The fear here is what every successful actress - she is older and she is useless in her career. In addition, she felt that she lived a life that lacked the true spirit, humanity and merit.

Gena Rowlands enters the heart of the character's torture and acts very well.

It is a movie that has many deep emotions.
