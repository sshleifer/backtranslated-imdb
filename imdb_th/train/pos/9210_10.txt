I feel that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I am the most old and loving Western man. I like movies that are involved, at least in facts. If I'm not mistaken, this is a movie like that. I also like revenge movies that have features as well. In my opinion, some of my favorite movies are open scenes with hit scenes and shooting scenes I felt that the dance scene of Corral was a little too real. But it does not affect my feelings about the complete movie I saw what I thought was the continuation of this film when gun smoke I like it. I recommend taking time to watch this movie. I'll watch it again. I still feel the romance of this movie playing well. I think it's a character that makes Randy Travis play the villain. But I always enjoy his performance
