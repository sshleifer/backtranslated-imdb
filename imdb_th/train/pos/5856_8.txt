Rated E (packed with violence) <br /> <br /> I have a traditional spiderman game for the PC for a couple of years and I have not lost because on Windows XP there is a certain level of error that I Unable to overcome this reason, so be warned if you have XP, but for those without XP, try playing this game. It's a fun game for families with action and it's great for Spiderman fans. In the game you play Spiderman and you spend time with various criminals who commit the crime. Spiderman is a fun little game and I recommend to Spiderman fans or parents who want a fun and clean game for kids. > <br /> 8/10
