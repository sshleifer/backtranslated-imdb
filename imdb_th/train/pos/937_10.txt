When it first aired in 1984, my wife and I recorded it in our first VHS recorder. I still have an age tape that I try to watch every year. It was the year that my first child was born and seeing A Christmas Carol in this nation brought a lovely memory back in a happy time which spent many hours with this film in the background. I finally broke down this year and ordered a DVD which made me take a moment to write this short reaction to the movie. The story of Charles Dickens was captured in a remarkable fashion here. George C. Scott Is great and very reliable as Scrooge The supporting actors are equally exciting. This is my idea. Impeccable production. Little details add to the enjoyment of the "similes" game. The grandson and wife of Scrooge play with the guests on the party as well as the items that are complete. (Since I created it with my high school students as a short summary of work in class!) I can actually think of ways to make myself entertained during the holiday. Originally by IBM (coincidentally, it's fun to watch old tapes with traditional IBM ads ... which shows how much the computer has developed in 21 years. It's amazing how things are Lee go! Action is a classic, timeless, fun ... and God bless all of us!
