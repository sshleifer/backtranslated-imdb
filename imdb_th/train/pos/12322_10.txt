This movie is one of my favorites. It is a type mixed with a mixture of Action- / Horror- / Romantic- / Comedygenre. Some special effects may look outdated compared to modern standards. This small flaw will be easily overlooked. There are many stories to discover in this story. The romantic relationship between the two main characters is so beautiful that it's painful. The picture is beautiful as well. The action is great, which is not surprising. It comes from Honkong, the hometown of the best action movies in the world. Humor sometimes seems a little silly. But a good way Anyway, this film can create a balance for different emotions and maintain well-being. Absolutely recommended
