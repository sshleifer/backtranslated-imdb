I really stick to Caprica because it is a very good prequel series for the Battlestar Galactica. It started slowly, but of course it will be accepted soon after the new episode is still airing. <br /> <br /> I've heard Good stories about future episodes and guest stars for the first season. <br /> <br /> This sci-fi drama makes our fans who both like <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz works Excellent including Polly Walker as Clarice Willow !! <br /> <br /> Worthwhile to try. <br /> <br /> Catch Friday at 21.00 hrs. / 20.00 hrs. at SYFY.
