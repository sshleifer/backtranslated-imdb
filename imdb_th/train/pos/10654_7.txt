The Haunting is a movie that has an eerie home, good work and a voice actors who believe that everything around is real. There are scenes that make you jump and the terrifying aspect of what happened at the Hill House in the past. I find it interesting. There are truly creepy moments in the movie and I like the way the ghosts appear in the blinds and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score gives the correct atmosphere and the sound design is ringing around you What I hope will happen is something a little more serious than this. Jan De Bont gave PG-13 a rating to argue and I think he held himself too much. And it still holds. Haunting should use a few pure horror scenes. The ending for me is a little antimicrobial. Overall, I like it a lot. Performing well and having moments that make you jump I just hope it will make me more afraid.
