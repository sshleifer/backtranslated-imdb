I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. I think it's funny, funny, sexy, painful and warm. Andie MacDowell's performance is appropriate and vulnerable. At one time, film director MacDowell didn't make her beauty a character in the movie anymore. The love between Kate and her young man is cute, looks and plays very well. Her relationship with friends is both thorns and balm in life. Imelda Stalinson, an MVP in many British movies, performed well in this regard. There are some tragedies in this story. But I think this movie was recorded at the end with a great performance, clean direction and sharp writing.
