I know a couple of days ago that the creator of this film played the title role. This film is not about the actions of "Giant riding" but mostly about people who are giant sports giants RIDING to change the focus. <br /> <br /> In my teens, I live a blog from one of the wedges of a good body. The best and the best in the world I went out to surf 15 to 18 and rode and hammered with waves 10 and 12 feet several times. That experience causes me to be amazed by the players in this movie. The idea that Jeff Clark, for all human beings, can escape from horse riding by HIMSELF of non-partisan for more than a decade than I can understand. The first safety rule of water sports is "Never surf / dive / swim by yourself" He goes to a place where people have no reason to be and live to tell about it. I will not go out there if the water is 75 degrees and the sharks leave. <br /> <br /> In the world of warm water: the first shot of the waves in the jaw makes my skin all over my body. This is not just a terrible wave. But it was an uncontrollable wave when we saw Laird Hamilton not only survived the waves of 40 to 60 feet (I could hardly print those numbers) but actually worked my face like a fun day at Rincon. Blown away There is a dedication and focus on the big wave riders who are comparable to anyone in the world. <br /> <br /> This movie is great. I let it be 9 instead of 10, because it neglected to mention that there are big wave riders in the world outside the Hamilton / Kalama team and I think they deserve to be mentioned in Splice in Ken. Bradshaw at the Log Cabins outside and 10 more!
