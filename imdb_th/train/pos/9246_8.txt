One of the great mysteries of life that has been suffering from everyday life is the reason why cute girls always pay more attention to jerks and heels than cute men. <br /> <br / > Worse when a good guy wants to get married Those girls, girls also like jerks and heels, even after jerks and heels show disdain, they show that they are interested in using girls Good people after being lied to and cheated and even after losing the girl completely <br /> <br /> Clark Gables is a jerk and he is perfect in the role. But it is a sad note for his fans. <Br >> <br /> Jean Harlow came in as a more streamlined West, even though it sounds like the West in a scornful line. <br /> <br /> <br /> It is strange to be surprised that many other characters intend to be bad guys - I mean, they are locked, so they must be clearly good people. <Br /> <br /> In fact, there are many good people here. Anyone in the renter, movie or story will be annoying and stabbed behind. But here to help others. <br /> <br /> So maybe the story may look quite awkward, at least by modern standards. The audience will be glad to see. <br /> <br /> The biggest complaint I have is that many good actors don't get credit. Again, we can say "Thank you" sincerely to IMDb.com.
