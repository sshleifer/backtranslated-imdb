I just watched all 6 episodes on the DVD. Great performances - no question. My actions are not enough for me. There is no doubt that the first-class character development has so many. There's nothing like Tinker Tailor in terms of "whodunnit". If you like a good story slowly and carefully, this is what you want. Peter Egan as the Magnus Pym leader is great. <br /> <br /> Movie This story shows the life of a traitor. The man who should be a faithful member of the British Intelligence Service, but who has been mentally damaged from an unhappy childhood until the deception becomes his way of life in everything As a child, he admired his father. But his father was revealed again and again as a crook and a male prisoner Pim betrayed not for ideology or money But because he wanted to deceive the person closest to him (wife, son, counselor), Pim suffered serious damage from the influence of his father - eating moral fiber He has no real love or loyalty in him. <br /> <br /> The heavy psychological things and small moments in the 6-hour series do very well, though.
