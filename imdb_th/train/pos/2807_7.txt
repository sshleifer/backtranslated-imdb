I caught the last half of the film in the cable one night and was impressed with its anomaly. Even when one of the two victims is the most deteriorated, the camera continues to move forward. The lingering image of the corpse was opened and his concentration camp was compressed into a handbag. Don't watch this movie if you're already happy. If so, you feel really good.
