This is the beginning of a new and interesting Star Trek series. It has a feeling "Down to earth" with a less gloomy and "overgrown" feeling. <br /> <br /> The characters have to spend more time developing, but have one potential that is quite disappointing (with all Star Trek series. Really) is that they show a depressing picture of equality between men and women in the future when they draw good positive images about everything (The world stopped the war, famine and others) <br /> <br /> The two female characters here are T'Pol, the rude boss and Hoshi, who are human. Hoshi is quite fragile and T'Pol was created. To be an "orphan" <br /> <br /> The attitude of some sailors feels a little too American. (Compared to the more international feelings of the TNG team) but creating interesting changes. <br /> <br /> Very good pilots, even though it's a very good series.
