Films directed by the best directors in the industry today This film cast some great actors in our era, not just from France. But from anywhere <br /> <br /> My favorite group: <br /> <br /> District 14: Carol (Margo Martindale) from Denver to Paris to learn French and understand life. <br /> <br /> Montmartre: Maybe not a better way to start creating this movie than this romantic Paris region. <Br /> <br /> Loin du 16ème: Portrait of Paris Which we know better since the riots in Cités Ana (Catalina Sandino Moreno) take care of other people's children <br /> <br /> Quartier Latin: Very fun to see Gérard Depardieu as "tenancier de bar" with Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara talking about divorce. <br /> <br /> Eiffel Tour: Don't tell me that you don't like mime! <br /> <br /> Tuileries: Healing to see Steve Buscemi as a tourist who is dealing with a girl in the subway. <br /> <br /> Parc Monceau: Nick Nolte is great. Ludivine Sagnier with <br /> <br /> I spent 3 days in Paris in 2004 and this movie made me want to go back! <br /> <br /> See in Barcelona (Another big city) at Verdi on 18 March 2007 <br /> <br /> 84/100 (***)
