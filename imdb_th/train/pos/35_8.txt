When I saw the exquisite DVD box for this and the terrifying red queen statue, I felt that I was in a big disappointment. But surprisingly surprised, I love it so much Of course, no complex nonsense and forgive that this complex storyline should be rushed to the point where it is hardly able to read the subtitles. These things are separated. However, this movie is a dream. A wonderful lady in a glamorous outfit in a wonderful atmosphere and everything throughout the journey and accompanied by a wonderful Bruno Nicolai score. He may not be Morricone but in this lighter piece he might be like that So much fun with so many colors, lots of sexy, blood-killing and minimal police intervention.
