I proposed this name and BABYLON 5 is the best TV sci-fi series. Both stand out in my mind because unlike the first version of the STAR TREK, the plot and character development are consistent if you watch the original STAR TREK and STAR TREK: TNG shows that it is a good program But there is no overall theme or plot that connects all episodes. In many ways, you will often watch the entire program without problems understanding what happened. This is a very rare case with DEEP SPACE 9 (with a big fight that lasts every season) and other TREK programs because there are bigger stories that are combined. This link seems to have been developed into a concept with BABYLON 5 and saw this at a much greater level with SG-1. The bottom line is that in many ways this is like a family look or a slow novel. Of course, there are some "not thrown" episodes that are not connected to the rest. But there are very few and between and often quite funny. <br /> <br /> And funny talking. I love SG-1. Keep the mood light from time to time and not terrible. In this way, I like it more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill is a great character with Homer's Simpson's satire and love - it's really terrible that he gradually fades from C. <br /> <br >> To truly appreciate the SG-1, you should look at it from the beginning and see how complicated the plan is. This link will help to show special powers. And if you don't like SG-1 after giving a fair chance, sci-fi may not be your type
