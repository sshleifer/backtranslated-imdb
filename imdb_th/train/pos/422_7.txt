"The Plainsman" refers to the power of Cecil B. DeMille that is not the most accurate and unreal. It set up a parallel conversion to not less than the environmental protagonist than Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln to interact. Is dead at the time the story takes place Every time, while DeMille floated near the dangerous truth But can easily divert attention to beautiful images and glitter This film is an attempt to sustain Custer's final stance with novels based on people's lives, which are works of art and mythology. Truly, this is the world according to DeMille - Zeitgeist in the record of entertainment. But is a beautiful campsite that meets today's standards. <br /> <br /> TRANSFER: Considering the oldness of this movie With clean white people and very hard blacks There are a number of movies in some scenes and there are no other moments. Overall, the image quality is quite inconsistent. But never bad or good at all Better than in the middle of the road The artifacts associated with that age are kept to a minimum and digital irregularities will not distract. The sound is mono. But it is very balanced. <br /> <br /> EXTRAS: Forget it. It's universal! LINE below: As a pseudo-image of this western celluloid, attractive and fun. Just bring the characters and stories with salt in some cases ?? The whole box seems more appropriate!
