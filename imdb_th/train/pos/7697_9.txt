This is another great movie that I was lucky to see for the first time on the big screen (thanks to Rick Baker and the band). Back in the late 80s I was a newcomer compared to the music genre and it was a story. New about the three great JC, SH & YB I'm not sure what to expect when I pay the hard earned money to see this thing in "Triple Bill of Classics" at Scala. Old I don't need to worry. I was left without fear of this movie. If you are a fan of Hong Kong Action / Kung Fu movies and have never seen this movie before, do it now!
