This is a great movie with good actors. They all hit the button on all the tanks and when Dianne Keaton is the best, she doesn't get better than that. But Tom Everett Scott is always underestimated. He should be a star. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is to use a screenplay in one aspect. There is no character who admits that the dead daughter is not always good. And not her mother, played by Keaton At one point, she promised that she made a character not revealing that he was sleeping. <br /> <br /> One critic said that the film had "Political agenda" That is a baffling thing to say. There is no politics in this movie.
