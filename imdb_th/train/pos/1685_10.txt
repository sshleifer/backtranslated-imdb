First saw this film in 1990 and died laughing through it. It became a favorite in my friend's circle and we will refer to the hat. ("I'm going home in the pocket!") Needing to speak humor is still there. 15 years later, it became a Halloween tradition to reveal many of my new friends to this movie. (The good thing you can still buy on Ebay!) I found that Halloween candy has a much better taste. This film gives everything that is suspicious, anxious, unrequited love, nobleman and the program. Royal Dano gives a wonderful heartbeat performance as an Old Man Wrenchmuller. I remember seeing him in "The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao" in As a bad person who has found a bad end Here you feel really old man from the beginning. <br /> <br /> If you're not careful, you'll miss some of the humor in this movie. The creator is truly delicate in many ways, with a unique view of the little series that dug in other sci-fi movies and even the scenes that ripped from Wile E. Coyote! <br /> <br /> Do not spend too The very thoughtful process that tries to analyze people movies - is fun without cost and should not be a violation to anyone. (May be a fool But they don't know that they are mocking ..) <br /> <br /> - Now, if you're going to apologize to me, I'll go to the bar 'Zag-nut' .... <br /> <br / > -Ramsay "RC" Cowlishaw DJ Karaoke / Singer
