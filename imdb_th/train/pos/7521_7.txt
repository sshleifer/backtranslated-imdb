I have a vague idea that Betty Page is partly due to her presence in Playboy's fun time. (Obviously, when she took a picture of her and the Santa hat, she didn't even know that it was right). The film was co-written and directed by Mary Harron, an American psychopath. Bel, a city in the southern part of the church, had a bad experience and left them behind to seek a better time in New York City, where she became a model and from there. She soon became a sense of undergroundity with slavery. The clear character (and "notorious" of the name) combined with her actress Gret Mall to convey her image and make this woman's soul good. As much as she can, which is a huge success of this film She is not a simple character, although sometimes her moral thoughts are suspicious. ("Adam and Eve were naked, didn't they?" She gave a few comments.) Obviously, the filmmakers left the life of the next year and went out with her during the redemption. <br /> <br /> Notrious Bettie is not much more than the general biographical format presented by the HBO film, although this time is strong in the launch of the documentary. The best scene that Harron caught was Page in her "suspicious" position, taking photos of her in the poses and starring in ridiculous movies of whips and chains and leather uniforms. This adds to the humor that is essential to the film of nature. It is not that the story behind it is not interesting, which is related to government investigations about the 'soot' that comes out of such photographs and underground magazines. But there is not much time to explore the more significant things with her face and complexity or her relationship with sex and the fifties. Everything looks perfectly black and white, and sometimes it seems that Harron is about to shoot some black and white photos. It is a view that can be viewed if you do not have too much knowledge about Bette Page and may be possible for fans as well.
