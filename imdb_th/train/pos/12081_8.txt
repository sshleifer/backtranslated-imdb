Nina Foch delivers surprisingly strong performance as the title character in the fun little biter nailer game. She accepts the position of Secretary of the London Society (played by May May Witty) and her creepy son. (The weak and annoying George Macready) Before she realized that she woke up to find herself in a seaside mansion she had never seen before, Witty and Macready were calling her, Marian, and trying to convince. Servants and nearby towns where she is Macready's wife. Of course, this couple can plan a formidable act, and even though we know that Julia must eventually escape her trap, director Joseph Le wis creates a real suspicion in answering the question of how you can deal with it. <br /> <br /> "My name is Julia Ross." There is nothing to separate it from every movie that comes out during the period. Same time But I was surprised that it was held together even though the shoe line and blood line B-movie. There was a relatively short time that could make you sit at the edge of your seat and I found myself rooted in Julia. Truly, as she entered the under-ground project and began to take over her captors In the other gothic thriller, the heroine is a faint, screaming screaming and sad, waiting for her hero to help her. So I can't tell you that being the heroine in this film is refreshing, using her brain and thinking of how to help herself. <br /> <br /> Well done. <br /> <br /> Grade : B +
