For movies with low prices, this is really good. I put this thing above your average B-movie action. Sean and Corinne presented it in this movie and they're not shy about the camera. Watch out for Jeanne and Jared's pendant. I don't think manufacturers will even consider But the runners who deserve it <br /> <br /> I'll be waiting to be more involved in Sean and Corin in the movie entertainment industry. The character of Sean looks very authentic and Corinne's sexy character is quite frozen and to the point. She connects well with action scenes and performs with confidence. It is a good idea to select Billy Zane as a clever and resourceful villain. His talent on the screen is always happy to see the chemistry between Zane and Sean's character. The action sequence is not wonderful and appears to be interconnected throughout the movie. Of course there are bugs. But it comes with the land. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a good movie considering the budget and the fact that it was made for TV. Sean and Corinne worked well because they were new players. In the game, I hope Jeanne, Jared and the next remaining actor will be given the opportunity to participate in entertainment. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: *** / ****
