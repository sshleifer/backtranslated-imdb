Bonanza has many great actors, Lorne Greene, Pernell Whitaker, Michael Landon, Dan Blocker and even Guy Williams (a cousin who was brought in many episodes during 1964 to replace Adam when he left the series). The show has chemistry and they seem to be truly the same. That makes their weakest stories work better than they should be. It also makes many of their best stories become great Western plays. <br /> <br /> Like any program that has been filmed for more than thirty episodes each season. However, most times, each episode has an interesting story, some conflicts and corrections that often do not include violence. While Bonanza was western, the fight never featured as a main attraction. While I'm a fan of The Rifleman and Wanted: Dead Or Alive; Those items often end with a gunfight. Gunfights are Westerners who resolve conflicts every time and Bonanza is very different in trying to find a peaceful and harmonious solution instead of killing. <br /> <br /> During the early years of Bonanza, there were some interesting episodes. A lot of boxing Those episodes stood opposite the rest of the series. But it was quite good in itself in 1964 when Pernell Whitaker wanted to leave Guy Williams to be replaced. Williams is playing the role of a long lost cousin. Unfortunately, Whitaker decided to stay for another year and Williams wrote out of the series when he moved to marry Adam's ex-boyfriend. If Williams remained during Bonanza's time, one could wonder if the series would be much better in the years after 1965 when Pernell Whitaker left the show. <br /> <br /> Don't have to. Wondering when Pernell Whitaker left this series, focusing on jokes and other countries, Whitaker often played heavily in many episodes and his departure was void in the selection. Little Joe wants to play as a good boy and Hoss wants to play a good boy with a heart of gold. Since Ben is a kind and wise master of the family, there is not enough room for any gunfire. <br /> <br /> Sometimes they hire a ranch named Candy (David Canary). Became the fourth member of the cast of the actors, but Candy never featured in any boxing, and he barely had more than a year or two older Joe Little Joe. They also gave Ben a cousin at Lost Another (Jamie played by Mitch Vogel) who is a teenager who often has problems with someone. <br /> <br /> Obviously With the addition of teenagers, studios want to attract younger audiences. It also gives writers the opportunity to write episodes about teenage problems, alcohol, misconduct, etc. The types of sermons are popular in the 1960s, which is the reaction of the media. The establishment of the anti-cultural movement Dragnet seems to be. The most popular law source and order TV. Although Hawaii 5-0, The FBI and many other programs are trying to jump on the ban dwagon by doing a TV show with irresponsible teenagers causing damage, physical abuse and crime. <br /> <br /> Adding teenagers to actors makes Cartwrights more likely to show. Fix and solve problems But those episodes felt a lot of planning and were generally not very good after the Dead Blocker. The series was hobbled for another year before being canceled or The past season is not good because Little Joe keeps track of the wife's murderers and most episodes are depressing because Little Joe often drinks or remembers how much he loves his wife and is not fair. She is killed. <br /> I don't think I will ever see the last episode of the series, and I wonder if they've ever officially wrapped it up. Last year, only Ben (Lorne Green) actually lived on Ponderosa while Adam moved away. (And never returned even once as a guest) and Hoss died and Little Joe from his wife, the series) was killed by a homeless person. <br /> <br /> By combining the era in 1959-1965 is the best in this series. When Adam departed, it gradually decreased. Most of the programs before the 1970s were quite good as well. In the 1970s, the series tried hard to be hip and specific songs, and it lost a lot of western flavors. Adding Candy and teenage boys made the quality of Show less and death of Hoss (Dan Blocker) is the final nail. Bonanza is probably the best western series ever, and in the production of 465 episodes, at least one hundred people are great Western dramas! That's a fairly good statistic. Even the worst bonanza is much better than other TV programs.
