Elmerfuddled laughing while leaning on a comfortable chair and reading a comic book. His dog slept comfortably near the front of the fireplace. Everything was peaceful until the punch bounced off (Flea was dressed in a peasant costume with large wide-brimmed hats and carrying a bag with the name "A. Punch"). He picked up the telescope and saw the dog (We saw the big shock of the dog and the flea punch with excitement, shouting "T-bone!" Then he sang. "There is food around the corner; There is food around the corner! ") <br /> <br /> That's the story of a cute punch. But nasty that tortured this poor dog Stupid as hilarious as he responds to fleas Once, this is probably the most fun dog I've ever seen in a cartoon! The poor dog is threatened by a shower so he doesn't respond when a stupid punch causes him to suffer. It was almost painful when he saw that fleas used pickaxes, jackhammers and dogs. He put the firecrackers behind the dog. It was cruel!
