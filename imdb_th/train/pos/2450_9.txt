I watched this program since the age of 14. And I like it a lot. I like this show because it's funny! You will enjoy this show a lot because it shows new and fun things every day, and my favorite part is when Benny has her latest opinion on George, always after every time about his fat giant head. With friends at home, it's like we are watching comedy movies, but the love story George Lopez is funny, talented, funny, exciting. This is a funny series for everyone and you will enjoy It - I do! And if you haven't watched it, I suggest you start watching because you don't want to stop watching. Although there are no new episodes anymore But I still enjoy running again, still funny, not wearing <br /> <br /> 9/10
