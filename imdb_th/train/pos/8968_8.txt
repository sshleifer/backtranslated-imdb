This movie is like Jimmy Stewart. All things are witty, charming and fun. Kim Novak's performance as Gillian, a beautiful witch who wishes to be a human is a wonderful, subtle expression of She every move She left us with her every word. I shouldn't talk about the admirable performances of Ernie Kovacs and Elsa Lanchester as a writer who has a passion for the magic world (Kovacs) and later a lovely aunt. Seems to stop using magic, even being banned from the romantic scene between Stewart and Novak, doing beautifully and chemistry between them is great But then again, when the chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and the top ladies was bad!
