This film is good for what it is and unpretentious; Anyway, I won't watch it twice: I am Peter Cushing's master and that's why I watched it. The best assets of this movie are: BREVITY and EFFECTIVENESS When compared to other similar movies, it will not drag their feet forever, since each of the four segments (plus one) will take no more than 30 minutes and under 10 seconds in the first part. 'Writer's Blog' will move to a quiet old home to find inspiration. He found it too much when he began to see a madman wearing one. An artificial plot similar to PREMATURE BURIAL takes advantage of a twisted perspective: being a mentally ill writer ... or (as a trilogy) his trophy wife needs her lover to play along with her husband's phobias.

This part still lacks the strength of the first two. <br /> <br /> The performance is fair, with 2 groups starting to make a group. Good movie taken with one salt Not the best mattress or Lee ... but worth watching
