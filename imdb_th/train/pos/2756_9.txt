I chose this movie based on a summary of the story and the criticism on the back of the box. I'm not big in foreign movies and don't know what to expect. I don't really care about the subtitles. But I really like it! It has simple and cute qualities that make you feel good about life. I found myself laughing loudly over and over again. I want to recommend this picture to everyone, even those who hate foreign movies with subtitles. This makes it worth the effort.
