At first sight, those who sing there seem to be ridiculous and wonderful jokes ?? With unusual movements, quiet and slow only: wrong! <br /> <br /> Start with two singers in the desert landscape, then the bus and the great actors hide the gems! <br /> <br /> The story that is folded and the wrong rhythm makes you To think yes, it's a cartoon But just letting you guess that it will be a gentle movie. <br /> <br /> Not at all: very funny by insulting others immediately. Development makes you surprised throughout the story ?? Presenting wisely and wisely, all the characters are important and the actors give them a perfect life. <br /> <br /> And what a surprise it is based on the deep observation of the top camera controls. Great and meaningful And everything really. The general direction and presentation details make you forget that it's a movie: it's like watching a human society that is kind. You don't know how to shoot by friends behind the camera. <br /> <br /> and You are behind him. It's easy and wonderful. <br /> <br /> Don't understand me wrong. Whether it means script, image quality, music score, no skill at all! It's a great art! <br /> <br /> Because it flows like a river, right? From the top of the mountain to the sea, along with the different areas and origins in which the true river will face travel to the sea? From small things to the mainstream. <br /> <br /> The metaphor I use is the best way I can find to describe all the charms with Who's Singing Over. For me again, I took a hammer: excellent. Just ... <br /> <br /> I've seen that the director is the person who makes Chat Blanc / Chat Noir, which I know it's quiet, famous ?? But while I still don't see it, I have no idea about this gentleman. <br /> <br /> Other critics wrote Ditham Kamil's comments on that movie. I strongly agree! <br /> <br /> Eastern European cinema Don't know because it's not translated But I was lucky to have this example in the original language with good English subtitles. Conclusion: Delicious and special ... <br /> <br /> For fast and empty explosion types and effects. Special incentives avoid any costs. It may be subtle and too good for you! <br /> <br /> But if you are interested in different styles of music and / or classics, I guess you will not regret this and if you buy it, it will have a good friendship in your personal DVD library. You Than the big name that deserves Billy Wilder, Lubitsch or Sacha Guitry among my favorite directors At least for this movie! <br /> <br /> *** This movie was never good, unless the camera was the eyes of the poet Orson Welles ***
