One of the most beautiful films that attracts us to the end soon! Than looking at the screen like "No, they don't!" Haha. Good performances all over! The performance was great with Emily Blunt. Great! I know that she will provide a stable and attractive performance for Victoria's youth, emotion and vulnerability throughout the story. In addition, production is outstanding in all aspects: style, substance and sensitivity. A breathtaking glimpse of the remarkable moments in Britian's history tells through a personal history and touch of the school-age princess until her reign as Queen. The birth of the first nine children It has well-written script and flawless editing. Rupert Friend is patient and sympathetic to Prince Albert, who wins the queen's attention less than keeping her love in front of Lord Melbourne. (Paul Bettani) The relationship between the teenage Victoria and her mother, who is sometimes angry with her mother and King William. (Which does not like her mother too) performances and scenes are highly attractive In that era, and of course, anyone who loves interesting true love stories
