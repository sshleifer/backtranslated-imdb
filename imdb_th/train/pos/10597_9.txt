I would like to see pictures that try different things. Many movies seem to bring back old ideas, which is a big reason I recommend Passport to Pimlico. <br /> <br /> The film is set after WW2 and the shortage of war and rationing To drive a London car "barmy", this movie is located in a small neighborhood in London called Pimlico. They are also sick that can't buy what they want. But can't find a solution Until they accidentally found hidden treasures and official chartered names that were sovereign nations hundreds of years ago! With this document, they reasoned that they could avoid all the allocations and coupons and live the life they wanted because it turned out that they were not British! Where the movie goes from there and how to fix the crisis in the end is what you have to see for yourself Leave it with Ealing Studios' great ideas to find this gem!
