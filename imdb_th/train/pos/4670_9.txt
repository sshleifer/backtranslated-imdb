Those who remember only Peter Peter Ustinov's spies as Hercule Poirot or professional raconteur would do well in the search for the late 60s. This charming star, Ustinov, was convicted of embezzlement (First of all we will see him during his last day in the prison where he is preparing a tax return for the governor of the prison.) Who feels that the future is in the computer post? Computer expert and determined to infiltrate American multinational companies. <br /> <br /> Ustinov (co-writer) is in the same form as Maggie Smith. Pleasant - Dolly Sparrow Bob Newhart also has an amusing work as a suspicious executive designed for Maggie Smith. In addition, Carl Malden is also an ugly, satisfying person as the woman's head. Ustinov and Newhart <br /> <br /> What do I like about this movie? Not only is the movie a good jump But also an impressive love story. Ustinov and Smith have a lot of confidence because of two mistakes that cause love. (All scenes related to the card deck are particularly effective.) <br /> <br /> So what's not to like? The script doesn't have more computer knowledge than most movies. (That is almost all things) Although it gives a sense of business computing at the end of the 1960s, the 'big iron' is quite good. There are also a few small plot flaws that you shouldn't notice. Until the second or third time viewing But I think this is a minor issue. <br /> <br /> As I said It is worth finding and after you see it when you want to see it again at regular intervals. <br /> <br />
