I think I should qualify my position after reading other reviews. This movie is not good. But it has many wonderful elements Various lighting and scenes with the camera can work very well. The story is slow and weak. But not bad, than you can find in the SyFy channel Most guesses are still fun. Women are attractive enough, and the leading actors can do well to be thoughtful. Breathtaking clean movies for modern movies and violence suitable for children aged 13 years and over. There is no sex scene. I give 7 out of 10 and I think it's fair. I will watch again if I have nothing to do better. Angels that make gay voices are the most annoying part of this movie.
