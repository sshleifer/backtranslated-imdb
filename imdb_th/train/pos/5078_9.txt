This one is outstanding because it is an initiative. I'm tired of watching Hindi movies which are hotpot movies, Hollywood movies and Brit. Some bugs are unavoidable. However, this movie is a must see. Surya shows the police that are clean and correct according to the principles. He came a long way from his job at Nerukku Ner. I like movies so much that I have to be the owner. I usually do not live in an illogical type of violence. In any way, I really feel each character. I do not appreciate the melodrama and sentimental scenes that are hand in hand with most Hindi and Tamil movies. I like this movie a lot because it lacks the same. ACP Anbuselvan's reaction to losing his wife is not over-doing as a heart attack. There are times when I watch movies when I want to press the FF button many times. I want to do that at the cinema. Never wanted to do that when watching this movie I really hope that Ghajini will be published soon.
