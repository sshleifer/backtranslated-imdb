Classic cult is almost impossible to predict. Who would have guessed that Vision Quest, Fight Club and 2001: A Space Oddysey, the movie that was criticized by critics and audiences alike when released, would become very popular. I think I am a movie expert. Which is different from most people who hate Envy (evidence from horror 4.4 points) The conversation is not wise. The scene has little continuity and the script seems to be written by four elementary students. But that's why this movie is so hilarious You see, in order to appreciate Envy's unintended genius, you must enjoy movies from a separate perspective. <br /> <br /> Why do I love Envy? Because this movie is not good to the point that it is good This is a recipe for cult classics and Envy is definitely suitable for the bill.
