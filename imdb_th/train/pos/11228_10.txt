This is short and to the point. Writing the story used for Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is surprisingly good. The show is all over the map. But the main characters over the years have seemed to work to improve their skills. It is difficult to believe that this series will last for almost 7 years and will end in mid-May 2007. <br /> <br /> I will not make any improvements to the scenes and graphics. Considering that this is a volunteer, all without profit, it is quite amazing. <br /> <br /> If this is rated as a professional manufacturer, I have to give 5 good things but the scene is terrible However, as a television producer, I have to give a great score as well as exempting a few other attempts. This is my own league. For the actual amount, I don't think this has been matched. Congratulations to the actors and the team for the efforts that many people appreciate.
