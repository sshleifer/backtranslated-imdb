Written by a writer who wrote the great Murder Rooms, which recorded the adventures of ACD and Doctor Joseph Bell. I waited for this and I was not disappointed. It is quite slow, with the emphasis on Doyle's frustration at Sherlock Holmes, which is very accurate and excellent. It is a very interesting character study and can be taken very well. (In an unusual digital video for a period of time) The performance was excellent, especially Tim McInnery and Brian Cox, although the actors who showed the ACD, whose name I didn't remember, did not make me impressed. An excellent character education, which has the same amount as the general case of Sherlock Holmes. Try this if you have a chance.
