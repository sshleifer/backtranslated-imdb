Another demonstration of Kurosawa's genius. His first film was a look into the tragic life of the Tokyo slum, who lived in the main slum, which is a combination of vignettes, paintings. Many groups reflect life. This film shows how people deal with the worst life in their own way, most of them retreating into themselves and living. In the world of the imagination of his own head, withdrawing emotions from those around you or drowning in alcohol, combining the realism of the kitchen with Kabuki-esk plays, Kuroza's toys are proficient in emotions. The audience draws tears and laughter with equal agility. Great experience and drainage
