I look forward to seeing this from the first time I saw it in her work list. Finally, it was found that yesterday 2/13/02 on the movie channel for life. <br /> <br /> Jim Larson's comments about this story are "The funny story of the two people who are blocking the way" is dead. Writers may not be able to get a bonus. Everyone who makes this movie /> <br /> Natasha's screen looks so warm and Your smile, the electrician, is so strong that he doesn't say anything about her beauty that whatever she is in my favorites. Her TV interviews and publications that I have seen are refreshing and worth looking at. <br /> <br /> May God protect you, your family and your future efforts. <br /> <br /> This movie is not Seems to be available on DVDs or videos But I will be the first person to buy it, and I think other people too.
