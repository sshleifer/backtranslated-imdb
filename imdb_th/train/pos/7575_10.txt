Resident Evil: code veronica is a well-made video game with excellent graphics, comfortable controls, great storyline and high fun factor. The story of this story is Claire Redfield being taken to the island to invade the indoor space. The damage to the main lab while looking for her brother, Veronica's graphics is excellent, the lights and rain effects look good. The controls are comfortable. But the button layout is not suitable for controlling the dreamcasts to.Its still enjoy some surprising places. Shoot the zombies out. Code: veronica also has a little "Romance" between the two main characters. Play as Chris Redfield from Resident Evil 1. The sound of this game is better than before, although I hate the new feature when the giant spider crawls. They will create annoying noise and gunshots with more realism. Excellent graphics. Comfortable control story and stic sound truth make Resident Evil Code: Veronica absolutely beloved. I gave 10 out of 10 items.
