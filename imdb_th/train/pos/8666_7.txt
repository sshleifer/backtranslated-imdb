Frankie Dio (Lee VanCleef) is a high-ranking gangster who turns himself into a police or illegal gambling. (For reasons that are not clear to me) Tony Lo Bianco is a low-level gangster who frequented the pool and spent his free time envying Frankie. By being in the right place at the right time, Tony is caught with Frankie and sent to prison ... where they cause a bond that may not be friends.> This film Came to me under the name "Frank and Tony" which was disappointing because I saw another name, "Mean Frank and Crazy Tony", which would help sell movies more efficiently I think it is a respect for "Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry" but what can I know? I watched it after another Italian crime movie. "Violence expert" and I must say that both help each other well. <br /> <br /> The Italians tend to lag behind Americans in their budget and production value. The real shame of this film It was considered a "grindhouse" movie that was unfairly demoted to the movie b (or worse) with clean sound and images. I might wonder if Hollywood hits. I found a very interesting story. The characters (and actors) are better than average and not the same. "Violent expert" The plot is quite clear - not too many secondary characters. <br /> <br /> If you like movies or mafia crime. Movies you should try A movie about a mob that is actually from Italy (you need a lot of genuine stuff) as much as you can ask. Of course not "The Godfather", but it shouldn't be. This is not a drama. But is a light action comedy ... like "Die Hard With a Vengeance" from the point of view of the bad guys Okay, not true. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, this movie makes me want to watch other movies from the main director and actor. Movies in addition to "Escape From New York" (which VanCleef plays as "Hauk") and general cult movies What is more fun than discovering the lost classic?
