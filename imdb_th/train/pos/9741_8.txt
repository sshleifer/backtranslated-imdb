I was very surprised to find out how to lose friends and people who were far away from being close to the 'Mao' comedy show because the trailer made me expect. I quickly absorbed the story and continued to be obsessed with the matter. I think the walk of comedic content is more visible. (I mean, I get the impression that I have seen Pegg's efforts in restoring lost control greatly. 'In real time' to speak) at other times, there are times when allowing to share the protagonist How events affect them and what leads them to the point where they find themselves. All characters have been carefully selected, some interesting and own, and generally quite satisfactory. (Any merciless ambition that appears to tend to be tempered by flexibility that has good habits that are consistent). Fun movies, clever scripts, smartly directed.
