This film has excellent performances, excellent photography and a very strong story that makes you think of who you are. . There are already wonderful comments about these issues. I want to comment on the official setting of this film. Basically it was two people on the roof. There is a unity of place and time, with two protagonists and a radio acting as a choir. Many directors changed the Greek tragedy into a movie. Many directors filmed contemporary stories as if they were a Greek tragedy. But in my opinion, none of the directors succeeded as admirable as Ettore Scola in approaching purity. In official stories and settings Masterpiece.
