The French Naudet brothers do things that no one else has done. They have a video camera on the day of this tragedy. They are in the building # 2. When you see the paper drifting down, people hit the ground from a jump from high. <br /> <br /> I mean, it goes as far as the two buildings break. They run. The camera still works. When the white dust covered them, they found the shop door and went inside. But all these images are real, and I think they do a great job in shooting for us. <br /> <br /> Ten stars to the Naudet brothers who filmed a special movie that I watch every time. 9/11, so I will never forget what this country has passed I believe that if I remember correctly, it showed the first death of a fireman's priest, as he was taken to the church and his noble funeral.
