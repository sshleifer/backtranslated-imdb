The whole point of creating this film, which is one of the fastest and best international releases of opera theaters, is to make it more accessible to the masses. And it was successful in doing so The general public will not remain silent for the love story about two exotic couples in ancient Egypt, if shown by 300 pounds over the age of 40, and the soprano vocalist with the appropriate singing vocals Therefore, the replacement of the beautiful principal (Loren, Della Marra, handsome and Mrs. Maxwell, who is flowing) makes this story more reliable, making those unfamiliar with the story or song have a better chance. Arya cute that may not be like that. Altogether, charmingly introduced to one of Verdi's great works. I remember seeing this when I was in high school and it made me interested in opera, which was a style that I was not familiar with. I still consider this movie with love and would like to introduce strongly to those who might appreciate the great music, with better images. On average, Luciano Della Marra stands out as Radames and unfortunately the audience is not. Have appeared in other movies
