Gunga Din (1939) is based on the poem by Rudyard Kipling. The film is directed by George Stevens. This film was created in India in the 19th century in which three British soldiers stopped the evil leaders and murder. Gunga Din was an adventure war. Great Comedian with many exciting moments. Three great men visited Grant. Sgt.Archibald Cutter, Victor McLaglen is Sgt.'Mac 'MacChesney and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (the legendary son you know someone) is SgtThomas Ballantine. Don't forget other good players including Sam Jaffe who also play Gunga Din. The wonderful way Joan Fontaine is beautiful and talented is Emaline Stebbins. It's very fun to see the difficulties of Tommy's and Emmy's wedding plans. It's very fun. It's exciting. It's everything a good movie needs.
