Let's face each other: The final season (# 8) is one of the worst seasons in any program I've ever enjoyed. (Mostly I have never encountered dry spells throughout the season.) But if you judge this item last season, it will definitely be worse. That is an unjustified assessment of all - because "acting in the 70s" in those days was a great and hilarious sitcom about the past and the people who lived there were no different from what we were here in. Today's <br /> <br /> Don't worry ... Don't care. Season 8 <br /> <br /> Top Grace stars as Eric Forman, a teenager with him. Donna's long love (Laura Prepon), feminist, next door Performed as their friends, Danny Masterson (Hyde), Mila Kunis (Jackie), Wilmer Valderrama (Fez) and even Ashton Kutcher (Kelso) giving great performances in almost every episode. The best students should be the foreign exchange students who have the most psychological consciousness. He came from what country? Think about it! Another dimension of entertainment, Debra Joe Rupp and Kurt Wood Smith, is phenomenal as Eric's parents. Rupp, as Kitty, has both formidable and captivating, similar to that of Mrs. Brady. Meet Marie Baron, while Smith Reid is primarily to make everyone afraid of dogs. Don Stark and Tanya Roberts play very well each other, while Donna's parents Bob is a stubborn person. But cute and Mommy, the radical Tommy Chong, has appeared from time to time as Leo Stoner who serves as father to Hyde. <br /> <br /> In addition to the unusual mistakes that appear Often and excellent lessons that sometimes happen (and the last season that is miserable) "70s" is a great program with amazing writing, direct directions and good feelings. They are okay
