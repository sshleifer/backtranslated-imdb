The trio of sisters who are looking for a place in the sun. This story may become a biographical story of many young artists who want things that can happen when things happen too quickly and the role models can't help. <br /> <br /> Songs The miracle written and composed by Aretha Franklin and Curtis Mayfield.

When you set goals to get your ideal opportunity as you participate in society, <br /> <br /> This film may create ideas for creating "Dreamgirls" on Broadway and Mariah Carey's "Glitter". 25 years later, as the original audience of the two productions, I saw many similarities in "Sparkle" as in "Saturday Night Fever," "Fame," "Flashdance" and the attack from Broadway "My mother wants to sing"
