The military is not a great movie and everyone who hates it has many reasons. But I like soldiers very much, partly because my expectations are so low that what I see makes me wonder. <br /> <br /> First, the art direction is tight and well executed As far as the backdrop of science fiction progresses, soldiers are doing things by designing more than 90% of all types of costumes and props, consistent and performing effectively. I do not love their future military style. But I was impressed by the effort For me, this makes the movie worth the time it takes to watch. <br /> <br /> Second, I'm a Kirk Russell fan. I grew up watching this guy in my most memorable movie of my youth ... Barefoot's executive and John Carpenter's movie is a major action movie and the role of Sergeant Todd is Important action hero It's not an award-winning chapter, but Kurt gathers a convincing mood with a little conversation. <br /> <br /> Third, the fighting and fighting scenes are well designed. This is not an iron monkey or even a matrix. But it is far more than the average quality in the form. <br /> <br /> If you don't see it and you like sci-fi Action movie, pick it up if you go through the rental warehouse of your choice. Don't expect Bladerunner to continue
