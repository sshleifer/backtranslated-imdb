The two of me and my sister watched the three sets of Tenko and admitted that this was one of the better BBC series. The actors were very confident in the role they played and although the 3rd series would Rather slower Similarly, without it, no doubt that we will watch again because it is a series that I never bored to watch. Great viewing and full BBC scores for the best series and selection. First in every department And would like to recommend this series to everyone, although some people have to consider the age limit due to some content of adults. Therefore, thanks to the BBC for releasing this series on DVD and video
