I like this movie a lot because I have a husband like a man in this movie. This film about Lindsay, who met Ben in the middle of the winter when the baseball season didn't exist, she fell in love. But when spring arrived, she received the shock of her life, putting her on. <br /> <br /> It's a funny movie with a passion for baseball that Ben has. He can't be separated from what he loves the most. That is what makes it so funny and why many women are involved in Lindsey. In real life, the person he sits in the baseball game is still obsessed <br /> It's a funny movie and you won't be stunned if you rent here.
