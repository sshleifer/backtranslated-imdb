This is a movie that the main market is not accessible because it does not make the audience easy to see. A story about a spike that has a problem and his friend Heaton is not a Friday night movie. But it is unique and I find it fun There was a moment of brightness because this film was filmed in a low budget, such as when Spike inhaled the aerosol. However, I didn't understand the relationship between Spike and Heatton, and in fact it made me spend most of the movies trying. Will do it And I don't like the fact that most of the movies spend time with the two friends who talk and don't have much "action". It's a small movie that is complicated to watch and that Is what makes it interesting
