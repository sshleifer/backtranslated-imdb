I like this item a lot. That is why I was disappointed to learn recently that George Lopez was a class and he dismissed Masiela Lusha from the performance just because he discovered that she was not a Latin immigrant. But was an immigrant from Albania I learned this from people in the list. She is one of the best parts of the show and for this reason, to learn that even among people you think are sensitive to racism, they can still hate someone just because the country they were born to. Come true Disappointing I like this item a lot.
