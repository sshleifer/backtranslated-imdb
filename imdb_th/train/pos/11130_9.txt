Jon Voight is great in the Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, though, makes him think of Rainman in the later episodes, but it's a show that makes me watch movies. As the image of the characters in New York, there was only Daniel Day Lewis's drawing about Bill Butcher in the New York gang that came close to each other and that day did not show the deep emotion that Horowitz had. <br /> <br /> It's a normal thing for Hoffman's performance at the actors that we most often identify with. Midnight Cowboy is Voight. I think Hoffman. Is one of the best 4 or 5 actors in history The film's role is to show people around him in the way that they raise their performances to a higher level. <br /> <br /> Voight's buck is so innocent that he must float out of the movie. Aside, except that Ratso pulled him down - pulled him down, but taught him about how to survive and, more importantly, How to live <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself. I think as a movie that it is, it has a very beautiful message, no matter how much you lose (Ratso defines "losers") if you can find a way to be true to yourself. You are in possession of the secrets of life and you may share that understanding with others. <br /> <br /> I can't help comparing the Midnight Cowboy and Klute from a few years later, which I think is. Like a movie about finding yourself that became a movie about escape
