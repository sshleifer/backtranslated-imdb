Oops, ancient thought They are the main part of a variety of horror movies. This film has a lot. The film is still Stephen King, one of the best horror movies. This movie is very good, just guessing too much. And what horror movies are not stupid? This one is packed with victims of mental retardation, just asking their lives to be caught.
