Wow, I can't believe that I will wait to watch this movie for a long time. I never go around to see it. The story has nothing I am interested in. I don't know anything about football (football). I am one of the stupid Americans who have no clue. I have never seen David Beckham before in this movie. I chose to ignore the rumors surrounding this film at the time of the show in America. Enough about me, <br /> <br /> Tell the truth, it's a mistake to ignore this heaven of filmmaking. Is a fun movie It is full of colors and abundance. I smile wide on my face throughout the movie. Parminder Nagra is so cute and cute. You can't help but take root instead of you. No wonder why America's television program has grabbed her up. I have a new gratitude for Indian culture. Those people know how to have a good time. The wedding scene is beautiful. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have is decoding English slang and conversations through accents. I opened the English subtitles to make sure I didn't miss anything. (This is not a movie criticism!) I'm sure that audiences around the world have trouble understanding the slang that is constantly changing in American movies. <br /> <br /> This is the perfect movie. It has a great sports plot like Rocky and a strong sense of femininity that empowers women. I watched with my wife and sixteen year old niece and we all like it. I highly recommend
