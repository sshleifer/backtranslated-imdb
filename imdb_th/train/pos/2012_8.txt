This is one of my all-time favorites. Great music and a bit funny. I laughed every time that Milly, a woman who pretended to be an insult, held her dainty towel while talking and polished the furniture carefully while she talked. I couldn't pass her French accent, never having a problem because they tried to send her to be the daughter of the boss. <br /> <br /> Seeing Mel Meles, the teenager and the singing of Frank Sinatra at age Still very little My mother saw Frank Sinatra at the cinema at the same time that the movie came out. She said that they couldn't clear "Bobby-Soccer" during the movie. (In those days, you didn't have to leave the show.) This film shows you that Frank is attractive and attractive and helps you admire his special abilities as well. And Victor Borge has a routine. A day that is a bonus <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie that has a sweet and simple story. Very fun.
