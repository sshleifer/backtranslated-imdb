"Dance, Fools, Dance" is a Crawford-Gable vehicle. From 1931, Crawford played the role of Bonnie Jordan, a wealthy young woman whose life consisted of various parties. All of this ended when her father died and left her and her brother (William Blakewell) exhausted. Bonnie worked in a newspaper using the name Mary Smith; Her brother went to work for the head of the bandit, Jake Luva - played by Clark Gable while he played another person. Later, he will definitely become a romantic hero. But in the early 1930s MGM used him as a bad guy. Didn't know that her brother had been involved in illegal activities. Bonnie together with Luke <br /> <br /> Gables and Crawford built a great team. Her facial expressions look a little in the forest. But her dance is something that makes the movie fun. Look for Cliff Edwards. The voice of Jiminy Cricket as Bert. <br /> <br /> It's always interesting to watch precode movies and "Dance, Fools Dance "too
