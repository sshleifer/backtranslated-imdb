This is one of the favorite movies of all time. The character of Parker Posey is a great entertainment and the librarian's norms are not lost to anyone who has worked in books and the world stack. You are a student of this library. Then buy a poster and hang it on your wall. The soundtrack is highly recommended as well. I have shown this movie to my library friends more than others - they all fell in love with it.
