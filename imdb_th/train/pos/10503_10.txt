When I got the N64 for the first time when I was five or six years old, I fell in love with my first game, Super Mario 64 and I loved it. The graphics are great for time, good plans and better courses. All the best songs I heard in the Nintendo game <br /> <br /> I can't remember the complete plot. But I think Princess Peach was kidnapped by Bowser and Mario must rescue her. The game is to get 120 stars from the curse in each castle. There are about five or six challenges to get a star. There are parts of the castle where you can get more stars. Sure, you win Bowser. * I think there are three levels. To defeat Bowser *, start with the character Mario as the main character and receive useful advice from the toad, so he is one of your only allies. I heard that Luigi and Yoshi In the game at the end, the main villain is Bowser and there are other characters like Boo and Goomba. The characters are really great. <br /> <br /> Next, people say that Gameplay is more important than graphics and I Completely agree But he has a great plot with excellent graphics, especially at that time. I have other Nintendo games like 007 and their graphics. Compared to Super Mario, bright colors, great effects and great sound effects, I found the graphics in the stream very good, next to Bowser world world. It has the best graphics in the game. <br /> <br /> Now, this song is the part that I like most of the game. Growing up when I played this game at an early age, I am willing to leave the game all night, so the music will make me sleep, especially the music from Jolly Roger. Bay And excellent. There are other people who are excellent too, especially in the world where Bowser is the most addicted to me and my favorite. <br /> <br /> This game is my favorite time. As a developing gamer and I like this game, this game has been 10/10 or ***** (5) / ***** (5) to play the game!
