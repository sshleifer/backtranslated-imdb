An invisible man is a show that everyone must love! It reminds me of the old school's 80s series (a-team, airwolf, knightrider). Special techniques are small. But very effective !! But the most important thing is the fun that they shoot in this scene. It really shows! All actors fit perfectly in the script, and it looks like they can do what they want !! Especially Paul Ben Victor and Vincent Ventresca Ventresca really illuminate here! For me, it is unbelievable that the actor who has a very sarcastic act is his acting style not filmed in the big movie. (Mr. Tarantino, this is the item you should direct! Show that you can be worth it !!!
