Eytan Fox does it again: move the hearts of the audience in an untidy story The film also succeeded in explaining the incredible atmosphere of the city like Tel Aviv perfectly and thoroughly. <br /> <br /> I was there last month and it was there: Way. Life, relationships, heart, beatings, chaos, utopian encouragement in megalopolis, full of minds, blurred and forgotten. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended: it As Getting to the heart and mind, with a view to appealing. The conflict between Israel and Palestine. <br /> <br /> Nota Bene: There is a gay plot centered on movies. If you don't think you are gay-friendly, be prepared to be challenged and eventually see it as "just love" (and don't worry: the chick is too hot!)
