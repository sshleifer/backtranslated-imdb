I love this movie! I'm a true Tom Hanks fan and I've always been impressed with his work. From his most notable roles, such as Cast Away, The Green Mile, Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, Apollo 13 & Philadelphia for his hilarious roles, such as A League of the Own, Turner and Hooch, Catch Me If You Can, The Lady Killers, Toy Story & Big, but in this movie, Hanks is not the only great actor to open the Tyler Hoechlin screen. A hot star that shows great promise in Hollywood stars. Wood, as Hank's son, and gave a great performance Of course, he was the one who had to be careful of his career. I believe he would do good things. Paul Newman always gave great performance on the screen. He is truly a legend. We cannot forget those who do not play a role in the movie. But still helps to improve Jennifer Jason Leigh, a beautiful and very talented actor in the Bastard Out of Carolina and the only white woman I will never forget, brings her elegance to the screen as Hank's wife in the movie. Liam Aiken is a treasure found in movies. He did such a great job with a small role and liked his role in Lemony Snickets and Sweet November and I dreamed of Africa. He gave a great performance.
