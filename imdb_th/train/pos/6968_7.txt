Like the new BSG, it's not something that fans of the original series expect. Caprica may not deliver what BSG fans expect. (Mostly) It is very interesting if not involved with the character. Or at least as a pilot. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for BSG's great CGI (new), you will be very disappointed. If you like drama, you may find something you like and may specify. <br /> <br /> The story will examine how Cylons developed. Why did Adama hate them and the origin of the monotheistic society? The author can also deal with human beings who play God (s) and the creation or creation of a new 'human life'. It's interesting to see how this happens. <br /> <br /> I found It participates in some parts and preaches. In other matters too, but all is good. My small part needs (Or hope) there may be a bit of BSG's inklings in there (other than the latter that I talk about) but that might make the story too messy But it's too early to tell. <br /> <br /> It's easy to chalk this story into failure if you compare it to Previous series But I am happy to give you a chance Overall, I think it's interesting enough to make me see what the true series is before 'throwing a towel (Proverbs)'
