I caught this movie late at night / Sunday morning with my brother. We drink This is one of the best films for tearing I've ever seen. From the 'luxury' fleet actually is a ferry 'Roll on, roll out' with iron. Everything goes to the door with adhesive stickers. Tell the staff and see the same door that is used for other things. In another scene - this movie is rock !! Continuity is so bad that you can't help. But noticed that it slapped your face with holes In the final scene, he jumped into a life boat with a remote ferry. Cut off for his new son and boyfriend (Director of the public relations department, known as Kung Fu and used to be a police officer But was fired because of doing what she wanted - actually) on a ferry that was away from a quick explosion ...... then my father hugged them. How ???? Who cares about the magic of it There is no one redemption feature for this movie. The casino has the size of a large bedroom with a casino table. When being chased by a villain, there is only one place that you can guess. Enter the villain that instead of checking under one table, proceed to shoot four fruit machines and a small corner bar (the corner bar in the casino - amazing). They walk straight through the only hidden place which makes Our Casper goes around them and 'Take them out.' <br /> <br /> Take your friends for a drink. Put this film down.
