Otto Premingers gathered at Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney where the Sidewalk Ends reunited, hoping to get his magic of Laura again. But they are a fiercely different movie set in different classes of New York (not to mention the opposite polarity of the Noir universe). The thick fog of Gothic lies over the luxurious Manhattan of Laura. With Necilia's erotic and evil passion at The Sidewalk Ends, soot, pure and gravel cities in the city, basements, steam rooms and garage. <br /> <br /> But it's Is good The film is regarded as a pathfinder and stained-wool noir (Laura, on the other hand, one of the clutch films from 1944, in which the French dubbed `noir 'is still a very complex murder mystery. ) The sun came into only temporary suffering, and the director of photography Joseph LaShelle took advantage of most of the alleyways and brown rocks, docks and elves. This is the quintessential big city - especially the Big Apple-Noir, as well as others from the 1950s bumper crop such as Side Street and Sleeping City and The Tattooed Stranger and Edge of Doom. <br /> <br / > When the movie opens Police Detective Dana Andrew is on the carpet to find a cruel way, especially the feud with Mr. Gary Merrill. (Which we learned from the business that Andrew's father had done) when the out-of-towner was stabbed to death in a floating crap game run by Merrill I. - Andrew Trigger As a witness, causing him to break until the skull (Which came from a sheet of steel mounted in the head of a veteran). Andrew left the body in the river after making it seem that the suspect used the powder. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's still far away. From the end The body was discovered by Tierney's wife who became separated, and all the evidence began to turn to her father (Tom Tully). But will sail the same road on the night of the murder, but there is enough reason to cause his son-in-law to die But the bitter Andrew, bitter, found in Tierney to call for his better nature. He tried to get out of her father while still engaging himself in a vicious business. Confidential .... <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, like Laura, the script The The Sidewalk Ends (by Ben Hecht) shows his own irritability. (In the second dress, his bishop told Andrew, "Look, you - everyone is puzzled like a cylinder ball." <br /> <br /> But while Laura distracted Over half a dozen characters here, Andrews, are the only focus. (Even Tierney's role is still in the middle, less than Laura's half-spectrum) and Andrew may never have shown his craft here. It's tight and quiet. But never spoke better when his face was recorded for anguish, which his stubbornness had brought him quietly. He was a detainee who could only be found through the safety valve of violence. (He was freed from his faithful partner, Burfred) to make sure he found a quick way to redeem, even though his beautiful co-star agency. But that was the form of the era and the sweet ending that destroyed the story of New York about violence, corruption and chaos in the city.
