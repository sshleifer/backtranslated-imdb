This is a good story ... It's a good rhythm and every character develops. <br /> <br /> I've watched many movies in the last two weeks and this is a good story. the best I've seen in two weeks. <br /> <br /> The character of Jason Bigg is the best, though <br /> <br /> Although small. But was cleverly invented from the start. <br /> <br /> This may be a romantic comedy and I don't like most, but writing, direction, acting, sound, overall design in every sense. <br /> <br /> This film has a fairly high score from the movies I've seen recently and the rest is a big budget or a better release. <br /> < br /> Well written work the Mark
