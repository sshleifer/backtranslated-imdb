it's very fun! I never read Chester-Gould-comics, but not necessarily knowing There may be some jokes. I didn't think of anything. But what the eye does not see the heart can not regret This is a comical colorful film and a good mood actor. The settings are similar to Batman movies, but not dark and gray. Okay, the story is not original, but has a plot (which is not clear in itself) and more or less surprising ending. Interesting if you watch with friends. Don't look at the credit at the beginning and see who is the fastest in finding out who is the most famous actor in makeup!
