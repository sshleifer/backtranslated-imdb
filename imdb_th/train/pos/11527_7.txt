Miriam Hopkins is "The Lady with Red Hair" in the movie Leslie Carter's biography in 1940, which starred Claude Rains, while David Belasco, Richard Ainley, Lou Payne and well-supported players. <br /> <br /> Miriam Hopkins and Claude Rains give a great performance Hopkins is a beautiful actor who makes us feel that Carter Rains is great as a colorful producer / writer / actor / opera actor David Belasco, one of the famous people in the cinema. br /> <br /> Although Carter's Lou Payne second husband served as a consultant in this film It represents the real event in Mrs. Carter's life. In fact, there are many famous and bitter divorces, and she is seen as a shameful character for that and being an actor. However, she was taken care of by her son Dudley, so there was no fight for protection. When she broke up with Belasco, she didn't go back to him, and in fact began to work on the song and made some movies end her life. In fact, she married Lou and he became her most important pro. Productions <br /> <br /> The driving force for Mrs. Carter at the beginning of this movie is to take care of her son. But eventually she realized that When she left him, he carefully bonded with his father. In this movie too (And I'm not sure if it's true in real life.) She travels with her mother and lives in a theater that makes this film an interesting atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Not a movie that doesn't. Well, it may not be the image of Carter or Belasco's greatness. One of Carter's most famous moments was in the heart of Maryland, where she wore a wig with a six-foot long strand of hair. When outside the stage, the fans blew her hair while she was resting 35 feet above the stage and bent in the middle of the bell to prevent the rings from ringing. Is quite visual
