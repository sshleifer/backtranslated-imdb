This movie may be good. I just watched last night But felt unable to give honest opinions because I read the book first This book is better than movies that I am disappointed with the movie. If you plan to watch "Of Human Bondage", do not read the book in advance. On the other hand, this book is very good and there are more love stories that Phillip has with Mildred. You can still enjoy it after watching a movie. I did not make this claim lightly. I read books on average every 4 days and read different authors like Daniel Steele, Ovid Faulkner, Plato and Shakespeare. Of Human Bondage "My vote is one of the top ten novels ever written.
