I have to admit that Purple Rain is one of my deepest happy mistakes. Purple rain not only But destroying the boundaries. It also sets decades, costumes, music, behavior and dance! To this day, my friends and I are still stuck with the purple rain tracks and pretend to be princes and revolutions. <br /> <br /> Now, the movie itself, I just mean what I say. In the name Most of this movie is made by performing music? Please do not let me judge this thing because this is one of the pleasures that I like because I know it's not worth the Oscar in any way, but I think both of those filmmakers are Morris and Jarome. They are about passwords that are more hilarious. I just want to rate this movie in the concert sequence because I feel that it's what makes this movie. <br /> <br /> The Prince is a musical genius and creates beautiful music. While movies and performances are quite poor But this movie is still fun to watch at night and dance too. This movie defines the 80s, so just enjoy it. The prince wants it to be that party just below! Oh, the boy who listened lamely <br /> <br /> 9/10
