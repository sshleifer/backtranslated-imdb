In celebration of Disney's Earth Day, Disney released the movie "Earth". We will be treated to wonderful animals in their habitat without feeling too bad about ourselves. <br /> < br /> Stars in the show are elephants The family of polar bears and whales and calves The lecture begins at the North Pole and proceeds south until we reach the tropics every time we are introduced to people in different climatic zones. <br /> <br /> World conditions The heat was mentioned as we looked at the bear's warming world; Notes made from frozen sea islands that have contracted over the past few years We have never seen a bear catch any seals, but the search for the hopeless food of his father led him to a dangerous solution. <br /> <br /> The aerial image of the caribou migrated throughout the tundra into one. In the most amazing wildlife images I've seen; It and the migration of wild birds is enough to reward the entrance fees to see them on the big screen. <br /> <br /> One of the disappointments that I felt was a great image of sharks. White that took seals Slow movement. You never experience any kind of wild animals; Their incredible speed The idea of ​​making this film slower is to convey the great speed that I think begins with. (Or at least the first time I remembered) the TV show "Kung Fu" in the early seventies. <br /> <br /> Interesting ways are While the credits are a demonstration at the end of the demonstration of the techniques used for shooting movies There are amazing moments, humor and adequate advice in this film to make it a good choice for nature lovers. May be due to some modifications (Focus on us like before the end of the hunt) and the fact that this image was released in 2007 and is available on DVD. It is a movie that is stable on its own. And you can take your children. <br /> <br /> Three stars
