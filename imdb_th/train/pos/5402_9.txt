Hitokiri (which means "assassination"), a / k / a "Tenchu", which roughly translates as "sacred punishment"), showing Hideo Gosha at the top of the body Don't miss this or any other classic of Gosha, Goyokin! Hitokiri is not only one of Gosha's best movies, but one of the best movies on "Samurai / Shambara" and probably one of the best. The best Japanese movie ever sent. <br /> <br /> Be warned of all the complexities. The plot details in Hitokiri are quite difficult to follow for those unfamiliar with Japanese history in the 19th century. However, the basic human drama is clear and open to all audiences. According to the norm of Gosha Hitokiri also gives the difference in the traditional form of "Loyalty to the boss" and "doing the right thing". However, Gosha developed a theme that he liked with this complexity, which of course is the movie _the_ must see (with Goyokin of course). <br /> < br /> I think it will be like this: if you want more simplicity Action storytelling. You may want to watch Goyokin. However, if you want a theater that has many ideas and complex levels (Although scary) to watch this drama. <br /> <br /> (Okay is the main historical backdrop, a great power between many different samurai tribes (1) working to reform But still retaining the Tokugawa shogunate and (2) those who tried to install the Emperor Meiji as the highest ruler of Japan. Of course, these groups worked "for" the Emperor Meiji is not always interested in "reform" Japan. Rather than ensuring that their group has more power in The ridiculous "new world order" that all feudal systems were officially abolished is one of the first reforms of the Meiji government. The difference between "Hitokiri" from Gosha's other movies is the feeling that the maturity of every Gosha movie consists of contemplation and (like Barry Kubdon of Kubrick). Each frame of the movie can capture its own image as element Of course, it is normal for Gosha Hitokiri to stand out with a stunning backdrop, including (Like Goyokin) Many impressive scenery Just watch the opening sequence and you'll be hooked! Don't make mistakes. This is not the time in English: Hitokiri is extremely violent. (Do not say that you do not receive a warning.) <br /> <br /> There is nothing other than a good camera that makes Hitokiri stand out. The show seemed to be more subtle for me. Katsu Shintaro (from Zatoichi / Hanzo the Razor Celebrity) changed the starring role of the protagonist / conflicting character like Okada Izo Katsu to cultivate humanity for the characters that seem to be wild animals. More than a villain Throughout the movie, you are not sure whether you are involved or disagree with Okada's characters. At the same time, the image of Katsu about Okada's thirst for respect and his pathetic effort in redemption seems like a human being that you can't help. But he felt sympathetic / sympathetic. Of course, after seeing Nakadai Tatsuya as a hero who was tortured in "Googin", it was great to see him play the cruel villain in "Hitikiri". The perfect person has nothing to say. <br /> <br /> As the last note, perhaps more interesting than the general fans, don't miss the last screen of Mishima Yukio, the Ultranationalist novelist. The right-wing committed suicide by Seppuku before having a Japanese military group that he "kidnapped" in 1970 and a movie about his life and work by Paul Schrader) which is actually a fairly good job.
