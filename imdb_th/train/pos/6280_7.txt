If you like cars, you will love this movie. <br /> <br /> There are great actors in this movie, especially Vinnie Jones. In general, he has no ridiculous attitude and looks more difficult than people. Others .... <br /> <br /> There are a couple of shortcomings for this movie. Firstly, the plot is poor. But people do not watch this movie for the plot Second, the glory of Grand Theft Auto (Car crime) However, if people believe that they can steal Ferrari and escape, then look good on them. Hope you have a good time in jail. <br /> <br /> When I read The first time that Nicolas Cage will do the main function My first thought was "... sweeet" but then I thought "... naaaa you suck!" But after watching the movie, I realized that "... yes, he sucks!" Playing well. <br /> <br /> I'll finish this unusual review by saying "If premature death Of criminals in some way illuminating the general theater where viewers look at the bottom surface of the glossy film of criminal life and inspire them to change their way of life from death This time Everyone should be lucky. You can say "bad criminals". I said: "Bad for us." <br /> <br /> Ps - Angelina Jolie Voight looks quite good!
