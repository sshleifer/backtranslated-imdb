Although I can't claim to be a comic book fanatic, I read my share, so I guess I am part of this movie audience and I am not disappointed. It's almost gone, almost full of ideas and it seems that Lena Olin, one of my favorite actresses, was left on the cutting floor. In addition, the little blue king of Hank Azaria can travel far. Even so, it's easy to forgive these mistakes when you have a lot of fun movies. All actors seem to blow up their roles, especially William H. Macy as straight arrow Shoveler and Janeane Garofalo as The Bowler. And unlike some, I found the design of the city to make the story even more funny Enjoy I like that disco is a song that the villain chooses; Somehow it seems appropriate
