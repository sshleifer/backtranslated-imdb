Sorry I don't have time to write. I am not a psychologist but have known for 25 years. She says Scott Wilson shows a sociologist. (Without conscience) as well. I agree! She also said that Robert Blake exhibited an image of anger and conscience control. But I can't control myself perfectly. I agree! It's a cool and great movie. I have watched more than 2,000 movies and will be ranked in the top 100. My friends keep in touch with their customers throughout this life. My only criticism is a sermon at the end of the movie. Many people grew up in ideal conditions. But only one in a million people behave like these 2 losers
