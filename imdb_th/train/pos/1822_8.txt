An unforgettable masterpiece from the creators of The Secret of Nimh and The Land Before Time. This is a bittersweet cartoon that is very impressive. I remember well since I was young. It's funny and sad and very beautiful. It started to darken. The dog that escaped the pound and was killed by an old friend in heaven and returned. But it will be sweet when he comes with an orphan girl who can talk to animals Some scenes are quite scary, in contrast to other cartoons, such as Charlie's dream sequence. But everything is ok and the song is fair The memorable role of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise. I love this guy so much, and Judith Barczier of Jaws. Revenge. May God put her soul. Poor little girl. But she is in heaven. Now all good people go to heaven. Overall, this is a very good animated movie. Don Bluth is classic enough to shame the anime and Disney. Recommended for the whole family And knowing this, if you have an original video of this story, you will find that after the film, Dom DeLuise has a very important and special message to love that man ahehehe
