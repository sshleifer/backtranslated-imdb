I love Korean movies because they have the ability to capture real life. I often watch Korean movies for just one reason. I've seen this director, other movies before. One thing that is close to the feeling that I received from this story is the oasis and another great movie called This Charming Girl. <br /> <br /> However, my title should come from Chrstian's perspective. So i will start Do that instead of showering with admiration. <br /> <br /> For a non-Christian perspective, director Chang Dong Lee captures the unbiased image and is a true portrayal of modern Protestant churches. (Regardless of the denomination) and warts. I often wait for Christian movies that show the life of a truly dark church. Because Christian movies often speak in different languages ​​than they want to share faith Many movies that have a hidden religion, despite good motivation But is likely to have only an echo from Disney movies or after school specials They have to show life as it is. Real people curse real people sensual real people fall And even though Christians believe that salvation is available to those who seek But we are still challenged by the horrors of everyday life of this life And the character of Jon Yeon is almost honest and cruel in all of the women who found God But because of the bitter truth of life, losing her love for her She doesn't reject God. It is only that she refuses to accept to live with the idea that he is a loving and forgiving God. <br /> <br /> In her right to the edge of morality and madness of the characters She asked the question in The heart of all people is religious or not. <br /> <br /> "If God is love, why do he allow this terrible thing to happen?" The film didn't answer correctly. And I believe that the last 10 minutes of the film, although open to interpretation, gives us a future with hope for our main characters and the idea of Full circle of sunshine <br /> <br /> I don't believe for a second that this movie tries to be religious or try to do everything possible. There are reasons why it works more. It's true. It's honest. And for this reason it is the best combination of the Christian life that I have seen in movies
