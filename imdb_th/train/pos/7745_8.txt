"Life hits my face ........ We must try to make it beautiful." <br /> <br /> Launch the movie from one of Belgium's best artists. (He sings) Tom Barman, the long-awaited movie and --- Happiness, Happiness, Happiness, Happiness for the Making of the Flemish Films - Really Awesome and Promising Pieces! It leads us to the life of 8 main characters that live throughout Friday and night. The name says about the way we spend time with them: We float on a Friday night party where they meet. <br /> <br /> It's a quirky style that is 'very thoughtful'. Use music Sometimes it takes a higher hand with the image and you feel the power of it. Gainsbourg! QOTSA! Party scene (20 minutes) is an exciting viewing experience which is the cause of the filming method. It keeps you in it while it's located in a small place where there are many people who have a big party ..... so it can be difficult to shoot. <br /> <br /> Thank you Menij√®r Barman for Create a daring movie Over the years, the time of the creation of a poor Flemish movie You made my day!
