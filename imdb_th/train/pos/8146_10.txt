I can't stop saying how much I love this movie. This film is one of the least known movies and one of the most fun movies I've ever seen. The movie tracks the exploits of the rap group that is NWH (Ni # $% rs with Hats). It starts from the beginning of the group until the end of the group after the tragedy breaks apart. Follow the group of documentaries producer Nina Blackburn. <br /> <br /> This movie is cheap. But it's okay. It's a well-made movie, well produced, and the performances of these actors and actors are excellent. The main strength of this film is that it has many beautiful and wonderful songs written in this movie. It's not true. <br /> <br /> Spoiler <br /> <br /> There is a singer. Real players such as MC Slammer, Vanilla Sherbert, Ice Cold, Tone Def, Tastey-Taste and the song (Booty Juice, Grab Your Dick and more). Rusty Condieff created a great movie. In the movie, he plays a cool ice rapper. The movie doesn't stop. It's a joke from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The movie works very well, because it's strange on occasion. But it hit that line at the point where it's funny without having to go too far Listening to the trio trying to talk about some philosophy is one of the best parts of the film, like Tone Def, which tells the record producer producer when you take the bus. You get there. It's deep! '<br /> <br /> The NWH group has some natural chemistry for them. They worked very well together and they were able to pull this movie to a place where there was not a moment in the movie. What makes this movie really good is the reality of the rap group all the time that this movie is. Many rap groups have problems with censorship with violence, and as with the NWA, the group began to gain popularity when the establishment began to do big things from the controversial lyrics. <br /> <br / > I like this movie because it's nasty. There is something here to offend everyone in a hospitable way. This movie began when there were a lot of people outside the rap, which was the most fun thing of Spike Lee. As they come up with this conversation, I can't imagine. This film has lines per line that will keep you rolling on the floor. As I said before the writing was excellent, <br /> <br /> I was not surprised that this movie was released. It was an intelligent and impudent movie. This is too much for the mainstream, although it is hilarious and flawless in production. No major stars But there are many familiar faces, including Marc Lawrence, Tone Def players. Watch this movie, at least you will definitely have an opinion.
