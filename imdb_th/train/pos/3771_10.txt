1991 saw the release of the two best consecutive episodes of all time: TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY and BILLUS JOURNEY BILL & TED from these two stories. I like BOGUS BILL & TED'S JOURNEY better than ever. TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is better but no Something like Bill and Ted. In addition to Chris Farley and David Spade in TOMMY BOY, it's hard to think of a far more funny comedian than Bill and Ted. They are one of a kind. <br /> <br /> Influenced by the OC National. Lamphun and Stiggs, Bill and Ted were created by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson, two writers. With an incredible ability to invent both while performing at a local theater in 1980. Both began writing the script quickly about two times, and soon the great adventure of BILL & TED will take place. The film was filmed in 1987 and released in 1989, becoming a successful box office movie. Shortly before starting work on the sequel to Stephen Herek, the director of 'EXCELLENT ADVENTURE' was not eager to work on the sequel because he thought it was meaningful and lively, unlike the first film that Peter Hewitt performed in his first film. His sequel shouldn't have a better director for this event. BOGUS BILL & TED'S JOURNEY is excellent. It's full of unique styles and energy that can't be matched. <br /> <br /> What makes 'BOGUS JOURNEY' is one of the best sequels that has ever existed while it's dark. manuscript Is fun It doesn't change the character like most of the episodes that make Bill and Ted are cute characters, like in the first movie. This is because it was written by the original writer. Most sequels are not written by the same writer as the first one, but because 'BOGUS JOURNEY' has the same screenwriter, it ended up being as good as 'EXCELLENT ADVENTURE'. Like the first one, 'BOGUS JOURNEY' is a funny game that can be written well, fun and above all. It's full of amazing special effects and great comedy performances from Alex Winter, Keanu Reeves and William Sadler. It's a memorable 'travel' 10/10.
