I like many difficult trekkers (or Trekkies I'm not interested in!), Experiencing the seven seasons of "Star Trek Voyager" which dreamed of a better performance when it ended up lamenting "Deep Space Nine" 1999. Reply "Enterprise" Excellent, new perspective, completely different characters, amazing new images, pop songs for intro (I'm shocked!) I can't think of what I don't like. Sign me 10 seasons of this program. "Star Trek" is back - "Around the world" Who has missed you! Keep Trekkin '! <br /> <br />>
