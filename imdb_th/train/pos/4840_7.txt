I have seen the latest DVD of this movie in the "Horror" section of Oxford Street stores and advertise as well. In fact, it's just a vehicle for Arthur Askey, one of the most popular names in British comedy and entertainment for over four decades. <br /> <br /> Sometimes he may be cheerful, bright, cheerful and humorous. As a bit of a shock culture, many people are familiar with the sour and cynical taste of many British jokes over the past twenty-five years. However, there are those who admire the cheerful and cheerful personality and avoid the pathetic things. Askey is Tommy Cooper's idol who borrowed "gag" himself that Arthur tried to entertain passengers stuck. Always <br /> <br /> There is a distinctive and rare look by Linden Travers, the creator of the mysterious Julie.
