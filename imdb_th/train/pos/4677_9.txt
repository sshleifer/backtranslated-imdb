I understand that this movie is a debut feature and it is very impressive. It has feelings and steps. "True Indie" but director Todd Yellin has a clear vision for photography and editorial, command and judgment of mature and experienced professionals. The picture is crisp and thought out and serves to move forward. He and the author, Ivan Solomon, presented stories with depth and poetry rather than script types. In general, it is a story that requires the ability of the character Judd Hirsch to work. Judd is normally excellent; Just as Scott Cohen and Susan Floyd were beautiful, the true surprise was Elliot Korte, who played Adam Groden. Too much access However, I found the movie refreshing and fun.
