The presentation of the filming of "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" is the most beautiful and interesting performance of the poem that haunted Coleridge. An outstanding film combined with a collection of two centuries of attempts to show the epic poem of the year 1798 by world-renowned artists and the great lectures of Michael Redgrave are worth the time to see the work of the image. This wonderful /> In the age of television, such work is a valuable tool to influence young students, including adults, to explore and learn the value of great poetry. As you know best, this type of work is rare. That's sad. As a student in world literature, and as a former college professor and academic advisor, I feel that Coleridge's epic epic poem, such as "Ancient Rime of the Mariner", should be "translated". Will not be a film critic But as an avid reader of classical literature, I am happy to recommend this great production without any reservations.
