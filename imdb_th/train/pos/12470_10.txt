I just watched this movie on TV .. <br /> <br /> I lost my father when I was young and this movie touched me .. <br /> <br /> I can feel the loss. That little girl, Desi, feels .. <br /> <br /> Feeling like meeting her father again. <br /> <br /> Want to talk to him. <br /> <br /> Or at least give you a chance. Say goodbye .. <br /> <br /> And I was impressed with the letter she wrote .. <br /> <br /> Saying that her father read her letter. And send it back to someone to answer her and buy a gift for her because there is no shop in heaven .. <br /> <br /> It makes me feel that miracles really exist ..
