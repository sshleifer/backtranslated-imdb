The chaos of the music genre But mostly from Stephen Chow's combination for inspiration There are magic, kung fu, college romance, sports, gangster action and nasty melodrama for jewelry. The production is excellent and fast pacing, so it's easy to get through many shortcomings in this movie. <br /> <br /> Children are abandoned next to the basketball court. A homeless man takes him to the Shaolin Temple in the center of the city with a special kung fu guide that the homeless man is still unable to read. Old monk teaches boys But will expire when he tries to practice special techniques in the manual The school was taken over by a fake kung fu master who was rescued by four strange monks. The new chief is furious that the 20-year-old boy who doesn't pretend to be hurt by his weak punch and throws him all night. Found that the boy was throwing garbage into the basket from a distance unbelievably by a man who brought him to the gangster club to play darts This leads to a big fight, expelling the boy from the monastery and the man's decision to turn the boy into a college basketball sensation. <br /> <br /> Al, this happens. In the first 20 minutes, mostly in the first 10 minutes. In addition to the short stories that are problematic, the first problem is that we know very little of the main characters until entering the movie Men who use that child will be more clearly defined when the third person ends. The plot is not a new ground, except for the film's climax scene. I'm sure you can easily imagine that a strange monk will appear at the end. The shooting and stunting effects are the most important. <br /> <br /> Stephen Chow has the ability to write and play comedy that is much better and the film will In his shadow It is quite entertaining even if it ends with a recommended distribution.
