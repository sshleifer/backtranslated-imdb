I don't know why some people criticize this show. <br /> <br /> It's a great and funny performance - probably not the right content for the prime time, but still ... <br /> <br /> Family dynamics are funny and in the same way you see in most comedy programs. The supporting characters are absolutely hilarious. The plot of each episode and the common Sibfried & Jibes are higher than average. But often you have a sub plot or lining that makes you laugh. <br /> <br /> The performance is worth the 8 pounds paid for. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10
