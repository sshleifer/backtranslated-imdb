Why do I believe there is another novel in this novel elsewhere? I saw this movie again this year as I was teaching a novel and found that the change in this film was annoying - without the appearance of a little boy in this novel and the ending changed They killed him in the movie. But the whole point was that he was haunted by the events at the Eel Marsh House for many years. But remarried and eventually put the event behind him That the child is truly creepy. Kipps is haunted by women seeking revenge, not children. I am sure that I have seen movies that are better and closer to fiction and really scary. Am I just thinking about this?
