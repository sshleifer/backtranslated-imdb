Many comments that people make me (apologize) disappear from the point. Kasdan wants to present life just to ordinary life The conventionally structured story in which the characters have insights that change their lives and then fade away. The music and the film end up being absorbed into a larger canvas. Many characters in this movie are so bright, and they will move on. Sometimes they can keep their insights, sometimes they can't, and that's how life is real. In other words, Kasdan jettisons a remarkable traditional structure in favor of exploring the continuation of life? No happy ending, only the ending in the end; And everything before still in the process is still always ready to grab? And if you insist on the topic of exploring the role of miracles in our lives What is a miracle? Life is good for the beginning. Then add random events and cross-links that merge into multiple lives or interconnected lives, and you have miracles from the people of Kasdan. Focus on this form more gently, insist and support in various ways. The most memorable in the center of the movie is Mac and his wife lying on each dream bed. But later showed in the movie how those dreams were powerful in the movie to create reality This is not a movie that is simple or clear. You just let it play in front of you and let it sit in your mind for a few days, a month, a couple of years, and see what it's doing there. This is Kasdan's best movie, whether it's the best and most humane movie. A major meditation in life from one of our most talented writers and directors. Tragedy, of course, that he was not allowed to work for many years now, mainly due to the limitations of the studio around. "Dreamcatcher" hopes that we have never heard of Larry Kasdan, the last great movie from a great artist Please note that art does not need to find complete rationalization in order to be successful.
