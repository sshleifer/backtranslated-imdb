Even if you absolutely don't know anything about Ireland, you have to love "My Left Foot" (and especially the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis in that). Therefore spent most of his life in exile Even when trying to warn people about something, they just laughed at him. The light in the dark for him is that he can control one part of his body: his left foot. He used the organs to draw and write poems, making him famous. <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis and director Jim Sheridan performed very well in this collaboration. "My left foot" can make you feel in many ways: sad, hopeful or otherwise. But in any case, Daniel Day-Lewis gave a lifelong performance here. Great movie in every aspect
