Just kidding about something to lose weight; Well, you may lose weight that you never know. Anyway, I can say anything. I love this movie. It has the same feelings of youth and innocence found in movies such as Stand By Me and The Goonies. Jake's wardrobe shows the beauty of the simple things of life and the frequency we overlook them. This film reminds us of what it's like to see the world through the eyes of children and the magic, mystery and horror they perceive. Jake's wardrobe presents a unique story of humanity in kindness that everyone with childhood can associate and fall in love with friends; Look at the people who love to build a fort - extra wine.
