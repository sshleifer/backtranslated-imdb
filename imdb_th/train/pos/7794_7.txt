The movie star Ashley Judd hasn't made a better movie than her debut here She fits the role of the actor, bringing Ruby as a glove, as if she didn't have to do anything. She has a real movie star in this film and still can't convey the same charm in her later films, even though she was impressed by Normal Life.
