This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. How movies are related to real life and how drugs can play an important role Although this film seems to be produced from a low budget But I found it exhilarating to watch. <br /> <br /> Some people may not like the story and say that the script lacks direction. However, when people take drugs as deeply as these characters, there is no direction in life. I feel that this movie is the right representative of what might happen to a person if they face a serious temptation. <br /> <br /> Most actors are newcomers in the industry. However, they all pulled it out very well. Everyone seems to be working well and has good habits. <br /> <br /> I think this movie may be a good tool to use when dealing with people or loved ones that are related to drugs and Seems to be a circle out of control. This movie may make them afraid enough to change their ways.
