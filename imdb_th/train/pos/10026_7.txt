Without Kirsten Miller, this project doesn't have to be completed. However, with the beauty and incredible ability of Miss Miller, I would definitely recommend it. It looks as if other actors are playing with her strong performances. Wagner's indefatigable effort to honor this film is quite disappointing. But some of his scenes didn't distract My most criticisms come from writing and plotting a group of talents that work bravely to save what should be a disaster The delivery and the charming times of Miller are flawless and reliable. She plays the line between assertive and bossy. But in reality she is not a structural engineer that she claims to be I hope I can see this on a big screen. But luckily I rented it before it disappeared
