In the colonies, we are not everyone familiar with Arthur Askey, so I almost crossed this movie. (Which has a recent TCM preview) due to negative comments about his appearance in "Ghost Train" - which I expected Thoroughly annoying But I was surprised when I found myself laughing like I heard The physical appearance of Askey's comedy and his time when delivering songs shows you what you will get if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen have children. There is no comparison of him with Bud Abbott or other comic relief suppliers who appear. In this type of movie One can feel even more than that, linking the Askey thread with British comedy films over the next 30 years; At least it is clear from the American perspective that he looks more like the Thammasat faculty than anyone else here in the rest of the film - the movies that you've watched are more likely at You can guess at the end. But it is still fun and atmosphere and is quite worthwhile to wait for the next appearance
