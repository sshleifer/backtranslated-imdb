This film opened a bad performance in the first few weeks. Then Mina Kumari died and brought people to gather music in All India Radio, especially playing Inhi LogoN ne. Often I was bored with them at that time. <br /> <br /> Yeah. It took many years to succeed. This is because marriage is a very unpleasant matter and Kamal Amrohi has trouble finding money to make a movie. Look at luxury dresses and costumes. No wonder !! Not only was Meena Kumari aged and fell ill but listened to Lata's voice carefully. Inhi logoN ne had a voice that was 50 years younger than her, while newly recorded songs such as Chalo dildar chalo showed clear development. I just hope someone will find Ghulam Mohammad, which is not included in the movie because of changing fashion that demands less music. But a little song and Lata releases in a recent interview (2007) rated Ghulam Mohammad as one of the best composers she has ever attended, except Madan Mohan (a great personal friend). Will not see the actors in the Chalo dildar song, which is very unusual. There is a short image of Raj Kumar from the middle distance and you see the back of Meena Kumari Kamal Amrohi. Benefit from the need and focus on the stars And moon Other movies, this song should have both of them. <br /> <br /> For this is the best movie ever. Means you miss many Indian cinemas in a unique order, such as Barsaat (old), Devdas (old version), Bandini, Do Bigha Zameen, Garam Hava, Dastak, Guddi, Aan, Pyasa, Kagaz ke Phool, Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam, Kabuliwallah, Abhimaan, Guide, Sujatha, Bombay ka Babu, Daag, Parineeta (old), Umrao Jaan etc. , Teesri Manzil, Mahal, Aag, Jugnu, Anand, Mera Naam Joker: The list is really endless! <br /> <br /> So enjoy Pakeezah, but don't miss one of the above ..
