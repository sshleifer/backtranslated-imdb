This is a really fun movie. One of those that you can sit and watch unconsciously when the plot begins to become more and more distorted Robert Downey, Jr ... These well-known quality actors act as stars / drama producers. If you've watched TV series and thought "How can they do this?" You will love this movie. I saw it many times And every time I watch it, the more I like humor, the more I realize what it is. Don't expect the quality of the Oscar. This is a fun movie that provides entertainment, not a search effort. "Inside of men" etc. Sit back, relax and laugh.
