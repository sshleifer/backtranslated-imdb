In fact ... the "video camera" effect is just that it is quite a good effect .. (You don't know much about how you direct the movie?) This movie is better. It was fun to watch from the TV without having to follow any rules. I find it difficult to see number 1 because he killed the first woman. It's annoying. And all the time we set the path for Judd Nelson to go out with us, we as an audience beside him I hope that someday we will see the third cottage by the lake. But i doubt it Watching this movie, you can understand how to make a real movie like this is like a movie in a movie. Judd is one of the most terrifying villains ever, and he is more realistic. But chopping people without attention as in other horrors
