Surviving Christmas is a surprisingly funny movie, especially when considering bad publicity when it was first released. Ben Fafflick is funny as a nasty millionaire who pays money for a family that owns his childhood home to be his family at Christmas. Then he drove a car with a crazy family with negligence to encourage Christmas. I have never been a fan of Ben Affleck before (although I like Daredevil and Paycheck) but here he has a good role in this chapter I also like Christina Applegate as a daughter in a family who can't take the role of Affleck at first. Of course, you can see where this movie will go. But you don't care Do not care what the critics say and rent this movie because it's more fun than many Christmas movies.
