I have to be only 11 years old. When Mr. Peepers started, it was something to watch for the whole family. I believe in the sun. The night was repeated. He was robbed. Opened his locker. (He must use a yardstick or pointer to check the right spot in other lockers and do other things. Finally, kick the point that his door will eventually open) and the pins from the new shirt. At the beginning of the episode, he will open the package with a new shirt and the rest of the show will find one pin after he misses when taking off his shirt, time is everything and the pins have a lot of laughter). That the aunt who drove Rio like Jack Benny and wanted "Sunny" to say something scientific He will think and create "Semi-permeable membrane" or osmosis makes her say how wonderful he is. (You have to go there) Marion Lorne stole the item every time she was on the screen. Why didn't they make the series from her POV when Wally resigned (he was afraid he was typecast, but then it was too late) I would never know. I saw somewhere that the 1st TV wedding (big event) was at Tiny Tim on the Carson Horsecocky program. It was Rob and Nancy (I used to have a hot hot spot for her) and I remember it was the cover of TV Guide and published in all leading newspapers and magazines Traveling to the Broadcasting Museum in New York many years ago was disappointed that they had a few episodes and may now disappear. I still remember how wonderful it was and hoping that I would be a little older.
