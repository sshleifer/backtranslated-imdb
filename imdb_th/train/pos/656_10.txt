From all the comments I have read, most people have a lot of difficulties in Alexandre. Both Marie or Veronika never seem like they are hoping to treat Alexandre. But do not have as much knowledge as everyone thinks Alexander received a perfect life, totally cared for, received and given what he wanted. The girls allowed this story. Veronika loves sex. Marie is his patron. Is there anything wrong with this? Has anyone in love? Really? I do not think so Although French New Wave cinemas tend to deceive and others, it is a miracle just because of lack of desire for the plot to create emotions. Ease is perfectly cute and everyone in Alexandre's position in the city can request. I'm looking for every benefactor?
