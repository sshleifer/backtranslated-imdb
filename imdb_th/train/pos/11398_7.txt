I enjoy this movie It's light, fun, and very colorful. You can see that MGM is showing Technicolor. There is almost no color that does not appear in this movie. Every scene is packed. The choreography is excellent. Gene Kelly is a miracle. He is very talented. The dance numbers in this movie go perfectly and perfectly designed. He understands that dancing can tell a story as much as anything else. The last part of this film is a very impressive dance scene. What makes this movie so special is that Gershwin's song, a few American composers, received a better gift for the melody. I am very happy with Gershwin's music. It's charming. Ira Gershwin is one of the greatest poets. He is very witty and charming. This is a highly entertaining movie.
