Unborn tells the story of a spouse named Virginia (Brooke Adames) and Bradley Marshall (Jeff Hayenga), who tried to understand. Over the past five years, Virginia has had two abortions since then. They went to find Dr. Richard Mayerling (James Karen) for help after their friends recommend Dr. Mayerling said that he could help them with their children. Dr. Meyerling worked in Virginia and was confirmed shortly that the surgery was successful and Virginia was pregnant. At first, everything seemed to be perfect, and Marshall couldn't be happier. But the picture of their perfect life, not long ago when Virginia's pregnancy developed problems, she became irritated and acted as a character completely. & She received a call from Beth Jane Cameron) another woman who passed the process. Of Dr. Mayerling, who claims that Meyling is using his own patients for his own end, and in fact, the embarrassing genetic researcher Virginia began to question what was growing in her ... <br /> <br /> Produced and directed by Rodman Flender. I actually thought that The Unborn was a horror / thriller. (Of course, not a sci-fi movie like IMDb will let you believe) that surprised me. The script by Henry Dominic tries to be different and requires at least a Unborn credit to go for psychological horror rather than cheap fear and bad special effects. It's a clever story. That works and plays with basic human fears It moves at a fair pace, although it is not an action movie that is packed in any way. Climax is good & looks like an appropriate way to round things. & Warnings about genetic manipulation seem to be more relevant today than it had to go back then. Below, it lacks the elements of exploitation. & Is the heart of most dialogue-driven films, focusing on one person, so it's sometimes boring. In addition, I must mention what Erath is about: Black skateboards are all black dwarfs, right? <br /> <br /> The director of Flender has performed well, The Unborn is far from the most stylish or interesting movie, but it is good enough. The atmosphere is good & there is a lot of tension, just like what Virginia has in The evil plan of Dr. Meyerling and she did not disclose until the last moment. The frustrating blood and blood are almost nonexistent, which makes this movie impossible to return because in looking back, there is nothing really memorable. The Unborn relies on good storytelling. br /> Technically, this movie is normal. I think The Unborn has a low budget. But it did well, although it seemed polite and a little forgotten Mammals are a great special effect & have a fairly realistic face movement. Good performance. & This is one of the first performances that was credited to a friend (1994 - 2004) star Lisa Kudrow. I must be honest with me. Don't like friends & I don't even know who you are, so I Can't tell you how she is doing. <br /> <br /> Unborn is a great horror / thriller that deserves to be known and known more widely. It's better than a very low budget shit. Your horror fans & looking for something a little different, something smarter and thought provoking than usual, I think you should be worse than The Unborn, followed by the sequel The Unborn II (1994).
