OK. First, edit the tag posted on the main page of this movie. Abe Lincoln didn't walk with his sister in the movie and he didn't stop at his sister's grave. The person with the problem is Ann Rutledge, a close friend of Lincoln during Salem's new day. Some people say that Ann used to be Lincoln's girlfriend. But there is no evidence to support <br /> <br /> Now there are inventions and assumptions in this movie. Hollywood is very licensed with everything under the sun and "Young Mr. Lincoln" is no exception. However, the case of the courtroom in this film is based on real events: allegations of murder against William "Duff" Armstrong, and although it is a fictional story in the film by changing many names Screen. This is the golden age of Hollywood, with the best plays and Henry Fonda giving Lincoln the best for everyone.
