Hidden Frontier has been discussed and reported by many news agencies for their long-standing commitment to creating the best stories of Star Trek and to be an example of the coexistence of Gene Roddenberry's mission. Focusing on homosexuality, depression, war and the acceptance of different races are at a higher level than other Trek series and movies. A start smaller and choppy, but during the seventh season of the production of the better stories are more complex and the graphics are very smooth and even more impressive in Season 6, Episode 1 Countermeasures. There is one of the greatest space battles in history. Trek the boat, showing good results and fighting in space is impressive and exciting. The real drawing for the frontier is not a boat or background. But as a person and mutual influence and character growth There is also a nod to the Trek series and other films that have locations and characters that we all know. I recommend that Trek fans prepare to watch the response and you will be attracted!
