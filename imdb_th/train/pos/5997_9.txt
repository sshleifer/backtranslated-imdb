Let me start by saying that I have never watched a movie in IMDb before. However, I am in this video myself. And from that recognition I can say no doubt that this movie is a short story that should be It has a very good story and another thing I love - (better ending). The opening is very good. I like the videos I chose and how to fix it. <br /> <br /> I'm not a B&W fan. But the way this movie uses effects And with every movie that is important The flow of this film works perfectly and the editing is very good. From the technical aspects of things (which is the side that I work normally), everything works very well as well. No important technology What to point out There is only a small amount that I have, the final credit will slightly This may be due to rendering problems. Let me tell you that I want to see more love scenes. But I am a man (So ​​you can chalk up to the male factor) <br /> <br /> So overall, I rate 9/10. It's worth the watch if you like indie movies and / or short movies. <br /> <br /> ps sorry for bad grammar or spelling
