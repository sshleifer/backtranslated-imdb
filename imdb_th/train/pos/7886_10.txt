Ok, I'm a big fan of the Nightmare series and everyone says this is the worst thing! But it's not !!! You haven't seen Freddy's revenge ??? WTF! That's the worst of all !!! Now, this movie is quite good and it's stuck with Freddie's story and it's cool that he has a daughter, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> Then I found it to be 3D !!! I was very excited. I remember when I saw it in the DVD box set that I skipped in a three dimensional sequence immediately. Quite a lot in the 3-D, though like the hands of Lisa Zanes, Dream Demons, Freddy's nails (more than once), Lezlie Dean holding a knife, Lisa Zane with a baseball bat on the hand of the explosive Freddy's head. <br /> <br >> I like this movie a lot because it's in 3-D, but I hope this movie will be in 3-D, not just 15 minutes ago. <br /> <br /> Where it takes 15 Minutes !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
