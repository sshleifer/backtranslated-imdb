Moonwalker is a musical fantasy film that stares Michael Jackson with different segments. I will rate each segment. <br /> <br /> Part 1 opens the movie with a music video. Music video is a concert by Michael Jackson performing "Man in the Mirror". The music video also shows the montages of historical figures such as Gandhi Martin Luther King JR. John Lennon and many more The first part is a good alternative to opening movies that I like music and still love editing of historical figures. I still love the message in the song I gave the first part to 9/10. <br /> <br /> Part 2 shows the editing of Michael Jackson's start from Jackson's fifth to his solo career. The photo montage that I think is made out well. I like the animations they put on and I like the songs they choose. "I want you to come back to overcome it. Thrilling. You can feel it and the way you make me feel." The only thing I hope they do a little better in one song. The editing is "We are the world." You see is rain drops and in the drops is a picture of Michael Jackson and the star's chorus. But it was difficult to see the chorus In addition, the group is still good. I gave 9/10. <br /> <br /> Part 3 is bad music. You might think it's a bad music video for Michael Jackson. Yes and no. This part is a music video. But will play again by the kids. The segment is cute. But it's not as good as other segments. I give 6/10. <br /> <br /> Episode 4 is a short Claymation Music movie that takes place after the bad boy "Speed ​​Demon". Synopsis about Michael Jackson. Was chased by his beloved fans and the media and he disguised himself as a rabbit and rode a motorcycle to try to escape from them. But in some of the movies, the character Claymation looks a bit fake when they interact with real people. At the end of the clip came out of which no Michael Jackson's rabbit set came to life and he danced with it. I like dancing 8/10 <br /> <br /> Part 5 is a music video that won the Michael Jackson Grammy "Leave Me Alone" music video about With the media that appeared in the personal life of Michael Jackson and Michael Jackson, feeling that they would not let him alone, whether he was proven innocent The music video really speaks. (But please remember that this happened before the boy attacked this story about his rumors in the 80s) but I didn't feel that this video should be in this movie because it was a child movie and I Do not think that the child will understand what he is singing. I gave this music video 8/10. <br /> <br /> Episode 6 takes us to the main story of the whole movie called "Smooth Criminal". Michael Jackson plays as a gangster who uses The power of this star is a crime to protect children. (Including John Lennon's son, Sean Lennon) from an evil gangster named Mr Bigg (played by Joe Pesci) when I thought of bringing the movie, especially when he danced and sang "Smooth Criminal" Along with a group of criminals I think the special effects are good. The strange thing about the segment is why children go on trips with grown men. Joe Pesci's character talks about drugs and what he plans to do with them. I mean, why are you talking about drugs in movies for other smart kids? My rating for this part is 8/10. <br /> <br /> Part 7 is the last part of the entire movie. The movie ends with Michael Jackson singing the version of the Beatle "Come Together" and during the credits we see Michael Jackson singing with Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Michael makes a good cover of "Come Together" and me. Think that it is a good idea to combine good singers with talented musicians like him My rating is 9/10. <br /> <br /> This movie is a good movie by Michael Jackson. I think it brings to the imagination of the kids. The movie is an imaginative film, like the animated movie The Beatles "Yellow Submarine" If you like Michael Jackson and you are a very creative movie, this is the movie. My overall score for this film is 8/10.
