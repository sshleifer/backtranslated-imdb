This surprised me because I was always disappointed by Adrian Pasdar in the past, but he held the perfect balance in this performance, avoiding both jokes and sad stories while delivering true humor and emotions. Always great is here, excellent and everyone who hasn't taken her scene in 1983 Educating Rita should rent out immediately. (Great movie) The rest of the characters also support good play. Surprisingly surprisingly, without going to the top. This is fun.
