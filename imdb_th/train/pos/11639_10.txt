I saw an advanced screening for this movie tonight. I liked it a lot. This movie put me on the edge of my seat all night. For those of you who have seen Batman Begins, his character is much more scary in this movie. He plays his character very well. The most horrible "bad guy" I have seen in a moment In the queue The suspense will be held throughout the movie. The amazing part is that the end is not against the climate. I'm not disappointed in the end I feel satisfied The movie trailer didn't do justice. This film is much better than the sample that is specified. Do not wait for the film to come out in the video to watch, even though I don't have to pay to watch this movie. But I am happy to make 10.75 look fun!
