Albuquerque is a film that has all the elements of the Western Class A, except for those belonging to Class B or C, which was accepted at the time the film was created when people were very excited to see western colors. Today, it looks very original. However, for those who like old-fashioned westerns, it's fun. The original colors and sounds are well preserved on DVDs. Just came out. Gabby Hayes is a good close friend. Lon Loney has a meaning as always, and Randolph Scott is slightly more cheerful than usual. In the movie Albuquerque, you expect to see something that will remind you of the city. But the city shown here may be anywhere
