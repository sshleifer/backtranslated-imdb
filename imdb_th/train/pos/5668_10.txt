I accidentally stumbled upon this set. After half the time I was hooked, American Gothic was a dark and strange set, with Gary Cole being the crafty, cunning sheriff who tried to control Caleb, his illegal son, played by Lucas Black. With Lucas Black, Lucas Black's Caleb can stand against Sheriff Buck, one of the most formidable characters ever created for a TV series. I rarely see young actors who have the same personality or ability as Lucas Black. If you're still unlucky enough to see Lucas in American Gothic, meet him in Slingblade. <br /> <br /> It's an amazing show that has many ambiguities and mysteries that have never been explained during the period. short time
