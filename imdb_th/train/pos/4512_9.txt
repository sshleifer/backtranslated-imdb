I saw this movie today and I have to say it's better than I expected so much that it takes about a couple of hours before going to watch. Personally, I have a bias due to its language. But it changed all my thoughts This film is mostly surprisingly good for actors and actresses. It is a story about a boy who has a dream and who does everything to reach it. This really impressed me, and as a movie made from real stories, it convinced me. The new school, the headmaster, psychiatrists and young boys who know new teachers are slightly different from others and fight for things even if they seem ineffective. It shows that small things can change a lot in many things and sometimes differences can cause difficult situations. In addition, I think the selection of the actors is perfectly successful. It feels like you get someone to watch when you are an outsider when they happen. Before I lose this movie with compliments, I have to admit that there are some things and situations that do not look and feel real .. as the headmaster of the school beat Frit aka Martin in front of the class at the end of the movie He was severely beaten. But the only thing that gave him some blood came from the nose when compared to the first hit in the first episode when Frits stitched .. I think every thing is wrong .. must say that if one day I find a DVD This is from the store. It is sure that I take it too.
