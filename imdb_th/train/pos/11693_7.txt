This movie is a newly created movie of two very good stories. Finally, Heaven waits well, I suggest you look like that. This is not good. The third part of this film is not so bad, and Chris Rock began to show comedy that led him to where he is today. However, I don't know what happened to the first two parts of this movie. It plays like the movie "B", which is very bad that people listen like on a sitcom TV. The situation was forced and it was as if they were trying to end the story so that they could start a real movie. It seems that all of the real, fake and modified items are not good. I don't know how they will release this movie. However, the last part is not bad, so wait for the video to watch.
