If I don't know anything better than this, it's almost like being a scene. But it is not It was completely set up and the way they got all the pictures was amazing! The unfortunate event of September 11, 2001 was brought together very well in this documentary and the classic video that they have made into an unfortunate movie. Only the history in the image will make it a must-see for the American people or those who experience the tragedy on September 11.
