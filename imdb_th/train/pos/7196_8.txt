As the serials go, "The Fighting Forces of Zorro" is one of the best action serials of the 1930s. Created at a time when the studio can still cast a large actor, this one has to perform. Walls and walls throughout Chapter 12 <br /> <br /> In 1824, the newly established President of the Republic of Mexico Benito Juarez (Carleton Young) was trying to secure his new country financially. He managed to deliver the rich gold sent to the town hall from the local San Mendolita mine. <br /> <br /> Members of the local council planned to steal the goods on behalf of Don-del-Oro a deity. The gold-plated armor, which, with the help of the local Yaki tribe, hopes to install itself as a guardian of Mexico. His opponent is Don Francisco (Guy D'Ennery), the founder of the military to help Juarez. When Don Franco was killed by the people of Don-del-Oroon, strangely, the people of Don San Diego (Reed Hadley) arrives in Diego aka Zorro to capture the army with the help of Ramon friends (William Corson) and Juan (Budd Buster). The token of this piece is Volita (Sheila D ' Arcy) Ramon's sister <br /> <br /> Both Diego and Ramon have seats in the Counsil local council. It soon became clear that the other members of the league in the league with Don-del-Oro The first time there was the President of the Council (Leander de Cordova), the leader of the military, Manuel (John Merton), Chief Justice Pablo (C. Montague Shaw) and Gonzolez (Edmun d Cobb) Soror suspects that one of these men is Don-Del-Oro, but who is it. <br /> <br /> The following thing is to raise me many times by Soror and the region. Under his direction from the followers of Don-Del-Oro, we have a rope bridge that collapses all the time, a deep gap between the two cliffs that Zorro can only jump to to safety and the normal classification of the fire explosion. And coach and wagon bumping or crossing the frontLeaving here to the Republican stunt team, led by legendary Yakima Canutt and Yrigoyens, Bill and Joe Canutt, showing his signature thrilling jump to the horse team that had escaped under the coach, which he repeated in Other films include John Ford's "Stagecoach" in the same year. <br /> <br /> However, Soror reveals the false god Don-del-Oro and restores peace to the valley before Ride the horse into the sunset in Chapter 12. <br /> <br /> Other performances include Jim Pierce, Curley Dresden and Charlie King as Don-del-Oro's men, and if you look closely, you might see a bit by future serial stars Lone Ranger and Clayton Moore and Stuntman Canutt a bit. "Big" Jim Pierce may be best remembered for playing Tarzan in 1927, "Tarzan and Liom Gold" (1927) and for his marriage to Joan Roh, the daughter of Tarzan creator.
