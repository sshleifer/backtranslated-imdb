Like many people on this site, I saw this movie only once when it was first screened in 1971. Some scenes are in my memory and the overall feeling is unrecognizable. Effect from it I would be surprised to see it again if the video is open for home videos. <br /> <br /> Possible spoilers: I suspect that others will agree that the settings are Basics and characters may come from 1960. The British film, formerly known as City of the Dead, is named Horror Hotel for screenings in America? There are still similarities to the British movies. The next story The Wicker Man <br /> <br /> One detail remains with me for many years after seeing this movie. It's a small but important time, close to the beginning of the movie. While I remember, the Minister and his wife stopped helping some people on the side of the road around 1870, somewhere in the west. Ray, a friendly friend of Millland, introduces himself and his daughter, Yvette Mimie, a beautiful dumb girl. While the preacher was helping Ray Millland with a gangster wagon car, the rattlesnake looked unharmed and helpless, ignoring any character except Yvette Miz. She didn't look scared at all. But stared at the snake quietly until it disappeared With this strange time, we already know that there is something very unusual about the common people that seem to be possible, even if the potential danger to the minister and his wife remains ambiguous and uncertain. For a long time, <br /> <br /> Be with me, vividly after many years, along with many others. This film has quality about this story that is not released. The surprising that people remember it vividly. Someone should make this video a home video!
