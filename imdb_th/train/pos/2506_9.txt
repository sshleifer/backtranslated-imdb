Moon Child is one of the more iconic movies I've ever seen. What I like about it is illustrations about immorality / death and obstacles and lifelong approaches. This movie shows a lot of vampires that have the power of immorality and their advantages. Regardless of having supernatural abilities or eternal life, these are the things that humans need. Moon Moon shows the pain and disadvantages of immortality, because the feeling of loss affects. Almost all characters, especially with the main characters Sho and Kei, the meaning of the name 'Moon Child' revealed when the film is nearing the end, which clearly shows that everyone is the moon The other way of guidance. I have a personality that is quite like the virtues that the movie describes. The weakness of this film is in some parts of the show and special effects because it makes the film less accurate. The scene in which the character Toshi dies may be more powerful and realistic if there is a real emotion in the performance. Some scenes with special effects such as guns appear to be more realistic without making the game look too much. Sparks that came out of the gun seemed too fake and I thought it would be eliminated or corrected. However, I think Moon Child should be a movie that everyone should consider. Symbolic thoughts and pictures that the movie presented are accepted by everyone and may be of interest to a large audience. It's quite a movie that is generous and entertaining to watch.
