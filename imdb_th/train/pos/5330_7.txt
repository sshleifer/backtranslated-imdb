I think it's quite interesting that my social studies / language teacher is the police chief who holds a microphone in a bucket of water = D. I'm excited that my teacher is in an advertisement in gas / coffee / telephone / commercial advertising. It's a good thing to see him on TV. He's still everyone hating Chris, except he always gets a small part. Why do we have to be correct? 10 lines that are stupid -_- I think I've never been interested. Not funny. What is this? Why do we have to go to the tenth line ... What is the point? ?? !! I will speak randomly at this time. -_- Maple is fun. I love my friends.
