I saw the gem of this film in Cannes, which is part of the director every week. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Collinwood. Nothing is better than this. Have fun all the time with all the members of the strong actors who show their socks. Sometimes it is a joke about the thief (Cosimo, played by Luis Guzman) who was caught trying to steal a car and send him to prison. While in prison, he met "savior" who told him that you and me ?? It is certain that you get a fast format. It turns out that there is a passage from an abandoned building to a jewel shop in the city? Which can net a million sounds easy? ?? Throw strange characters and events together and you have ingredients for natural riding !! ?? The passage from a low-life loser to another and soon their team will gather to try and bring money into Cosimos `bellini 'led by the failed Pero fighter crook Riley (William H. Macy) who was forced to take his children along with him while his wife was imprisoned for fraud !! street) which inspired the movie similar to `Collinwood '??` Palookaville' This caused the last attempt, and although it Written and directed by the Russo Brothers But there are shades of Coen Brothers about it, produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, who has a small but hilarious part as a safe destroyer
