As an amateur historian of WW2 / Nazi Germany, I can't wait for this story to come out on DVD. I missed it when it was first time in 2003. I don't want to repeat what has already been spoken in the previous 8 pages of comments about historical inaccuracies. A better job might be to make the painter the most popular. I have a few problems with not many selection options for their performances. But for their appearance, Peter Stormare doesn't look like Rohm. Why didn't they create Babson when Hess put on a wig? And my greatest complaint .. Mostly made from Hitler's eye-catching blue eyes, why don't they make Carlyle wear a blue shirt? On the positive side, I think the actors playing Goring and Drexler look quite good again, as long as the audience understands that this should be entertainment. No. 1 History No. 2 I don't think there will be many dangers
