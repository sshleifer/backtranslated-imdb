The obvious similarity between Walt Disney's charming fantasy bedknobs with Lewis Broom and CCS Chronicles of Narnia is quite clear. There is more coincidence than comparing Bedknobs and Broomsticks than Mary Poppins, although many of the same creative abilities went into two Disney movies. <br /> <br /> Just like The Chronicles of Narnia involves some English children who Leave London During the blitz and will come to live in the country And those children have to deal with the magic world But unlike C.S. Lewis, the children of Rawlins have a magic attack on their planet and help eliminate the people who do it here and now. Don't fall back into the realm of fantasy like a child. Pevensie <br /> <br /> There is no serious philosophy here from Walt Disney, except it may not be good to mess with witches, even trainees such as Angela Lansbury who learn magic from. The charlatan like David Tomlinson. Ms. Lansbury isn't one of the best actors in the story. She holds his own magic, which even the special effects that Disney can't rank for. And they received an Oscar for the Magic Kingdom in that department. For this film, <br /> <br /> Two actors say goodbye to the movie in Bedknobs and Broomsticks Tessie O'Shea. Play the last chapter. In this film, she has performed many films in the UK as one of the most beloved musicians. And the great actor actor Reginald Owen as a retired general who is the leader of the Old Old Guard in the war and in offering music prices to film audiences around the world. <br /> <br /> Robert B. Sherman's team And Richard M. Sherman, who wrote the score for Mary Poppins, wrote well and was helpful. Here, The Age Of Not Believing was nominated for an Academy Award. But lost in the theme from Shaft. Personally, I like David Tomlinson's tribute to Portabello, the most colorful street in London. <br /> <br /> Bedknobs and Broomsticks are fantasy movies that are still well preserved after nearly 40. Years. Imagine what it would be like with computer-generated graphics.
