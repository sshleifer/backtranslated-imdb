Dick Tracy is not the best for many comic book fans because they want something that has blood like Batman. Dick Tracy plays the innocence of being a comic book that has bad-looking and funny characters. Warren Beatty leads the director and the star as the main character in the fight against crime without using special powers. I like Dick Tracy since I was a kid because of the cartoon atmosphere of the main colors: red, blue, orange, yellow, green and black. This is the perfect movie for everyone to watch with their children. Al Pacino is like Jack Nicholson in Batman and plays Big Boy Caprice with fun. Madonna as a second evil baby boy. In this movie, do not play the toys that she represents. As I said, there is no blood, vulgarity, sexism, or anything that offends anyone.
