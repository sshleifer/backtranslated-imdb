I am very pleased to see the movie "Milanese" in Milan. Alessandro Alatri is a Roman director who has the correct understanding and luck that is printed in the film Philosophy of Milan. <br /> <br /> Movie Tell the story of a Milan spouse starting from "birth" to death. Wedding arrangements are normal for any project that has become original and related to every guest in the past. The way they come together and feel the love. Life is difficult in Milan's "urbe" and after a sweet day becomes violent and eventually violent. Products: Children who instead strengthen their relationship with each other, it decreases because "The effect of selfishness" general of today "personality" Greater "advertising environment with "Creativity" under stressful atmosphere helps to participate in the plot We are losing life value and this is a good and profound reflection on this great and sharp movie from the director of Senza Pelle. <br /> <br /> A well-selected actor Stefania Rocca is a person. Well and looks astounding as Fabio Volo, good, unexpected, well known in the TV show "Trash": Le Iene <br /> <br /> Score: 7/10
