When I watched this movie before it was long ago in VHS-Video, I liked this movie because it was funny and exciting. Many years ago I saw another movie titled: * Andy Colby's Incredible Adventure * in this movie as part of the * Wizard of the Lost Kingdom * used in them called this movie I started searching for "KOR" - movies for many years because I wanted to see the complete movie, not just the part used in * Andy Colby * -Movie. There are no stores that rent movies. Kor and shops do not know this movie For many years I watched my old VHS tapes at home and surprisingly ... I have had this movie for many years at home. But this movie has a different name because in Germany there are 3 or 4 titles, so I'm glad to find this tape at home, and this time I have more time to watch * KOR the Conquerer again. Excellent during watching movies on the hole. But the best part of filming with music is this time when KOR is walking drunk through the green forest. The music in the back has some magic. I like Bo Svenson and the boys who play Simon in both movies. They work very well. Manfred Kraatz, Germany, 26.10.2004. Thank you to everyone who read my comments.
