The only notable thing about this movie is that it was Steve McQueen's first big actor. <br /> <br /> McQueen's talents have not been developed and raw. But honestly in a small sci-fi horror movie, Steve shows himself as an actor who loves a hot car that will become the symbol of the film industry in just five years. <br /> <br /> Later, McQueen said that he hated this movie and "he was a bloody" but everyone had to start somewhere and The Blob was cute, fresh and innocent. If all of us are still there, <br /> <br /> The plot is changing rapidly and even if predictable. And it was fun to see Steve McQueen before he became the King of Kool (and Anita Corsaut before she became Andy Taylor's girlfriend) Steve McQueen's movie collection
