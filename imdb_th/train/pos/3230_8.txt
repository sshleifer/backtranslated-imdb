OK, so the soldiers are not as deep and have the same meaning as Blade Runner or the budget as big as Terminator 2. But overall I feel it is fun. <br /> <br /> The fact that Kurt Russell is still in a way that is not. Speak and be Almost without emotion, causing the moment in which his humanity broke through the painful pain I found his image about the emotional development that limited the touch over Arnie's in the movie T (and before I received the comments. Yes, I know Arnie is Cyborg and Kurt is human, but the evidence of the whole movie. Two of them too)> <br /> So for the movie itself, a reasonably US / British actor can tell this little story. Not really sure that Gary Busey and the two officials He is a bad person or a good person so can't decide if I like them or not. The colony is more realistic than it is not a group of people who are mistaken for peace / heartless / cowardly lovers who have been eliminated from travel or terrorist groups who have been paranoid, paranoid about the extraterrestrials and each other. Russell is good and unlike other comments, I don't feel it will have a negative impact on his career. (Unlike the Escape from LA - sequels are unpredictable monsters!) Sean Pertwee makes his deceased father really proud by continuing the noble Sci-Fi family and the remaining actors. Helping the pathetic band of the audience to fall into the worst situation and not doing anything bad. <br /> <br /> If you see this on my TV schedule, I suggest giving you a chance. Don't think you are disappointed
