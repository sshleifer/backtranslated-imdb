The arrival of world-famous musicians about unexpected events and feelings in some small villages, threatened by the way he managed the choir of the church and the way in which people will change. Keep this movie warm and keep you out of the cinema with a smile on your lips and tears in your eyes. It's about presenting the best in people, and Kay Pollak has written a great script based on the ideas he is famous for. The actor has distinguished Michael Nyqvist that we have known before, but Frida Hallgren is a new and charming acquaintance for me. She has the brightest face that has never been touched. Later, Moberg did his job as Gabriella's husband. Almost too good, he was scary as well. Just hope that he will be thrown to play as a good person one day, so we can see if he is that character or not. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will not make you not touch. If you haven't seen it yet, do it right away!
