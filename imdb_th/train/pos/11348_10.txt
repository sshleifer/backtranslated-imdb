I love this movie a lot when I was young. I cry every time I watch it. It's not strange for me I stated totally with the characters. I like to see it again (And hopefully I won't be disappointed!) Pufnstuf Rock !!!! I was attracted to the world of fantasy. And for me, this film is loooong. I wonder if I've seen the series and made them confused? The acting that I think is strong I love jack wilde He dreamed of being 10 years old (when I watched the movie for the first time, not in the 1970s. I still remember the character so vividly that the flute was completely believable and I could still 'feel' the wicked forest. Witchy poo was scary. I didn't want to cross the path. yours
