`United States Kiss My Ass' House / Games <br /> <br /> is the first launch game from playwright David Mamet and it is a powerful and sometimes surprising psychological thriller. It shows that Lindsay Crouse is the best-selling psychiatrist, Margaret Ford, who decides to confront a gambler who pushes one of her patients to commit suicide. In doing so, she left the safety and comfort of her rather ordinary life behind and traveling `downtown 'to visit humble places. House of Games <br /> <br /> Gambler Mike ( Performed by Excellently by Joe Mantegna) appears to be quite sharp and level He offers the character of Crouse. If she is willing to sit with him in a big money game in a secret room, he will cancel the patient's debt. Card games began and soon a psychiatrist and gambler could see that it was a familiar line. (Gained the trust of others) and the interesting relationship began. What makes House of Games interesting and an important perspective for this movie fan is the constant guesswork on who controls it. Is a psychiatrist or therapist.> <br /> In the House of Games, the direction is boring and mostly flat and not interesting. However, in all films of David Mamet, it is a central story. The entire operation is not in the House of Games, what shines through this part with great performances from both actors. (Which is flashy and annoying) but mostly the case of Mamet's work. It's a conversation that catches you and pulls you into the movie slowly. No one in the House of Games says what they mean and the conversation becomes a battleground And the war of words Everyone bluffs and bluffs in pairs, which remembers the natural poker game. This is a theme that is used throughout the movie and used for great effects at the right time to create a lot of tension. House of Games can be viewed in the movie `class-war 'with Lindsay Crouse. We have A well-educated mid-level psychologist and Joe Mantegna is the opposite of America's proletariat who earns a living with a crime of 'honesty'. <br /> <br /> An enticing movie. The audience is similar to Crouse being tempted by Mantegna and the end result is finally a satisfying American movie. And the last of this movie is something that everyone will see and be careful of. It's amazing. <br /> <br /> The funniest movie experience that should be worth watching. 9/10
