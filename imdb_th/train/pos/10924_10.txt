I saw this kung fu movie when I was a kid and I thought it was cool! Now I'm 26 years old and my friend has it on DVD !!! <br /> <br /> We have a case. It's not gone from the traditional cold of kung fu! If you are a fan of kung fu / karate movies, this is a must see ... DVDs are available. I believe this movie is called "Pick Your Poison" <br /> <br /> Watch it soon!
