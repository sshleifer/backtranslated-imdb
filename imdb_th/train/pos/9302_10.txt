Most comments are positive. But I want to add that viewers should focus on the scene. The designer of the series uses many beautiful Art Deco treatments along with beautiful buildings, stairs, doors, furniture and so on. This film is inspired by the diverse styles and symbols. All actors, gangsters were selected - it's like seeing old friends and keeping them. Sometimes the conversation is amusing. But sometimes presumably and I think it should be like that This is a movie of buffalo movies. It was created by people for people who love the media. Don't miss this one.
