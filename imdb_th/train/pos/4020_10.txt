Pinjar by Mr dwivedi is a great movie It was the best and most wonderful of the year 2003. There was a very good performance there. Dwivedi knew that he could extract anything from MAST Urmila. She was like you've never seen before. One truly wonderful performance Along with her being a good actor, Manoj bajpai, which shows the popularity of what he is with Bhiku Mhatre. This movie is about a woman (Urmila) living in Pakistan before the partition. She came from a Punjabi family, living in a small town. She was kidnapped by Muslim men as part of the fight with the Punjab family. Then follow a series of twists and turns into a marriage. The arrangement of Urmila is scheduled in a few days. This movie is a really good movie. The story is strong with an amazing screenplay. All performances, such as lillete dubey, isha koppikar (You never believed But she can perform well apart from jus dancin in Khallas), kulbhushan kharbanda and many more. Those dresses are Pakistani before partitioning, costumes, movies, sounds, background scores added to positive points From beginning to end, you're stuck with your seat with the next question. This movie is not worth your look. But it should be part of your movie collection The final scene is the end of the movie. I would recommend the crowd. No-Kabhi-Khushi-Kabhi-gum-and-No-Dil-Pagal-Hai All those to see this amazing flick My rating: 10/10
