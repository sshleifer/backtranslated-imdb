It's very funny. You know, like a comedian who should be. It looks very good, like Hollywood Spectacular. So, what else do you want? Howz about Sally Fields. Very good. She's so much better in everything I've seen. She came in and she looks very good. This movie is all you need to understand why you are a star. Those eyes! Like a silent movie star, but better. In fact, everyone's eyes are very good. I used to pretend to be a bad TV drama actor with my girlfriend. We will do that which you see really fast from one eye to the other side of your partner. They don't do that in the Great Soap Dish. The eyes have it! (Sorry) <br /> <br /> There are many great performances, fun, waiting for each one to appear again. Is there a whole workshop that has happened to Kevin Kline about how to overact in a very detailed manner? Yes, he is a good person. Robert Downey, Jr., who plays a key role in playing Slick, Slimy Executive Cathy Moriarity while That is not the most talented actress, charming and sensational, especially when she is angry And even the Whoopi Goldberg is good. Giving her the natural time makes sending a little zing here. OK, there is no Whoopi Bashing. I hear you <br /> <br /> Soap Dish hairs were created at the end of BIG Hair. Eighties, so Doo is ridiculous, so it's a wonderful character in itself. They are bigger and stupid like you do. Yes, we got the picture. <br /> <br /> The soap dish is better than I thought, the better I wanted it to be. I'm fed up with movies that tell me that I should be interested in superficial stories that are selfish, semi-talented, egomaniacs that are capable of such TV stars, soap, soap dishes seem to be happy to let me laugh at 'em. Thank you.
