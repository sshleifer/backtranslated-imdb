Guinea Pig: The Demon Experiment. No doubt that the star in the first view looks disgusting and scary in the dark side of human nature. This movie reaches the point where you might think of what point? The point is to meet the needs of fans of violence and gore. This movie has some more or less blood. But suffering severe women, only 3 scenes can be considered as blood I will tell you one thing, even though the guinea pig: the temptation of demons makes it seem like an enemy like Sesame Street. If you think Hostile is a cruel torture movie, you won't see half of it until you see Guinea Pig : The Devil's Experiment <br /> <br /> Movie score 0-5, Gore 0- 10 <br /> <br /> Guinea Pig: Demon Experiment (Uncut) ***** (7)
