Lucky for our Real McCoy fans (probably the Baby Boomers that grew in the late 50s and 60s). Three adult actors / actors appeared when they performed to reunite in 2000. Tony Martinez and Richard Both Crenna soon afterwards. It's fun to see Luke, Sugar Beep and Pepino together again. It's equally mysterious that there is no mention of Lydia Reed and Michael Winkleman. It's my understanding that Little Luke died a year. 1999 but I'm not sure There is no information about Hassie on the internet that I can find. Wondering why not to mention It's very clear, their absence from the reunion shows that I suspect that the family of Michael and Lydia themselves. (If still alive) as well 1) asked to be left out of the discussion and therefore their wishes were received or 2) TNN did not find any traces of Michael or Lydia (Like the rest of us) they seem to disappear Therefore, it is the safest policy to let them leave all conversations. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the return to Walter Brennen is amazing. They didn't do anything about it ... It's a grandfather that makes the list successful. I remember when I was a parody of my grandfather's eyes and my parents laughed. (Because I'm sure there are a million other children in those days) One thing that makes me a little annoyed is that the trend that Richard Crenna will influence over the debate ... sometimes interrupts Tony and Kathleen to point out issues. In fact, though, Tony Martinez seems to have the ability to fully participate in the conversation. But he was not allowed to speak out and talk too much during the reunion performance Unfortunately, since I want to hear from all three people equally. Overall, the combination is real for me. I've watched on DVD many times and enjoyed it every time. <br /> <br /> Dodgerdude
