This may be one of Brian De Palma's best-known movies, but it's not his best. Body Double, The Fury and Carrie are better movies. But this movie is better than Blow Out and Obsession De Palma has been heavily influenced by Hitchcock and this film leads to Psycho Angie. Dickinson is a bored housekeeper who is thinking of adultery and after a psychiatrist She was played by Michael Caine, showing a proposal. Dickinson met a man in the gallery. After this point, it's best that you don't know what happened. But there is a murder and Nancy Allen is a woman who calls the murderer. Dennis Franz is a detective in the case of not trusting Allen and she must find the killer herself. It's a good movie But not the best movie of De Palma
