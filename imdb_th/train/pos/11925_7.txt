I accidentally watched this movie on cable one day. I have to admit that I have never been an avid baseball fan. But sometimes I can create movies related to sports. What I am more interesting is the image of the host family system. As a therapist who sees both good and bad for the mental health of the community and the patronage system But I am quite refreshing to see a movie that shows both the ups and downs of this system: people jump from one family to family Parents are not actively involved and transitions, which may only cause the heart to thrive and melt the heart. Both bring very reliable performances. Maybe it's just my mood. But I found myself shedding tears at the end of this movie.
