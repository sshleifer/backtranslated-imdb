LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT is the first movie I saw in 2000 and I wonder if I will look better this year. This beautiful tragedy by Belgian filmmaker Benoît Mariage is located in the wasteland of Wallonia. Benoît Poelvoorde plays the father who wants his son to receive a car award (Lada!). For him to do this, the son must break the record. Opening the door What he wanted his son to be true because he had never done it as a local news reporter for a newspaper called L'Espoir (Hope). Of course, nothing works as planned. This film can be best compared to Aki Kaurismäki's DRIFTING CLOUDS, although it looks more dramatic and the humor is darker. Like in that movie But the tone seemed more melancholy than the melancholy and the ending rhythm without unrealistic happiness Humor is nonsense without making incredible stories, and Mariage finds an amazing picture in a bleak setting that has never been seen before. The best thing about the LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT is the performance by Poelvoorde. This actor filmed for the famous C'EST ARRIVÉPRÈS DE CHEZ VOUS, which he played Ben, a charming killer. Since then, he has played only two small roles in films that were not released in the Netherlands because, as he said in an interview, he was not confident in his acting ability. With his return to the leading role in the LCA, no longer suspicious about his performance He is a wise man, just a fool and evil, enough to cause his family to suffer. But smart enough to realize what he was doing and being torn by remorse about it, must see
