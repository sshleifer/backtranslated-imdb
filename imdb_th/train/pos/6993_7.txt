This is not the best movie of Bela Lagosi, but has a good old way for horror entertainment of 40 years. <br /> <br /> The bride is dying at the altar like a fly. I think I will postpone the wedding until after the devil is arrested. But it's a horror movie, so I think people don't care about danger for some reason. However, Lagosi is a crazy doctor who wants young blood to keep his age, weak wife, healthy and happy. He often dodges Keystone Cops by Hide the body in the corpse (Who would have thought that looking for a body in a truck?) And the bride would be zapped. <br /> <br /> To complete without a woman journalist Lois Lane wanting to catch the criminals by himself. Good at solving bad crimes that always shut her mouth. Guessing who the Lakosi chose his next victim, I liked the bit "Haunted House" where Lois Lane was caught in a thunderstorm as a guest. The scary mansion of Lagosi, the hidden path, the wife who is like a vampire, the help of the evil Igor, the dwarf and other good things. <br /> <br /> The good-natured pacing helps. Mobile movie For the story, and it can be edited as usual, but it's satisfying if you like old horror story worth watching.
