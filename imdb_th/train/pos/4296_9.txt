This should be my number one movie for 1991, except that it's won by JFK. This is a great movie! I like it. I love the story of the lives of different characters, intersecting with others and how they deal with their lives. Kevin Kline is very good here. But was revealed by Danny Glover and especially Steve Martin. I never liked Martin or his style very much. But here he is excellent. I like all the words he gave to Kline near the end of the Grand Canyon. Excellent writing Larry Kasdan is an excellent IMO writer throughout the lines of Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino. Here, he created many three-dimensional characters. And think about the story and story that gives a good feeling to our lives A truly wonderful movie 4 out of 4 stars
