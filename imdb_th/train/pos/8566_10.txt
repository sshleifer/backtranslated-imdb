I like 101 Dalmations when it came out in 1996. Now, 5 years later, I watched 102 dalmations in 2001. I think it's great, but I think 101 is better because I think it's fun, humor, humor and that movie. more Is based on the same story as the cartoon version (One hundred and one dalmations (1961) I wonder if there is a plan for 103 Dalmations. I hope there will probably be, yes, maybe not. We, dalmation fans, all have to find. If in the future there will be 103 dalmations
