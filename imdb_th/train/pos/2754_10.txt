I love this movie very much. See it again last week after 3 years or more. This film is perfect, excellent performances, wonderful stories, wonderful governance / camera work / music. It's a gift to show to your loved ones. Jaco van dormael is too bad, not creating additional movies after this 5 work. First, really !! <br /> <br /> Today is 3 years and 3 days later. It was never posted because it was no more than 10 lines. However, I saw "le huitieme jour" again yesterday. There is no doubt that in my movie ranked 3rd, with "Cinema Paradiso", which is a masterpiece. The soundtrack is also good. I want to know about the new movie "jaco von dormael". I hope it will make my movie the most complete. 3. If you see this movie, rent it. Or better then buy it. Because you will want to look again
