And this is a very annoying movie. I might be wrong, but this is the last movie that I think Burt Reynolds is an actor who changed roles and sent <br /> <br /> Jon Voight And Ned Beatty is also great They are humble and unconscious. Businessmen who want to enjoy the country They know little about what will happen next. <br /> <br /> Photography and scenes are real and natural. This is before the era of Wes Craven. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing thing about this movie is the fact that this place still exists. In America, rural people still hate people in the city. For nearly a century and a half since the civil war, <br /> <br /> You will enjoy this movie. It was filmed in a rural area of ​​South Georgia which still exists. Don't drive through Mobile, Alabama; The area has not been repaired since Hurricane Katrina 10/10
