This film is the first film from the infamous Guinea Pig movie and one of the best movies. At the same time, it looks realistic and unrealistic, just knowing that this movie is a fake. Stories about women arrested and tortured in many ways Men at the beginning of the story received a letter without a sender address and had a cartoon video showing the torture. The man who caught her was testing human boundaries before they died. Some scenes are shocking, such as the eyeball scene and some scenes are not as shocking as girls who were punched 100 times because you saw fleas in almost everything This movie has a lot of blood, so I will recommend this to people 17 years and older. <br /> <br /> 9/10
