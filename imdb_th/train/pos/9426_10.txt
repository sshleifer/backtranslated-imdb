This is one of the funniest series ever! I laughed until the side broke and rolled on the floor. If only someone would release in America Please specify region 0 or 1 - not PAL <br /> <br /> I know that it was sold in the UK. But that is Part 2 and PAL. Apart from this, let's shake this series. America must know this series Moffat is a genius I love Tracie Bennett's stupid role in this story. I definitely like Fiona Gillies! But Tracie is a treasure! <br /> <br /> Let this show in America! Or show again on PBS. I have to laugh and laugh again! Please feel free to please us! please! <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading.
