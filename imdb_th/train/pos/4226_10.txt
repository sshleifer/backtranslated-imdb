I have a lot of time for all Columbo movies, but especially this film is very well written and the problem solving at the end is very effective. However, my memory of this story is the opening of a scene in the middle of the movie between Columbo and the murderer (I'm sorry if I don't remember all the details here). I've seen: The view comes from within the darkness of the cabinet in which the victim was killed and entered the outside room that was illuminated by Columbo. High back facing the door (and us), pondering the cabinet and almost as shiny as the nuances of light, no sound, camera moves slowly out of the room and approached him. He was deep in meditation, swirling on the cigar, swirling the smoke from the cigar slowly and slowly as he thought. Then the conversation will start to be excellent.
