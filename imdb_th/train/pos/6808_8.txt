1967 In Cold Blood may be like "real" (think about it: do we want to see the real thing?) But it is black and white in the color world and not many people Even knowing what it is and having the opportunity to create it for television In addition, if you remake, you can show things that are not shown in the original book, In Cold Blood by Truman Capote, as the first "nonfiction novel". Truman's book is actually not 100% true. I think Canada's location is sufficient for Kansas for television movies. Looking for elements of sex, medicine and rock and roll: the femininity of Dick Perry is an aspirin, a junkie, Perry plays the blues guitar.
