This amazing movie can be easily summarized. First of all, while the comparison with "Princess Bride" is inevitable, it is almost useless to do that. While both films combine intelligence and humor of adults with the fairy tale background, "Stardust" is different from other fantasy / science fiction movies I've seen. It is a hybrid of those types. But the plot and its script are unique - along with special effects, movie shooting and scores - finished products are not only comparable to everything that appears on the silver screen. Second, The score is very effective in pulling us into the story and the fantasy world as it happens and pushing the story at the same time while creating fear and excitement. The right amount to believe in the magic kingdom with the letters Thirdly, I do not find that the film will be difficult or confusing in the distance. In fact, the interesting interplay between the three sub-digits makes it even more interesting. Excellent performers and excellent acting throughout the board This fantasy adventure (With sci-fi elements) is the best thing I've ever seen since "Return of the King" (not that I compare both). OK, so it's not easy to summarize. But don't let rude and cruel reviews and insulting or pathetic movies of PR make you unable to participate in the best times of the season. In a long time)!
