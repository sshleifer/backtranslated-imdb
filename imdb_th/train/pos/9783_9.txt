How can you tell that Peach and the complex storytelling of many problems are "Small TV thoughts" that are above me In addition, I can think of many movies that have "Small TV ideas" in their plans The fact that you don't like your television industry ("Sue Smith failed to rise above her television background") is especially confusing when you have "Great time" working on TV If we all can have the same abilities as Ms Smith (not me, not a friend or relative) - AFI, who has won the Brides of Christ, streets from Coorain, etc., all done for TV Think about it. What about Other "small TV ideas" such as "Against the Wind", "Bodyline", "The Dismissal", "Scales of Justice", "Blue Murder", "Water under the Bridge" etc. I think Peach is a movie. Which provides good entertainment which makes me interested and most of my friends as well from beginning to end It's far from flawless. But I think it's one of the best Australian movies I've seen in the last few years. Who knows by watching a few more times (think a lot). It might be there with classics like "The Year My Voice Broke", "The Devil's Playground". I enjoy this movie more than "Sommer. "And" three dollars ". I think these movies have a great time, a realistic atmosphere and deal with important contemporary issues. But for true entertainment for general movie viewers and me, it is very common if not boring. When I go to watch a movie, I tend to be aware of the audience's reaction to the movie. (Through the reaction of the movie and hearing the conversation in the hall and Lou) Some people from Peach are shaking their heads. Some people criticize the negative. But many people seem to enjoy the experience
