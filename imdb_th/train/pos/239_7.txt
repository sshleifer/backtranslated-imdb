I watched this movie with my boyfriend at that time and I can say that I don't have the best time because I don't know about Ned Kelly or his story. <br /> <br /> But because of this As a biography, at least important to know what to expect from the characters. <br /> <br /> I don't know if the format of the event is true or whether everything is a fictional story. But the way Ned Kelly shows that being a hero and a fighter for justice makes me want to believe that everything is true. I do not think he shows that he is a criminal or a stupid thief. But that's just my opinion. <br /> <br /> This is a strong western-style movie for everyone's taste. Heath Ledger is great, as always, and Naomi Watts is sexy, charming on screen. <br /> < br /> Let this movie have a chance if it's broadcast on cable Otherwise, I don't think I can recommend it.
