The election of Johnnie To has cool music in the opening credits and good launch designs as well. Kaleidoscope Chinese characters As a matter of fact, all the flicks scored well. I met about To from Bishop Seraphim Sigrist and was quite keen to watch the movie. To what I started the election was exciting and interesting and only moderately violent at present. The story of the Asian godfather's use of the puzzle of the violent elements from the life of the gangster, the competition for the scepter, the true details and the same as Coppola. Rights and being good and satisfying The show is fun and reasonably well. <br /> <br /> The election is well done in a fun and unattractive manner. The ending was really bitter and would make the kids afraid.
