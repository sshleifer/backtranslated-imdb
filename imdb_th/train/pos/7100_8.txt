I saw his movie in Dallas, Texas. When it came out in 1986, I remembered that they gave the prize for the show to watch the movie. After watching the movie, I can see why. This movie is not bad and it is great. The problem of this movie is trying to tell the story. They created a new story, a new character and tried to surround the Masters Saga. My biggest complaint was the plot of Robotech Masters's second wave attacking the world. They also used the same scene from Master Saga. different When I was a child, I loved movies. Unfortunately, I didn't see it as an adult and could not give a better opinion. Looking back, I was disappointed. But now I want to watch movies and evaluate my posture again. That was said to have someone please release this movie for the whole world to judge? I love Robotech and can't wait for The Shadows Chronicles.
