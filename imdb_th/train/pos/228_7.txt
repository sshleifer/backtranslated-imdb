"Convicts" is the third movie. The dialogue and interaction of all the characters that occur within it comes from the wind that blows down from the southern end of the day. And by extending the life of the main character Soll (Robert Duvall) <br /> <br /> This is the first collaboration of director Peter Masterson and author Horton Foote six years before working together on "The Trip to Bountiful "which is a movie that is almost full of action compared to this movie. Masterson doesn't have to be a good director In fact, he was hardly enough on this side. The slow pace makes it a lot of space for the filmmaker, Toyomichi Kurita, who screened the film with the proper sense of light and fragile warmth. <br /> <br /> Because this is the drama that was filmed. Editing or directing courage, everything comes to the show. As far as I'm concerned, there are no flaws here. Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones, two of the best American actors (Both were born in January 1931). Create a true character that truly does not care anything except life. Lucas Haas, a young actor I am familiar with from "Wills" and "Witnesses", plays a character like in his early roles. He quietly withdraws, is afraid and slightly sad. This is a natural feature from him. <br /> <br /> Maybe the name "Convicts" might cause damage to the film. The name, along with the opening scene, seemed to create a picture of a Western style with high tension. If the stage production is slow, do not care you a lot, you have to go through this as well. Otherwise, it may be the movie you want more often. <br /> <br /> Fun.
