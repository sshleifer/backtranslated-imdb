I saw this movie when I was a kid on television. (Thank you to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) and have a nightmare about it for many years. After that, <br /> <br /> Trnka is one of Bratislav Pojar's advisors in Canada. The best animation of the National Film Board Pojar used to be a consultant and work together for the great Drouin. If you like Trnka, you should see "Night Angel" <br /> <br /> The symbol is clear. But use fluently The opposite of beauty and life (plants) will be in conflict with the identity of the hands that wear gloves. The poor puppet hero was condemned despite the lack of political agenda. <br /> <br /> The thing I remember most was the feeling of oppression in the decoration of the little room where the action took place in the characters' world Hand invasion is a complete violation of that world. <br /> <br /> Beautiful and haunted movies. I found a copy of this shorts and other wonderful Trnka shorts at the public library and show my children to see.
