This is a great drama and a great change from the hustling and loud movie today. Is another shop that is based on the truth, which still means many stores that can be created for amazing purposes. Frankly, I don't know. But I like the story. <br /> <br /> A story about a young man in the fifties who was interested in rockets and wanted to enter that area instead of working in a coal mine. As others, including his father, do in West Virginia The big problem is the conflict between the boy and his father, which I think is too much. I want to have less tension between these two people. <br /> <br /> Jake Gyllenhaal, a young man who is still a child, played by the first person assigned by staring at him. He is as fond as his school friends here. It's good to see cute kids in modern movies. The other two main actors in the movie are Chris Cooper (Father) and Laura Dern (the teacher who supports him all the time). <br /> <br /> The film has a soundtrack soundtrack in 1950 that is fun Will hear again: I hope to have more of this type of movie today
