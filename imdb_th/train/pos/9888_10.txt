Although this lovely piece of art uses vocabulary, some movies about surrealism But in reality it has nothing to sort It is the political and cultural symbol of the fragrant back Odyssey of Mexico. Even the past overview of Mexican history will be a confirmation. <br /> <br /> Contrary to "Like Water for Chocolate" "Erendira" expects the audience to meet at least half way to make the understanding work a little. (A good starting point is to see Grandma's character as Spanish: proud, distant, melancholy and above all, weighed down with history.) <br /> <br /> Final action. Of the heroine is clear because of the "results" of history (As in the present) is always vague because we are too close for an honest assessment Rejecting to be bound to a loose end is the only choice the director has to offer because of the ambition of the movie. <br /> <br /> "Erendira" is very beautiful. The big screen experience will be perfect if you can catch It's at home, local art or university screening, but if not VHS, it's better than never seen at all.
