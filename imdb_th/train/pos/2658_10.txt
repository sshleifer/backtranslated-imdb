Kubrick once again expressed his amazing ability to create the perfect atmosphere for movies. Mostly through movies But also using ingenious points, he created a cool and ominous sound that was throughout the film and made the spine feel tingling from the beginning It was an impeccable atmosphere that made The Shining a masterpiece in my eyes. Of course, it wasn't hurt that Jack Nicholson gave one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. The horrific depiction of true spirituality causes a loss of consciousness. Duvall and Lloyd are inventions to be good people. But it's easy to look through these two when the rest of the movie is great. There are also actors with the greatest names of all time (Scatman Crothers).
