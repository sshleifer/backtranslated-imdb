I love this movie for two reasons: 1) Jeff Combs is great in that Play the role of a modern wizard for the handle. (And that is absolutely cute) 2) The movie helped inspire the role-playing game I like. Mage: The Awakening I have shown it at many LARP parties and it is very popular. > D&D Love and Jeff - not a masterpiece The story moves fast and participates in simplicity. Special effects are quite good for low budgets and scripts while nothing is the protagonist. Not too bad. A good way to spend the evening
