Of course, this movie is cute and boring and full of old ideas. But it's fun and that's what I watch movies To be entertained Natasha Henstein is amazing even with short hair. Her smile is clear and her beauty cannot be concealed. For Michael Vartan, I'm sure that women love him. The two of them seem to like the other eacb in this movie. I do not understand the opinion that there is no chemistry between them. I guess we see what we want to see. <br /> <br /> Olivia d'Abo and Michael Rigoli enjoy watching. To tell you the truth, I didn't really notice until I read these comments. But I returned to the DVD and now her conversation sounds more English than American to me. But she is suitable for her role with that exception. <br /> <br /> It is the story of two lovely people who are married to another important person. May be something that shouldn't happen But who says all movies should be documentary? It is more unrealistic than the drama that is played every hour in the tube. That's why we watch them to escape from the chaos of everyday life for a short time and enter the world of characters on the screen. I think these actors perform well. But hey, I am so grateful for being easily torn. Do not understand me wrong, it must be a sensitive scene and this movie has many things. <br /> <br /> I only give 9/10 because I saved my 10/10 for that. But an unseen beautiful movie that I know will happen on certain days If you see an upcoming ad in a movie or movie channel for a lifetime or whatever, take notes to watch. I think you will like it
