In the end, the indie movie that gave a great fear! I see most horror movies that come out ... Drama, straight - DVDs, cable, etc ... and most of them suck ... There are few people who can see ... even a little. It is really good ... Dark Remains is one of the good people. I watched this movie at the South Padre Island Film Festival ... The audience liked it ... and my wife and I loved it! No actor name, I think the budget in this movie is quite low. But you don't know ... The movie looks very good ... The performance is good with this movie ... The story is great ... and the fear is great! While most filmmakers focus on fear, they often forget about and developing two characters that help deliver fear more effectively. Brian Avenet-Bradley Must know that the characters and stories are important He develops both at the point where you care about the characters, you know the characters and are more afraid when they are in danger. <br /> <br /> Watching horror movies that cost between 80 million and 5,000 dollars I found that "Dark Remains" is one of those gems. Try this movie!
