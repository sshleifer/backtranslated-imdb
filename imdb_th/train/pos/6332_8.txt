This movie is good for TV. I like it because I'm a big fan of disastrous movies, although this is a family movie. The accuracy of this film from half and half books. They have the correct character name. But in this book, there is no storm hunter, the car scene involving the Hatch family running away from the tornado is not in the book. Dan Hatch and his friends rode with police to go to the police station for safety. And in the book Dan and his friends are 12 years old, that's all I think Overall, this is a good movie, although it is a slightly more accurate book. Do you know that this book is based on the true story of a small tornado that devastated Nebraska in the 1980s?
