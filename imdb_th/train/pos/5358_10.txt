This is one of the great movies of the 80s in my collection that I miss all the time. <br /> <br /> Running Man is one of Arnold's best and most different movies. And when I saw The Running Man for the first time, I was very excited to see a movie like this. I love all the battles and this is a truly special movie. There are also Jesse Ventura, Professor Toru Tanaka, Sven-Ole Thorsen, Maria Conchita Alonso, Yaphet Kotto, Kurt Fuller, Richard Dawson and Thomas Rosales Jr. who seem to like death in his movie. Killed in movies such as Universal Solder, The Lost World, Robo Cop 2, Predator 2 and so on. All Arnold's fans should love this movie from beginning to end because of the actions of celebrities full of The stars and one of Arnold's best movies!
