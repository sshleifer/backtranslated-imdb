This is an incredible return from the film director Tsui Hark. It is one of the few films that should be worth matching with Steven Chow's Shaolin Soccer. Since the moment the movie begins, there is a good backdrop. Be amazed at every aspect that has a great style. If you are a science fiction or Chinese martial arts "geek", you will love the many 3D effects and weapons created from real computers. There was a good performance (as always) from Ekin Cheung, the player of "Sky King". He collaborated with Louis Khu (Dang), which I was very impressed with his flexible "wings" which deviated the incoming attacks The movements of these actors have expertise in all areas. Not only is it an excellent action But with a rather complicated story Many critics in this film complain about the lack of stories / themes or just "Pushing random debris" and explaining "The Legend of Poo". However, viewers cannot rely on watching Dragon Ballz and other cartoon cartoons that are similar to understanding this movie. Others are famous with the movie " Wu Xia "will have a better image sincerely There may be only one weakness that can be seen. The explosion that was delivered to the enemy in the last fight scene is probably a very damaging thing, although this must be seen.
