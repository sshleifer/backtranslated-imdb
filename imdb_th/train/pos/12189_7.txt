Despite the love of Rita Hayworth, but finding the sequence of the last two films of interest and the ability to appreciate the iconic view of the film, the movie The Lady from Shanghai doesn't work for me. I have a problem with most displays, scripts and overall structure. And in the movie that most people talk about in different situations, that is the Shanghai Lady's issue that ends with a very low "C" or 7 for me. <br /> <br /> Lady from Shanghai is a character Of Michael O'Hara, the character of Orson Welles. Ohara saw Elsa "Rosalie" Bannister (Rita Hayworth) in Central Park for a ride and watch her. After that, he rescued her from the attack and she sparked him. O'Hara was a crew from Ireland and Elsa was born with a yacht with Arthur. (Everett Sloan), her husband, California's famous and powerful defense lawyer They talked to O'Hara to work for them, even with the first booking. It seems to him and to the audience that Elsa is looking for someone to have a relationship with him and O'Hara doesn't want to have. <br /> <br /> Not long after going to work on their yachts, Georges Risby (Glenn Underwood), a stranger who said he was Arthur's partner, appeared at the port of call. Finally, Grisby asks O'Hara to enter a very suspicious and dangerous project. Ohara agreed stupidly. Naturally, it has made him a bit of a problem, and in the end there is a lot of mystery. <br /> <br /> Maybe my problem with this movie may be the fact that until now I couldn't. Is a big fan of Orson Welles and here he produces, writes, directs and spends most of the time on the screen I have never seen anywhere near the majority of Welles work, but I like to like his next movie better when he becomes more level and more efficient. I like F for Fake (like Vérités et mensonges, 1974) and I liked his performance in Casino Royale (1967) when he insisted that he be allowed to juggle at the baccarat table but Citizen Kane (1941) never did much for me despite giving the opportunity 3 or 4 times over the years (Including about a year ago, my rating is low 7 - like my current score for The Lady from Shanghai) <br /> <br /> Welsh performances and the dialogue he wrote for me He is a little bit of Thomas, a monotonous person, and mono alone - he always listens to what he is reading. His performance reminded me of what I saw in the version of Moby Dick of Welles (identified in IMDb in 1999, but "completed" in 1971. It can be seen in Orson Welles: The One-Man Band (1995). ) It seems that he will read the camera and believe that he is a character I am the person who hardly ever complains about the accent. Welles is able to make his Irish accent sound affected and pretend for me as well. <br /> <br /> For other performances I say Can only say that I think Hayworth did very well. Of course, she is very beautiful, which doesn't hurt Many eye candy here, like Welles, Sloane seems to be affected and pretend to me - I never bought his character, his handicap, and so, and Anders was just as strange as it seemed strange. Weird Wells often shot him close to him and Anders often showed a frenzy on his sweaty face. <br /> <br /> Lady The Shanghai structure from here is not smooth in the 50s. The first minute was very gentle and waterlogged, although the drama operation was likely to be contacted by negligence. When Grisby introduced his style, things began to improve and most of them were improved when we Will end But by the time the lady from Shanghai became a crime / mystery movie, it was too late and it became a drama in the courtroom before it happened suddenly, an exciting ending that was almost nowhere and it was too early. For its relatives, excellence. <br /> <br /> The ending is an action story that focuses on talking less, harder, more diverse and exotic in settings and Sometimes it is quite abstract Wales dealt with a blend of material as a director. If The Lady from Shanghai is a mixture of crime / mystery and the end of arty, it should be at least 9, the last scene is easier than 10 seconds, while Welles Change from the suspicious scene of Hitchcockian in the Chinese opera house in San Francisco to another suspicious scene in the Chinese amusement park. The funhouse climax uses movies that have been experimented for. Its donkey It integrates well with the script because it helps to solve many complex and symbolic problems. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is interesting, even if it cannot compensate for the problems in the foreground. Wells blocked the scene with skills. There are many attractive settings from Central Park to Acapulco to various places in San Francisco. Wales created a symbolic backdrop for his actions effectively, from the high heights and steep drops of Acapulco to the Caribbean road, which is like a beautiful and sleek maze. Of the San Francisco Aquarium The love material at the aquarium serves as a backdrop with an interesting mood along with uneasiness throughout the story. But on the other hand, romance doesn't work like a lover. <br /> <br /> Of course, serious Welsh fans will appreciate The Lady from Shanghai more than I do, and of course it's worth watching if you Love Rita Hayworth. In my opinion, Lady from Shanghai is not a terrible movie. But it's extremely dangerous not to "pass". Continue with caution.
