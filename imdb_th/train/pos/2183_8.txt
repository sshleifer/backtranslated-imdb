Billy Wilder was honored as a contributor and his unintended touch was evident in the original story of this ghost writer composer. A clear misunderstanding occurred quickly. Thank you. Heaven and what is left is a sharp and fun mix of melodious music and Basil Rathbone and Oscar Levant. Giving the most cynical thorns (Levant is in a rare form and Not dated.) Surprisingly pleasant and recommended for all types of fans.
