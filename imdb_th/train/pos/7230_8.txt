"The Invisible Mouse" is a delightful and different Tom & Jerry cartoon. It has to chase the cat / mouse and fight as usual. But in a different way at this time Jerry falls into an invisible ink bottle and is clearly very happy about it because he realizes that he can prepare Tom to surprise him, causing him to torture and confuse him. <br /> <br /> Very strange and very funny to see what we can't see: Invisible Jerry It's fun to see things floating in the air without seeing who is doing. (We know who is right) - It's like those things that have their own lives or even like ghosts. It's as fun as seeing Jerry eating snacks and fruits while he can't see. I like the instrumental music played when he can't see. <br /> <br /> Some of the best short jokes in the short term are when Tom sees Jerry's shadow and slams him and even when Tom tries to Hit him with a pan and Jerry wrote "Miss me". I like when Jerry drinks Tom's chocolate milk and can see it again with a happy face. <br /> <br /> Overall short. This has basic ingredients The need for classic cartoons: humor, fun and entertainment. Good art as well
