As other investigators noted, this was an unfairly depressed economic era movie. Directed by Frank Borzage (two Oscars) and written by Jo Swerling (letting her go to heaven, westerners, lifeboats, etc.). It's a difficult movement, well structured and realistic about people living. Based in New York City. They are beggars, beggars and women who are forced to prostitution. But is a community of people, both good and bad, with the same loyalty as any group. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the main feature of this film Is the difference between Spencer's character, Tracy, Bill and Trina Young's Trina. He speaks fiercely, has physical aggression and is not afraid - but Bill is not the character that makes this movie survive while He's a blusters. Trina is really hard to hang (if that word can be used for characters like women). His dedication to him is clear and complete. When she is pregnant, she says she will feed herself if he wants to leave or not. "I will give up my child if you are happy." That is the dignity of Loretta Young's performance (at the age of 20) as a relatively simple character that she doesn't look weak or rely on. But a woman who is aware of happiness when she finds it and doesn't want much
