This movie Breed Evil: The Legend of Samhain has very little thought or effort. It was ridiculed by the details of the ultra-fast "slasher" style and normal disgusting actions. The performances were rated D while the actors showed very little talent and their stupidity in the film was too suspicious. The way in which they express the things that people in their era do is incredibly different. The strangeness of pornography is appropriate for the idea that it doesn't have much space and any respectable space, but rather quickly deteriorates with death. For example, a poor person who had been removed from his anus and that scene took about 5 minutes. It was clearly difficult to fight with children. This movie is a good choice for those who like to see death at Scary and truly tortured
