It is strange But it's impressive about love. Personnaly I never told a strange story in real life, but I can imagine that <br /> <br /> It's a story that promises "sick" from the title. But after I watched, I didn't get the feeling. "Illness", which of course I must have about the rules of society It's a beautiful thing in this movie ... something impressive ... which I can't argue with moral or social rules. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the relationship between Kiki and Alex. You can see how this relationship begins to evolve and end. You feel the moment when this love blooms first, whispering, touching You feel the connection And soon I thought that this was immoral You still hope that it will not break in the end ... It can't be destroyed ... It's not right. You feel the pain of being broken by the deer at the end ... <br /> <br /> But I have to add negative thoughts to this comment ... I don't know what this isn't. * Show * to make sense that these relationships are ill in form only But not in the content You don't have all the stories But only a fraction When the movie begins, the relationship between Kiki and Sandu is already happening. So there is no clue about the nature of the relationship. You only feel the tension between them ... The struggle between the desire, love and desire to destroy this relationship. I think Kiki's line to Sandu said all: "I want to stop ... and if you love me you will do what I ask you." <br /> <br /> This movie may stir some questions about with What is love and what is virtue ... and where is the limitation between them? I don't know what the idea of ​​this movie is. "Love conquers all ... even social and moral standards" or "Love is beautiful ... no matter where or how". But in my opinion, this movie was successful for a simple reason. Do you think ...
