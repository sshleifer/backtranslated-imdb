There are great comments and observations about this movie. I am happy to observe the comparison with Fritz Lang's "M" (forget the abortion remix in the 50s with David Wayne lightly). The real villain is not a tortured murderer. (Jeff Ferry De Munn was a torture agent) who showed anger to his victims, mostly children. He is the target. The real villain is an inviolable Soviet system of systems caught up in his own incompetence. The grievances of people who are steadfastly dedicated (Rea in his best role since "The Crying Game"), a popular practitioner who is willing to use the system for his benefit (Sutherland succeeds in this role. Always) psychiatrist (unparalleled maxdow) government officials who have no reason for prosecutors (Brilliant actor John Wood) and the wife's supporter's researcher (The delightful supporter of Imelda Staunton) This is a good movie. Its darkness and coldness are supported by the description of the damaged and incompetent systems that work against success. There is no need to poke into the exciting excitement that has created many movies. Gorman - it's a scary story - but it adds to the image of a human with a distorted pathology. The success of that story is of course: These are actions that are done by human beings like you or me, where you and I choose to vent our frustration in a reasonable way. Chikatilo makes his anger the most innocent and Weak to us, our children. The great evidence of this story is expressed by equally excellent performers - in general, I know that fellow citizens   สเตรเลียของเราไม่ชอบคำพูดและไม่ต้องสงสัยเลยที่จะได้ยินพวกเขาพูดเป็นภาษาออสซี่ ดีเกินไป หนังเรื่องนี้ดีแน่นอนว่าเหมาะกับฉันและทุกคนที่ฉันเคยคุยด้วยซึ่งเคยเห็นมาแล้ว
