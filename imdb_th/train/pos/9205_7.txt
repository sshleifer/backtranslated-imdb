This is up to me. I like the song R.D. Burman and despite the elements of the story that I find to be very impressed when I watch the movie again. I think the sister plot line is very powerful. In addition, there are more possibilities, such as punching bars, stupid crime stories, etc. that are distracting. (Although not an unpredictable point of view) There is also an English translation by someone who stretched it out and of course I am grateful that he did it. <br /> <br> Like many Bollywood movies that I used to see it as a melodious and opera song, as well as a song sung by a small boy to encourage his abused and unhappy sister. Then the same song sang 12 or many years later. The man traveled to Kathmandu Kathmandu trying to contact the woman again and grow up happy. (She told her brother and mother that it was dead) causing her pain with drugs. <br /> <br The great thing about the 1971 movie is about the movement of hippies that brought a legion of hordes. Came to India from the point of view of the Indians, who viewed them as people who driven India with spiritual hunger caused by the failure of Their own society But in India, life is only for happiness at that time. The hippie dance and dance scene is truly fantastic and accurate in their tone. (I'm old enough to remember) and I'm pretty sure that the mass of the children with the white logo is the real hippie. Hear about the children in the Eastern Caravan to receive this type of work in Bollywood. <br /> <br /> (Not about the true Hare Krishna movement, although the hippie movie sings Krishna / Rama's hymn as same as The true Indian disciples who are not related to the hippies in the film's opening scene) <br /> <br /> ~ Virginia
