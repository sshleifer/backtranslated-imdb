Surprising challenger of this year's best documentary film competition at Oscar It's an Irish movie with heart. But it was produced by Belgium and Brazil together with my guess that animators working in all three countries The product is one of the most beautiful and unique movies in recent memories. The character design is reminiscent of the French animation film Persepolis, a few years ago with a simple character with a thick black outline. This film is not black and white. The thing that makes this film great is the use of only some of the most frightening and shocking colors I've ever seen. The general design of the image is more geometric, with a rectangular or oval character. Most movies can be used to play, find circles - an important aspect of image design is the circle in the middle of the image. All of these geometric designs have a purpose - a story about a young boy who is learning to be an artist who works on illuminated manuscripts (Book of Kells is a real light Bible. The art of movies is made from images. Drawing) The story of this movie is not very deep. But it is a pretty fantasy story Brendan is a young boy in Kells, a city surrounded by a large wall, built by his uncle to protect the Vikings. Newcomer Brother Aiden, Kells, inspired Brendan to show an example. He also inspires him to do things such as leaving Kells and exploring the nearby forests that live in the nymph. Bruno Coulais gives an excellent score, almost as good as he did with Coraline, which I think is good. Most of the year
