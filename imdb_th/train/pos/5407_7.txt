I always enjoy Pokemon movies. Yes, I know that all of them are monotonous in some areas and, of course, even if they are aimed at small children, they are too mature in some fields. Lighten up, it's a movie for children. "But not all of them still have good entertainment, right? In my opinion, they are like that and I enjoy them very much. This is fun, as before, three and more cute. There is a lovely and impressive moment because it is the launch of Pokemon Celebi that is cute and fresh. It's not the best pokemon movie. But I enjoy it more than the third part, although the third episode is not bad and the whole series is fun, harmless and harmless to the popcorn family. This film has a mark of violence and high attention, especially during the climax / ending, as well as all sectors and characters, while slightly monotonous than the previous three sectors. This film is ranked the lowest and has been most criticized by modifying the four feature lengths and it is not appropriate to receive.
