I hate French movies that are spoken too much. But my favorite movie forever is the longest and most talked about French film. I saw it twice in the mid 70s and then it disappeared. But I finally saw it again in 1999 and fell in love again The most amazing thing is fresh feeling every day, like 25 years ago. If you don't see it, don't miss your chance!
