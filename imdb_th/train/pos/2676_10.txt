Every day we can watch a lot of movies, soap ... on TV. Sometimes miracles happen. A great movie that has a real feeling with great actors along with real directors. For me, there are two movies that everyone wants to see: the first movie is Pacula? "Sophie's Choice" with Meryl Streep. The second is "Journey of Hope" As a human being, we must learn about humility, the love of others, about the acceptance of other civilizations, other ways of life. We must fight racism and fascination. We must avoid judging criticism. We must love our fellow world This great movie helps us reach John (Lennon). His dream: Imagine everyone who lives in peace. These two films look hard: look at these, but you are sure to be hurt, but better. Great movies, great actors, scary stories, painful and guaranteed vocals But still understand others better. Enjoy it.
