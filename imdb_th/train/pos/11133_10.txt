Although I love this movie But I can hardly see But it is true So I put it tonight and hid behind my bank computer. I clearly remember But I want to see that I can find things I have never seen before ........ I can't: that's because it's true for me. <br /> <br /> "Users" Others Write the age of the commentator should be shown along with the summary. I'm all for that! It is clear that most of these people who have commented about the "Midnight Cowboy" may not have been born since their debut. They are talking about other films, Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman appear later. I will be openly honest: I am 82 years old. If you are familiar with my other opinions, you will know that I am a professional female imitator for 60 years and appear in the movie as well - you won't remember me even if you Familiar With my nightclub party Do you think I know more about the characters in this movie? You can bet .... !! <br /> <br /> .... And not ashamed. If you don't see them, that's your loss - but there are many opportunities you have. But just don't know Many mothers, dads, sons and daughters surprised you. It shouldn't be a secret. Many actors / actors emerge from the background of "Midnight Cowboy". Who will judge? I can name many giant stars today that grow on trees that are full of trees in cities and do not suffer the least damage from spending time there. I do not judge because these things are human, just as we all - love, courage, kindness, kindness, intelligence, humility: you name the attributes. They are all there, no matter what their looks are. <br /> <br /> "Trivia" about Hoffman begging in the streets to prove that he can do the role of "Ratzo" as a jewel - he can see that driving his car Fighting around Los Angeles - you think they get the data? I can also name many male celebrities who stand on the road and sail in bars for money. Although the nightclub I worked in 26 years ago is world-famous and legal. But I can still name a large star that has to be chased behind our streets continuously.>> This is not surprising today, although it is done in Hollywood and other large and small cities. Wake up and smell the rose. They smell unsweetened because they have different colors. <br /> <br /> "Users" Some people think "Joe Buck" has been molested by his grandmother. Although I can see him in her bed with her boyfriend. But I didn't find that that happened. Believe it or not, children don't always have their own room - because that's what you have to do today. Tell you that there is something strange going on in the master's bedroom. Hoffman's business may ask to change on. The road But some users point out that Jon Voight is not an important actor for filming "Midnight Cowboy" - his real salary will surprise you. I think he was robbed! No one can doubt the clarity he used in his role and did not make him a star for such great work. "Liberation", he defined a person who has the potential to defeat his demons and better for it: there are a few people who comment that he has been sodomized in this film. The end of the 60s may be one of the first movies. Open But society is always up-to-date. <br /> <br /> I don't find any homosexuality between "Ratzo" and "Joe" - they are clearly the opposite. They found a much higher relationship - true friendship. If you do not understand that at the end of the movie, you will lose the confusion of "Joe's", but the shameless sacrifice is clear. Yes, Voight deserves an Oscar for this role - what John Wayne can't pull out. Come and he is handsome in his childhood. <br /> <br /> Hoffman is Hoffman - you expect fireworks. He gave them excellent Wayne got his Oscar. All the characters in this movie are beautifully defined - if you don't think they are still around, you will be misunderstood. - Join some of the "raves" that are younger than those who attend ..... If you can come and see who is trying to get into the hot club - you will see all the evil personalities. <br /> <br /> Brenda Vicaro is a good example of a woman who has the shine of society that must go down to Nitty Nity all the time. If you are shocked by her wonderful performance by thinking "This is not real". Look at the "women" today that are in shame .... and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> The brutality "Joe" appears in the robbery of an old man. Still part of life You don't have to condone But it was not different from the violence. "Joe" clearly named his purpose - in that situation I would give the money faster than he requested. That was one of the scenes that caused the film to collapse, which I didn't watch. I am heartbroken, both ..... <br /> <br /> John Schlesinger definitely has to be familiar with this viciousness to guide those magnificent eye-opening - Waldo Salt was not written. From clairvoyance Everyone who has any part of receiving it to the screen must realize that they are making history and should be proud of its integrity. Perhaps "Only in America" ​​We can close our eyes to undesirable situations. Wishing while other film makers didn't participate in public presentations Do not look, does not mean that it is not there - give the truth to me every time. Cheers! all......
