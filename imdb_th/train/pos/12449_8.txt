Finally, there is a good movie release, Modesty Blaise. But tell the story only But actually it's a "real" story. I admit it's a bad movie if you expect to have action thriller. But if you stop following and deleting all your expectations You will then notice that it is a story that is similar to the manuscript produced by Peter O'Donnell. You have a story to tell about how polite and beautiful it is to you It's not a movie that will attract new fans. But is a movie that tells the true story Some things may be better. But when you can't forget the scary movies from '66, this is a great movie. So you're a big fan, then sit back, relax and enjoy the true story there, along with the story so that Modesty tells her story.
