The closest I have ever seen is a clip showing in the Gerard Philippe exhibition in Paris two years ago. I have no interest in rebuilding and just following the original manuscript for more than half a century after being created. I can conclude that improper fencing is a purposeful aim for an outdated goal. Hollywood has been fighting with realistic swords since the 30s, when the greatest basil of all of them, Pere Rathbone, crossed with Elrol Flynn and others. So there is a technique. Valid After a while, you will not notice and be happy in Henri Jeanson's dialogue reminiscent of Prisoner Of Zenda. Both models Gerard Philippe has a role in removing such roles and Gina. His father Lalabara may be better than other Martin Carroll candidates. At that time, the print work I saw was terrible, and at one point completely collapsed, so maybe the DVD might improve it.
