It is the first and most important flick of the chick. It is a romantic joke. There is a fair balance between the two. This movie has some additional fighting scenes. I don't think that any wires will be used or if they are, they are not blatant. It's not a very complicated movie, so it's easy in the brain, no need to analyze anything to get a deeper meaning. It's easier. The good chemistry between the lead actor and the fun clock. I want it if they bring the true potential of the girls out once, making her amazingly cute. But throughout the movie, they made it a relatively low key. I'll watch again ... with women
