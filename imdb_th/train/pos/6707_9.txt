I know that sometimes it's really repetitive ... but the acting is amazing and Melissa Joan Hart is cute like a button. I love this show a lot and I'm almost embarrassed that I do b / c acting. That is repetitive But it makes me feel good My only problem is that sometimes it may be a relatively low budget - sometimes the actors change and you have to deal with it ... just like Sabrina's father is 2 different men throughout the movie course .. I mean, they don't. Just saying that he is an uncle or something? Even so, I couldn't help but love this show. Harvey and Sabrina created a really cute couple and Salem was absolutely hilarious. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for light and funny entertainment ... My favorite episode is "Pancake Madness" ... Great episode. The best season seems to be 3 ... I'm not a big fan of the seventh season ... When you get into the University of Morgan, join the group and her conversation is painful and bad ... Plus she is an ugly story, so a joke about the way she survived her good image has been lost to me ... but I think it was created to have a really good eighth season. I was really sad to see my favorites!
