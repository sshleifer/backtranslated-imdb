Cecil B. DeMille knew how to create a classic style, and after 7 decades, his westerners met as genuine, not obsolete. <br /> <br /> As a true fan of DEADWOOD TV, I'll tell you about Gary Cooper's performances as Wild Bill Hickock and Jean Arthor because Calamity Jane is the next target. <br /> <br /> We don't have a giant in Hollywood. Lee anymore Plain is just one of the dozens of classics from the 1936-1945 decade that saw a lasting commercial life decades after decades: released again, re-released again. The filmmakers like Spielberg, Jackson, Bruckheimer are like children playing in the sand box. There is no current movie that will be searched in 7 months, let alone 70 years.
