I can't remember when I first heard about this movie. But I rented about six years ago and still be one of my favorite comedies. I'll admit, you might watch this movie if you don't know anything about rap music. But if you are a rap fan, even a normal person, you will love pearl and reference in your heart. One of the best lines in movies is the difference between a b **** and a **; I still use this line today and laugh a lot. One of the best performances comes from Larry Scott, who plays nerd Lamar in 'Revenge of the Nerds'. It's a shame that this movie will never be released on DVD.
