I absolutely love this movie! I hesitate to watch at first because I think it will be too painful. I remember how hard it was when John was shot. However, watching "The Two of Us" brought me back to a more happy time when he was still alive and had hope and possibility I think the author has done remarkable work. Aidan Quinn is cute while Paul and meets challenges. I was impressed with his accent and gesture. Jared Harris is a talented and convincing John. My favorite part is the scene in the park and the roof top - which is so painful. This film made me both sad and satisfied, both of which I felt was appropriate according to the situation.
