The Bourne Ultimatum - Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, in his best role ever) The newest child spy on the blog, brings close personal identities while he is still trying to end C's latest program. IA "Blackbriar" like himself <br /> <br /> I'm crazy about this so much that I watched it as a previous version yesterday and today. The identity is the best I can remember and Supremacy is still a weak link. (But still fun) in the chain for the weakest plot, and in addition to chasing the car at this film's chase is easy. <br /> Hoo, the young boy Ultimatum has a suspicion ?! Even if you know Bond will escape the authorities (And the boys do not make these movies to pay attention to the police improperly) but it still looks good that he did It is incredible to think that two men with a pistol and a motorcycle can create more than 10x doubts as a giant robot worth 150 million dollars in Transformers. <br /> <br /> Talk to Paul Greengrass, who has a strange style, filming this documentary, even though he filmed an extraordinary character. But in places such as the CIA's headquarters that are not allowed within 10 miles with a camcorder It seems that he listened to my complaints with Supremacy, because the actions in the Ultimatum were nothing more surprising, as well as various devices used as a candle holder as a hardcover. (I won't look at that again) and electric fans (don't ask). The song also helps to create a lot of doubt and there's almost no time to bite to do nails. <br /> <br /> The performance is good and evolutionary. Of the character Julia Stiles of the character "Nicky" makes her situation become New high sympathy light Damon plays his signature role along with the backup. But ability (Which sounds a little But actually, it seems that Matt Damon is able to evade the CIA and the international police something.) But the moment of obvious pain His desire for real life can be bored and almost done in the Supremacy, but better than in the Ultimatum (better script). <br /> <br /> I think of a scene in "Goldeneye". The best Bonds, which the character of Sean Bean, asks James that the devil will silence the screams of all the men he killed. Bond regretted everyone he killed and he thought (Or at least make me consider) the meaning of action without meaning, life without meaning and the way the government changes people into resources Even so, the resource knows that Krav Maga and can create everything. <br /> <br /> Sidenote: It is a thing that always disturbs me, even if it's a police officer who is a CIA unit, an international police and police almost everywhere. Where he went Bond never thought that he would try even the slightest to disguise his qualifications or disguise some new passports. Maybe sunglasses? <br /> <br /> If you have a movie about pulse and love action than the Bourne Ultimatum for you, probably the best action movie to be released this year. Of course, you are a fool to see it without having to watch others first. The close contact is over. But I almost want to overlook that This is the first movie "3" in this summer that will match at least if not more than the original and that is saying something. <br /> <br /> A-
