Wow, praise IMDb and Google because I tried to remember the name of a great movie for over 15 years and then killed a tall man! Yeah. <br /> <br /> I won't bore you with the synopsis, the actors and yadda yadda yadda. 'Let you know what's going on. That's why you're here. However, what I will do is explain the lovely memories I had for the D-Movie slasher 80, which was substantially in 1987 when I was about 7 years old. My father used to rent. These horror movies Will he care if his children are watching them with him? No, at the young age, I saw the Slaughter High. What I saw in that movie was stuck with me big time. I didn't see it But I remember that to this day, the most ridiculous killing in movies For example, sex backdrop (Why is there a metal bed in the school?) Has been absorbed Or someone who has been drowned in the pool! My personal favorite though ... The stomach bursts from the contaminated beer. Amazing! How can you hate the movie honestly when one character finds a beer in an abandoned school, like 10 or 15 years later and thinks it's a good idea to drink? Then his stomach exploded? What!? And excellent lines: take my car ... it's always starting Classic all the shit <br /> <br /> I mean, I look back almost 20 years later and laugh at. But when I was 7 years old, I was scared of sh! Tless that funny hat. (Or is it a mask?) That the killer shook the rock all the time, causing me to f * ck out! <br /> <br /> All right, yes, crappy movies. But for nostalgia and comedy, this movie received 9 out of 10 from me, really late every night and hope to watch this late night movie or watch a VHS copy and get rid of your VCR
