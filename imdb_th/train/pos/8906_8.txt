Some men who watch movies and complain about this for a living are forgetting something: DVD menu system I told you, I watched the main screen repeatedly in this one, about 35 times. It's great. The blinds in the cinema are filled with bright colors that are available to me from where it was the beginning. Sum and Bam many times! I was hooked over and over And more <br /> <br /> "Doot de doot, de doo de dodedo" and that's just the soundtrack! <br /> <br /> I slept in my bed with my Vaio. It rained in the flat roof and tonight was soft again. The cat has comfort and my ankle which has crossed me. I popped the DVD. I was hypnotized by the night. "Doot de doot, de doo de dodedo" <br /> <br /> Blob watch it. Both thumbs walk up!
