This is a great movie !!! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time when it came out. I just saw this movie again and it still remains in my memory. Many movies that we watch when we are young still do not appear when we watch them in life. This film is a good example of the 80s of the movie genre that was created at that time. Keaton is the best. All the actors have performed very well and Ron Howard is very good at allowing the story to push the movie instead of force The pace of this film was done quickly with a few slow points and seeing cars from the 80s was too funny as from the 80s. This film is a great movie for comedy lovers and movie lovers of the 80s.
