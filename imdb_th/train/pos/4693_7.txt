Johnny is completely in danger in the traffic category, or missing out on gags and gags, and lacking a comprehensive script or story that makes any sense, but that's the point. <br /> <br /> The actor is pleasant. Michael Keaton, an excellent cartoon actor before he was too serious about himself. Over time, Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito were both acting with enthusiasm. And at least received a lot of laughter from me But the complete illusion is Richard Dimitri (the word "Iceholes" in movie history) as the best gangster to kill English. <br /> <br /> I connect childhood memories with the film. this I watched it often, so I might like to enjoy it more than others. Johnny is dangerous. At least, it's a naive connoisseur of movies that convey some meaning about the dangers of smoking (and sex. ) <br /> <br /> I like it, but it's hard to recommend <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
