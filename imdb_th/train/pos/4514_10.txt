Recently, I watched this movie on a lazy Sunday afternoon with my friends and we had a lot of fun! This film is a masterpiece of garbage. Try it for this purpose! Of course it was not expected. But the actors' performances (And Alberto Tom's madness is the best) weak scripts and low-cost budgets have created many amazing things In the late 1980s and 1990s, Tomba won three Olympic gold medals, two world championships, and nine World Cup matches. About the director seriously: No one knows why Damiano Damiani signed with this movie. All other directions of Damiani are very important.
