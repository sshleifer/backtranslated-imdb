When I saw the Romeo department for the first time last spring, my first reaction was BRILLIANT! However, in the future look, I get more than creating a movie that specializes. This picture has a strange voice that resonates throughout the history of the movie. <br /> <br /> The montage opens to a beautiful picture, which JP Sarro's assistant uses to create his art on this entertaining canvas > <br /> Sarro literally uses the camera as his brush while he takes us by sitting in an audience wrapped up in an action movie that is far more than the traditional style that we are familiar with and dives deep. Go down Dark pattern And the importance of friendship This movie is a dream of a very important director. <br /> <br /> However, Sarro is not alone in this epic venture. The writing that Tim Sheridan wrote was such a remarkable story. > <br /> The dialogue is precise and straightforward for the actors to appear and be charming on the screen. Especially the last scene (Warning: Spoiler !!! Spoiler !!!) Vanessa reveals that she is one of the allies and villains of all time being written in a dark voice that is one of the coldest things. The ending that I saw Sheridan as Robert Towne, the next person Very much with the producer Scott Shipley that seems To have creativity and genius to walk next to Jerry Bruckheimer, I have never seen before in a great production that has a lot of interest in every little detail. Producer work is one of the most difficult films, and Shipley makes it easy to see. <br /> <br /> All in this film combines creative writing, incredible production and expert direction. This is the best movie art. When the ending of this film came to be the only thing that was needed more, <br /> <br /> The Romeo department is a masterpiece and the most important Romeo department is truly a work of art.
