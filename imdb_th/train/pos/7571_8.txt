This game is in the top position. I have been honored by my playing on the PS2, so the graphics are really good. The sound that comes out is above standard. The difficulty level is correct. Wesker must be the best character in the RE series in my opinion. The story surprised me and many differences that I didn't expect. The only score that this game deserves is excellent.
