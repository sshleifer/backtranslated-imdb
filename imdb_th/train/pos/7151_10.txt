I read holes in grade 5, so when I heard that they were making movies, I'm glad! Of course, I'm a busy person, so I don't have the opportunity to watch movies in the cinema. Holstein drove out of town. But alas, we are very busy I was surprised to hear that all my friends saw and didn't invite them! They say it's good. But I read a great book that created a crappy movie, so I was definitely worried. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the perfect opportunity to see it. It was out last week and my parents were sailing and I was left to look after. My sister is 9 years old and I watch and love it so much! Then I took it to other people that I was the home caregiver and their children 9 and 4 also liked. Even my parents liked it and they criticized the movie innocently. Overall, I recommend this movie for everyone who understands family morale and likes hilarious comedians! This movie should be on your list of top 5 "to see" !!!!
