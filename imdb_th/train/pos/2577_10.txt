My father grew up watching George Reeves as a Superman, and when I was a child he had episodes on the VHS and let me watch them, including this movie. (Forward them in the family if you want) and I love it.> <br /> Clark Kent and Lois Lane are sent to a small town along with an oil mine and from the mines to emerge. The city that is considered to be life threatening and depends on Superman to stop this mayhem.> <br /> It's great and fun. Old-fashioned effects and sounds - the crew draws a bit of beauty with technology. George Reeves is my hero when I was a kid and now I'm 16 years old. It shows that these adventures are immortal. And how classic
