This is a movie that is almost perfect. The idea will be repeated by Mamet, but never told tightly. This is about the failure of trust from the human condition. The movie weave the idea that we are all criminals. No one is innocent. Is there anyone who still lives today that doesn't see this drama in our society every day? The film is very structured like the Hitchcock thriller, except that there are no characters that are innocent anymore. This world has been completely contaminated with ruins and everyone is involved in the resistance. Is there anything else to be true? <br /> <br /> Don't miss a lot of fun songs.
