<br /> <br /> I have a problem with the opinion of other reviewers for the simple reason that this is a mysterious movie, not a supernatural story! Is not the only movie that has an explanation "Supernatural" ("Vampire") but turned into a complex movie. <br /> <br /> Other films that are thought of as Edgar Wallace's movie "Before Dawn" and "The Vampire's Mark "(More famous) <br /> <br /> This film serves a great role in creating a scary atmosphere like DRACULA when Renfield meets Count on the stairs of his castle or on the MARK of THE VAMPIRE when Two people look Go through the ruins of the castle and see the "corpse" playing the organ while Luna comes down with wings! <br /> <br /> If anyone likes to touch the atmosphere (often quiet), these movies must have! <br /> <br /> Norm Vogel
