Twisted, strange, charming and hilarious! I couldn't stop laughing at this movie. Darren Stein presented a movie he had created in a family video camera that grew up in Southern California in 1980. It was an interesting image for young filmmakers and motivation and talent. In his handling of the camera Management is a strong word. But do we all not watch movies that will be handled in any way? <br /> <br /> From the beginning, I enjoyed the fact that the boys in the movie seemed to have no shirt as they could. Later, Darren commented on his homosexuality and you can see from the hint (big hint!) Of childhood color. Maybe it's just warm weather in Southern California. Who knows? As a gay who grew up in a good environment, it was very good to see that his parents supported and loved him and his friends seemed to be stunned by his ability to conceive. > <br /> Put the camera on me "Offer to look back at 80, untouched by trade You will remember that I am music and fashion. I am the same age as Mr. Stein, so getting back to the memory channel is welcome. His number of ballet singles is priceless, which has been improved by the T-shirt. Frankie Goes To Hollywood <br /> <br /> The movie manages the dark theme at that time. Child abuse, catastrophe, nuclear war, sexual fantasy, and social disorders There is no worrying childhood and the way Stein handles these interesting things to say the least and hilarious to see <br /> <br /> Look at your first comfort!
