Yaitate !! Japan is a very fun show and I like it a lot! It was screened in our country recently in Hero TV and ABS-CBN every 5:30. It's about Azuma Kazuma, who is trying to fulfill his dream of making Japanese bread to represent his country. He worked in the Pantasia branch of Toyo south, and he also helped his friend (Tsukino Azusagawa) along with other bakers (such as Kawachi Kyousuke and Kanmuri Shigeru) to beat St. Pierre and control Pantasia. Excellent bread from many other countries and not just But learning to make different types of bread, but also learning other cooking. It is a funny and unique anime because they imitate the characters from other anime (such as Naruto, Detective Conan and One Piece) and famous people from real life It is one of the best works of Takashi Haschiguchi and is something that should not be missed for people of different ages.
