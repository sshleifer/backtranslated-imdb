Finally, I'm glad to see the release of the Amazing Stories in the first season of the DVD. I forgot that actors and directors starring in this drama. For the longest time, the only way you can see this amazing series is the 2 or 3 VHS collections or when Sci-Fi starts a new episode. However, when Sci-Fi hosts a recursion, they are usually stuck in the same episode. There are some episodes that stand out in the Season Days like The Mission that they don't repeat. Does anyone know how long this series runs? It says 1985 to 1987 is on the top of IMDb, but I think it took more than two years. If you love Twilight Zone, Night Gallery and Outer Limits, you'll love this series and you won't be disappointed with your purchase.
