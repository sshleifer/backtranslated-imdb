Earlier investigators said for sure. I saw it once being fascinated for a second time when it was broadcast again within one or two weeks of the first broadcast. I still remember some scenes. The setting is the opening of the 20th century. The war referred to in the name is the First World War, one of the scenes set in the women-only part of the public place, which is an interesting historical record. The moment that a woman touches the first time, the woman is one of my greatest moments of all time. I do not think this is a "gay movie", an interesting and gentle love story that both of them are women. I like to watch this movie again; I will buy this one if it comes out on DVD.
