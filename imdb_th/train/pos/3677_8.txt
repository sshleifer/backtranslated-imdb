Fortunately, I saw this on a plane to Singapore recently. (I think I miss it in Cinemalaya) Paris, je t'aime is a collection of 20 short films (about 5 minutes per story) by 20 directors who express love in contemporary Paris bags. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite parts is 'Parc Monceau' by Alfonso Cuarn (great expectations, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) who made one continuous shot and presented. Nick Nolte <br /> <br /> Coen Brothers' 'Tuileries' starring Steve Buscemi as a tourist in Hilarious subway! Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe in 'Place des Victoires' are haunted. <br /> <br /> For Maggie Gyllenhaal as an American actress in the Druggie in 'Quartier des Enfants Rouges' to express their expectations and heartbreak in A short time, that time was wonderful. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood, as a vampire victim in the 'Quartier de la Madeleine', is a cute surreal, while Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell play in pairs. Cute in Wes Craven's 'Pre-Lachaise' br> <br /> Natalie Portman is as beautiful as the girlfriend of a visually impaired French boy in 'Faubourg Saint-Denis' but being executed by Gena Rowlands in the 'Quartier Latin' became even more violent. Every story. <br /> <br /> This film is suitable for those with short attention span because each scene is driven and careful. <br /> <br / > There are many memorable words. In particular, this person came from a husband who cheated, which eventually let his mistress stay with the wife who was dying on her last day: "To pretend to be a man who loves him to become a dear man"
