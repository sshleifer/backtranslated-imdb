One of the best television drama works of the past decade Over the course of five hours, perception and sympathy was constantly challenged because it explored various aspects of the modern British society. David Morrisey was great. In the beginning, when encountering a heavy copper that conflicts with the heroine But then proved to be intelligent and caring, as he worked with her to reveal the truth I never saw Surrane Jones before. I believe she came from the world of television soap. Her performance is excellent as she continues to maintain humor and calm while trying to balance the needs of the case and the stress of caring for her mother. I can talk about every member of the actor who is involved in this spectacular drama. But their efforts will be less meaningful, without an interesting script that challenges your assumptions about any character. It is such an item that helps restore faith in a television drama while at the same time making it almost impossible. Not able to deal with most of the garbage that adds more radio waves
