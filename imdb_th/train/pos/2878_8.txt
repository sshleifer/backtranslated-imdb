For a long time in my life I didn't like this movie or I liked this movie. But not much I watched it recently. (When pending, funny enough) and I like it more than I have done since I was under 6 years old or something Now I'm more grateful, like the classic Disney I have watched recently (including "Sleeping Beauty" and "Pinnochio" or you spell it) <br /> <br /> Now I am very grateful for the animated cartoon "Disney", a clever humor from expressive emotions and plot. Animation can do very well. Often, it seems that you are wherever the other characters are watching. The animation also shows the style of the background as well as the city. Disney changed this from a traditional fairy tale in a surprisingly good way. Changing the smart turning point, like mice, creating clothes and being an important part. (Usually I don't like Disney movies a lot if they're not like the original story. But with this I didn't care too much, I felt that they made the necessary changes to make this movie a good Disney movie. Often I don't think Disney changed the book in a good way in some movies.) <br /> <br /> You know this, Cinderella is a girl who works for her horrible stepmother and stepson. She went to the ball with the help of her fairy godmother and lost the shoes ... <br /> <br /> This is a movie that people watch so much. The family immediately isn't good enough. If you want to enjoy this, I suggest you watch with friends (and close family if you want to :-)) <br /> <br /> I recommend this to people who like Disney, at least someone. Like a fairy tale and for those who like me, enjoy! :-)
