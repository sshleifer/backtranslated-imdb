This film runs around the original Dolemite completely. It has everything that makes a great movie, except for real actors. (Ernie Hudson can't do it alone and you know! LOL) I agree that I killed the first videotape of this movie and I plan to buy the DVD version again as soon as possible! This movie has a lot of mischief! I'm embarrassed to say that I know the song goes forward and back! I love Jimmy Lynch's character to death and he should have won the Best Supporting Actor Award in Blaxploitation. But Oscar was never ready for this! This is a random movie that includes Crooked Cops, Breasts, Chases, Bad Editing and Martial Arts. (Since it's 70s and I can say that everyone knows some martial arts) I think this movie should be revived and performed one night amid the marathon in the local cinema!
