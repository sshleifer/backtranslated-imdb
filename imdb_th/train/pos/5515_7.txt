I read Che's little story before watching this movie and you want to know something. He is a true hero for people because he wants to see equality for everyone. Including other Latin America in general! Now I don't know about others. But for me, he did the right thing by wanting socialism so everyone had to pay a fair share. However, powerful elites do not go for that. So instead of understanding what Che Guevera wanted, they were forced to kill him in an attempt to suppress the revolution. It doesn't work because there are too many other followers who go to get where he goes. A good example of this is when Castro remained his leader in Cuba. As far as I was concerned, and as Je told myself before he died: "If you kill me, that's fine. But you just kill a man, you won't kill the cause! "I can't tell if it's better. <br /> <br /> But ... for whatever reason ... that is The reason I gave this movie 7 out of 10
