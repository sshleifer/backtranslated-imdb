My wife Kate and I absolutely love the series and can't wait for the next series. (Hopefully there will be a sequel!) I like to know what a catchy song called and who wrote it may be because I'm "old and gray" and still interested in life :-) If anyone has full lyrics Please send it. <br /> <br /> Of course, one of the important reasons for my wife and I to like this series is that we are 75 years old and retired, but still have a lot of intelligence. It is good to see performances that focus on participation in society in which older people still have special skills and experiences. The interesting aspects of human beings represent the interaction of the characters and the younger people around them are an important part of the show. <br /> <br /> This series is extremely entertaining and has Very complicated, "Spooks" and "Hustle"
