Anou, the music genre that I like The follow-up of "Laura" of Otto Preminger is a noir movie in New York after the war of corruption. It was Dana Andrew's star, while Sergeant Mark Dixon, a brutal detective who caught him in the hot water with his leader. <br /> <br /> When he killed the suspect In the accidental murder, Dixon tries to blame the offender Tommy Scalese. Dixon is close to achieving his goal when he is involved in Morgan's wife, Taylor, the deceased wife. Of course, in a typical noir, things quickly fall down. <br /> <br /> While this film has nothing to do with camera or intelligent storytelling. But it is always scary and sad It's great and attracts audiences from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Still, like most moviegoers, Preminger's work is not something I watch again. It lacks the verbal intelligence of Wilder, Hitchcock's colorfulness or the Welsh spatial experiment. Like Lang's later work, "Sidewalk" gives a very "muddy" feeling to what Noir should be, instead of being a true art. <br /> <br /> This film has nothing. extra It's about the police who find themselves becoming criminals slowly. In one scene, Dixon explained that his father was a small person. At this time, flirting, this movie had an idea about fate. But this scene is the scene where Otto goes or dares to use his thoughts. <br /> <br /> The camera's performance is disappointing as well. No intelligence on Otto's camera. There is no attempt to assign a camera to everything. It does not play with the area or architecture or cares for the police process step by step. It is only a tripod with Dolly in and out from time to time. Although most people do not care about these things, <br /> <br /> There is only one good match that our hero is stuck in a car full of gangsters (Cage Noir), which itself enters the elevator. Vehicles (another cage) and being taken into the hidden gangster's head, just like Lynch's "Blue Velvet". Otto retopologizes. This movie is like "upstairs" to hell. It works well, but the set design fails to strengthen. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Otto seems satisfied to follow Hawksian. That it is a noisy sound more than a toy that is no longer able to go, such as "Indirect", "Night in the City", "Scarlet Street", "In Lonely Place", "Violence Act", "Bomberang" and "Johnny Eager", "Where the Sidewalk Ends" are one of them. Making film noir, second floor It is capable and engaging. But lacking special magic
