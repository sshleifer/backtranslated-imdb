The musical that Nathan Detroit needed for $ 1,000.00 to play the floating game, so he persuaded Sky Masterson to try and get the surviving young woman's army, played by Jean Simmons, to accompany Masterson to Havana. <br /> <br /> 5 years later, Simmons will be a missionary in the novel "Elmer Gantry" again. There, she is Sharon's sister and here she is Sarah's sister. The same mood and different story. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra is a devil, Nathan Detroit. He is engaged to Vivian Blaine for 14 years and she hates gambling. <br /> <br /> In real change, Sky Masterson is played by Marlon Brando, who sings his own song here! <br /> <br /> The movie was recorded by the best dance moves. Those dancing and singing are excellent. They know, especially from Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely (Johnson) <br /> <br /> All of this is a very good performance.
