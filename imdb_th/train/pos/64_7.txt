This is Paul F. Ryan's first and only full length feature. He has not done anything since However, he managed to get an amazing band performer to show the characters in his story. I don't know when or why the idea appeared in his head. But Ryan wrote the screenplay, which later became his own movie "Home room" <br /> <br /> Busy Philipps put the movie on her shoulder. Alicia, a woman with a problem What we often see in TV series With dark hair and black clothes The package of the cigarette in the bag looks strange and disturbing. (With makeup, of course). There was an incident at her school. Shooting some students died and she saw everything. Now Detective Martin Van Sant (Victor Garber) is investigating this case and as expected, Alicia is a suspect. But the shooting was just the origin The movie is not about shooting. <br /> <br /> Sleeping in a hospital bed is Deanna Cartwright (Erika Christensen). She is one of the survivors from the hospital. The script creates a relationship between them by the school principal (James Pickens Jr). He is helping all students recover from the incident. But Alicia doesn't seem to care about her, so lonely the headmaster punishes her; She had to go to Deanna every day until five o'clock in the morning. Then the movie started. <br /> <br /> I can't explain how I write. I can identify the characters and situations in which they live. I like the truth These things can happen to everyone. And what they say is totally understandable They grew up and tried to deal with things they had never seen before. They are doing their best. Alicia (when she visited Deana for the first time) and Deana (when she saw Alicia standing in front of her) were beginning to travel to define the character and Their concept for the next step in life After class, <br /> <br /> The director leads Christensen and Philipps through their roles. See the difference between them. Dean seems innocent and has a simple idea. There is no complexity in her mind. When Alicia came into her room and saw many flowers she asked: "Who brought it?" "Many people," Deanna answered; Although some days later, we learned that they came from her parents who came every week. All parents' numbers are good representatives. But not as important as the character of Dinah Lonely, Alicia's son. Smoking and roughly speaking But after two days, she found herself back to the hospital every day. Even when sleeping in Dean's room all night When they both fought, I believe that Deana said: "Why are you constantly coming back?" Alicia lonely. <br /> <br /> The ending of the movie without destroying it. A little disappointing It's something I didn't wait. It eliminates some strength of the movie. All unnecessary revelations The destruction of the logical climax that a movie can have It's a great script anyway. And excellent direction Good movie. <br /> <br /> When talking about Erika Christensen, this is the role you want to fly higher. Her role in "traffic" is impressive, but this is a big step. The main role may not be that many have the opportunity to see her in this movie and that is a pity. She didn't do anything wrong since then. She comes out with a good performance in a horrible movie. On the other hand, Busy Philipps, who has proven to have hope in this film (Changes) There are not many opportunities for other chapters. <br /> <br /> I'm talking about Paul F. Ryan (in directing the curse) and I expected that he was sitting on his computer, finished his new script; I waited for his next movie I hope it's the best for them all.
