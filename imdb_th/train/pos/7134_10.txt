John Thaw is a great actor I have to admit that I was impressed with his period in the role of an old, stubborn curmudgeon that was unwilling to accept immigrants from London streets (World War II era) <br /> <br /> being said This movie is also excellent. The story is impressive and ends satisfactorily. Some characters are slightly underdeveloped. (Especially school teachers) but there are no characters that are important to the plot Essentially, the story about the old man and the boy and this movie needs something else.
