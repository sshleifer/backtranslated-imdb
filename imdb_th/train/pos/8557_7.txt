I have to give it to the creative team behind these "American Pie" movies. In general, "Direct To DVD" has the same meaning as making cheap and incompetent movies. Last year, I was surprised when I found myself enjoying the sequel to the DVD "The Naked Mile". The filmmakers took advantage of the opportunity to deliver a small movie that was funny this year. He offers follow-up "Beta House". This is a straightforward truth. "Beta House" created the first few "American Pie" movies that look like "The Little Mermaid". <br /> <br /> Is fun that is not obstructed, not tasteless, laughs Of course, the story is quite loud sometimes. But that is the beauty of everything. In the first 10 minutes, we are introduced to all the main characters, the new characters that support, get a handful of jokes, meet the villains and create a general plot. With the inevitable thing, the movie becomes a limitless player. There are many gags and they don't hold back in this one. I'm talking about semen, male urine, dildos, chicks with penis, sex with sheep, spray, orgazim women and many more. Not to mention the fact that a few minutes have passed without breasts or sex scenes. <br /> < br /> Returning from "The Naked Mile" is John White, Jake Siegel, Steve Talley and Eugene Levy. Supporting the role as the last few films) all actors perform well In particular, Steve Talley (Dwight Stifler) has the power and appearance of an excellent screen. I predict something good for him. This film is filled with excellent movie references for those who open their eyes. Until now, the film's greatest laughter for me is the parody of "The Deerhunter" classic. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that if you are a big fan of the series, you will feel like you are. House with "Beta House". It pushes the limits of really good taste. But in the end it was funny
