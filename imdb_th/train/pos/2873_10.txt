This is one of Disney's top five animation features in my opinion. Cinderella came back perfectly in the full animated movie. (Unlike the compilation movies of the 40s) and expensive depths through multi-camera <br /> <br /> Cinderella is more mature than Snow White and multi-dimensional characters. In fact, every character is quite well developed, except the Prince - leaving the flat as much as possible - we know that he has a sense of humor and a good smile. But that's all Like Snow White, Disney has a permanent impact on the story of popular culture - in most Cinderella models, who are not only beautiful, like Cinderella and Their characters> <br /> Disney's favorite additions: I! It also admires the continuation - Cinderella always loses shoes throughout the story. Adding a homemade set, like the following attacks from a mentor, is as scary as children - I remember the View Master showing this with a big black background and red light! The broken slippers show the unwillingness of the evil Lady Tremaine to give up Cinderella and accept the defeat. - Audley will show the most evil character of all Disney villains.
