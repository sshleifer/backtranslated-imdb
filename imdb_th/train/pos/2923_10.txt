Eddie Murphy made me laugh, resigned on the HBO program. This story I liked the impression of Mr. T, Ed Norton and Ralph Cramden from "The Honeymooners", Elvis Presley, and Michael Jackson with Goony Goo Goo As a joke, I saw this for the first time when it came out in 1984. I laughed very hard. I almost fell off the chair. I still thought it was funny. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy when he was. In "Saturday Night Live" makes me laugh hard. He is one of the best people. "Eddie Murphy Delirious" is his next best performance. "Eddie Murphy Raw" <br /> <br /> I gave "Eddie Murphy Delirious" 2 thumbs up and stars 10/10
