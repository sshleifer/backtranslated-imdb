Worst movie ever? Wow, you can't be serious. <br /> <br /> May be about what you expect for a movie. I live in Oregon, so I enjoy the beautiful pictures of Smith Rocks that are familiar and still amazing and other areas in Central Oregon (as well as Ken Kesey and Ken's sweet pendants). Our Babbs at the beginning of the movie) alone is enough to encourage me to rate movies better than "average". <br /> <br /> Or .... maybe because of your expectations When reading a book a long time ago and thinking about himself "Goodness, no one can create a movie from strange books that are interesting, strange ... especially when 20 years later, when mores (MORAYS - can't put online accents) change" - really Then I was quite surprised when I first watched the movie when it came out in 1994 and still liked it more today. See again. <br /> <br /> Sissy was finely selected. And I'm not interested in what you say. I was surprised by Rain Phoenix and John Hurt. I'm not a lesbian or two or trans. But met with many people who are similar to the people they should draw - and those "real" people do the same as these actors. Tilt the stage a little - always "open". Gus Van Sang is one of the strange Oregon people. But with compassion, he did a good job in altering this book. IMHO
