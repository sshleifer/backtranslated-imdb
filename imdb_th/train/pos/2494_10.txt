The first two seasons of this comedy series are very strange and they are not very funny and have dramatic elements that Bill (mother) is struggling with all the normal problems in life. But the composition is quite depressed and not mixed Well with comedy elements, which is probably the reason it was left After a while, it became one of the funniest comedy series that the BBC had done! The chemistry between Bill and Ben's characters is very funny and there are many wonderful and memorable sketches in each series. The special Christmas offer is hilarious and a real treat for Christmas. <br /> <br /> The show stops when the main actor Gary Olsen plays Bill's death, which is very sad because he is an actor. Great in movies such as Up 'n' Under and being a joke On the UKTV Gold for a long time, but should Each repeated on BBC One or Two for the show. Great comedy for new audiences
