Hyde and Gackt both showed heartbeat and my eyes were still hot from crying that lasted throughout the second half of the movie. You are sucked into the story and you feel the character at the end. The element of blood-sucking that I love, but it's too easy to refute or destroy the movie - mixed thoroughly in the story so that it is a normal novelty in this setting rather than unnecessary random additions.
