I haven't written a review on IMDb for as long as possible. But I felt myself forced to write this! When searching for this movie, I found one review that encouraged people to not see this movie. Don't pay attention to people who don't know this! Nothing is a great movie, full of laughter and above all ... Imagine! Are you sick and tired of being forced to feed the old cycle of bubble junk movies? Sometimes movies like nothing come along and give you something you've never seen before. I don't even care if you don't like (hate) movies, but nobody has the right to destroy the reputation of the IMDb movie. There is a big impact on reputation and no negative reviews should lose that movie's reputation Just say that you hate it and why you hate it ... but don't try to tell others that they shouldn't watch it. We have our own hearts and will make our own hearts. Thank you. <br /> <br /> If my judgment is good, I will say that many people will enjoy this movie. <br /> <br / > Keep your ideas in line with your eyes. See anything!
