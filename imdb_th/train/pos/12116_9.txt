... that the Bette Davis version of this movie is better than the Kim Novak version. <br /> <br /> Despite all the other comments written here, I like the Bette Davis model. <br /> <br /> However: Davis Mildred's raw emotion seems to make me smarter than a slave girl who seems to be a prostitute easily. <br /> <br /> Is a raw emotion that consists of * parts * of what doctors Poor love falls in love He has the mood of despair, the failure of "Being different" - the violent emotions that he tolerated On the other hand, Davis Mildred expressed her emotions immediately and without blame. She has no feelings of despair or failure or "Others", but she survived as a poor woman in the Victorian era. <br /> <br /> Novak's description is Mildred, which is weaker than Davis throughout the film. Davis Mildred had never been so weak that she had to go to the doctor and ask for help. And when he mocked her - for how to treat her body and mind together, and for the use of continuous love for her - she revealed the profound rejection of immoral pride I wiped my mouth !! "Novak's vulnerability was great. Davis's reality is remembered. <br /> <br /> IMDb votes agree!
