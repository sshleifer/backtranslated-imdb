I gave this film 8 stories out of 10, 10 alternate stories, such as Amadeus and the latest story of Slumdog, 9 millionaires. At Kusturica, expertly presented In order to understand, you need to be one of the Balkans. This is a more dramatic and contemporary film than in his previous film, which is boring at this time. I think Kusturica is moving forward with this movie. I like Balkan humor. Photography is my own art. Each scene is an art that has a limit. The plot seems to be a fairy tale. Don't remember now. But remember to read similar stories with my daughter
