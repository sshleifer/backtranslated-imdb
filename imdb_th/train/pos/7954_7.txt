Great sound, adventure and clever dialogue make this movie a very good story. Adding "characters" to the three leading animals makes the story more depth and meaning, especially the relationship between old friends and shadows. And the young Hellraiser. The previous version of the movie was not able to give true personality or motivation to animals. Sally Field is loved in everything. But really projecting in this film is Sassy. The cat prides itself on the wonderful differences between the view of the cat and the dog in life and just the right amount of spirit and the fuzzy warmth to give the story and the wonderful resolution. Even with high scores and beautiful mountain views Ideal for the evening alone or with children. Take off the hat from Disney.
