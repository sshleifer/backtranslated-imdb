I love this movie It analyzes the Italian middle class society beautifully. The remaining people in the 70s abandoned all their ideals and came to a happy deal that they didn't want to be disturbed. For example, an aged psychoanalyst who envied his son and didn't want to think of a more radical teenager. <br /> <br /> For a long time, wanting to buy a video after watching a movie A couple of times on the big screen and on the TV But seems to have disappeared completely from the market, even in Italy, no one in the bookstore knows about this movie <br /> <br /> The sex scene that everyone seems to be doing.
