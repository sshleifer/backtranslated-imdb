The question is whether this movie that is entertaining is considered a "bad" movie? My husband and I picked it up at a second hand video store for 99 cents just because of the name and the fact that the box has the word "Picture of the picture" at it (Vestron is highly regarded as a symbol of quality since I Became the legendary movie "Suburbia" and "Class of 1984"). We did not expect this movie to be full of victories like this. Your basic plot is as follows: Grange thugs goombaesque, this from the planet robbed planet. "Bank of the Moon" and sentenced to prison on a remote planet (I do not remember the name of the planet) is mine for minerals. And other minerals "the governor" of the colony and mine owners are exploiting prisoners for labor Walker Bounty Hunter (Obviously one-third of the whole world) warned the prisoners that there was no escape route because there was only one shuttle from the whole world and they wanted him to manage. Retired prize that suffers from the nightmare that comes back to life. Most movies are set around the "future" car chase (sand dunes with plywood slapped to the side) with many bombs. The planet itself looks suspicious, like Hemet, CA, or one of the dusty Inland Empire checkpoints. But what really makes the movie shine is the surprising soundtrack with many LA punk bands. In the mid 80s, I seriously suspected that this soundtrack had been made vinyl. But it's worth it to buy movies for the soundtrack I can't remember the name of the band. (They are on credit) In addition to Exploding White Mice, because that's the only thing I've heard before I saw this movie. But I'm looking for them. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie doesn't have to waste time and of course you will enjoy 12 beers and your best friends.
