This is a must-see documentary for me when I missed the opportunity in 2004, so I will definitely see the repeat. I sympathize with the main character of the film because this is true. I have a skin problem that is more severe than he has Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB). This is a sad, sometimes amusing and emotional documentary about children Men with severe skin problems Jonny Kennedy spoke like a child. (Because of the muscular cries) and never passed the young age before, but he was 36 years old. Most sympathetic moments saw his bad condition and sent bandages out. Jonny has a somewhat mischievous sense of humor, telling stories from above the grave when showing his body in the coffin. He told his story with the help of his mother, Edna Kennedy, a brother and a celebrity model and a supporter of Jonny Nell Mac Andrew, who won the BAFTA for a top cut. Visiting and Best New Director (Factual) and nominated for Best Sound (Factual) and Best Documentary Award It was number 10 in the Top 100 TV Treats 2004 A, must see the documentary!
