Pierce Brosnan is the latest killer. But not James Bond anymore He is very good at what he does. But he is old and tired. Greg Kinnair is very good as a straight and narrow businessman. Now, when the story opens, the movie shows these two people in separate lives. Then one night they were drinking at the bar and started talking. Suddenly, you found that these two people were pulled together during various events. The story is great, great acting and humor is a joke. I never thought Pierce Brosnan would be funny this way, but he was real and I must say that this movie must watch.
