I was lucky enough to see this on a whim during the film festival and was hit hard with what I saw. I returned the next night for the second screen of the third. Comedy and sharp attacks in all aspects of mainstream entertainment that disappeared without tasting by the most ordinary target audience joined by lonely journalists, avenger members of guerrillas. War Everything about movies and action in an unpredictable and refreshing manner that you leave after the credit is renewed with renewed hope and excitement that the original movie can still be created. Anyone who is disappointed with unfulfilled expectations for something that will spark their imagination will do well in the hunt. (And I mean hunting) items that are almost invisible for all fans of Fight Club and Charlie Kaufman's movies and have to watch everyone who avoid multiplexing like crazy dogs
