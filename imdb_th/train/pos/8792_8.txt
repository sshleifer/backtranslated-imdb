Kung Fu movies that entertain both acting, planning and fighting are better scenes than conventional socks. All actors are characters that are favorite and are martial arts artists. Alexander Fu-Sheng's Proto-Jackie Chan comedy drama is fun to watch and his strict partner shows an exceptionally impressive skill. For me, the only obvious flaw in this film is the size of the actors - sometimes things are a little confusing when the movie shuffles and changes between the various subplots and some characters aren't filled. <br /> <br /> But Kung Fu movies should be considered first and foremost about the quality of the action and the Shaolin Temple will be delivered in the future. It certainly The focus of this film is the fight with a high number of bodies, which allows each character to show his skills to valuable opponents. <br /> <br /> Overall, Shaolin Temple is a kung fu movie that has Low budget Does not depend on the quality of Jet Li movies But worth looking at for fans of my rating type: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Other notes: The 1987 Warner first video release I saw was (forecast) Has been badly dubbed and lacking credit for actors and full teams
