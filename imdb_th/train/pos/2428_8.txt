As an old white housekeeper, I still appreciate that Lawrence Fishburn is one of our best actors. Anyone who appreciates his work, such as in Deep Cover, may enjoy watching the incredible performances of this actor. Since I think this is the introduction of his director, it may prove more interesting. All performances are quite good. If you can't reduce the small world of Manhattan or the reality of crime life (Not an action-action action game) This is not your favorite movie. It is a typical work of Mr. Fishburne following an incredibly profound relationship. I like to see Larry and Anthony Hopkins together in a movie someday.
