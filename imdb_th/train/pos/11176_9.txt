OK. First of all, I have to point out the fact that when I first saw this flick, I was 9 years old. If I saw this two weeks ago for the first time, I might notice that this is just a horror movie that was created. Up from a cable TV with a well-built scene But when you are nine years old, you ignore those facts. This makes me afraid of hell, especially the Zelda-scene mentioned above. (And they still do) today I am attracted to this movie I have to see this thing, maybe once a month and on New Year's Day every time. I watch this thing with 12 packs of beer and a group of friends. It's a good appetizer for a party! I agree with those who say that acting here is not intended. Midkiff and Crosby look like I want Louis and Rachel to have the same look. But no one saw the sacrifice or feeling on the faces of both Hughes and Gwynne. Very beautiful. Recording the scene where "Creeds" underact. What I want to say about this is the fact that there are no other films that are similar. With any Sematary Pet and I don't mean zombies stuff here The atmosphere of this film is unique and unified. In fact, how many times have you seen movies that are superficial in levels like cable TV? But do you make you feel chill compared to the best horror movies? Okay, I caught some actors' balls a few minutes ago. But I must say that every piece at that level too will make the overall performance perfect. But wait, tell me what movie you know, which is similar to Pet Sematary! I like to know that ... and I do not mean the night of death that lives here ... This is a way rather than a comparison of intelligence compared to that.
