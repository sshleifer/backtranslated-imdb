"The Last Wave" is one of the movies that requires a lot of thought. This name refers to the Aboriginal doomsday theory: there will be a last wave that will destroy everything. <br /> <br /> David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) is a Sydney lawyer who hired to protect the natives. During this time, there was a special heavy rain in Australia. While protecting Aboriginal people, David learned the last wave theory and began to wonder if it was just a myth. <br /> <br /> The final sequence of this film is a metaphor for going down. In the mind of Peter Weir created a terrifying movie. But thought provoking The native actor David Gulpilil (who you may have seen in "Walkabout", "Crocodile Dundee" and "Rabbit-Proof Fence") provides an interesting supporting role as a defendant. The "Creation" feature on the DVD Peter Weir describes some of the passive movies, some of which are related to the background of Richard Chamberlain.
