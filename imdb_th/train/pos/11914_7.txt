Do you know that this movie is not a great story? But I mean, c'mon is about angels that help the baseball team. I found the story to be hilarious. The boy's father said that he would bring him back if the angel won the flag. (Because he knew they wouldn't) The boy prayed to his false god to help the angel win all the time (through Angel Christopher Lloyd, RIP) and eventually his father didn't take him back and ride his motorcycle. As soon as the children face it, it's hilarious until Danny Glover uses it and be friends. <br /> <br /> I guess the interesting thing is that the old woman was left alone to die with her project and Her story Although the true winner here is God. Because later he got a job as a writer to show a lot of jokes Get 10
