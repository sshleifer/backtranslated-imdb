I think JEDI is now a sequence that will be considered "the latest" in popular fairy tales and is a very good thing, like many of these things. And I admire the integrity of Luke Skywalker as a character (and Mark Hamill as an actor). After hearing many negative things about Ewoks, they are not bad. I am happy with the exciting chase within the forest, and I feel that there are many emotions in this chapter. The ending (with some new additions, I understand) succeeded in completing all 6 chapters. To become a wonderful fantasy story, I know that the real Star Wars fans hate George Lucas for the changes he made to the original movie. But being a novice in relation to these movies is quite late in life and doesn't miss things that I didn't know before. I think he made all 6 movies perfect as all legal entities. Oh and wrong - Carrie Fisher looks quite tasty in her skimpy outfit.
