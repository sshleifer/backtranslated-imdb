This story is based on two pieces, Edgar Allen Poe. ("The Fall of Usher's House", "The Dance of Death" (Poetry)) is actually quite creepy from beginning to end. It is similar to some black and white movies about people found in old homes (such as "The Cat and the Canary", "The Dark House", "Night of Terror" etc.) Boris Carloff. Is a crazy inventor of a real doll that threatens guests He died at the beginning of the movie (or he?) And residents in the house had to experience a lot of horror. I will not go to see the details here. But it is a must not miss for fans of old puzzles in a dark house. <br /> <br /> Watch it with lots of popcorn and soda in a darkened room.
