I have to agree with other people who post. <br /> <br /> I watched it recently. But I will tell you whenever I hear music from this anime, I think of a beautiful story. The character animation and the feeling I received when watching it made me cry. (Feeling happy but sad) However, I found that the love story in that sense felt difficult to run, and they didn't explain things correctly, but it didn't destroy any viewing experience One <br /> <br /> I came into this anime a lot. After the end, I had to do research. (And watch the ending a few times) and I found all the answers and many more I like the way they set the legend in history to this anime. It's amazing and makes me want to research more and more (I'm always interested in historical figures related to this anime) > <br> I think it's probably a longer series. But if this is all they have to work with, they will pull it out well. I would like to recommend this to everyone who likes an emotional anime with a great story, a well-built character. (Some mysterious) and a little fantasy action. <br /> <br /> In addition, although it's a H game, there is nothing in it and I like it like this. (I have no problem with anime that is mature in most cases. I like it)
