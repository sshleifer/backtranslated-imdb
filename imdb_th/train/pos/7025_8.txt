I found this to be a charming, lively and fun adaptation. With two major errors, except the actors are wonderful. I have to make some comments earlier - Chynna Phillips is a terrible person like a teenager. At age 27, she is too old. (And yes, it shows) and lacking singing "chops" for Broadway style songs Vanessa Williams is a good enough singer and for non-her dancers is enough. However, she is not a Latina and of course her character. She is also very strong all the time, which makes her weary. <br /> <br /> The girls of Sweet Apple fans of Conrad Birdie are truly sparkling. I also enjoy Tyne Daly's performance, but in general I am not a fan of her work. Finally, the Shriners dance is a riot, especially the three dorky in the bar. <br /> <br /> The movie is suitable for the whole family and I highly recommend it.
