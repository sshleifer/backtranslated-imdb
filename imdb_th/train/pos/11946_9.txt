*** 1/2 Scarlett Johansson, Woody Allen, Hugh Jackman, Ian McShane, Romola Garia directed by Woody Allen After he joined Johansson in "Match Point", the two came back again with "Scoop", riding a corkie, funny and funny. When a student journalist (Johansson) discovers a new scoop from a deceased journalist (McShane) when she enters the tools of a magician crippled (Allen) the existence of a new Tarot killer in London that may be Peter Man Lyman (Jackman); While Sondra and Sid act as a detective, Sondra falls in love with a handsome actor. Finally, Allen did not score as well as "Match Point", but definitely more fun. I laughed more than I expected. One year must watch.
