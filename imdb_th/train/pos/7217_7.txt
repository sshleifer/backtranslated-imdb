Modification of a stage is often an important mistake. They often came out to look like a film camera stuck on the stage (such as "Night Mother"). Sidney Lumet's direction made this movie alive, which was especially difficult because the picture didn't challenge anything. Still, it's good to see what it is. The chemistry between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve is great. The change of their relationship is surprising. Ken was great and Reeve was given the opportunity to perform. <br /> <br /> I agree that I never saw the drama of Ira Levin. But I heard that the modification of Jay The script is incredibly complex and can make you guess. "Deathtrap" is a very entertaining movie and is suitable for fans on stage and almost all screens. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
