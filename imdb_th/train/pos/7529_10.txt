Two years have passed and most everyone looks different, some are good and people are getting worse. I am still happy as much as I did before. <br /> <br /> Some of the flaws that they have, though, like changing the Joker. Now, he has no red lips. Hamill, which is my advantage. Guessing they made Poison Ivy white, implied that she became like a plant and Catwomen looked very different and was not "attractive" like she was in the original. <br /> <br /> Scarecrow didn't look good. Only Scarecrow <br /> <br /> The list is not as dark as the original. Because Batman didn't work alone as he had done Most of the time working with Batgirl and Tim Drake's new Robin, while NightWing (Dick Grayson) comes to help often. Batman surrenders the yellow logo and has a black wing on his suit and looks like he is a little bigger. But still kicking a lot of ass. <br /> <br /> The list is not as good as the original because most Some new improved characters But the story is as exciting as ever, and the dialogue remains excellent. "Over the Edge" may be one of Batman's greatest episodes of all time. Make sure you check. <br /> <br /> Overall 8-9 / 10
