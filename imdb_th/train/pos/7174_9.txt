I drove from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to see the premiere - and really glad I did. As an avid movie fan and a long-standing Northern California resident, I was surprised that there were many award-winning Oscars in the Bay area. As a true fashion designer who wants to live in the Bay area compared to going to LA, George Lucas's comments about the realization of the community and the vision that truly reflects me /> Hey, if he and other filmmakers can create it in SF, other artists can do it. <br /> <br /> Would like to recommend this movie.
