I apologize only once for this movie: There are far too far, wide angle, and if they make you angry more than enough, patience is enough. They drove me to find the first ten minutes. But after that I had a break with the horrible movie. And shortly before the movie ended, I stopped interested. This is too funny to be easily destroyed. It's a hilarious joke. The flair of every actor's cartoons is impeccable and many users express their feelings through the lens of the fish-eyed lens. They may not care about them very much. In fact, 'Mystery Men' are not only fun but not just But only wise But still deeper than anyone thinks is reliable For example, the jokes in Austin Powers 'movies include less funny jokes. Here, the words of `Mystery Men' bite when something is worth biting and gently biting when there is no It doesn't ridicule old things, which is the opposite of what some critics have. (I have to assume that they are not interested) have said that it has never lost the idea. <br /> <br /> The `super 'hero is an attractive group. Of course, they have a second rate. But they are not just the second rate For example, the Blue King didn't do anything except throwing a knife in person and he wasn't good. On the other hand, he is not badly funny. He is better in his limited space than most people, and he practice diligently. He is not a clown, which makes him a funny character if he is If Superman is Christ in a mysterious cloak, a mysterious man is a minor minority, all from the foothills of Olympus, in a very fun robe, still very much loved.
