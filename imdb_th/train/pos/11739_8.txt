"Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark" is "Harper Valley PTA" with a touch of supernatural. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) walks out of the job as the owner of a horror film on television after the new station owner. Working with her Now she just shows up in Las Vegas to take her through.

But he is determined to make his hands aware of its power Elvira, then, the face that was burned at the pole for the old spell of the city and the battle between her and her uncle The story is quite easy. But the humor and characters that are well developed make it move well. "Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark" is filled with humor that is cute, scary, scary and clever through the eyes of many jokes, playing musical scenes, music and parody. The touch of superstition of the movie makes this movie one of the best horror movies ever. It's a well-crafted movie with great performances from all the actors, including Edie McClurg and Jeff Conaway (of "Grease."). There are also many great special effects (including myself). That the character Elvira will be able to present a feature film or not, and the answer is delightful. YES!
