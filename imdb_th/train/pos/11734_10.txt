This must be one of my favorite movies, which is unlike 'Elvira's Haunted Hills' that is weak ... However, I love the way this movie is the story of the Wizard of Oz 'goth / com' <br /> <br / > Elvira is a German Dorothy who is trapped in an unfamiliar town after the death of a good witch. (Elvira Aunt Morgana) ... She received a "Ruby" ring that had tremendous power and was needed .. She attacked four characters that she intended to help grow throughout the story too. Dog Towing With her uncle (Wicked Witch of the West) that Elvira realizes that she has the strength in her and ends up defeating him. Eventually, she was sent out by the townspeople after winning their hearts and finally reaching her destination in Las Vegas. (Dorothy's home in Kansas) <br /> <br /> There are many references from The Wizard of Oz throughout the movie ... She and her uncle both claim lines related to their parallel characters. Elvira: "You must be Aunt M and you must be Uncle Remus .... There's no place like home. There's no place like home!" Uncle Bad Vinny: "I'll take you with you and your little dog. Also! "<br /> <br /> There are signs that Elvira passed when walking on the first road. <br /> But apart from this, the fact that one of the scenes in which she "tore away, hmm ... I mean, inspired by FlashDance" is a pure genius. .. and if you don't laugh at Performing her Las Vegas at the end of her "very 80's" program. You don't have a bone camp in your body ... The film is Cult / Camp Classic.
