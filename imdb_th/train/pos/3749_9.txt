I laughed a lot while watching this. It is short, fun with many theatrical performances, music and strange things. The character is simple. But their simplicity adds style to humor. The dialog box is often funny and unexpected, and from the first line to the last everything seems to flow amazingly smooth. There is Max that clearly brings a horrible life. And having Edward who is not sure what his life wants to bring My favorite character is Edward's crazy Tom. Tom has a short but memorable role. It is highly recommended for everyone who likes silly humor and you can search online now which is a bonus! I'm a fan of all Jason's cartoons and can't wait to see what he comes out next time.
