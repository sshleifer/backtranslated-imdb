After just completing the Cronicles of Heroic Knight a few minutes ago, I found myself extremely please. But the question still exists more than me While it appears that the first 7 or more are actually telling the story of Lodoss War's first record, the truth is that they are not really. It seems that the creator of CotHK has a different vision of how the original manuscript ended. (And that may be the reason that the first 7 episodes happened) but I did not find that to be so. CotHK says it started 5 years after the Heros war, which Parn is part of I think the director made Episode 5, the first episode seems to be a summary of the original, just for the audience to receive a little warning and introduce their characters and actions because they look less after the series enters. Spark's story Now when the series turns into Spark, we will find ourselves kicking for 10 years (15 years since the Heros war). In some cases, Spark and his team are similar to Parn and his team when traveling. Started to gear, especially the love story that happened between Spark and Neese. I still think a lot of times throughout CotHK that I threw in the original series, and if not for Spark's long blue hair, I knew I would press The more than once to make sure it has the correct disc without. Considering these important scenes, however, the author did well in defining the credible characters and remarkable stories. The only thing that hurt me is Ashram and Wagnard. Hmmm ... Do not understand me wrong. Both are great villains, although the only evil feature of the hermitage is that he supports Marmo. Maybe I miss. Something while the series describes that part As long as the sequel continues, I recommend CotHK. I put both CotHK and, moreover, the original record of Lodoss War that is above the trilogy of the Lord of the Rings. Both are better than anything I've seen or read. I highly recommend this.
