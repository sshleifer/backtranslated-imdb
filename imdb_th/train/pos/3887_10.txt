I managed to cut this thing out of my satellite. But I like to be released first in a format that we can use here in America. Eddie is truly famous for his performances from San Francisco. I can't remember laughing hard at a regular job. My wife and I both enjoyed this tape and his work with Glorious. I just wish I could buy a copy and help support Eddie financially through the purchase. We need more performances for him.
