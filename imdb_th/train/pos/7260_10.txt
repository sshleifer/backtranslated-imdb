Hello everyone. My name is Larissa. I am 13 years old. When I was about 4 years old, I looked curly, sued and it made my socks. I watched this movie for a long time. Actually, about 30 minutes ago I just finished watching. Alisan porter is A very good actor and I love this movie. It's very funny when you manage cards. Every time I watched this movie at the end of my life, I cried, so I said that I knew I was only 13 years old, but it was very impressive. It was really strange at Alisan, 25 years old now. Every time I watch a movie, some people tend to be kids and movies come out like the year after they did it, and when you watch it and see how people in this movie are really traumatized, how can they? The car went from one age to the next. Like Harry Potter, that movie was great. But Daniel is about 12 years old in the first film and I'm about 11 years old. So how can he get from the age of 12 to 16 years in the next 4 years and I'm only 13 years old? I'm not sure if he or now is 16. Now, I think he's almost 18, but that's strange when you watch a movie and the story continues there for about 4 years. You, when they were only 1, at the end, I'm not sure I have a big deal. Imagine and I like to insult it. I am a computer person. But I like to do many things for children as well. I'm very smart, like someone who has problems in this movie. But one thing I don't like in this movie is when the man called the foster home and was sued. I would kill that man if he did it in real life. Well, I would stop writing. But there are a lot of children in it. The head that has to go out and if they are not, the child will not learn. <br /> <br /> Larissa
