And I will tell you why: Anyone who decides to edit this film to fit the television should not do it. Everything related to drugs is eliminated and covered up !!! How do they ask you? They certainly did not do very well. However, instead of marijuana that Cheech and Chong should have in possession, they were said to have diamonds! Even so, the characters still circle in the haze of marijuana placed on their way without any explanation!
