This is the favorite Tom & Jerry cartoon that is perfect for Halloween. I know it is not disgusting, but there is a 'trick' in "Trick or Treat". As Jerry does with Tom and the blind, the window and the vacuum cleaner with a normal collar to make it like a ghost; But still like to put it on my Halloween cartoons. In this short time, Tom is listening to "Witching Hour", which is a radio program of ghost stories and scared of horror stories that have been told. Half way of the drama story (I stood at the very end of my heart, plunged into the throat, chilling the ice on the spine) began to happen to Tom .. truly, and Jerry observed everything and laughed at himself, thinking that he had made Tom afraid by making He is afraid <br /> <br /> I like the ending. It's funny. And you know that this short is the first four cartoons that Tom Attack Mammy Two Shoes; Others are The Lonesome Mouse, Mouse in the House and Nit-Witty Kitty. And in short, this is the first twenty-five comic book that Tom speaks. The other ones are The Lonesome Mouse, The Zoot Cat, The Million Dollar Cat, The Bodyguard. , Mouse Trouble, Mouse Comes to Dinner, Quiet Please!, Happy Traps, Solid Serenade, Mouse Cleaning, Texas Tom, Mucho Mouse and The Cat Top and Bottom Mouse Directed by Chuck Jones
