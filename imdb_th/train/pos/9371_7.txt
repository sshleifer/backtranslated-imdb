One of my favorite things about Robert Ludlum is that when you think you understand it, it goes in a completely different direction. There are many reversals in this film that I have a sore throat. <br /> <br /> One thing I like about director John Dahl (Kill Me Again, Rounders, Unforgettable) is that he can. Depending on the supervision and in this case write (With his brother Rick) is a good thing. <br /> <br /> Now add Nick Dennis, Hopper, Lara Flynn, and JT. Walsh and the actors and you have a story that will make you interested, even if they play as characters that everyone is perfect. Dahl seems to bring the best out of people and this will make you interested and guessing until the end.
