The little movie that sees this is something that is tired and relaxed. It distracted from the ancient concept and used to relieve the idea. It's about women who are looking for lost lovers. Psychiatrists who suddenly disappear without reason Her search led her to a vacation home with an unusual group of people in the true giallo style. The murder is far away. <br /> <br /> The actors are quite good. We have Aldofo Celi (Thunderball ), Alida Valli (Suspiria), Horst Frank (Cat o 'Nine Tails) and Sybil Danning at a very young age (Queen screamed in the 80s) The leading actor is Rosemary Dexter. And while I'm not familiar with her, she works well in bringing pictures. <br /> <br /> One of the features of Eye in Labyrinth is its music. It's a jazz rock soundtrack. This score, composed by Roberto Nicolosi, reminiscent of Miles Davis, especially his work in a quiet way. It is a great soundtrack and gives the most different feeling from this movie. The fusion groove emphasizes the sluggish atmosphere and the view of the sunshine and the sea front that most movies create. <br /> <br /> This is a giallo so we need to talk about the murder. This movie is very short on this issue. Of course, it's not useless for them. But they are not far apart The first dream murder may be the best offer, including the order of burning a memorable car. But this is not a particularly violent movie Still, I don't think it would be disappointing for fans of the genre. The mystery is quite interesting and there are enough unusual characters. (Saboey, an idiot and an improper accent that doesn't do that) and strange moments to satisfy While the slim factor is attached to the nakedness that lies throughout. <br /> <br /> The eyes in the Labyrinth play like the mysterious Agatha Christie, the Giallo version, as it has a group of characters that Not sympathetic to all the houses Under murder charges; We have the necessary retrospective events with details of the connection to the last hour of the murder victim. (Not very satisfied) while this is not an example of the type of level But of course, it's differently attractive because it doesn't borrow heavily from other subcategory movies. For those who like giallo, I give a thumbs-up and hopefully someday there will be a good DVD transfer. It definitely deserves treatment.
