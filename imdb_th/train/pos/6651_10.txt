Great Gandhi: <br /> <br /> The greatness of the world is connected with people such as Alexander the Great, Ashoka the Great. For their greatness lies in being praised as More human Gandhi was called excellent because it was not really big. But more than human beings, because I always believed that bringing humanity into us is the greatness of human lies. Gandhi is a human being and a human being. In the struggle for humanity But not his enemy I would like to move to see the movie review. <br /> <br /> About Gandhi My father: <br /> <br /> My father Gandhi is a non-Gandhi movie. But about his son, Harilal Gandhi, when telling the story Of a son whose father is one of the greatest human beings in this world Great Criticizing Gandhi's failure as his father and son, I want to say that it is Gandhi's sacrifice made as the son's father for justice as a national father. I want the essence of this film not only But only in Indian territory, Gandhi But through the heart of the people of this world. <br /> <br /> True Man Gandhi Jaihind
