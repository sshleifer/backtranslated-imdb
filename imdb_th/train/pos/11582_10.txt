For those who are in the Daily Mirror strip, watching this movie is a nostalgic exercise. In that context, it's great. But the younger audience will find humor and will miss the point that the actor is a cartoon character. The plot is still relatively weak for the current audience. But reflects the innocence of the 40s and 50s as well Jane, you have to remember that it is part of the imagination of the war escapeers that have been built over the years to promote the morale of the soldiers. She gives two meanings as "undress" in a cartoon strip. <br /> <br /> The story has something in common with the story of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Ryder. The theme seems to be familiar to readers. In those days, the Nazi group was spilled out by the Englishmen who had failed unequally and set in the wild Africa. The rest of you is a damp patch. <br /> <br />
