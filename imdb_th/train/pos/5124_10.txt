This is a great movie that I don't think will get enough credit for Saturday Night Fever or Grease in John Travolta's career. But the pig was too head to accept his feelings with her. He wants to participate in mechanical bull riding because he thinks it will show his manhood. Although it was created in the 1980s, but still in time today The excellent country music soundtrack is excellent. 10/10
