I have to admit that Holly is not on the watch list for the Edinburgh Film Festival. However, after the art director of the festival introduced this film to over 200 audiences before screening other films, I decided to go and watch Wow! <br /> <br /> This film deals with the problem of prostitution, children that are very difficult and can be done without any compromise. I find myself crying many times in the movie and laughing at others. Speaking about the emotional roller coaster <br /> <br /> The leading actor (Thuy Nguyen) is a Vietnamese newcomer. (Who was only 14 years old in filming) and had to deal with this incredibly complex and difficult role She reminded me about the Keisha Castle-Hughes from Whale Rider, but the role here is more demanding because she has to play as a prostitute. The chance that she will receive many awards. <br /> <br /> The main story about a girl who was sold to a family, prostitution and sex slavery in a brothel in Cambodia. She met the Americans. (Played by Ron Livingston in an amazing role that we have never seen from him), which after spending time with her, decided to help her However, at that time she was sold again and he was searching for her in Cambodia. The story turns and the audience can't predict what will happen next. <br /> <br /> The performance is strong across the board, with many interesting international actors. Udo Kier (Believe as a sex traveler) , Virgine Ledoyen (a social worker) and Chris Penn (one of his last films) Asian actors are also excellent. <br /> <br /> Although the film is related to difficult stories the But focusing on telling interesting and powerful stories It was taken in Cambodia. (Some scenes in the real working brothel) add to the feeling that you are watching a documentary. It seems that DP uses a lot of camera phones and close-ups and overall it makes you feel like you are there. One of the stories <br /> <br /> After screening, I listened to others. The members of the audience as they departed and it seems that they were all shocking. This is not easy to watch and I greet the filmmakers who didn't create "Hollywood Film". <br /> <br /> It's the best movie I've ever seen in Edinburgh Film Festival. Comments shared by my husband.
