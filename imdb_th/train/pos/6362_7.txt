I've seen "Speed ​​Racer" for some time, but I've never watched it at all, and I've seen other programs that have these characters dressed like flying birds, a boat called Phoenix and revolving around a space ship that looks like Giant ocean The boat and it flew back sometimes for some reason and was very dark and difficult to understand for those who might be five. Even though I watched almost every episode and the surprising thing for me now is that this program has some resolution. It ended. The villain did what was different from almost all American cartoons that had no conclusion, such as the final episode of One Transformers that ended with Galvatron and this new villain vowing to get Autobots, Dungeons and Dragons With the children, making it home, with GI Joe and Cobra still there, ready to try again and continuously. This is over and has made a robot that is quite cool that has received new weapons As the performance progresses, it begins with tenderness because it cannot fly and has only a few great weapons. As it happened, he had a cool punch like Android 16 used with Cell in Dragonball Z. Then that weapon was developed to combine the razor to shoot. Then the big robot has wings so that he can fly and there are also many weapons included in the wings. He will receive a few allies in the female robot and is a rather funny person named Bobo in America. But consists of Dr. Hale only, but still a strange person who is half a woman and half a friend with a flying head An interesting show and it's a good thing to see the conclusion.
