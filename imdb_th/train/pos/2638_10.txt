One of the best movies for all ages You won't be able to see the LION KING again without thinking of the special history that this movie added for nearly 40 years. I watched this story with my wife and two sons after work tonight. & I didn't laugh and enjoy the movie. A lot in a long time <br /> <br /> Take time to watch the kids. It will remind you that Disney used to be when you were a kid.
