When I watched this film rigorously about the strength of the examiner's scoring, I was most surprised. Although clearly low budget But it is a sign of intelligent intelligence For example, when Julia wakes up in a strange house and looks out of the window, I find myself thinking that her lonely feelings will be improved with an external shot that focuses on her face. And lo and behold! The next scene is the last picture of a house standing alone on a cliff at the water's edge. There are other examples of how intelligent directors can raise their films to a thrilling level. But be assured that they will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> For the show, George Macready is his usual eerie identity, almost keeping his peace. Nina Foz is a surprisingly good person, as a girl who works absurdly to not give up without quarreling, but Dame May Witty, oh boy. She also makes me wonder in my own eyes and believe her Can escape from her evil plans <br /> <br /> This is a genuine diamond in the rough and should not be missed.
