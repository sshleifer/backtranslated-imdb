This movie makes my tears; John Robert really knew how to reach the heart. The audience directed this wonderful image in which life was seen through Polly's heart and heart. We discover from time to time with the help of sensitive and talented directors such as John, even small creatures like Polly. I can't stop my tears even though this movie ends happily. This is a great story after thousands of films that I have seen through my life. "Polly" has touched me deeply. This is after "Ugly Duckling" The second image that really made me upside down.
