Love characters and stories Very funny with lots of action. Thomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carrer performed great. I enjoy the interaction and interaction of Griffith and Career. Donald Southland plays a surprisingly satisfying and sympathetic killer. All three actors are in my favorites and make them participate in this film for special practice. It is also my great DVD collection. I would like to recommend this movie if you like ... Mr. and Mrs. Smith, the killer, the LA representative who is secret, long kiss, good night, hell and all nine yards ... You will love this movie
