Saw this flick on the last night ENCW for the third or fourth time Enjoy it so much. I ordered a DVD. This is remarkable and definitely the first pair of Mann-Stewart pairings over here. In general, although not as powerful as The The Searchers, there are many clear symbols about achieving manhood. But most of the performances are Stewart Millard Mitchell, his partner Shelly Winterers and Waco Johnny Dean - Dan Duryea. Steve Miller (not a joker) is interesting in As a handsome boy who should be a hero interested in Lola But too yellow Like Stewart in The Man who killed Liberty Valance, he reduced wearing aprons and served the decaf enemy coffee. No doubt, Tony Curtis from Bronx Cavalry and Rock Hudson behaved like an Indian I had seen on the screen. Interesting pendant <br /> <br /> Special performance by John McIntire as a lucky card trader too. Rick's American Cafe is a very low western grade. No one wants to spend the night there. Jay C. flips the kissing scene from Lola (Winters) and has a good scene with Stewart before he reaches Bend of the River and Far Country Will Geer as Wyatt Earp and the leader. Indians who took Walter Brennan's teeth from him in the Red River This is a western style that has But Stewart only, not Wayne and Scott will pull out. Worth the shot. I repeat :-)
