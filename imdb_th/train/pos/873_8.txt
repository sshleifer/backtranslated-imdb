I watched this movie, did not expect much and didn't know much about it. I liked it. A good plot and a tight hook that was interesting in the form of ugly, fat, deaf girls and former prisoners. And the steps that make things flow without hurry. <br /> <br /> A lot better movies from director De battre mon coeur s'est arret√© boring and unbelievable. <br /> <br /> The only thing that doesn't work It is ugly, fat girl, not ugly or fat: definitely hard and far from conventionally beautiful But there are so many characters in her face that she comes to the screen whenever she is on. It's great. I hope you will be in the movie more and better than you in general is I've seen Gilles' wife and a little mustache, and both of them seem rubbish and I see De Bramont Morroret Arre and that is rubbish. It seems that she has a few more, so I will give my finger across.
