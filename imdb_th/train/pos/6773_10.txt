I caught this movie on the night of Oct 28 and you know that Danny Masterson is a very good actor in this movie and it's a great story to see him in things other than acting in 70s, this film is not rated But in my opinion, I will give a rating (R) just because of many nude pictures and adult content. But all I love, I think Wisecracks of the soil is quite funny. Basically it's about people who don't have jobs, fans, or money and eventually get a job as a private detective. (There are actually more messengers) He has been framed for the murder of Rock Star and Rock Star fans. People who really want to help him, I give it .... *** 3 stars
