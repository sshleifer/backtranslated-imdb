I can't really watch movies and stop tears. The tragedy that India does not have such leaders after being independent, daring to do justice to their own children when they behave inappropriately .. In modern times, politicians bring their children into politics without having to measure their abilities and skills. . Conversations from Gandhi 'What kind of society do we want to create / build with people (about Harilal)' It is not surprising that it will be a dream that India has almost no leader like this in this generation or next generation. Stein was right when he spoke of Gandhi, 'After 50 years, we hardly believe that people with physical, mental, and spiritual minds have lived on this planet.' I want to express my great gratitude to Anil Kapap, Feroze khan and actor / actor All the movies for this great movie, about good people and relationships with his son. Every father and son should watch this movie only once and learn both roles.
