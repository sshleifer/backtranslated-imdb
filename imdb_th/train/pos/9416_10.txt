A man in a white suit like me is the right jack, using a gloomy view of both labor and capital. Alex Guinness is a scientific genius - but a strange person. (He never received a degree from the university due to ... wrong ... accident in a college laboratory) He managed to push himself into various industrial laboratories in the textile industry. When the movie began, he was in the company of Michael Gough and Gough (in a memorable moment) trying to impress his father-in-law. (Cecil Parker) by showing him the shape of the ship he ran While having lunch with Parker and Parker's daughter (Joan Greenwood), Gough received a message about some problems with the large budget problems of the lab. (Due to Guinness's experiments) and the nickname of his coffee. <br /> <br /> Guinness works in Parker's company and repeats the same way he did with Gough - but Park. Guerin also discovered it. Greenwood discovered what Guinness was working on and convinced Parker to continue experimenting. (But now legal) Results: Guinness and his assistants have been thinking of ways to create artificial fibers that can change the electronic bond within the molecular structure at any time. (For every purpose and purpose) Fiber will remain in good condition. Any textile made from it will never fade, dirty or deteriorate - it will last forever. <br /> <br /> Kinene Wirral is sponsored by Stewart, a woman shop. But not her leader He saw that Guinness sold to the rich. But when he explained to them what he had done, they resisted him. If everyone has clothes that will last forever, they won't want new clothes! Soon, the textile entrepreneurs of Parkers (led by Gough, Ernest Theisinger - in a great performance and Howard Marion-Crawford) are alarmed by what might cause the business to end. They try to suppress the invention (although Parker is a sympathetic person). Guinness tries to get the news of his discovery to the public. <br /> <br /> In the end, Guinness is defeated by science and Greed. But he ended the movie that saw his calculation error and we guess that one day he might pull his discovery. <br /> <br /> It's a great comedy. But the reason for the suppression is correct? At one point, the difficulty of doing textiles appears. (You have to heat to high temperatures so that the ends of the material will really be combined. Nothing shows that the fabric will stretch if the owner is fat (or the contract if the owner is thin, can we believe that people will want clothes? Only one set forever. What happens to the fashion changes and new styles and fabrics made in white only? (Guinness seems to be a white knight) We have been told to add dyes earlier in this process that will not affect the chemical reactions that maintain the structure of the fabric. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, this is not Science paper But it's a movie about the hypocrisy of labor and capital in this modern industry. It's great But those questions that I mentioned bothered me about the validity of the Guinness invention.
