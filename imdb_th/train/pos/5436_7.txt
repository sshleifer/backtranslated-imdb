For many years I think this amazing service is a product of John Ford, especially with Victor McLaglen as a leader. Of course, it has the same humor in the house that Ford tied to his movie. <br /> <br /> Surprised me. I know George Stevens is directing it. Still, I still refused to believe that the film was not presented to John Ford, but he might go to Monument Valley, which makes Stagecoach <br /> <br /> Victor McLaglen along with Cary Grant and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Playing three soldiers, a sergeant in an Indian army with good friends / close friends / close friends But the old gang broke up because Fairbanks was engaged to Joann Fontaine Not if both of his friends can help with the help and support from the Gunga Din wildlife group, played by Sam Jaffe. <br /> <br /> The poem Rudyard Kipling serves as an inspiration to the movie. This story, RKO, about the barracks in England. Playing cartoons led to being a good actor until unable to convey an incredibly racist message. Not that racist But this is the assumption of the British there. At that time, including our actors and Gunga Din, showed the most effective. <br /> <br /> The British came into India by increasing. There, along with the local rulers under the weak Mughal emperor, which had been disposed of in the middle of the 19th century, they ruled India only slightly, which would be impossible. Their rules depend on the native forces you see here. Please note that the military cannot rise to the rank of corporal and Gunga Din has a lower status. <br /> <br /> Please note that here the rebels, in fact, are non-Muslims. There are many religions, as well as having a Christian and strangling sect. Of course, for those who are strangled, they may not have the same view as the liberator. But until India organized an independent movement until the Congress party came in, these people were voices of free India. <br /> <br /> However, you slaughtered it. And England has issues here as well. When I watch Gunga Din, I think Star Trek and the reason for the main order happen. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant must play his true self here instead of aryane. Cary that we have seen. Fairbanks and McLaglen performed very well with the role that suits their personality. <br /> <br /> The best acting role in this film is Eduard Ciannelli as a religious leader guru. neck Noticed the fire and his passion for acting, causing everyone to leave the screen when he was on. <br /> <br /> Gunga Din's favorite scene is Ciannelli, warning his troops in their mountain temples. Notice how Stevens can make the background around Xianelli darken until what you see is the eyes and teeth like a ghoul Halloween mask. Scare and scary and powerful. <br /> <br /> It happened after the action of this movie in the late nineteenth century that more and more British people began to question the assumption of the king. But that's the topic of Gandhi. <br /> <br /> Gunga Din is still a great, fun and funny movie. It should be shown with A Passage to India and Gandhi and you can chart how the Indian Independence Movement has evolved.
