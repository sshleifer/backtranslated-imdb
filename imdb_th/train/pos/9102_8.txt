I saw this movie at the 18th Haifa Film Festival and one of the best things I've seen this year. Saw it on the big screen (And I mean big, not one of the TV screens that most cinemas have) with excellent sound systems that will always enhance the movie viewing experience because movies bring your eyes and ears into pictures. <br /> <br /> The film offers a set of characters that are loosely interconnected. Their stories skip at some point and the variety of the story reminds me of the great Robert Altman. Each film's excellent for him. But the real hero of this movie is Madrid, which is the backdrop of the entire movie. There are characters that consist of walking paths and roads that they walk and set the background atmosphere for all the activities in the beautifully filmed scene. <br /> <br /> The movie comes back again with some themes (for example shoes ) And in essence Salazar makes his parable more understandable when the movie goes on He blends the perspective of the city with the image of the character and matches the feel of the scene with a luxurious background. A talented actor helped him showcase various characters. One great example is the scene where Juaquin took Anita across the road for the first time. It may not work on a small screen. But it makes me goose bumps easily on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The film's message is very good, so the movie is so light and funny all the time. Movie-based songs often appear with a few musical instruments. (I hope to lay my hands on the soundtrack one day, even though I seriously suspect that I will) <br /> <br /> All together, I'm out of This film has an exciting feeling and I am not easily impressed. (You have to use my words for it) for this and others. I give this movie a strong 8/10.
