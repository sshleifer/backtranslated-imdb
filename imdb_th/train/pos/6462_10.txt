I will not spoil the content with anyone who has not seen Kay Pollak's pathetic masterpiece. <br /> <br /> World-famous musician Michael Nyqvist shows peace from stress by moving back. Still in his childhood, the village. The villagers who follow the genius quietly are tempting him to share his greatness slowly. <br /> <br /> Each role in this film has a very specific purpose. And show outstanding potential in each actor Playing your own chords with short but precise words. The symphony of love <br /> <br /> It's not love in terms of relationships. But in the voice of the soul buried deep into each character Current stories, their needs, skeletons, wishes and more. <br /> <br /> I won't forget to talk about the two main parts played by Frida Hallgren and Michael Nyqvist. This drama plays in the Buddha. A memorable religion. Suggestions. They touch each other with the pain associated with their own disability to love themselves. <br /> <br /> Michael Nyqvist has tested here in a very difficult setting in Movie The title is the one that ended in disaster. Or wonderful And it is excellent from beginning to end, not less than one second or less. You will feel more change and tastes. <br /> <br /> To this day, one of the best movies I'm happy to see
