Antonio Marguerite "Danza Macabra" / "Castle of Blood" is a cute and successful person in every area. It looks beautiful in black and white, and it is amazingly creepy. Gothic Aki Foster is an English journalist. By visiting the American horror writer Edgar Allan Poe, betting with Foster that he could not spend one night in the abandoned mansion of Thomas Blackwood, Poe's friend who was betting. Foster is trapped in the mansion. The atmosphere and frightening out of me, the crypt sequence is actually creepy and tense, almost unbearable. Barbara Steele looks incredibly beautiful as a demon. Elisabeth Blackwood "Castle of Blood" is one of the horror movies. The best of Italy at the beginning of the year 60 is a masterpiece!
