_Les Acteurs_ is a ridiculous story of Jean-Pierre Marielle, desperate to wait for a cup of hot water, the story of a conspiracy against the actor, the story of an older actor who has a less than enthusiastic career French actors and their movies <br /> <br /> are supported by clear reflections about theaters and performances. (Fourth wall, hidden camera, to play or not play) The story of this film, most of which Famous actors play their role. (Not to be confused with the use of their lives in front of the camera - the movie is not a voyeur) is quite ambiguous and follows the actors in the series that make this movie amusing.

To request a signature And the gossip happened. We recognize the pastiche of other scenes that each person (or others) play. <br /> <br /> Actually, for anyone who doesn't know the actors. (Mostly at least in the 1950s) or did not know French Cinema, this movie has less interest because most references are missed But it still gives a good reflection about aging, acting in public life ...
