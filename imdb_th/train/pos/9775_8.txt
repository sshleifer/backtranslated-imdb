Tears of Kali is a traditional horror movie that has flaws that delve into the actions of the cult group in India, consisting of German psychologists who learn how to control their will and body to the point that they can make others techniques Completely different (Which can stimulate the hallucinations of nightmares and physical pain and torture) to release the detained demons within them. <br /> <br /> This film shows that it is a vignette. Above cult groups The first part is slower than the rest. But serves well in setting up evidence for the rest of the movie The rest will play like mindf @ ck movies, with some staples thrown into the mix. (Front nude pictures filled with some blood) that will make you happy. <br /> <br /> I think this may not be exciting. But the concept of the concept is quite neat and given in the right spot. 8/10
