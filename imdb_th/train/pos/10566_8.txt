Never watched this movie and enjoyed singing and dancing by Cagney and other actors: Dick Powell, (Scott Blair) who had a good voice and Ruby Keeler (Bea Thorn) James Cagney plays Chester Kent. The musical, and finally into the production of Prologues, which was shown during a documentary film in the theater in the 1930s. Chester had problems with people trying to steal his ideas for his performance. This film is an entertaining movie with many comedians and laughs. Joan Blondell (Nan Prescott) gives a great supporting role that is still young and beautiful. Dick Powell is a great person as a singer and a singer. Beating and just starting a successful and long-time acting career
