Whenever I hear the movie being touted because of lack of sex, violence, bad language, special techniques and others, the detector goes off. Usually, this kind of movie is a Hogwarts movie that sends people who don't need anything to surprise them. But to confirm that they are cowards among us So when David Lynch's STRAIGHT STORY started receiving those comments, I felt frightened, especially when I was not a fan of his other "uplifting" stories. THE ELEPHANT MAN for amazing images and A good show in this movie seems to be more interested in preaching to us than to inspire us. <br /> <br /> I don't need to worry. THE STRAIGHT STORY is a straightforward movie. The more Saccharine is mainly because of the fact that Lynch and author John Roach and Mary Sweeney told it straight and simple majority. Frankly, there are a few things that I can do without having to have, and the image of the rice seeds harvested is a little too repeated. There is no heavy message. There is no emotion to pull our emotions and there is no sympathy for us and its characters. But they depend on the story to create their own power, and so in the final scene, we are truly impressed. <br /> <br /> Of course, casting Richard Farnsworth adds realism to that part. He is a person who seems to have passed through his life. But still have patience and exclude those homilies. The desire that he must return together with his brother does not seem too gratifying because you can experience it here. For a long time and saw too much to be driven by anger for a long time And he knew that his time was about to run out, so he wanted to create peace, not just But only with his brother But still alive Sissy Specification also works well as a job for Strauss's daughter. And even though I am a city and suburban child But the landscape of Iowa and Wisconsin is very beautiful, so I want to go one day.
