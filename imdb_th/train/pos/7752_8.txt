Barten wants to make a movie because he wants That simple, and he succeeded not only in his goals But also create excellent movies, especially images He knows how to use pans, slow motion sequences, follow shots, shock cranes, etc. in a beautiful and smooth way. This makes the movie feel very relaxed. <br /> <br /> A story about the lives of 8 different characters that are nothing but the other: one thing: every party they join. The turning point of this film The beauty of this image is not in the question of how the characters affect each person. (Compared to a similar movie better than Magnolia) I don't think that Barman's ideas of beauty are in the details of the experiences that people pass through or destroy their lives. Barten was very successful in telling those little stories that explained a little experience. He knows people ..... and Antwerp. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of the movie is great. But it's not surprising that we know that Barman is also a very successful songwriter and musician with his band. The music is sometimes hot and at the same time relaxing, which creates a soft feel of the movie. Sometimes we hear pop / rock-melodies that give strength to the scenes they want. <br /> <br /> There is only one flaw and that is the last half hour. It is the runtime which makes me crash. Or is it not the last scene that is fresh and accurate than other scenes? I can't think of ... <br /> <br /> All in the sunny movie, which raised the Belgian cinema. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10! The breeze that flows through the hair of the girl in the afternoon, the sun makes her more beautiful. It is a refreshing breeze that makes you relax when it passes you over to a crowded party. When someone opens the door, it is the wind that carries. Perfume from that beautiful woman sitting next to you in the park you just met last week, it's easy .....) <br /> <br />
