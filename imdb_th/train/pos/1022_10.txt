Stargate is the best show of all time Every actor is perfect for that chapter. I love the connection between the characters. If you haven't seen this item, I highly recommend it. Although this program is compared to Star trek, many times it can't be done because it's completely different. I'm a Star Trek fan, but I will rate this show better than any star trails. Unfortunately I live in New Zealand. And we don't get Stargate on our TV, so if I want to watch it, I have to buy a DVD and Season 10 hasn't left here. But I can not see it in some time down.) However, this program is very good and must be viewed But was warned that it was very stuck So in the summer I like Stargate (and Amanda Tapping).
