Steve Biko is a black activist who seeks to fight against a white minority that ruled South Africa in the same way that Gandhi tried to resist colonialism in the British Empire in India. Richard Attenborough's Freedom Cry movie is not about Biko or Apartheid as much as With Donald Woods, a white liberal newspaper editor who risked his life trying to tell Biko's story. After a jarring BUSINESS cattle died in prison from the hands of devious behavior "police" of South Africa. Woods, played by Kevin Klein, has to choose whether to do the right thing and escape the country to publish a book about Biko or allow his wife to be played by Penelope Wilton to pressure. He forgot about the book. In this case, Biko died in vain. What started out as a life-changing friendship between Biko and Woods deteriorated into a standard by numbers that fled along the border yarn after the death of Biko. Denzel Washington, nominated for an Oscar, performed well in his fourth film, titled Biko. But there is something wrong in the movie that tries to show the battle of the apartment Attenborough will do his job better, focusing on the rise of Biko to stand out instead of starting with Biko as a friend to Woods. Perhaps the black actors with a leading role in the 2 and a half hours of the movie may not be suitable for a large box office. But this movie is a great box office anyway Political movies This film continues to entertain and send one or two messages, even if it's about PG. *** From 4 stars
