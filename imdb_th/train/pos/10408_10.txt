I saw this movie for the first time when I was a kid and fell in love with it at once. Breathtaking scenes and some chapters are funny: "The son of a thousand punches." <br /> <br /> It will appear on TV late at night or in the morning. I wake up at about 3:00 am and It just started. The TV company needs to show more respect and use it at the right time on Sunday to give everyone the opportunity to see this great performance. <br /> <br /> 10/10
