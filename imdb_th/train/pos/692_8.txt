I saw this movie for the first time at the festival. There are many good movies. But there are a few people who think about it. Soon after, and An Insomniac's nightmare is one of them. Tess is definitely a talented filmmaker. The picture is great. Perfect casting Dominic shines in his role that she created perfectly. There is not much to know about his character. But she wrote the story that we care about him and Ellen - I can't wait to see where you are! She showed a lot of talent and I hope she will make a few movies. With a multi-million dollar budget that is trying to cause excitement, cheap, Tess shows that everything is not needed as long as there are stories and actors. I would like to thank everyone involved in this film and thank Tess and co for selling on DVD!
