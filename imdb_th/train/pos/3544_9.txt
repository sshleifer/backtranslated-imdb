Guys and Dolls must be one of my favorite songs of all time. It's a fun movie and nothing more. It shows what people forget about musicals, created for entertainment, not just for theology. Today we have Rent and Chicago, which is a great musical drama and a good movie. But they failed to bring strong entertainment to us The only thing that bothered me in the movie is Marlon Brando. Men can't sing! It's very annoying to listen to him singing and talking when I don't understand him. If not for Marlon, I will give this 10 stars. Guys and Dolls provide old-fashioned entertainment that we rarely get today Watch it. Have a good time !!
