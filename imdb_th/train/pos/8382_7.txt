If you like mech war games, it's quite good. Some are cheap. But the fighting robots are worth watching I have liked mech's battlefield for a long time and this is the only movie I have ever seen that comes close to the feeling of what it would be like to pilot one of those great mechs If you like games, then your favorite game is Mech Warrior Three and Four, and if you have an Xbox and $ 350 to reserve Steel Battalion, this movie should be worth at least once. There must be many movies in the same theme, less remakes and more original work. <br /> <br /> Have fun.
