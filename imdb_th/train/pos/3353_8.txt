This movie shows good comments about the Italian people of that time. Using the mirror to improve the character's revelation is cute and I can't talk about the beauty and beauty of Sophia Loren and Mastroianni. I love them both. Their interactive methods are beautiful and natural, which you may wonder if the camera is actually there. His husband, in a short role, was excellent in his role as the Italian fascist who ordered his wife and children, but in his own way, dear father. The scene begins with Hitler at the Piazza Venezia and the Italians, all of whom are excellent and the place to shoot movies in the past. I love this movie and I also agree that it's funny that it's not famous.
