A collection of eleven short stories in this film is a good idea and presents some good. But there are some surprises that are disappointing From the tragedy on September 11, 2001 in the United States, 11 directors were invited to approach the American tragedy. Their results are mostly not just But is sympathetic to Americans only But most of the stories are narrow-minded in a world with different cultures and people. Ken Loach (UK) presents the best group about September 11, 1973 in Chile, when the Salvadoran Allende democratic government Destroyed by the dictator Augusto Pinochet with the support of the United States Made by the United States Government Riga in various countries according to contemporary history; And one of Mira Nair (India) shows the true story of injustice and injustice to Pakistani families whose son was accused of terrorism in the United States when he was really a hero. <br /> <br / > Some are beautiful: Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) shows that the innocent Afghan refugee children are preparing a dangerous shelter from the bombing while the teacher asks. They try to explain to them what happened on the other side of the world. Claude Lelouch (French) shows the romantic life of a couple in New York, near WTC; Danis Tanovic (Bosnia-Herzegovina ) Shows the impact of wars in small places and the protests of isolated widows; Sean Penn is a poet that shows that life continues. And the story of Shohei Imamura seems to be the most impressive, showing that there is no holy war But sadness and shame. <br /> <br /> Idrissa Quedraogo (Birkina Faso) is very innocent. This African country <br /> <br /> Amos Gital (Israel) is boring and manipulative, showing more violence and terrorism. <br /> <br /> Alejandro GonzálezIñárritu's part is very disappointing. Scary, no inspiration and of course the worst. <br /> <br /> My score is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "11 de Setembro" ("11 September")
