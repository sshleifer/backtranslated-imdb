Excellent documentary I remember growing up in NYC in the early 1980s. This film is for everyone who is not in that time period. This shows one thing that African American gay underclass felt belonged. They only People are real and only a few people are still alive while writing. The ball remains But not as much as they were in the eighteenth That time was gone forever This is a good movie "homo thug" when Queens are really proud of him. Goodbye to Storyville. This is a lost era. But have recorded many hail movies!
