My friends and I are discussing the frustrations we have with movies and especially romantic jokes. We are offended by the Hollywood schlock that is available today because they act like everything. <br /> <br /> Everything is not good ... except for a few bright spots like this movie. It doesn't have a big name actor, a big budget. I don't think it will have a big release (I rent from Hollywood Video). /> But there are many things that are missing. It has excellent chemical properties between love with interest in "Parker" (Jonathan Schaech) and "Sam" (Alison Eastwood). Their love story does not force us as much. The director takes his time so that these characters can truly know each other. Their story reminded me of one of my favorites, "Tootsie". <br /> <br /> Not only actors who support But the moment is really funny. James LeGros's characters are absolutely worthless. Sam's gay friend is hysterical. Interaction with Parker and his fellow employees in Psychic Hotline was fun. <br /> <br /> I laughed. I cried. I remember how I fell in love.
