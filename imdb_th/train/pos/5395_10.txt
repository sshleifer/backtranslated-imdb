I remember watching this movie that was very interesting. I want to know what will happen next. I was amazed at the amount of money they could make in 8 minutes. We started on the school field. Two friends were discussing the class that crossed Kid B, speaking to Kid A "Don't go to class today" and Kid A. Rejected by claiming that they may miss some very important things. Therefore, children and children A go to school. When he arrives there, the teacher tells him that today they are going to learn the only and most important lesson they will learn. They will learn the meaning of life. She gave everyone a small book, and when she arrived at the child she ran away and told the boy next to him to share it. Children will not share, so Kid A went to find a teacher. When he finally found her, he received an astounding revelation in the true meaning of life. I recommend that everyone look short. This takes only 8 minutes from your life. But the message is very important and may help you throughout your life
