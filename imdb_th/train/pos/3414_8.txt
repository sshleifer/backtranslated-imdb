This interesting documentary tells the remarkable story of a journey to bring a blind Tibetan child to a hike in the Himalayas. But still a personality conflict between two amazing people On the other side, there is Erik Weihenmeyer, the first blind man to climb Everest and the climber team (sight) that guides children. On the other side is Sabriye Tenberken, the blind woman who takes care of the first school. For the blind Tibetans who agree to travel But later had doubts about the progress At some level, Sabine does not understand the philosophy of climbers. (Focusing on calling) She may be correct in identifying the differences between the goals, skills and needs of the children, but her confidence in her accuracy makes her a difficult person to be sympathetic to. Especially when she has an effective inhibition In the background of clashes (good manners), we get insights about the lives of children. I enjoy this movie, even though it sends a clear message that it has been elevated - even if it has income. Detailed about the controversy But the movie was quite relentlessly confirmed But it is difficult to argue with that assessment, even if it is presented to the audience somewhat uncertainly
