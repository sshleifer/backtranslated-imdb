I recently saw a delightful Japanese feature film at the 5th Roger Ebert Film Festival in the historic Virginia Theater in Champaign, Illinois. <br /> <br /> Although the film is named English This film shows the world outside Japan that the strong family structure, employment (salary) and recreation still exist in Japan today. <br /> <br /> Suo Masauki writer / director The family name (surname), the first name and the name given (the last)] uses a ballroom style that is not very popular to show the social structure of Japan. <br /> <br /> [Outside of I will not use the title character of the film on World readers may not be familiar with the official name of Japan, which can be confusing. I will refer to the actors. <br /> <br /> According to the names of their professional actors as stated in the internet movie database] <br /> <br /> He asks for help from his wife in real life Professional ballet dancer Kusakari Tamiyo in her first film and until now only movies She is a dance teacher at her father's dance studio. However, her true ambition is to compete again in the international dance competition, where she was disqualified from the past. No, I won't say "why" watching movies. <br /> <br /> Yakusyo Koji salary is the main star of the movie. He is a veteran of about 25 stories since 1979. He delivers great performances by 40-year-old businessmen with a lovely wife, teenage daughter and recently bought his house. <br /> <br /> longing <br / > <br /> There is still something missing from his inner happiness. Watch this movie to learn how he "participates" with ballroom dancing and studying lessons. <br /> Secretly, most dance characters are liberated from the social hierarchy structure. Traditional Japanese <br /> <br /> They are friendly and warm and inviting. Of course, this is the opposite of the Japanese society that is structured. "A place for everyone and everyone in the place" Philosophy <br /> <br /> Movies have a very funny time. Almost 1,500 movie viewers destroyed. <br /> <br /> Spontaneous laughter in a funny time This proves that <br /> <br /> The joke doesn't have foreign languages. <br /> <br /> A seasoned actor, Takenaka Naoto, funny and wonderful, like Watanabe Eriko. /> <br /> We can buy and read books about life structures in Japan, or you can watch this movie and begin to understand how <br /> is. <br /> Japanese people grow up in a rigid social structure. Watching movies "Can we go to Dan Su?" Is a quick study and learn more about other Japanese movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone. It's funny. It's charming. It will make you cry a little and it will make your heart warm. <br /> <br />
