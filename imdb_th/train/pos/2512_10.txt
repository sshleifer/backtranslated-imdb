As a big fan of Gackt and Hyde, the Japanese singer, I was very excited when I found out that they created the movie together and made my life a reality. I'm not disappointed In fact, this movie exceeded my expectations very much. I know that both Gackt and Hyde are more singers than actors, so I'm prepared for courage. But not a complete show But I'm glad to say that both of them tried to get me obsessed and believe in this story. Moon Child has a sense of humor, action, love and serious moments. I can't say that I've cried more and more in the movie and the smoother moments, both of them showed amazingly in my opinion, proving that their skills as an actor The battle scenes are amazing, and although there is a moment of uncertainty that must begin But you are ready to enter the movie and start bonding with the characters I recommend this movie to everyone, especially those who are fans of Gackt and Hyde.
