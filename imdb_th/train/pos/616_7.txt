If any form of movie is called my "miserable happiness", it will be a general fantasy genre. But the offense is a wrong word because I am very pleased to be an occasional escapee. "Stardust" is a good imagination in stock, what we should expect from Neil Gaiman (or Gaiman adaptation as It is not) Mirrormask's dream dream is not a pretend to be an adult of Pan's maze and it is not a fun classic bride princess. But it only has what fantasy lovers are familiar with For complete comfort during all viewing Fantasy lovers should rejoice - the most special technical work is good enough and cheap enough for this thing to be produced now. <br /> <br /> Stardust's story involves a young man named Tristan who has been loved. And the approval of the most beautiful girl in a small town on their wall, going on an adventure to pull down the star However, in order to make things difficult, Tristan's fallen star is a woman named Yvaine, and he is not the only one who finds her ... Some witches have eyes that are greedy in immortality that the hearts of stars can Give and brother's feud The magic kingdom leads to the evil prince in her direction. <br /> <br /> From there, all this can be predicted. But it involves engaging fantasy elements, warm opinions about the nature of love and the best part. Robert DeNiro is a gay pirate. In that note, DeNiro's performance is at the point ... it's not a ripple that most actors use to portray gay people. But what is surprisingly effective from people who have been seen as a harsh typecast character (such as a continuous joke around his character pairing up with DeNiro's opening in the form of a performance Choose) DeNiro does not stand out in his own image since Brazil and is saying something. <br /> <br /> Stardust is a type of movie that may be on the shelves of children and Man Fantasy for a long time. I can not say that it is nothing new. But did not have Actually, people who are most familiar with tropes that will enjoy it the most. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
