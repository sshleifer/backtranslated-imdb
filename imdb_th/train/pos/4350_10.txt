This film is one of the movies that are familiar with it. It is a clay and film that will make you think ... and smiles. Paul Reiser and Peter Falk take you on a trip that you will never forget. The soundtrack is varied and beautiful. And the movie itself is like fresh air This deserves recognition for both movies and actors! Finally, art pieces that are separated from the clear love stories and special effects that are common today. I never walked out of the movie with warmth and feelings in my heart. Because it feels as if someone has just wrapped it in a soft fleece blanket. To watch this movie is to find the true treasure and happiness in it.
