I saw "An American in Paris" first released when I was at school and fell in love immediately. I went back to watch the next day and counted the number of times I lost since both in the cinema and on TV. It takes advantage of the best music and songs by the greatest composers of the twentieth century. (George Gershwin) and Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron in Hollywood history Actor who has been supported by Oscar Levant (as strange as it had been), Georges Gracie (Why doesn't he make more movies?) And Nina Foch (excellent in a grudging role). A superbly designed ballet with title song makes it possible to use the scenery and The sound of Paris is excellent, including the images of Impressionist artists and artists after Impressionist. All of Gershwin's songs are beautifully arranged. But the most memorable is "It's Very Clear" (Caron and Kelly on the side of the Seine River) and "I Got Rhythm" (Parisian children join Gene Kelly in "Une Chanson Americaine"). If you love Paris Watch this movie If you've never been to Paris before, try to see it!
