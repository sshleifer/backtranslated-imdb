Walter Matthau and George Burns work together very well. Willy's acidity and memory loss are confusing ingredients in heaven. The scene where they meet again in Willy's flat is a jewel and the final scene will make the movie perfect. Walter Matthau gives an excellent performance as a frustrated semi-comedian as he can. Exaggerated plays coupled with a general misunderstanding of what happened in a good manner. The period of George Burns is legendary and there is no better place than in the movie. This self-confidence with his quiet response to the drought in the desert is unforgettable. See the scene near the end when Al and his daughter ask the Spanish caretaker and Al's reaction - no value.
