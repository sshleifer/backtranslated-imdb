When we talk about Hollywood hotels, we can talk about one of the three things that are true of the hotel, radio programs and movies, which have been partially inspired by the first two. Dick Powell is the host of the Hollywood Hotel. In the CBS radio network, Louella Parsons made a weekly lap show on the Powell and Parsons stars, debuting Hollywood Hotel in 1934, so in 1937 there was a fair share of viewers on the radio. Powell hosted the song. Louella kibitzed with each guest and her movie star. With the power that she had with her column, she was able to get the next star and continue to build on their latest film. <br /> <br /> Then the United States Radio Federation artist stepped in. Came in and demanded that she pay wages So they won the case. That made the Hollywood hotel show ended in 1938. Of course, both Powell and Luella went to other radio venues. The whole story was covered in The Thomass of Dick Powell's book. Thomas Thomas <br /> <br /> But before the film was pulled from Powell's home studio at Warner Brothers, Powell played a role. Sing / saxophone with Benny Goodman who signed with Hollywood But when he went out to Hollywood, he was busy with Lola Lane, an actress, Rosemary Lane, her real-life sister and actors Ham in Alan Mowbray. <br /> <br /> When Mowbray was called for In singing the Civil War epic he made with Lola Lane, it was Powell's voice that they used. Then Mowbray developed the problem Lina Lamont when he was asked to radio Hollywood Hotel broadcast from Hollywood Hotel. head Suppose the problem was not resolved in the way that it was singing. Singing In The Rain but manager Powell Ted Healy proved to be a skilled person. <br /> <br /> Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer gave good scores. So much for this movie Great hits start from the band Benny Goodman, along with singing Singer Johnny Davis, singing Hollywood's praises for Hollywood. My favorite thing is Powell and Rosemary Lane singing. I like fish outside the water. Just listen to the lyrics of Johnny Mercer about Ginger Rogers using Brooklyn Dodgers or Sally Rand, without her boyfriend. It's a summary of American popular culture in the Thirties. <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley acted dancing here and While the movie does There is no such thing as imagining that he had worked with Warner Brothers before. Berkeley's great time was in a driving restaurant where Powell and Healy were forced to work. The number begins with the broadcast of Benny Goodman from the Hollywood Hotel, which made Let That Be Lesson for you. Then at Powell, Lane and all the places, began to join the song for the rage of the owner Edgar Kennedy and you know you. What can be expected from anger Edgar Kennedy <br /> <br /> Benny Goodman shows why he was called the King of Swing when the band with drummer Gene Krupa and Silo, Lionel Hampton That together with Frances Slang Ford also sang And probably the last surviving member of this group is a friend who is a radio broadcaster He died in 2004, but not before he became the 40th president of the United States. Ronald Reagan is always credited with Dick Powell and Pat O'Brien as the two men in Warner Brothers who are players who are eager to build a reputation. <br /> <br /> Animation dated But so charming
