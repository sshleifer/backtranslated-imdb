Do not listen to comments about AcerBik and the compliments that are in this movie ..... Just talking about my friend's ninja movie is as good as it gets! <br /> <br /> Yes, it's stupid. Yes, the acting and the script are definitely badly accepted. But with chewing gum - it's so fun! In fact, it is often the case of the terrifying B-Movies' performance '(which in the case of this movie is the worst story I've ever had to see!) And' Plot It's really ridiculous. Serving only ten times the level of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the fighting scene is the main attraction in this story, and for the most part I am happy to say that they choreographed well specifically Final showdown (While we see that the ninja is not restricted by the usual gravity rules ....) <br /> <br /> Believe me if you are a fan of ninja movies and you haven't seen Sakura. Killers, then you will miss what is in my opinion, which is one of the true gems in the crown of the genre.
