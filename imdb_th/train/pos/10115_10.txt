This film deals with the cruelty of Derry 30 years ago, which is commonly known as the Bloody Sunday <br /> <br />. This film has been researched, performed and directed well. It's as close to the truth as we can get until the results of the Saville movie investigation make cruelty into the context of time. It also shows the military cruelty on the day of cruelty. The embarrassing white wash that is Widgery Tribunal also handles. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a wonderful, moving and shocking drama when Saville reports out to watch this movie again for See what the truth is.
