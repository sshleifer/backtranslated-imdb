Spanish movies became the movie A Golden, if not the golden age, of course. Pi√©dras is another example of a movie that cares about people and their conflicts seriously. Even if the feeling is strong or almost at the level of life or death This may happen. <br /> <br /> There are different stories here that are interconnected. One is about a mentally retarded girl who doesn't dare to pass the road to the next block. One of them is about a middle-aged woman who finds her lover's life as a footstep. Another story about a girl who has a drug problem that is her lover. There is another story about Madam's brothel that (almost) finds true love. <br /> <br /> Worth it to see. It is in Spain that filmmakers pay attention to women seriously.
