What is the overlooked soundtrack of the 80s? I imagine John Travolta singing some songs. But in watching movies, it seems to be the identity of everything that is 80s cheese. A clear film that has to rely on mechanical bulls, bartenders and relationships that are immature, stylish. The best is the Texas accent with his fists. Compared to the fire on Friday night, I would recommend watching cocktails and Stir Crazy to start into the darkness of the movie. In addition, as a note in the Made in America with Ted Danson and Whoopie Goldberg is a terrible movie. I was shocked to learn that I never watched it. Another strange movie that must be accompanied by Cadilac Man and Robin Williams, just remember that these big stars play a major role in these CHEESY movies .. Tom Cruise, Richard Pryor, Robin Williams and John Travolta
