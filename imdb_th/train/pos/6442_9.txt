It's a great Swedish movie .. It's the first Swedish movie I've seen .. It's easy and profound .. a great combination! <br /> <br /> Michael Nyqvist has a great performance as a celebrity. The conductor who seeks peace in his homeland. <br /> <br /> Frida Hallgren is great as a fan of his inspiration to help him continue and not give up br /> <br /> The battle between the conductor and The hypocritical priest who lost his fight with Michael when his wife faced him and defended Michael's noble cause to help people in his homeland find peace in music. <br /> <br /> The only thing I don't like .. It's not good but has a deep meaning.
