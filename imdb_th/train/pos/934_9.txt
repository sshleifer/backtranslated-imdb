In our home, we are a big fan of A Christmas Carol and watch almost every Christmas version, including Reginald Owen 1938 and the modern 1999 version of Patrick Stewart. What we favor is the 1951 black classic because Alastair Sim IS Ebeneezer Scrooge and true converts However, this translation of 1984 has its own advantages and creates a cute and fun story. (See my opinion about other movie adaptations if interested) <br /> <br /> First of all, George C. Scott can see crotchety for sure and doesn't make the Scrooge worse. I love his Jon, a long coat. And hats He cut the best fashion style of the lot and was a handsome gentleman. However, sometimes it seems that Scott is enjoying his role as a little Scrooge and is not as serious as he should! <br /> <br /> This action has the best Christmas atmosphere. Overall, there is hope and optimism. Somehow you know that this story will be happy. Filmed in Shrewsbury, England. It seems to be British This film has a lovely musical score along with the melodious and lively music throughout the story. Sometimes I almost get the smell of roasted chestnuts and pudding singing in copper! <br /> <br /> Marley's painful ghost (With his miraculous jaw scene) and the three spirits are quite reliable Christmas, in the past, was a woman with no identity, cute, great Christmas gifts and wonderfully cheerful Christmas Yet To Come covered with and premonition as always. However, I met with Scrooge's nephew, Fred, who was quiet and frightening, not as cheerful and warm as he should. I like the nephew's wife, whom they named Janet with her lovely and lively hairstyle. They have composed a game called Similes for the nephew's Christmas dinner, which is a slightly cute touch. Scrooge enters the spirit of this thing. <br /> <br /> The Cratchits and they are quite Little (although very popular) Christmas dinner is a good picture with Bob. (David Warner) who sympathizes and suffers appropriately in a scarf that is several miles long. Mrs. Chatchit is a charming image by Susannah York, who co-starred with George C. Scott in the great adaptation of Jane Eyre in 1970. Among other things, this version has undoubtedly the best of Tiny Tim. But cute and a little cute, but still weak. With dullness under his eyes, the weak things we seem to be unable to survive in this hour. <br /> <br /> This is a classic version that is pleasant and warm. For holidays With a festive atmosphere, ensuring that you enter the spirit of the season
