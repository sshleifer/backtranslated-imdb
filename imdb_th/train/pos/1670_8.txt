Channel 4 is a channel that allows more mischievous content than other channels. This list is absolutely disgusting. The presenter of the adult chat show, initially, four times winning BAFTA and the British Comedy Award (still being nominated twice). Graham Norton is just the perfect gay host for such a good performance. There is one famous star in the middle. In general, they have adult ideas that may be humiliating or humorous. But some people are not the heartless people They have women playing a recorder with a piece of men who uses their dicks to play xylophone, women who are walking on the bathtub, men with or without pants under their skirts and basic ideas. But many hilarious This is just for adults. But enjoy it! It won two BAFTA awards for Best Entertainment. (List or series) It won the British Comedy Awards for the Best Comedy Entertainment Program (also nominated), Best Comedy Talk Show. It won Emmy Award Episode 18 (?) And won the National Television Award twice. For popular talk shows It's number 52 in the 100 most funny moments. Very good!
