Easy to say, Oliver! Is one of the greatest musicals of all time It's full of memorable songs - "Food Glorious Food", "Oliver!", "Consider yourself" and "Oom-Pah-Pah" to name only a few characters. This film is a film adaptation of Charles Dickens classic novel and, like Oliver Twist's story, it is the perfect family movie. There are some terrible moments - Bill Sykes, a villain played by Oliver Reed, is scary enough for himself - but overall, this movie will attract children of all ages, including adults. The story - which now almost everyone is familiar with - a little orphaned boy named Oliver and his life growing up in London At first he lived in a shelter with other orphan friends, but after daring to ask Mr. Bumble, the caretaker was sold to the family as a servant. <br /> <br /> After the accident Close to the shaver, he met the Artful Dodger, played by Jack Wild, who showed his role in a fierce way. <br /> This film was filmed in the studio and on stage at Shepperton Film Studios only, but this was not translated into all movies. This scene mimics Victoria London perfectly, just like the dress worn by the characters. Many winners and great successes in the launch of Oliver! Is a worthy partner for the best stage plays at all times and will make everyone who loves movies a favorite
