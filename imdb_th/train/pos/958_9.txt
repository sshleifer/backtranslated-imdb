Wow! Recently, I've seen movies with a very low budget. But this movie is very good Drawing on police life in a city on the east coast of Germany that is very realistic is very different from movies or crime drama I love the main actors and the rejection of the ancient thoughts about the police. This movie is actually like documents and entertainment like drama at the same time. Perfect exchange!
