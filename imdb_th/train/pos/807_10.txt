Dear readers, <br /> <br /> The final battle between the Rebellion and the Empire. The second Death Star is nearing completion and when completed it will spell the fate of the rebels. Luke Sky Walker, now a Jedi Knight, has returned from Tatooine and Han Solo and Princess Leia, now revealed to be Luke's twin sister! They agreed to lead the attack of the shield generator on the moon of endor. While Lando Calrissian was the leader of the Death Star attack, they knew little that they had the most ingenious traps for them and the Palau Emperor Teen is the personal caretaker of the second death star. <br /> <br /> The return of Jedi is a favorite in the original ending. It has action, drama, romance, great fighting, great performances, breathtaking battle scenes and great music by John Williams. Mark Hamil is fully developed. Now becoming a Jedi Knight, being a naive farm boy and in his place is a peaceful and relaxing Jedi committed to keeping the galaxy. Leia is still cool in this movie, like Han and Landau 3P0, R2 and Chewie act as T, while James Earl Jones is still the biggest villain of the movie: Darth Vader Ian McDiarmid is Great villain as Emperor Palpatine, cruel and merciless. The action sequence of this film is remarkably amazing and the battle with the sword is fierce and fierce. John Williams' scores are still cool and help raise many levels of movies. <br /> <br /> Sign The Constant DVD Collector.
