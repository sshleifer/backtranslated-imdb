Every child has a movie that he appears in the VHS when he has nothing to do or when someone is around 100 times and I can say that it's a good movie for children / families. <br /> <br /> I still have a tape. I haven't watched it in 5 years, but maybe I go around this week and As a child all day long <br /> <br /> Khun Pee The Bears just need to love and care of their busy <br /> <br />.
