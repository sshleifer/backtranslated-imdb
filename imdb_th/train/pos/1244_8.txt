I saw this movie on television for the first time many years ago and like it very much. Charles Dance makes one of the most horrible villains able to imagine. His sophistication is completely different from the good, rude heroes. I have never been a fan of Eddie Murphy. But found that he was an annoying winner: "Axel Foley Through the Looking Glass" Charlotte Lewis is using a hacked phrase Some scenes are created amazingly: dream sequence, birds, stupid fight scenes and top encounters. Murphy is a modern man, and suddenly falls in love with the legendary version of Kerr Russell that is shocking and quieter. Like this film that we have an unparalleled actor James Hong, the short scene raises the quality of even Derek since 1955. Hong has defined a skilled actor. "Acting career" in his career "The Golden Child" is ridiculous. It's not perfect; But it has the ability to exchange many awards, which is a fun and amusing fantasy After four years, I saw "golden boy" again; I'm more fun! It's really fun
