This is the first movie directed by David Mamet. That's right, because it's his first time. <br /> <br /> The story here is uneven and it moves along with the movie. To the big downside to all comprehensive errors. It's like "The Grifters", but there is no level for the film. (In this film, John Cusack is gentle. But that is the nature of his character.) The performance here is quite flat. (Sometimes I wonder if the courteous acting should be a psychoanalytic attack) at least in the beginning. It's never really good, but it develops beyond reading painful painful lines after about ten minutes. At the beginning of the movie, some lines of Lindsay Crouse - the way she read them - sounded as if they were speaking alone or lecturing inside that they couldn't. With the arrival of things that have been received, Mantegna <br /> <br /> The conversation here is not as fun as it should be. I expect Jack Ring-A-Ding-Ding to crack the tongue. But these things are not Everything sounds very good, instead of saying, perhaps, Mamet developed after this film and loosened up. But if not, then sometimes he should let others direct his words. He has too much value with them here and as a result, they lose their quality, rhythm and dynamism. What's more strange is that besides this, the movie doesn't look or feel like playing. More movie cameras My only problem with "Glengarry Glen Ross" is that it looks like a filming theater too. But in this film, the actor is not only successful. <br /> <br /> I don't think much if it sounds like a movie character that speaks a movie - or even the characters that play the lines - but here looks like That movie characters (Or books) speak to play the line It is a theater and a movie that looks strange that doesn't work. That doesn't mean that this movie isn't good - it's not. But it is often very entertaining The best cubes in the middle. <br /> <br /> It's a movie with a standard: a new man (in this case, a girl). Lindsay Crouse comes in there. Participate in the geothermal world How is she involved: She is a psychiatrist and one of her patients. Billy is a gambler to do. She wants to help him with her gambling debt, so she walks into The House of Games, a dirty game room where people work in the back room. I will accept settings quite improbable. (They just expect to give Kresge in or not. They expect that she will write a check or not. Billy can come in or not. One of these questions is answered at the end.) <Br / > <br /> The downside starts here. I found the starting point - the little learner - it was the most fun. We received the lesson in the art of resistance as much as Crouse. <br /> <br /> We saw the ending coming and we didn't see the second ending. Coming up and the true ending I haven't seen But maybe you do The ball has just bounced back and from the last scene in the movie, we know that the second Crouse went into the House of Games. The opening of an improbable bit and reading a strange line because there are so many good things If the first part of the movie seems to be unstable, follow it. After marking half an hour, it will continue to be driven. If you want a fun movie then this is you. If you want Mamet to see "Glengarry Glen Ross" again - James Foley makes him better. <br /> <br /> ***
