"Thieves and Liars" show us the very nature of the level of corruption that affects many Puerto Rican people and forcing them to make difficult matters if there is no possible alternative With their lives and loved ones The performers are excellent because some people are not professional actors. A great option that increases the level of reality in movies. Photo-driven stories without intrusion as they should be in this movie The script collects the weirdness and attitude of "Boricuas" deeply. Sometimes it feels like you're watching a documentary! Watching this movie, you feel as if you have entered a real Puerto Rican society and stand to watch indefinitely. I like it!
