Being honest with you, I think everything is great in this movie. There shouldn't be a reason why it wasn't shown in The Deaths movie theater. In this movie, it's great. The fx is great when used. The story of a little girl, but all of this is a very good movie that I hope will someday get the props. It should be. The first part of this movie is the problem of why it's straight to the video with them killing the boy. Small but after that This story depends on the little girl and her mother who visited her mother, who moved out to try to become a writer. The property he bought became the place where the witch (the tooth fairy) lived and everyone who lived in the house. you Or going to her house will be in great danger, not wanting anything to really go out, just a little information. If you want to watch this movie and do it, it's worth the price of the rental
