I approached this movie with low expectations. But was very surprised It did very well, and it resulted in the movie dancing in the ballroom of the past year, especially "Stroomly Ballroom". While music is good and colorful dance for me, the movie isn't about With dance It is about Japanese educational institutions that allow people to work in the office for a long time and have free time after work for entertainment that is not related to their families. Here we have men with complete families and large mortgages and fun that attach the flag for life. He painted an attractive image of a girl in a dance studio he passed during the journey and this made him try ballroom dancing. In addition, Japan also has the fact that the inspiration for his new passion is simple. But was accepted by the family and the audience The attitude towards ballroom dancing that is broadcast in that movie is not Western. Of course, discipline and music are a clear cultural import in Japan. Cultural differences are interesting. Despite the lack of in-depth cultural, color, dance and enthusiasm of all players, it makes the film to be watched.
