Some movies that you just know that you will fall in love from the first few seconds This is one of those movies. Following it back to "Double Indemnity" and "The Postman Always Rings Twice" in the 40s - this is a great example of Modern Film Noir. In the 1990s, Nick Cage played "On His Luck". Involved in the murder of his wife - and his luck went from bad to worse, even worse, as he tried and tried to escape from the city, the violence and the threat of Red Rock West. A lot of great performances from Cage, Hopper And Walsh, the musical backdrop of a hypnotic guitar slide Favorite line: When Cage looked at the empty gas gauge in the car that went out, shook his head and said: "F *** in 'The story of my life"
