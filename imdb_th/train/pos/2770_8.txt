Viewing David & Bathsheba is a much better way to learn the Bible that goes to Sunday school. Although there are scripts that sometimes are inadvertently funny But this movie is highly entertaining Studio system is defective But did not receive the expense when extravagant production Kida, the role of King David as a lively poet But tortured those who did the same thing to kill Bathsheba in the shower. Susan Hayward, Raymond Massi, as a prophet, Nathan delivered a live performance and normal brute Looking for a quiet screen star Francis X. Bushman as King Saul and Gwen Verdon as a dancer. Bravo for the Old Testament and Hollywood
