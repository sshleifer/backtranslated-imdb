Updated on January 1, 2006 <br /> <br /> Parsifal is one of the two Wagner opera or musicals that I like more for more precision. (Meistersinger As another one), although it is hard to imagine that it appears "The song by a songwriter as usual is the chaos of religion, heresy, sexualism, and maybe even the same sex and the length of it may Make the audience feel like hearing a dry voice. <br /> <br /> Wagner, the famous anti-Semite (Klingsor, may be one of the Jewish villains who represent him) has given him Premiere mind to those who refuse to repent. (Not because I want to try RW!) Hermann Levi (go to the picture!) Kundry is the most mixed and another Jewish representative who seems to be both insidious or merciless, depending on the scene. > <br /> Considering that many of the Parsifal videos appear to be on stodgy, the opera's film is compared to the breath of fresh air. The director Hans-Jürgen Syberberg brings a lot of imagination. But it's hard to know why he chose something For example: Famous Parsifals (Of each gender!), Puppet, Wagner's death mask set and dolls, and symbols such as Nazi swastika in the traveling scene (if I can remember "Engelbert Humperdinck" real "write real music to crab Scene changes) Although Wagner himself died too early to be a true Nazi, many of his descendants (Like his second wife, Cosima) At least a traveling companion, including their grandson, Wolfgang Wagner, who continues to operate the Bayreuth Festival at an early age. In fact, Gottfried Wagner's son, Wolfgang, in contrast to his father, tried to make an honest deal with his great grandfather. <br /> <br /> Syberberg also seems politically vague from what I read in the year. 1977 He created a well-known movie about Hitler "Hitler: ein Film aus Deutschland" (sometimes called "Our Hitler" in English). Most people do not see it. (Including myself) <br /> <br /> Armin Jordan, the leader on the music CD based on this movie, plays Amfortas (sung by Wolfgang Schöne) Edith Clever (Yvonne Minton) plays Kundry, Michael Kutter and Karin Krick play the Parsifals (both sung by Reiner Goldberg! And all (except Kundry?) Have been described as being aged between actions 2 and 3 Someone looks older than the end of the opera (the miracle of the Grail in this opera, the Grail is the cup that Jesus drank at the last supper and not Mary Magdalene like the last time. The idea that I found Scary!) <br /> <br /> Performing and singing is quite useful, and the DVD seems to improve the sound if it's not a good image. (Yes, I agree that the "Kna" method is superior even in the second generation stereo. But he may be above all the recorded versions. <br /> <br /> Not Parsifal for all Wagnerites, but I think it works well like the filming opera.
