This was the suggestion of the director of the production of Alexander Chords in several subordinates; This film is credited to three directors. But in truth Alex, Zoltan Korda and William Cameron Menzies helped push it to six. <br /> <br /> For John Kobal's 1987 book "The Top 100 Movies" from his survey 81 film critics saw The Thief of Bagdad reaching 55th place. The close examination revealed only Jose Luis Guarner, John Russell Taylor and Kobal himself voted for the image but their high places. It is enough to bring it near the halfway mark. <br /> <br /> Outbreak The Second World War saw the production of this film moving throughout England and America, eventually seeing success in 1940 and winning three technical Oscars as well as Citizen Kane. In some cases, it may be a movie that you might Appreciate more than love. <br /> <br /> Special effects that are outstanding at that time are also reasonable. But it is not as effective as the courage of inventions Among them is a fun horse built from the kit model, which, when the key is inserted up to the end of it, starts to fly. There is also a killer toy of Goddess Kali with six weapons. (It may be obvious that the only woman with two women sitting behind her) and a giant spider that looks scary. The impressive thing is the important point with the amazing flying carpet. But the best memory must be Rex Ingram, which appeared in the great moments of filming of the djinn (genie), nearly a thousand feet! Ingram shows that the devil is a beast and adds a dangerous element to legal action. And watched when he was tricked into putting his bottle. <br /> <br /> John Justin performed well as an Arab king with a strange reason, with an English accent and a strong upper lip Sabu, aged 15 years. Surprisingly up close, Abu is a cocky thief. After they crossed the path with the evil Jaffer (Conrad Veidt), Justin found himself blind and Abu became a dog. When it seems that the rest of the film is told in a retrospective perspective through Ahmed (Justin) 's blind view, we find that half of the movies we follow to date and The adventure continues. In fact, in the second half it was better than ever, filled with events and natural wonders. <br /> <br /> Three small songs, pepper pieces. But while this movie is 100 minutes, it feels like it is not serious. More ingredients than real ingredients I'm not going to classify this as a musical. It's very fun. Justin and June Duprez are loved by mothers and Father Veidt is a villain. Sly and Abu are young and irrepressible robbers. It may take a while to get into a somewhat outdated and melodious idea that is full of 40s English movies, but when you sit and watch in the first half and a half hours, this movie truly attracts you.
