The spectacular seventeen-minute dance sequence of George Gershwin's orchestral piece in 1928 "The American in Paris" is a controversial masterpiece. The design is uncompromising precision and flair by Gene Kelly. The lively combination of colors, music and dance is still surprisingly eye-catching, as the pieces are divided into scenes inspired by Selected artists - Dufy in the Utrillo flower market on the Paris Rousseau street at the Vincent Van Gogh fair in the masterpiece of Place de l'Opera and Toulouse-Lautrec for the Moulin Rouge that Kelly wore a white bodysuit at The celebrated his 97 minutes ago This is an exciting ending soon. But there is some charm in watching the 1951 Oscar-winning musical. <br /> <br /> Director Vincente Minnelli and the screenwriter Alan J Lerner is a surprisingly complex form, if a little romantic story focuses on Jerry Mulligan, a former GI who remained in Paris after the end of World War II, trying to make a living in As a painter With the Braunachio dance style and his sporty dance style, Gene Kelly can show annoying and annoying attitude as the screen personality.

Impressively by Caron in the editing of the five scenes of all the descriptions of Lise to Henri Adam, designed to show Caron's dance versatility. The sequence is similar to "On the Town" at Vera-Ellen. Show her dancing skills when Kelly's sailor character describes the diverse vision of Miss Turnstiles. <br /> <br> Caron's 19-year-old girl Lise (in her first movie) dances superbly and manages her role with charm.
