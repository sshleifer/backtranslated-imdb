For the longest time I liked this movie better than the original Care Bears. Last summer I watched them both together and decided that I was wrong. The first one is the better Care Bears movie (because you can guess that if you read my review) this isn't a bad movie. It's just ... very strange. <br /> <br /> First of all. That few people talk about, it doesn't like any knowledge of the first movie I cannot think of other sequels that are incompatible with the original. (Especially with the gender of the characters and the way they all met) when I was young and watching this thing, I was quite confused and confused I feel the same way as an adult! <br /> <br /> For the reason why this movie is really good (if you separate from the first movie), I can't think of another movie for a little kid with DEMON because it's a villain! Now, I'm not saying that the evil demons who want to steal the spirit of the camp and Care Bears are good. I just found it cool to have a demon in the movie for a small child! It's like the movie "Santa Clause vs. Satan" from Mexico that you hear about sometimes. <br /> <br /> However, the demon's name is Darkheart and he wants this chick to help him get Care Bears in exchange. With her special powers Very dark for a small flick. Eh? And I did not mention that Darkheart will appear with women most often as a WHINEY VOICED 10 year old boy ??? freaky! While other children are in Care-a-Lot. Take care of BABY CARE BEARS! Oh man! The devil and the child care bear in the same movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> There's no need to say everything is finally eliminated. (But not before we saw the Darkheart trapping the souls of Care Bears in this story. The horrible chandelere in one scene was very surprising. But I was left with the question of whether this movie met the cult audience. It deserves a lot. I might look again myself
