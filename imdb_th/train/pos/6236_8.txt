The intellectual plot is as light as a feather, but the advantage here is the traditional rejection of boys and girls that we are familiar with in "The Gay Divorcee" and "Top Hat". Instead of being an acquaintance without intention Misconceptions about love, courtship and slight irritation from sabotage auditions with bicarbonate soda make ginger a rather special price. And in the great tradition of diminishing finances, there is nothing better than Hollywood's best entertainment than the show. <br /> <br /> A delightful number from Ur. Wing Berlin was sprinkled throughout the performance. Top hats and evening dresses will be recorded until they are finished, which is still a refreshing change. Fred and Ginger come out again to create a charm for the world ... and it's the charm of the navy. Everyone and everything comes back to happiness again. <br /> <br /> The best pure classic, but with Astaire and Rogers, we just know that it must work. <br /> <br /> Score: 8.25 / 10
