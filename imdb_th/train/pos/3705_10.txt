I do not understand low ratings 5.7 of this movie It is a pleasure for people who like a strong plot and a dark atmosphere. The voice of Midnight remembrance in the Garden of Good and Evil went down to the scene (Savannah). The performance was strong and I was amazed by Kenneth Branah's southern accent. Famke Jansen Great, Robert Duval is in effect in a small part and Embeth Davitz is a BOMB. Her best nude scenes are also <br /> <br /> The story is quite standard. But perform effectively
