To see how two brothers and sisters interacted and raised each other through the whole movie made me personally happy to live in rural areas like they did in movies. I have watched this movie countless times and there are books beside my scriptures. After watching the movie, I agree that this is one of the few movies that make justice. I suggest that everyone who has the opportunity to go to Montana to fish or go outdoors to do that is wonderful. I can't think of anyone else who can play this role better than Brad Pitt. Be fair and see one of the better movies in the modern movie era. It is highly recommended and is a guide for fishing in Montana and Wyoming. Do not try to learn how to fly fish from the movie scene because although it looks good in this movie, take real time. Thank you for listening to movies. This story, if you want a movie that is sad for a long time
