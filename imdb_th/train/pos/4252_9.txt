This movie will take you inside yourself in the first few minutes and catch you until the end. It has a very humane story and a very good selection of songs. The performances of Moritz Bleibtreu (Giancarlo Amato) and Barnaby Metschurat (Gigi Amato) are satisfactory. Recommended for those who are tired of action movies and want to see good movies.
