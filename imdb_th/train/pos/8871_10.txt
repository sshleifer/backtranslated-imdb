This is a great movie that has many lies. It dealt with the problems of fascism and class. But it has a message of knowing ourselves and taking responsibility for ourselves This film is very deep. It gives your message and you can only control your destiny. It also shows that knowing yourself and being happy with your identity is the only way you will socialize. What others think about you is not important. I believe that this movie is very good. Actors that I think can convey each character perfectly I just think it's amazing that this movie is really deep. You won't see how deep this movie is. But in another view, you will see the clear meaning of the movie.
