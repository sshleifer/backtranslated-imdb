Along with Patrick McCuhan and Robert Cull Jack Cassidy, a major villain of Columbia. Columbo's first "proper" episode after two solo pilots "Murder By The Book" is not far away. From the classic status of Jack Cassidy, Ken Franklin plays half of the murder mystery partner. Jim, his partner, is a gifted person, while Ken has no talent but a talent for speaking and skills. To promote Books As soon as Jim decided that he no longer needed Ken's marketing skills, Ken planned to kill Jim. Except that it is not a new plot. Actually, it's a real-life use of the murder story that is for one of their books. <br /> <br /> It doesn't take long. Columbo knew that Ken was a murderer. Although unfortunately having to kill again (Ken, romantic and murdering important witnesses) Before Columbo, there is enough evidence to make sure that it is wrong. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with "Murder By The Book" but it's not quite a bit I just give "Publish or die" over the edge: both episodes have Jack Cassidy and the world of publishing, but "publish or die" is a more stressful and unpredictable fraction. But this is also a great episode.
