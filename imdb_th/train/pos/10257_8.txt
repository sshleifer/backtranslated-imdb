What can I say about this movie that has not been spoken? Good to tell the truth, it looks very fake, like slapping and kicking. Charlie, how shiny is it to be true? I don't know. I'm sure they will press the button and kick her more if it is. However, the scene with hot squeezing and oil looks very realistic. And the last needle in the eye scene was amazingly amazing and probably the only thing in the movie that shocked me
