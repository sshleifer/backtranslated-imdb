Dark Scanner, Minority Report, Blade Runner, Sin City and Captain Sky and Future World? If you are a fan of these things, this is worthwhile to try. <br /> <br /> French animation project 'Renaissance' took seven years to create a shoestring budget, and tonight I finally had to look at Private movie for the International Film Festival in Stockholm My own reaction is fear; My next reflection is 'neat huh' and regretfully closely analyzed to get the 'meh' resounding. It is a beautifully successful science fiction on the surface. But scratching it, or even provoking it a little, and the unneeded plot of it becomes clear, like the flat characters. <br /> <br /> However, it is clear that people in the Onyx film can Doing something beautiful with the above surface, the image is shaking. They use the action-based motion capture to completely move the main frame animation with Jetstar and black. Difference of color and white light For people who are not with 'Technical jargon', this movie looks like Sin City that is lively. The liquid, transparent, dark, and emulated template has been added with a terrifying bolt. It's a vision But many credits are due to the sharp sound effects that are in the form of weapons of the future, terrifying music, heavy rain and broken glass. It is a drenched dream of all the technologists. <br /> <br /> The film expands into a bleak future, frigid, Paris, a giant company called 'Avalon'. Life of People with surveillance (Think transparent screen from minority report) and genetic engineering After leading to the mysterious kidnapping of young researcher Ilona (voiced by lovely Romola Garai), cut to our police who were heavily boiled, suspended and protagonist Karas (Daniel Craig) ?? A man who took the law into his own hands? The person who was assigned the case of finding and pulling Ilona. In this case, he received help from Ilona's older sister, whom he started a love affair, a love affair if I could say. <br /> <br /> The Renaissance world is amazing. Christian director Walkman used justice in the melting of the Noir theme and as a result was a forest in a city full of animals, rats, fat mice and lonely detectives hiding in the shadows of slums. The problem is that the creators have no doubt that there must be a clear prototype and spelled out a lot in the story, or this movie will be "overly" for the main audience due to the horrible animation format. After that, we have many ancient characters, such as the villain who laughs evil, the boss of the lazy criminals and the male chicks who smoke every time they receive it. It pushed my face to my face and didn't need it. <br /> <br /> The worse thing is that the conversation is a little planned. It seems that every line has only one reason to drive the plot. This thing is not deadly, because the plot is very complicated when it comes to wanting a clear direction. Daniel Craig helps here too by bringing a ridiculous attitude to his police character. At one point in the Renaissance, he saw the pursuit of a lively car, which is certainly one of the most exciting sequences of this film. Unfortunately, the novelty of sci-fi images deteriorates after chasing this car and 'Renassaince' will benefit from being slightly shorter. In summary, it is an interesting future comic book experience. But there are bugs. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
