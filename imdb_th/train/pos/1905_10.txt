Rather, it's the funniest and shortest comedy movie of all time ... It ranked my top ten. This will get a full score. Arthur Bach (Moore) is a wealthy, heir who is a 'middle-aged' child who refuses to take a mature path in life and avoids all necessary responsibilities. He also refused to leave the bottle. One day, he and his personal waiter, Hobson (Gielgud), went shopping at Bergdorf Goodman's and ran into a small drug smuggler. Linda (Minnelli), Arthur and Linda's chemistry helped increase electricity for the film. another There are many hilarious pieces in one scene. (Drunk throughout most stories) Knocking the wrong apartment door and receiving human ear 'Siren' threats ("My husband has a gun !!!!) The performances of everyone involved should be Noted: Gerald Fitzgerald played the role of Arthur Sir John's fierce and ruthless grandmother. Jill Kut almost stole all the performances with his acidity. (He brought Oscar here) and Christopher Cross. "The best thing you can do") It's a shame that Dudley Moore last month (March 2002)
