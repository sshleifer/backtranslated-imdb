I noticed that new hopes and empires were back in the top 10, but this was not in the top 100. <br /> <br /> This movie has a bad reputation because of Ewoks, but there are many reasons to love. This movie: <br /> - The Rescue of Han Solo from Jabba: This officer wrapped Han Solo in the debt sub-plan that was established when we first found the character in A NEW. Hopefully, < br /> <br /> - The emperor was finally revealed: Ah, this may not work like when the prequels go out, but this is the first time we see The Emperor as a child. <br /> <br /> - The Speeder Bike Chase: Yes. This is a special time. But it was one of the most memorable and exciting moments in every movie. <br /> <br /> - The 3 Part Climax: 1) Battle of Endor (led by Han and Leia) 2) Luke Confronts Father The Fall of the Emperor 3) The Destruction of the Second Death Star (Lando's Time) <br /> <br /> - The final celebration with our hero: As I said this movie Received a lot of shit because of Ewoks, but I think it's cool that while all galaxies celebrate FALL OF THE EMPIRE, our heroes Send a private party in the woods /> <br /> All together, this is a step <br last great. Chapters for our heroes and the appropriate story of the STAR WARS story
