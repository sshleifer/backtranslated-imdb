This movie makes me worried. At some point, I like it a lot! <br /> <br /> I agree that the dialogue and the story of the characters should be a little better. But wait, this is just a simple (short) story of two men trying to kill a dragon. There's nothing more for it. <br /> <br /> The overall design, the atmosphere, the beautiful landscape ... every <br /> <br /> There is a lot of love in this movie. Excellent character design and comedy Tim Burton-ish If you like it, I can recommend this movie to anyone interested in a great design, acting in a small but simple but cute story.
