This will work much better if it is created as "Mitchell in Malta" At least at this point, we may not see the picture of Joe Don Baker running in the Mediterranean with a spectacular view of a cowardly cowboy outfit ... not to mention acting like a gun. old Mitchell is Mitchell. This movie will not suffer from the lack of cruelty of the police. Oh, well, at least, the comments of Mike and Bots cartoons make this fare fun for MST. I can't imagine to see myself.
