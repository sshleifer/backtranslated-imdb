It is a great thriller from Turkey that can create a good job from the Gokbakar brothers. <br /> <br /> First of all, I want to point to playing on the movie playing screen in Turkey by In general, most are not enough, but GEN has the best picture to say "perfect" and the image change is really great. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Gen" has a wonderful topic that Influence everyone by only women Those who want to be a psychiatrist in a hospital, have a mother who is insane, habitual, the main cause and psychological effect that occurs in Gen. The only thing you have to do is to include all the suggestions. Impressive Doga Rutkay and Sahan Gokbakar playing this show may be more realistic "Monica Bellucci" <br /> <br /> The last thing I want to say is "Watch this movie, you'll be confused"
