"A Mouse in the House" is a classic cartoon by Tom & Jerry who is faithful to their traditions. But have their own jokes It's hysterical, hilarious, very fun and very fun. Artworks are of good quality. <br /> <br /> This short time is not just Tom trying to catch Jerry. Butch lives in the same house and he tries to catch the mouse as well, because «there is only one cat in this house in the morning - that is a cat that caught the mouse» <br /> <br /> If you ask me if there are many jokes in this cartoon The most funny example for me is when Mammy Two Shoes sees two lazy cats sleeping and sarcastically saying, "I'm glad you enjoyed lunch" and she hoped that they would be satisfied because she didn't do it. Two cats open Another joke is when Tom disguises himself as Mammy Two Shoes and slams Butch with the pan. Butch does the same thing as Tom. Of course, even more fun is when the real Mammy Two Shoes appear and both cats (stupid !) Thought that they saw each other, disguised as Mammy, then they attacked her on the "back" - haha. Usually, she was angry and when she was angry she didn't have anyone busy But even though Jerry won't win this time because he is expelled as well.
