I approached the movie about talking animals with care. For every innocent person, you will get equally poor people, such as creating Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey or in the case of Cats & Dogs. You have a great idea for a movie that doesn't. In its potential When I heard about Polly, the evidence of a smart parrot did not make me absolutely certain. But I found this movie surprising. And it sneaks into your heart without your knowledge. Misha Vilyenkov (Tony Shaloub) Russian janitor accepts work in a research lab One day he heard a song coming from the basement. And when he checked, he found a parrot in his cage, singing his small heart out. Misha became fascinated with birds, especially when it became a parrot that not only But will sing only And a few phrases as well It's a parrot that you can really talk. <br /> <br /> This parrot is called Polly. (Voiced by Jay Mormore) and known to a friend in Misha Wondering how this world of the smartest birds ended up with a dusty basement. Misha convinces Polly to tell his life story. Which all began when he was a child and in the care of Marie, a five year old girl with a stuttering The two of them became a feathered bird (okay, pun is not good!) <br /> <br /> When Marie's parents became concerned about her intimacy with birds, they considered sending him out. And finally they followed Marie almost to hurt himself in the fall after teaching Paul to fly Desperate to reunite with her again, Polly began to travel far across America, including many new owners, flying long distances and even ending behind bars. From the cage, that is! <br /> <br /> Polly is one of a number of talking animal movies released by DreamWorks in the late 90s and although it is not recognized as well as the success of the box office. But Polly succeeds at a relatively small level and is a clever job from time to time. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr's stand-up style, acting right for Paulie's part. He never played. The chapter is too comfortable, even though he is the smartest of Paulie's world, but he is innocent in his way. <br /> <br /> Because he lives a rather sheltered life with Marie when he is taken away, he must Take care of yourself for the first time And when he fell into the hands of different owners, they promised Paul to reunite with Marie, which he believed For those promises that will be a waste of time and again, <br /> <br /> Polly is accepted as a scene. It follows a variety of people. Polly ends up and the way he gradually brings closer. With Marie more He first started at the souvenir shop, where he received the patronage of Ivy (Gena Rowlands), a kind woman who taught the meaning of etiquette. She sympathized with Polly's situation and drove the RV to America to find Marie. <br /> <br /> Polly is an impressive film from time to time. His scenes with Ivy are the best scenes. Polly's wonderful moment is on her shoulder, singing Tom Jones's number. The way she instilled in him the desire, the great hope and some dialogue was well written and thought-provoking: <br /> <br /> "There are things in life that you have been fired because you think You You will have to do it later. But the real thing that Ivy taught me is that you have to live as it may not be later. "<br /> <br /> The scene where Ivy passed away from traveling. The moment when the heart beats And the order in which he drew the courage to fly for the first time in the Grand Canyon soaring majestically as a beautifully decorated scene, it was with you for hours after the movie ended. <br /> <br /> Although sometimes The sad moment has a lot of laughs to have. Polly falls into a group of parrots that are shown in a Spanish outdoor restaurant. The animatronic effect here is really fantastic because four birds perform perfectly designed dances. And Polly has love Which will be when he falls into a little steal (played by Mohr as well) that may be the only thing I have As soon as you become familiar with the situation, the movie moves Paulie to another situation. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Paulie is taught to steal money from the ATM is a joke. But also disturbing as well I was surprised that DreamWorks was given the opportunity to include a movie scene for children. And the robbery of Paulie's diamond is a Mission Impossible. He is caught in the scene and sent to the lab to test the animal, which he has remained since then. Lab where Misha vowed to help Polly Of course, they found Marie. But the final revelation was a scene with such horrifying violence that I felt sleepy for several minutes. Polly may never have a long life that is innocent. But I believe it is equally great movie The same laughter The same perfect effect And the same surprising wisdom. <br /> <br /> A little gem
