Brazilian films often receive more positive assessments than they actually deserve. Contrarily, the Contra Todos (Against Everybody) (the original name which the manufacturer discarded: God Against Everybody) has a very low GPA (GPA) on this website. It seems to be rejected by a female audience frankly. Actually it's not cruel. I mean, as far as graphic violence is concerned Its brutality is intrinsic, while portrays lumpens. I mean, the underdog people, in fact, have high-tech equipment, who ordered to kill coldly in exchange for Is it a postmodern person? He / she worries just by having a quick and almost non-existent sleep. Is it allowed to be special in the midst of a full meal? The picture may be Brazil's best movie in 2004 until now. The montage style that shines Ã  la Godard. The strange soundtrack strengths are more powerful than the overall actors and, above all, the narrative. Traditional with hidden spots that do not follow the time.
