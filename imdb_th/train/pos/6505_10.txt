Theo Robertson commented that WAW was not comprehensive enough after WWI, which led to the rise of Hitler and World War II. <br /> <br /> Maybe he missed the first and the 8th quarter of the 8th hour. ? Covering this period and together with the previous book in the series clearly shows the condition that I feel My friend grew up in Germany during this time, joined the Hitler Youth, and his experience was similar to those mentioned in WAW. <br /> <br /> This documentary is above my historical documentary. Own, without comparison. <br /> <br /> The only fault, and it's a small matter I have with WAW: numbers are not included many times. For example, if you are talking about lending - renting, how much will the war material be borrowed / rented? How much to Russia for Britian? How many U-Boats are there? When in 1941, how many German or Japanese ships? What kind are they? How many troops? How many partners are all the forces and how many countries? Many numbers may make a lot of viewers nod. But I want more! And naturally I want to see more military analysis, for example, why is Patton & Clark not catching up with the German army at Cassini after they are surrounded instead of Monty racing to Rome and letting it escape? I do not think you can understand the war until you see these video groups in "Total War", such as the Dresden explosion. It's like trying to understand Auschwitz, etc. Before you see the death camp clip: You just wrap your head around. It's too unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Don't know at that time and Of course, no filtering is the most serious cruelty and cruelty of Japan, including eating people (reading "Flyboys") and the survival of a medical "experiment" without any anesthetic! <Br /> <br /> Dave
