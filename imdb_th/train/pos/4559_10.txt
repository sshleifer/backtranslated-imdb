My sister was born in March 1985 and had a cerebral palsy in her 22 years of life. She didn't see anything besides our house walls and her school. I am a joke of everyone because my sister is disabled and I still think that to this day that no one is or will give a curse about her and her condition. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> I know what Christie's family is doing. But they are lucky Cristi can talk. He can communicate and have artistic skills. My sister can walk But she can't say anything and she can't use her hand to do anything but catch things But this movie made me realize that there are others in the world like my sister and the ending (To tell the truth) makes me cry And I've seen Chad Shank !!! This film is too low, serious and should not be done. This film tells people something. People should be proud of their own lives. Think you're not good at writing? This man wrote with his feet. Think you're not interesting? This man was rejected by many women due to his condition. Not the fastest runner? Cristi still can't stand up. <br /> <br /> My point: The parents of the kids. I encourage you to watch this movie with you, so they will know who next time they see anyone Someone on the road They didn't look at them like aliens. My sister has millions of stars and it makes me regret to think that this still happens to many people. This film will teach people that people who may not seem "normal" are also people. 10/10
