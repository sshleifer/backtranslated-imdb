Although this movie is a clear day But the audience can still identify easily with Buster's fate in a story that is forever underdog and funny. Buster struggles with an innocent bargain in three different eras: the Stone Age, the Roman Age and Moden. The age plays almost the same character as just changing the scene to help us identify different "ages" In this film, we have seen one of the oldest funny images of "caveman" stereotypes that win his love, not by love. But with brute force and comedy about the Roman warrior fight "The History of the World: Part I" of Mel Brooks. The basic theme of this film is simple. But trustworthy: even though times may change But we still face the same fight, even in the modern era that we fought in prehistoric times to "win the girl" (remember that Is the style of the year 1923. America when nationalism continues to be popular) is interesting to watch this movie eighty years later and consider that things have changed dramatically from "Current era" of this movie to date
