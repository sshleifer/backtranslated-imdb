I like movies a lot I remember reading it many times since I was a child and glad to see a movie made about the book. <br /> <br /> I sat for a boy and girl aged 11 and 8 and had to talk to the girl in Watching movies But in the end, she was glad to see it and said that she wanted to buy it on the DVD as soon as it came out. <br /> <br /> There was a very noisy moment and This movie is not "gross" as I expected to be ... even if it is ranked high up there. Gross-o-meter ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I can't find. Is the reason that they have to have a "stupid" line in it that is made by Woody in reference to his personal part ... that I was only one shocking moment in the movie) ... I don't know Why is it put into the movie; It doesn't add anything to the movie, except for the shocking / gasp factor ... besides being a very good movie. Glad to see the girl "Pepsi" grow up everyone
