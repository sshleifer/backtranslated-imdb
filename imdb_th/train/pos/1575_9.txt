The movie van trotta rosenstrasse is the best movie I've seen for many years. Actually, I'm not interested in movies with historical backgrounds. But with this, she received the attention from me at that time. <br /> <br /> The only annoying thing about the movie is the scene in New York. There is "trying to be as American as possible" ... which I think that certainly failed. <br /> <br /> The scene behind me really came to my heart. German actor Katja riemann deserves her complete reward. She is one of the most impressive actresses I've ever seen. In the future I will watch more of your movies. Good luck to me that I am a German owner =) and only a year in us, so as soon as I come back I will buy a DVD riemann a little. <br /> <br /> So all there Who hasn't seen this movie: watch it !!! I think it will be too long to explain what it is about, especially the flash on the back and the switch of the time is hard to explain, but just watcxh you will have fun !!!!!!!
