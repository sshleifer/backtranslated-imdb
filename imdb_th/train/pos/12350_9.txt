I'm not sure how I missed this when it first came out. But I'm glad to see it in the end. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in and around the red light district of the 19th century Okabasho, Japan. It tells the story of prostitution, caste systems and women who are strong in society according to the strength of the Japanese samurai code. <br /> <br /> It is unique Akira Kurosawa! Although he died before he directed this movie His views on the world of Japan and the caste system are famous and show how these systems interact with each other. The characters may rotate around each other. But the caste system remained when each character returned to the world in which they were samurai warriors floating into the world of good prostitutes and having love back to his life as she began. Another road with men who are part of her caste system .. the lowest, many awards from the world of samurai, above all else But is a lower caste that can help each other and those who can love without repression The samurai in this movie became weak, while the levelless couples proved to be noble. <br /> <br /> The movie deserves a higher score. It is about the survival of women in the feudal system of Japan. During this time, men were thought of as survivors .. strong people while women think that it is an unreasonable and weak property. This film focuses on the strength of Japanese women and the way they do for their survival and strength, making Japanese culture continue as before. <br /> <br /> I recommend "The Sea is Watching "to everyone who is a fan of Akira Kurosawa and even though they are not fans It is a lovely, quiet and bracing movie, and is another story that has been praised for any movie collection.
