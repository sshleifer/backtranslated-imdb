I think this movie is really good. I enjoy the show and it moves well. The director seemed to understand the story he was trying to tell. I have to see a large budget that came out today, apparently they have more money to throw. But can see a lot When you see a movie like this for a small price, you have to consider this when you are watching a movie. There are some things that should be better. But mostly related to budget The performance is quite good. F / X and stunned acting are very good. Two couples are men who play the camera as an assistant. And the boy playing the ball This type of film makes LA continue to work and this is an agreed movie.
