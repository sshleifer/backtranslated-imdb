Of course, the history of this film is "Hollywoodized" - but it's still far from writing a little history for the masses La Fitti sided with the American people because he thought of himself as a Frenchman and hated England, not because of the patriotic feelings for the New Orleans occupation country recently; He destroyed his agreement and returned to smuggling, which caused him to sail to Galveston; He is a criminal and a rogue who is even bigger than a hero * or * who is a fraud. But who cares? This is a movie that is truly entertaining - and faced with it. We all want Jean to go on a feisty girl more than to become the daughter of the governor of Brynner again to write a chapter. interesting
