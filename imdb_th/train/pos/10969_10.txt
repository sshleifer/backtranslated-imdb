I know about But never saw Gray Garden before I saw the Broadway musical of the same name A friend warned me that if I had never watched a movie, the music would not make sense. At first I thought it was a train wreck that was full of strange characters, screaming and it seemed so hard. But the ability to stop it, dig it and go back, makes me know why Gray Garden is a memorable documentary. <br /> <br /> Both Big E and Little E. Good, memorable, and lack of self-awareness are worth witnessing. Both are still beautiful, even the age of abuse. They have a relationship that will entice one woman. (And some men are undoubtedly) and make you check your contact with your mother In the era in which reality TV and movies are common, it is interesting to see Mayleses' work three decades ago and realize the impact that the movie must have. How to enter their family? But other than that, two people living in the 1970s would be able to escape the reality in a perfect way? Or that they just think too crazy to get help I suggest watching this with an opinion track, which gives me a deeper understanding of the movie.
