This unimaginable tale is the story of a female witch who is pursuing humans on the human world. Her "community" is open to members. But she hides from human spells. Hmm ... This thing is getting familiar. Haha. It's not your typical movie. The "campy" performance by Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs helps prevent boring things. Kim Novak Always have fun on the screen. But I found that the pairing with James Stewart was unusual (but not even dead). <br /> <br /> With a new interest in every dark and dark matter. That will be discovered and rediscovered by old and new audiences ...... it's still very much!
