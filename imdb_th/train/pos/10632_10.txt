This is an entertainment movie. I don't think the world creates a social explanation from a small movie. I found this movie funny, fun and memorable. It is a fantasy that is not like a female ashes that became a princess. This movie is very well done. I may add in the 70 years of the best experiment in the movie with the ability to talk about the sex of the person. Does this movie involve homosexual people? But is about love in all forms of strange This film shows some realities of being gay in the 70s in Hollywood or in California. Cute boys are being cared for by older people, not cute guys. Women who have to be deep in the closet, emotionally or at risk of not having a career. Bathhouses are an important part of the gay community. <br /> <br /> When the imagination begins !! Let us mix lesbian with gay and add alcohol and what we have? This movie, which in some way is better than a depressing repetition "The Big Big Thing" Maybe someone should ask the entire team to watch this movie and try to make it better. <br /> <br /> I enjoy this movie when I saw it in the 70s and still make a smile on my lips right now. I recommend to everyone who wants a soft, funny movie to pop and enjoy. Some people need to be lighter !!! And this is the movie you should do! <br /> <br />
