"Return of the Jedi" is often remembered for what is wrong more than what is wrong and that is a shame because the previous sector in Star Wars Saga is a sparkling example of epic storytelling. It manages to wrap the whole story of the previous movie in the last, great and reliable story. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are Ewoks - cute and cuddly bears that serve to expand the demographics of Star Wars. In the middle of the movie, there is a tendency to slow down slightly. But the last hour is the best content of the whole story, which Luke eventually confronted Darth Vader, the most well-known villain in film history. <br /> <br /> The return of Jedi has done many things correctly. People often overlook: It presents an incredible conclusion to the story of Darth Vader (which has changed from something slightly unreliable in "Empire Strikes Back" to persuasion here). exciting Eventually, Emperor Luke took part with him, the resolution of the love of Solo and Leia, and the most powerful moment on the moon. Ender <br /> <br /> Yes. A little annoyance But they are annoying to one generation of moviegoers who have time to make toothpicks in every scene. It is still a magical and moving movie that still serves as a great final chapter. It's not a 'good' movie - it's great!
