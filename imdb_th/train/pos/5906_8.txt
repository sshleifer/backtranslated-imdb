Doghi is a great movie and Renuka Daftardar is great. Uttara Baokar will always be the best in her role along with Kairee. It is the best example of the Marathi movie. There are some parts in the whole film that tend to be taught - it should help raise the movie to have a few scenes that have a social message reinforcing. These scenes may emerge from the political concerns of filmmakers. And moving enough to not need it But apart from this little story, it is a movie that deserves to be seen more and more that I highly recommend. The concern and humanism of Sumitra Bhave shines through.
