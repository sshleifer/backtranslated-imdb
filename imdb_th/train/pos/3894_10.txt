I wish I could laugh again as much as I saw this show for the first time. I haven't done it since then. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is that I find myself laughing almost hard after watching the program again and again. <br /> <br /> Eddie Izzard is cultivated. Painfully, as the people of the world He is fluent in politics and still feels that there is no need to "participate" in political discussions. He is above that. I will compare him with George Carlin, who uses his comedy to try to convince people about his thoughts and doesn't seem to enjoy the fact that he is trying to entertain. <br /> <br /> The most fun guy on earth
