This is a very charming movie which is one of my favorite romantic comedies. It's very funny and the actors are excellent. Although Laurence Olivier is mostly related to Shakespeare's work, he is shown in this film that he is not only limited to classical theater plays. He managed the transition from a disdainful lawyer who tried to avoid women and how to betray them to a cute puppy that fell in love with Lady X, easily played by Merle Obron. The conversation is amazing and refreshing, and the atmosphere is charming. Ralph Richardson is happy to watch as well. I highly recommend
