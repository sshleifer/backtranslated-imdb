I had a chance to watch this movie recently. I believe it will be in cinemas in Canada some time around Mother's Day. If staying in a theater near your home ... go! It's not a funny movie that gives a good feeling - it follows the feeling and thinks that the movie <br /> <br /> The director has done a great job in developing the character - allowing you to enter the heart of the idea. And Hagar's pain Little by little At first, her attitude and behavior were not reasonable. When her story unfolds, she becomes a person you can understand. As in life ... understanding brings compassion I found that she was a favorite at the end of the movie - especially when she opened her heart to a young man in a lake by the lake. <br /> <br /> Hagar's relationship with her two sons is painful. And ponder Our vast experience in this world John, her youngest son, who is full of life and adventure, takes the audience to the edge of the seat - and touches the raw, genuine and rare emotions. <br /> <br /> It's fun. Saw Ellen Page acting in this movie She is very different from the girl she plays in Juno. It makes me feel wider for her acting ability. If you love her in Juno, you will definitely love her in The Stone Angel. <br /> <br /> Sure, Ellen Burnstyn looks like Hagar. There seems to be no way to show the power of acting as strong as the talent. The actors that will make you forget the other characters they have played I never thought of Ellen Bernstein before in this movie - I always thought of Hagar. She swept me into her character - hook line and sinker. <br /> <br /> Kari Skogland's ability to film this famous book by one of the most famous writers of Canada is impressive She brought a wonderful screen, both the cool and angelic parts of the woman with the complex Hagar, a stone angel.
