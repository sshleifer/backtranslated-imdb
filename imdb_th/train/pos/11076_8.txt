I will start by saying that this thing is not paned by everyone about! The truth is that it's not what everyone expects, especially from Guy Ritchie. What everyone expects is a chicken and a good person, etc. But this is more mature than his previous work. I will admit that it causes confusion. But all the facts are there for us. We just have to see them and listen harder. This movie demands attention from you! Try to see interesting and impressive conversations, listen to conversations more than appreciate the performances and I think we all understand the whole story thoroughly. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is influenced by modern classics (Fight clubs, pulp novels, etc.) but it is in the manuscript, both in the direction and walking with the second song score second to none. I felt that if everyone watched this movie over and over again, they would understand it more and probably thanked it for the modern movie the way it was and I hope Ritchie will continue to be in this "Masterpiece"
