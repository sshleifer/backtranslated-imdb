I do not know how to explain "Darkend Room" because it concluded that it is not fair. It's a short Linlin movie that is quintessential to two beautiful girls in strange and mysterious situations. I will say that this story is shorter than "Mulholland Drive" at the end of the spectrum. Lynchian is different from "The Elephant Man" or "The Straight Story". It is hidden on the Lynch website and worth the search.
