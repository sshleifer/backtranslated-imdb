The 'Midnight Cowboy' was rated X with its first release in 1969. There are some scenes that you can understand a little. A movie about Joe Buck (Jon Voight) who came from Texas to New York City to become a businessman, sometimes a distraction. Dressed as a cowboy, he tried to live as a businessman, making money by acts of love. It didn't work as planned. After a man named Rico 'Ratso' Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) before pulling out his trickery and stealing money, they become friends. They live in an empty and very dirty apartment. Then Ratso was sick and Joe had to try to earn money. <br /> <br /> This movie might be rated X for the main story. The editing in this movie is very good. We see the dream sequence from Joe and Rutzo interrupted by the real world in some good and funny ways. Dustin Hoffman, Jon Voight and actor support the great performance In particular, Hoffman delivered some famous calls, scores made by John Barry and sounded good. All of this made the film a great movie that won the Academy Award for Best Picture for the reason good
