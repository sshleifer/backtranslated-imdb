I like The Lonely Lady for Pia to stop. She looks good and she has really good eyes. I don't like anything. The scene where she was raped by Ray Liotta with the garden hose is cruel and cruel Actually, many things that happened in this movie were cruel and cruel. But it is a worthless movie Many movies that are worthless are not bad at all. I like this better than the Valley of Dolls, which is not only worthless but boring. At least this is not boring. <br /> <br /> Very often nude and seems to be a writer. Watching her talk about Pushkin and Byron with men three times, her age is unbelievable. I'm sure that Pia is a good person in real life. She doesn't show the writer's picture. She seemed more happy when she worked as a receptionist for that man from Saturday Night Fever and wearing a sparkling disco dress. <br /> <br /> The two scenes were funny. The person she told the actors twice when she was pregnant, then he looked up and stared at her. "Stop hanging around!" All the time he was frustrated, almost without feeling bimbo. <br /> <br /> Pia's nervous breakdown scene is good. (The vortex of the floating face and the screaming cry - Oh!) <br /> <br /> But again, this is the trash that we're talking about. You can find the worst movie in eighty weeks.
