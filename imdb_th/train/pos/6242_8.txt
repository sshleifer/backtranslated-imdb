I agree with the previous comments on naming the content of the movie. "Crazy every day" but want to specify: "Dog Days" is about the way women treat society (male). The episodes we receive here illustrate some differences in discrimination in The daily lives of women are mostly divided by age group. There is a senior man who makes his new partner look and follow his wife to treat her like a doll that will act. "Worth wearing" a set of past, middle-aged couples who have a relationship with her almost as a slave and a boss (violent). In addition, we also find that there are younger people who do not contact with friends / His wife, and instead of envying her story, even made friendships with his competitors. A young young man makes his friend clear - a girl with a lot of problems because he is beautiful enough for him - that she must be an accessory on his side and follow the rules of manners that look narrow. Finally, there was a man in his late fifties who calculated his own advantage, giving a woman with a habit of walking, hitchhiking to an angry customer who took her in the wrong way. To complete the example, we found a friend of the man in the "slave master" - the group - after the disdain she combined - threatened and humiliated the past. "For your benefit" because she will get rid of her partner and bring herself to be a new "master". Throughout this period, residents of the nearby area that have been created recently, which have happened under Under the hot summer sun - no absolute movement (sic!) Unfortunately I didn't see the last minute of the shocking and true description of the Bora structure. Continued to dominate in the relationship between women and men. But what I have seen is a reliable analysis of discrimination. It may be a useful tool to teach even those who are less sensitive than having something wrong - due to the creation of good information.
