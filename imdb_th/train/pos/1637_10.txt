I love this movie and have seen it many times over the years. It will improve every time you look. I agree with all the positive comments here. Yes, it is witty and realistic like life in the pastures of those days. I found myself commenting while watching. There are people here saying that they are torn apart. I disagree more than this He is a wretched cunning steward who speaks a little and works like a slave / rider. Conchatta Farrell is great as Elinor, a widow whose Clyde is hired as a maid / cook (along with a 7 year old daughter Lilia Skala is excellent like a far away neighbor called Grandma. In addition, the stars are totally Montana grasslands. It is a beautiful and cruel country to settle. There are some scenes that are both nasty and necessary. No special effects here, what you see is true! It also has excellent music scores and great scripts. When you see Heartland, you'll never forget. It deserves all the 10s received here.
