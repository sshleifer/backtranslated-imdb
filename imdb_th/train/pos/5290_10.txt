Going to find things that are far from what he has done with intent, John Waters (Happy Birthday, John!) Makes a mockery about the world of celebrities / art. Edward Furlong plays the character of a teenager working in Baltimore who likes to take pictures When the New York agent (Lili Taylor) discovered his job, she offered him a big break, which he accepted. But when he hit it big, he must consider everything What we expect of course But by directing Waters, there are things that always shocked us. (You will know when seeing them) I definitely recommend, starring Christina Ricci, Mink Stole and Patty Hearst.
