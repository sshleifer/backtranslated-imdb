This is a great movie. I love it more every time I watch Most comedians are weak because you know all the gags. But the mysterious man has the integrity of writing and looks again - while Ben Stiller tears the limo hat with Louise Lasser or Geoffrey Rush flashes his fuhrer choreography or Tom Waits muttering While he watched the news report or Janeane, Garofalo rejected the kiss from Paul Reubens. This is a complete set of sound levels. Direct and continuous development stories Action sequences are creative and not too dominant, paying all the rewards at the end. Seriously, if you've seen it and it's been a long time, watch it again and if you haven't started yet. You can't see it again until you see it for the first time. (Wes Studi, William H. Macy, Trial Scene, Good Things Too!)
