This is a hilarious movie, Burt Reynolds is a NASCAR star who signed a sponsorship deal with Beatty's Chicken Ned Restaurant. The contract has all kinds of embarrassing things, such as forcing Bert to wear a chicken dress during the competition! Jim Nabors is the chief mechanic (Not credible) Loni Anderson (Oh, yeah!) Was assigned by Beatty to keep Reynolds honest and committed to the contract strictly. This is a funny movie that Bert proves that he's not too proud. I like it!
