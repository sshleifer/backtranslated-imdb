Like many Americans, I was introduced to Hayao Miyazaki's work for the first time when I saw "Spirited Away". I fell in love with this film and saw it many times. Now I'm searching to see all movies by Miyazaki. One of his previous works is "Castle in the Sky", although it is still fun. But not as good as "Spirited Away" (although this comparison or any movie with his masterpiece in 2002 may not be fair) <br /> <br /> A young man named Pazu (James Van Der Beek ) Was working in the mine one night when he saw a young woman slowly falling from the sky When she woke up the next morning, she introduced herself as Sheeta (Anna Paquin), but Sheeta had a secret and before he realized that Pazu was drawn to an adventure that would lead him to danger with the pirate army. And the missing floating city <br /> <br /> Going into the movie by Hayao Miyazaki means you can expect one thing: the magic and magic feelings. Many filmmakers tried But no one can create a miracle and awe as Miyazaki Watching movies by Miyazaki is like being able to experience the wonderful dreams of childhood. <br /> <br /> Because this movie is an animation movie, the voice of the movie is not a problem. Because it is impossible Lip movements match the words It also helps the translated conversation to be well written and sounded by talented actors. The voice acting is a great fare. James Van Der Beek is the best. He brings an irresistible enthusiasm and excitement to the role of Pazu that is perfect for the character Anna Paquin. It's almost as good as Sheeta. You But she knew what she had to do. Mark Hamill could not recognize that Muska was evil. He was dangerous and needed something from Sheeta and would do everything to get other sounds. Not good. Cloris Leachman was great, as Dola Leachman might win. Oscar for "The Last Picture Show" but she is annoying as a pirate leader. Leachman makes a terrifying disgusting character that is almost monotonous. It's terrible that it almost destroyed the film! Jim Cummings is a powerful voice actor. But he is like a general person. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend watching "Castle in the Sky". I might end up buying it myself. But even though it's not as good as "Spirited Away", it's still quite good.
