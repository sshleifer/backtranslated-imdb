Previously, I wanted to point out that I haven't read the book so there is no chance that I will be disappointed in that area. The major flaw that I found was historical details, with cars, trains, clothes and many other things. **** <br /> <br /> The technical aspect of this movie is ok, nothing to boast about. But I think the performance is great. I have no experience in acting But I can't believe that people can consider this horrible thing! Sometimes they may have only watched two movies. (And another story) and another story must be good With hard work, then fight with those who will take his life from his work. But he is involved in this fight, he does not know that there is no reason beside him and he is defeated. The disappointed Irons makes this convincing. I sympathize with his cruel character. <br /> <br / > After Jeremy Irons Winona Ryder was great as a romantic woman who was attracted to the revolutionary ideals of her boyfriend (Banderas), I thought he had a part that wasn't developed) and Glenn Close was very good. As well Meryl Stree p has an average performance, not bad at all, not up to the standards of other actors Watch out for Miguel Guido, there is a famous Portuguese actor between many stars. <br /> <br /> In contrast to today's movies, only the interpretation is important. But at the same time it was not boasting The movie is too worrying, trying to be wise. The best evidence I really liked. I wrote a review 7 years later.
