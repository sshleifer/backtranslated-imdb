This movie started slowly and got strong in the middle. However, the fact that the film ran for two nights caused the momentum to hit the highest level. The second part is really interesting. But after that he gave a pitiful ending Are playing football on the field? Is it really going to get sappy and maudlin again? Now I hear plans for a similar movie using '70s. I won't spend much effort to adjust to that if it's like "60s".
