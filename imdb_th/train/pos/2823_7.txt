MGM wasn't sure how to market Garbo when she first arrived in Hollywood. Mayer has a lot of confidence in her and appears in "Torrent" fairly. She didn't speak English, so she had to find it hard to work and Ricardo Cortez didn't make it easy for her. <br /> <br /> The heavy rain of the title is the Juscar River that runs through the small village. Sleepy in Spain, Leonora (Greta Garbo) hopes that one day her voice will bring prosperity and happiness to her difficult parents. Leonora and Raphael Don (Ricardo Cortez) is in love But he was under the thumb of his mother and could not allow her to marry Meanwhile, Dona Brull (Martha Mattox) drove Leonora's parents from their home and they sent Leonora to Paris, hoping to have the opportunity to continue working in her singing career. Leonora sent a letter to Rafael urging him to remember his contract and come with her. His mother was angry and forbade him to go - so he entered the cave as her request. <br /> <br /> Many years passed, Leonora had a new identity - she became La Brunna, the bread of Paris. Opera Raphael turned out to be his mother's desire - he ran to work and courted the "safe" girl. Remedios (Gertrude Olmstead), the heiress of Mack Swain, played the role. Her father Leonora decides to visit her old home and I agree - why don't you help her mother out? Her mother still lives in the family home, working as a man, and washing clothes. Leonora and Rafael meet, but Leonora is full of ridicule. Garbo is a very charming person. It's hard to believe that he will be happy with Remedios. <br /> <br /> The dam is exploding and the flooding in the city. Leonora's house is on the path of a raging river. But when Rafael tried to help her, he found her safe. Then they awakened their love. There was a "horizontal" love scene in the movie, similar to the scene in "Flesh and the Devil". <br /> <br /> Dona Brull spread gossip about how Leonora received her wealth and Leonora's mother believed her and told Leonora to go. Rafael met Leonora before she toured America. He intends to go with her again. But he disappointed her He spent a lot of time listening to others, ruining her reputation - "What will you do for you? But will drag you down They met several years later - she looked bright and lively as always - he looked older than his year, bowed by ordinary people. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's a good movie with a positive message. To follow your heart. <br /> <br /> Lucien Littlefield works well, such as Cupido, barber and old and honest friend of Leonora. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
