Val Kilmer and Dylan McDermott are great. I've seen Kilmer on The Doors. However, his interpretation of John Holmes is great. Nothing compared to Boogie Nights, which is rather slow. Wonderland is a movie that can show horrific crime stories from the perspective of a man who is enthralled with his drug addiction and ignores what is happening around him. At the same time, the character of John Holmes shows a very smart businessman who can go through the most disgusting and ugly situations that are almost dangerous. This film deserves to be watched more than once. The sensual and full seventies of drugs are amazing.
