I saw this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and completely blown away. The structure and operation of this film is excellent ... I know it won't. But actually it deserves an Oscar. Cal and Andre are phenomenal when both classmates are disturbed. Yes, this movie is very controversial and I can see many people who have a lot of problems with it because it involves shooting schools. However, despite the intense and blunt content, Zero Day is worth watching. I look forward to coming out in the video so I can buy it - it's very good, very good. Powerful and very intense ... The sequence of the ending scenes makes you unable to speak because it's too realistic. Their uncertainty "recorded" the image and the panic of the students, which is ambiguous beyond description I hope it gets the attention that it should be. It's done in the same way as The Blair Witch Project, which is a mobile camera that was created to be a documentary about a home video. Really impressed with everyone involved. If you have a chance, you should really see it.
