Even though it is a beautiful and amazing animation But this may be one of the most captivating Disney movies I've ever seen. The spirit is a wild horse that has been repeatedly caught, either by the cavalry or by the Indians, who both try to "destroy" him. Except for the beautiful animated movies of horses, I and I, five years old, were not inspired or very excited by this movie. It is a ridiculous story that is called "soul" because the spirit is something that this movie may be more useful. There is a special score for the soundtrack which is very fun by the songs of Brian Adams and Hans Zimmer. And although this movie is rated G, you may have to explain that "Horse destruction" means your five years old? I do. <br /> <br />
