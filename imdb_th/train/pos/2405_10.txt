Wow, I can't believe that I was the first and only person to post a comment about this great movie. <br /> <br /> Although the movie itself looks interesting enough, actually things That attracts me here is Matt lillard, for most people may think that he is too happy, caffeine, or just sucking. But we are both the same age and from the same generation and I have watched this guy many times until he is one of my favorites right now. This is one of the few movies in which he is a big shock and the main star in SLC Punk, another Lillard movie. <br /> <br /> In general, this is your usual robbery movie. Which started with a lot of madness The most notable thing in this film is another great actor named vincent D'onofrio, who is admired in the film industry. The woman in this film is a beginner and she is not too bad, even if you know that they primarily hire her for her accent and nude scenes. =) <br /> <br /> It's a Jack game with Jill and Bob as well Want to reap the rewards But share without anyone They tried to kill each other and it was time to wait for the bomb. Matt demonstrates his true courage in planning JAck, which started the entire project initially. Vincent and a few women play art thieves who want money because of lack of business. Vince's characters look a little confused and are imitated throughout the movie. But that only increases the concentration of the movie. <br /> <br /> Surprise left and right are well received and the ending is not boring and makes you feel happy. May depend on the type of finish you want This movie made me very interested, apart from the fact that Matt was in it. It was a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to watch movies. Critics may not like this movie. But they don't watch movies because they like movies anyway
