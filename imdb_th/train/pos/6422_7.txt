Military training movies have become commonplace as they become their own genre. Among the things that are more prominent than we are `Officer and Gentleman ',' Top Gun ',' GI Jane 'and now a" honorable person ". The fact that this happens actually does not change the fact that the formula is the same. This movie seems to be the most `GI Jane 'because it focuses on the corner of separation. <br /> <br /> This story is inspiring and is the story that most people are interested in. Above, Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) is a brave man with good principles and the strength of his character shines clearly in this film. Unfortunately, director George Tillman has a tunnel vision to present the character and avoid the character development of various characters other than Brashear to show Brashear in difficult conditions. Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro) is an important person and, except for the beginning of the fight and his wife, we don't know him very much. For example, Brashear saw the scar on the palm of Sunday and we had to assume That he made a plow But without tracking that point, Mr. Pappy (Hal Holbrook) got the only short scene in which we could judge him. The rest of the screen shows that he walked around and ranted. If the director is creating an interesting story of man, he must make the character become human. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding Jr. gives Brashear an outstanding performance. This is probably the best thing I've ever had. saw him This is the role and character that is more complete than any part that he had played before, and he rose to the occasion in `Jerry Maguire. 'Rod Tidwell is a fascinating person. But it is a one-dimensional character with the depths of the rainforest. Brashear is very complex and very basic, and the problems that he faces are life crisis, making the challenge even more. This is a great revival from the last chapter of Gooding in `Chill Factor '. The movie is so scary that almost the suicide of a professional will be involved. <br /> <br /> After trying his hand As a comedian (`Analyze this ',` The Adventures of Rocky & Bullring', Meet the Parents), Robert De Niro returns to his amazing roots along with Outstanding performance. DeNiro is not a bad comedian. He is a great actor who looks like he shouldn't waste time on comedy. DeNiro gave Billy Sunday a reward with a stubborn personality with the right spirit. Torture It is a pleasure to see him work. <br /> <br /> It seems that every movie I watch recently will have Charlize Theron in there. I see "The Legend of Bakker", "The Man Who Has Honorable "and" The Yard "continued, and I began to wonder if she was involved in every movie in 2000 (actually, she could only do five people). This is Theron's secondary role, but she did well and managed to live. With DeNiro's steps. David Keith, who Show together with Richard Gere in 'Officer and a Gentleman' with a cameo here. <br /> <br /> The DVD has some interesting special features, including reflections from real Carl Brashear and some negative scenes. <br /> < br /> I enjoy this movie, even though it is a story presented and a one-dimensional presentation. I give a score at 7/10. I am a sucker with an underdog story and I like the story of the strength of the characters as the main theme. This film has a special strength on both sides and brings two memorable performances to compensate for the director's shortcomings.
