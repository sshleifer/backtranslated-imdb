I didn't easily score ten stars. This movie really has to impress me and The Bourne Ultimatum is much more than that. In addition, this trilogy is well combined. I believe it will be one of the greatest trilogy of our generation. Although the three films are not much different from the Ludwig novel But they are still an important place in the success of the Bourne Ultimatum movie, making me want to cry that the series is complete. But I can't even stop smiling for hours. <br /> <br /> From the moment the title debut appears, Paul Greengrass has done it again. Everything we liked from the previous Bourne movie came back here again: action, dialogue and camera shake. However, for me, the last one never had a problem. I think it adds to the doubt. <br /> <br /> I'll go back and watch this movie many times before selling it on DVD because it's a genius It is a perfectly satisfying conclusion and should be tested at the time as a great movie and a memorable ending.
