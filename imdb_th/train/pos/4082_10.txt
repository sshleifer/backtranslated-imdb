Hayao Miyazaki is not the same when talking about using hand-drawn animation as a form of storytelling. But often he is compared to Walt Disney That wasn't fair because it was clear by watching Miyazaki's movie that he was a great artist. He has an exciting talent for both children and adults and Laputa is a really great player. <br /> <br /> Where can I start to describe the amazing and amazing movies Miyazaki's work never surprised me. Laputa is a great adventure and I wonder how the movie is filled with details and imagination. Ask yourself this question: If you are a child who dreams of a great and amazing adventure, what will it be? The answer is to fasten yourself in the seat and see Laputa because it is truly a childhood fantasy. Every minute of the movie is full of excitement ... from the chase of the train to the amazing aerial flight scene ... not to mention the excellent score by Joe Hisaishi! Everything you might want from an adventure movie is here.
