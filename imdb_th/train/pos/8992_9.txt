Really cool flick A must have for music lovers. You don't need to know about the band to enjoy movies. Before the movie, I only heard two songs from Dandy Warhols. The only thing that must have is an open mind. <br /> <br /> The movie is centered on Brian Jonestown. But they are the second person of BJM. The Dandy Warhols didn't play a huge role in the movie as I guess. But first, they didn't have the elements of the excitement and unpredictability of the BJM. You can't help. But forgotten by the band And the very attractive male face Anton Newcombe By itself, it's a profound movie and education about the music industry Just watch this movie and have fun.
