Conclusion: It is a normal business that Louche's casino in Tanger. The casino is closing and preparing for a big transaction the next day. Louche owner and some employees go out overnight, leaving a modest fee. Suddenly, the gang's armed forces invaded the casino fiercely. They killed Louche and now after the money hidden in the grave. But no one appears and still lives at the casino knowing the code to open the grave The tomb itself is a hospital full of explosives so the attacker cannot blow the door as planned. Suddenly, politeness found himself staring at the gangster Miklos in their dangerous live roulette game. <br /> <br /> Comments: This is an unrelated review. With other media Modesty Blaise, as I have not seen or read at all The first point I like to do is that it is slightly misclassified. I think this is a thriller with a clever fight between Modesty and Miklos as the main plot. Of course, there are many action scenes. But it's not an important or important part of the story. <br /> <br /> As mentioned in the main story and the scene full of suspicion is a game between Modesty and Miklos. It's a new and interesting way. In revealing the background of the character and in making many stories happen outside the casino in the past time Some people say it's almost like a pilot for a TV series, and the feeling is that it may be used for sure. But I felt it was a much better way to introduce the character than others had done. I was not disappointed in the lack of action. But I enjoy this game more than ordinary action movies This confidence and talent. <br /> <br /> 7/10
