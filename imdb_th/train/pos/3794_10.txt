`Our song 'gives us the lives of the three teenagers. Lanisha, Maria and Joycelyn - the best fans hang at the end of summer. Teen Summer - Although we do not know the signs and landmarks of this landscape, Crown Heights, Brooklyn - is / is the same for all of us. Relaxation that is lazy from the pressure and chaos in the school Welcome the heat and laziness. <br /> <br /> But if the teen's experience is universal, the city in the 90s is a different place than most of us know. Small body, new shadow carving ... Calling new land ... Labyrinth to maturity The young man who came in himself said that this is what I am. This is what I want to be. But this is the way to play in Brooklyn in the late 1990s. <br /> <br /> Jim McKay is a writer / director of this film project. But he admits that everyone who received advice with him shouted The slide opens the title 'A movie by' seems to be a list of everyone in the universe. It's a gesture But at the end of the movie, we know it's genuine. [The closing name also has the best credit and the most admiration I have ever read]. The clear sound recording by Jan McLaughlin deserves a special mention. McKay is a modest leader who knows who is telling this story - it is Lanisha, Maria and Joycelyn. His three people, they are real, their interactions have a fire of true friendship and focus. Of reality This music video does not tell the story of a teenage life. It has the seriousness of staring without blinking. <br /> <br /> They are not with us. But we can feel the privilege to listen to these things as real speech that speaks with clarity about the crisis. And dullness of daily life We testify in the modern mathematics of teenage life - how to interpret problems, computation and integration, and edit small scenes, showing a large idea throughout. Lanisha is with her father in a security-is job. The only way she could spend time with him We see the love that exists between them. But also the failure of the family and fatherhood In the connection scene, Lanisha protects her father and her mother and we see that she wants to love them both and for them to love her in return. Later, the three friends were in the dark vision and dream together - and we remember how crazy / funny children were and more sad. And at the end, Maria just walking down the street is a short story in itself. We see her gathering courage to suppress all her fears and doubts. She shows the strength that we must have in order to receive the vulnerability that makes life worthwhile. <br /> <br /> `The greatest gift of our music is that we feel the nature of friendship that Extremely unsustainable One day, alive and alive, the intimacy can be longer, just turning and floating. It's terrible, but that's what it is, right?
