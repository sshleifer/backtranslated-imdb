I remember Kasper's comic book. But can't remember the cartoon at all Maybe they are not memorable. I don't know, but my advanced age here. I'm watching the first Casper movie recently. After that I was shocked to read the user comments here. <br /> <br /> I have to learn again that Casper is not like other ghosts who like to go out each night and make everyone afraid. "He doesn't see the future in That matter, "according to the speaker here But one night he went out to the countryside of the city, causing some animals to be afraid and unable to find friends. It caused him to cry until the little fox heard him wailing and beating him. Both became friends. But soon the fox was running away for his life by hunting foxes. <br /> <br /> Other reviews are all about what happened. The fox was killed by a hunting dog (not shown) and Casper tears because of loss. "The only friend I ever had" but no one spoke about the happy ending with this story. "Ferdie" The fox became a spirit body like Casper jumped on lap, licked his face and commented the narrator "They live happily ever after." Both characters look very grateful. <br /> <br /> So sad. This is a good story with a good ending and happiness.
