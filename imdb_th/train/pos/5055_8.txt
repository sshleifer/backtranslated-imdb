I didn't expect much when I saw the first DVD. I mean Pierce Brosnan as Gray Owl? <br /> <br /> Ah ... but the story is still running. I was surprised and delighted that this true story (in general) made me want to read more about interesting characters, which means that the director fulfilled his purpose and the movie was a success!
