Indian Summer is a warm movie and has many characters that will create a good afternoon movie. (With minor modifications) <br /> <br /> This film began in the past with a group of children who set the perfect sound before cutting into the present when the adult group from the "golden age" of the camp Was invited back again to spend a few weeks on vacation by the head of Uncle Uncle Lou This film will help the audience spend more time with these characters when they remember the moments in the camp and create new memories for their last stay. This film is a great success. visit In this beautiful environment and allow them to develop without worrying about the plot development Watching these people reminisce and their relationship with each other is what this film is about and why it works well. It has never been to the top and is truly soulful, always keeping its warmth, charm and realism. I have never seen a movie in which nostalgia was caught and found myself attracted, even without ever going to these camps like children. <br /> <br /> For movies, characters that are warm and miss I sincerely recommend
