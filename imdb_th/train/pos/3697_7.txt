I caught this movie on the cable channel Sundance one afternoon. You might say "Those who love the sun" is the perfect pastime of the story. Why don't you try it? You will hang out with three people: Lukas Haas is Will (coming back after leaving everyone many years ago). Molly Parker is Maggie (we know she is part of the Bloom family) and Adam Scott is Daniel (he Be friends or The rival or fiancé), along the beautiful Falcon Lake, Manitoba, Canada, filmed in a graphic format that has been placed in bright summer colors compared to sunlight and shadows. And the support of the three members of the other two families in the merger revealed: Wendy Crewson, Mom Mary Bloom and R. Thomson, is the father of Arthur Bloom. Matt Bissonnette, screenwriter, story producer And the connection of the mustache - no need to worry. 'Lively' but the humor comes when Parker and Scott come into the group of friends to destroy and know that people are distracted. Dialogs may be compact or nothing. But we get the taste of cooking, confusion or doubt. <br /> <br /> Yes, "Who Loves the Sun" can be classified as a sleeping gem. The chemistry between the five principal teachers, of course, the gel and 'combusts' give the performance of the band full of energy. In the end, it was all in the family and the film was not too serious. <br /> <br /> It seems that the official website still exists at "wholovesthesun.com" and contains information about the soundtrack by Mac McCaughan (Portastatic with music and guitar strings) with excerpts and after recording production, interviews with screenwriters, producer Bissonnette about the movie And the idea of ​​selection of actors and others, has admired Molly Parker for a long time since his performance in 1996, 'Kissed' by Lynne Stopkewich, and she married Bissonnette, who "wrote Maggie for Molly"
