The early drama of Sirk. This film was filmed in black and white as a secondary movie. But also demonstrates the acumen of the German director in adding a tiring story to a similar art Barbara Stanwick, founded in 1910, was a woman who sinned by leaving her husband and small family in the city to seduce the Chicago stage. She never fulfilled her ambitions and was drawn back to the city she left with a letter from her daughter. Enthusiasm told her that she liked the theater as well. (Secondary production is that) She returned to her old town again to fight with little thoughts and to deal with the eldest daughter who is her enemy. (And boring) (Richard Carlson) and the former plot lovers are nothing new, but Sirk makes himself different by creating meaningful elements, with every frame shot carefully and he gets help. Overwhelmingly from Stanwyck being his leading woman It works very clearly, 76 minutes, and that is also because the material has no legs to go anymore.
