According to my opinion, everyone should watch this movie at least once. It makes things in my view. Although it is a fictional story But this movie is about what might happen to your children. <br /> <br /> It shows that two children can easily hide their hatred at the school. This movie will not work in other ways. They pull out the mobile camera completely. <br /> <br /> It reminds us of April 20, 1999 when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and Themselves It also reminds us of the media storm that followed later. Everyone wants to watch Rampart videos and everyone wants to watch the basement tape. <br /> <br /> This movie is our dream version that is true. We went to see the children behind the monster. <br /> <br /> The only thing bad about this movie is that it's not good in the market and some people know that it really exists. If it had a single preview in a single blockbuster movie, everyone would see that the big story about Zero Day. <br /> <br /> I believe this is the best adaptation of the movie. Filmed in school Of the few people who truly tried The filming took only ten minutes per hour and the movie was half-long because most of the time focused on Cal and Andre and what they did until that point. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it yet This movie went to rent it and watch it. I guarantee that when you're done, you won't say anything.
