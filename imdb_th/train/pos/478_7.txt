I am quite surprised that none of the critics have commented on the initial chess irregularities in Luzhin's game as being white to an unnamed opponent immediately before the finals. Despite Jonathan Speelman's use as a chess consultant, Luzhin showed that he won the game with illegal moves. During a quick cut-off and back to the board, it is not difficult to see that after Lucine's reunion in the Queen's sacrifice, his cheating at d1 is still pinned by black c1 So he couldn't play the partner who was claiming Rd1-d8, which is illegal - but he showed that he made a loud applause from the audience.
