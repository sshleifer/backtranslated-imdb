Everything is better in the past days Even television for children and Fraggle Rock proved my point easily. While writing this comment, I was fourteen years old. But even in my teenage years, I couldn't resist the charm of Fraggle Rock for those of you who lived under the rock. (Haha!) Fraggle Rock is a group of playful and foolish animals called Fraggles who Lived in the rock magically But they are not only living things That stone lives with other species such as Doozers, hard work and many living plants. On the outside of the stone on one side, the doctor, scientist and inventor is alive - the dog Sprocket (which later became friends with the Gobo Fraggle). On the other side, the family of the guardians should be the Gorgs of the universe. Brave), Mokey (arty and quiet), Wembley (unsure and friends with Gobo), Boober (pessimistic gods) and red (love everything related to sports and feud) in some The situation At the same time, while singing and dancing with interest, <br /> <br /> Fraggle Rock is a family show. Of course, plans may have complex details that the baby may not follow music - and Dance will make their attention. The characters are strong and are like the conflicts they believe and the exciting adventures of The Gorgs are terrifying, Doc and Sprocket enlightening, Uncle Traveling Matt. Hilarious (the postcard group has a lot of 80!) And the final episode changed. Stay true to the Fraggle Rock again!
