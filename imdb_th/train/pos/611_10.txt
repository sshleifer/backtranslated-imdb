I confirm that in the end, anyone who is responsible for creating / approving the movie preview is completely wrong. No one, I know that I want to watch this movie from the example and everyone who really sees (I know) definitely loves it ... The ad campaign is embarrassing / disastrous / catastrophic / wrong. <br /> <br /> Open at # 4 after ... <br /> <br /> # 1-Rush Hour, which I never saw the average IMDb score 7.4. <br /> <br /> # 2-The Bourn Ultimatum, which I got Saw a great movie But the 3rd week on average, IMDb score at 8.7 (should be the one that I will tell) <br /> <br /> # 3-The Simpsons Movie that I have watched. But the 4th week on average, IMDb 8.1 score (my opinion is slightly high) <br /> <br /> # 4-Stardust Average IMDb score 8.4 (dropped from Bourn but it's ours for 3 weeks) <br / > <br >> Whether it is a bad time or bad advertising, I think the power behind this movie made me disappointed. This thing should be advertised as an amazing movie that happens to be a fantasy / fairy tale and doesn't advertise that it's just another fairy tale? Too bad: (Next - now I have a pointless vulgarity ... Great movies. See it!
