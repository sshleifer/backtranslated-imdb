Except for the awkward scenes, this refreshing fairy tale fantasy is fun and enjoyable under the wit of mocking the charming adult audience as well as the powerful soundtrack that drives this fairy epic. Except for one scene of Robert DeNiro that is not smooth and does not make sense to the tone of the rest of the movie, this sweet romantic fairy tail gives a wonderful storytelling feel and strong magic. The lighter adventure scenes and spiritual humor do better. In the updated tradition of THE PRINCESS BRIDE, the contemporary presentation of magic and love is an attractive eight out of ten stars.
