This review is devoted to Keith Moon and John Entwistle. <br /> <br /> The Drum and Bass Traditional <br /> <br /> Looks like there is. Very early in the morning Moreover, it is 'Avoid it'. Now a day, it tends to be a very different person, both jokes, parody, shadow of their better year. For fairness, no one in them will have to prove anything to anyone anymore. They are respected and overtime. <br /> <br /> This concert image for me is one of the best. In order to control an audience of about 400,000 people who are extremely crowded, they need to use their skills, talents, intelligence, and beautiful music. <br /> <br /> All of us know about other acts. The week before Jim Morrison died), Moody Blues, Hendrix, Taste, Free and many more. The point is that anyone who is there is who most people come to see. This show is one year after the great hippie festival of the 1960s; Stock movies and recordings and the greatest work of the day is Tommy. Hungry crowds want to taste in order to experience their own unique events in order to be able to "Grove and Love" in the knowledge that this gig is my own. To do this, you have to get the best from Rock 'n Roll to throw a crowd like crazy. <br /> <br /> At two o'clock in the morning, announcing "Ladies and gentlemen, rock bands Small c & roll from Shepherd's Bush, London 'OO' <br /> <br /> John Entwistle's bodysuit is made of black leather. Roger wears a human skeleton from the neck to the toe, wearing his traditional dress with long and furry hair. Keith in a white T-shirt and jeans because Pete has a white pot set and Doc Martins that he likes to wear. <br /> <br /> Those who have never stopped their high-energy rock attacks for more than two hours, their performances and the greatest tracks of other artists, such as Young Man Blues, Shaking ' All Over and from QQ Keith baiting crowded "Shut up, it's a blood-flowing opera" with Tommy Rock Opera Crowds are crowded. This is what they have heard and those who are not disappointed, straight to the tapped and never go up into the air until the last message of "Tommy, do you hear me?" Amazing. <br /> <br /> Capturing this band's performance at their peak at the festival that will be the last of all in the world is a movie history. Marvelous <br /> <br /> English DVDs come in the English / Linear PCM Stereo soundtrack like in America. I think you can get it with 5.1. At least "check local media details?" In That is ok. <br /> <br /> The leave of the DVD is 85 minutes without any specials, which is disappointing. Yes, for rock history and festivals, this DVD will send you in travel memories during the time you press play for some of the best concert video images that it intends to be fresh, raw and in the face of. <br /> <br /> I'll give you ten DVDs if it's not because of lacking 5.1 and some special things. Well, <br /> <br /> Thank you Roger, Pete, John and Keith.
