The second feature involves a young woman in London who is desperate to have a job and is willing to take a fresh secretary position with an old woman and her son. The excitement about people being held in the house will make me feel uncomfortable - I feel like being a prisoner too - but this pretty B movie isn't scary. It is far and unlikely. But not interesting and Nina Foch stepped in quickly Doing this new thing in 1986 (as "Dead Of Winter") proved that it shouldn't be wise because of the planning elements, not of the current era. "Julia Ross" is very compact. (Too short at 65 minutes!) But it is still a good route until reaching the peak that is too hectic, which makes it feel a little careless *** from ****
