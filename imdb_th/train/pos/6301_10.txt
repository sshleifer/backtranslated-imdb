I joined the filmmaker's Symposium and this film was shown after we watched a movie that was not good and participated in a 40-minute discussion, although it was incredibly late and we were tired. But all the audiences enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think this movie is hilarious in all the right spots. They grow up with you in the movie.
