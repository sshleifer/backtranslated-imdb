I think Ice Age is a great movie! As a 30-year-old woman without children, I still enjoy a funny cartoon movie with a flair. Sid is the best character I've ever seen, sometimes better than Bartok in Anastasia (although he is really funny And I don't think his character will get along well I have watched the movie for at least 15 times (I own it clearly) and I refer to this movie at work. (Many times ... yes, also) My favorite scene is the part that Sid says. "Oh, oh, I love this game!" A pack of lies, a pack of problems, a wallop pack, a pack of birds, a pack of flying fish ... "Or, anyway, the parts that go! That is the most fun part of the whole movie, although I enjoy the humor behind "Sloth on the map" and many other parts as well. The only animated film that can be compared to Ice Age from a distance is "Brother Bear".
