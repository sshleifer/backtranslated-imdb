For people who use the real film, this movie is a must to consider because it is used as a comparatively little symbol for the movie itself. The science of Janos Rukh / Boris Karloff involves the capture and projection of cosmic phenomena. This light can do harm or may be controlled to do well. On the other hand, it makes his mother blind. On the other hand, it is used to treat blindness. ("I can see!" Shouting a young girl with this shining eye.) When Rukh / Karloff is poisoned by the amazing power of this light, we see him glowing on his hands and face as if it were erased. The bad way develops, drawing attention to the fact that the people we are watching. Entities viewed on movies (Clearly visible as in the cinema when the power goes out) <br /> <br /> There is an amazing story near the beginning that Karloff / Rukh describes his research as being informed of the facts. Everything that has happened is captured by the light that spun through space for millions of years, since the light from Andromeda was released from the galaxy at the time that the earth was still a molten rock. <br /> <br /> There is a message in the film when this new science has been applied to older cultural vehicles: the writer's role in Beulah Bondi / Arabella Stevens; And religion, which is a symbol of the statue on the temple of Carlos Blast with a projector / ray gun. <br /> <br /> We must be surprised here if this movie is intended to see what happens in Germany. At that time, and especially in the use of the film of Riefenstall last year to promote the regime that will certainly happen. To do many dangers: the victory of wills <br /> <br /> happily in the end, mother (Violet Kemper Cooper) intervened to warn Janos Rukh about the first law of science. <br /> <br /> If there is only a movie that makes you want to stand up in the cinema and shout: "I can see!"
