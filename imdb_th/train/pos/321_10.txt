I don't know why this movie has a low rating in IMDb. This movie comes with "I am Curious: Blue" as a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The only thing that will disappoint you in the movie. This is if you don't like the process of movies. Like psychology, or if you expect to have hard-core pornography. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie that you want to watch to relax. It is a movie you want to see like other masterpieces with time, attention and care. <br /> <br /> ****** SUMMARIES may have spoilers or two ***** ** *** <br /> <br /> The important thing about this movie is that it combines both movies together in the movie. But it is done in a way that sometimes you forget that the novel is not true. <br /> <br /> There are many movies in one story: <br /> <br /> 1 political documentary about social systems in Sweden at that time Which in many ways remains relevant to today An interview made by a girl named Lena. <br /> <br /> 2 stories about filmmakers Vilgot Sjoman create a movie ... He deals with his star relationship in this movie and the way he does. Should be related to the person he should work with. <br /> <br /> <br /> 3 movies that Vilgot is creating about a girl named Lena (IE. # 2) who is a child and politically active. She is doing a documentary (IE. # 1). From this, she is still very old and into her sex and free. <br /> <br /> The elegance and cleverness of "I am Curious: Yellow / Blue" is these three elements that have been cut. Together At one point you are watching a political interview and the next thing you see is what the interviewer is doing behind the scenes. But doing so well that sometimes you forget that it's a story. <br /> <br /> Another thing is the dynamic between "yellow" and "blue", which if you see a pattern, you have to see another form. One "Blue" is not a sequel. I will try to explain as best I can because my knowledge doesn't have other films that do it, even if it's a great technique. <br /> <br /> Think "yellow" is a living event. True in 14 complete storytelling scenes <br /> <br /> Think of "Blue" as everything in between 14 scenes in "Yellow" that you didn't see. That's a complete story by yourself. <br /> < br /> Basically they are pictures. Parallel ... The same story is told in two different ways. <br /> <br /> It's not until I see "Blue". The first 30 minutes I understand "Yellow" <br /> <br /> I hope this will be useful for people who are discouraged by various influences because this film changes the way I watch movies. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
