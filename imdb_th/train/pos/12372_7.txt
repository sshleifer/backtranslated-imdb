Sentinel is a movie my father suggested many years ago and I've seen it many times. It entertained me all the time while it was creepy as well. The retrospective is what makes me real. Cristina Raines' father runs around eeriely with two creepy women who often send chills down my spine. It is a good thing with general evil things. But at least it was fun The ending I think is one of the best in horror history. It had many shocks and doubts when seeing Burgess Meredith doing his things as Chazen put me on the edge of my seat. The Sentinel had perfect tension. We never felt comfortable when Allison appeared on the screen. We know that something bad is waiting for you and that makes everything more tense. This movie is often neglected among the fans that are scary, but I think it's one of the best stories and that's enough for all horror fans to be satisfied. <br /> <br /> Show Cristina Raines has her wooden moments But come in a good way for most She looks beautiful and her chemistry with Saranon feels natural. Chris Sarandon is great as a fan. Michael has a screen that appears immediately and I can't help but love him. Martin Balsam, Jos√© Ferrer, John Carradine , Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Sylvia Miles, Deborah Raffin, Jerry Orbach, Richard Dreyfuss, Jeff Goldblum and Tom Berenger all have a memorable role or a small pendant. Meredith's people are as good as Chazen. Which we found very scary, Eli Wallach & Christopher Wlake n well done as a failed detective Beverly Angelo has a chilling scene that I will not waste. <br /> <br /> The Sentinel bottom line is a powerful horror movie that fans are horrified by the horror that is often ignored. It will make you excited and scared. You must be satisfied. Worth watching. <br /> <br /> 7/10
