The sad thing, acting like Six Degree and Brothers & Sisters is a real reality TV, not a junk that doesn't have anything more than a praised game show. I think the ground of dissatisfaction was there in the last few years, with many pre-scheduled cancellations on cult-based programs. But with more voices than Jericho's fans (which I like) and other programs, the network may start to reverse this trend. I'm like everyone else. I won't support any new items until they get the second season. I will decide to watch and watch through DVD and online viewing. Previously, ABC, you have lost me as an audience to any new program.
