I saw the brother's shadow at the Tribeca Film Festival and liked it a lot! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are great dads and sons. The following movie, Scott Cohen, from a parole in Alaska, returned to his family in Brooklyn. He appeared there because his brother had died and he began to travel to repair the separate relationship with his wife and children. His brother and father never forgave him because it was the black sheep of the family. The story takes us into the heart and mind of this family and helps you understand the complexity of their lives. In addition, the image of the woodworking business and the backdrop of Brooklyn also set the tone for this complete and revealing family image.
