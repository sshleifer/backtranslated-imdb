The film includes Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill and General Custer. Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill and Jean Arthur plays Calamity. Jane and Charles Bickford act as bad people selling weapons to Indians. This is the first time Cecil B.B. DeMille and Gary Cooper work together and the next movie created is the same. The film begins with the assassination of Lincoln and is also related to the Indian War. Disaster Jane is falling in love with Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill is married and now wants to stay home. This film is related to Custer's last scene and still far from accurate. Gary Cooper is as good as usual and I don't usually like Jean Arthur but I like her here.
