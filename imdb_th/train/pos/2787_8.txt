Originally I rented this movie for my daughter because she was enthusiastic about football and I was not disappointed like that. (Except the story that interferes with the football scene) As a father, I think I was a little surprised with the introduction of lesbian topics - but I have to admit that as a parent these problems are available to all children today (As uncomfortable as I feel about the topic) in the way that this mood is the right part of the main movie - at some age, you have to trust your children to choose their own This dilemma was introduced by a teenage girl born in England called Jasminder (Jess) - an East-Indian heritage that dreams of playing professional football. The marriage of her older sister in the traditional Hindu marriage gives many opportunities for her to explore (in a good way) her hopes and fears for her future. <br /> <br / > Multicultural challenges are a very interesting technique to explore Jesse's frustration with the expectations of her parents - there is no difference in the relationship between parents and children. <br /> <br /> In the conclusion, the football scene is great. (Many have to learn in Slowo) and while I don't want the story - there is something necessary to keep the movie going.
