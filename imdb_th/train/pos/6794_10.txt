I read through most comments posted here and all I can say that most of these posters have significant problems in life. This performance is very different from most game shows. It's very fun. Mr. Shatner, who is great in everything he does, is once again a hit. He is a bright and glowing personality, as if he was a sign. He's fun and makes you smile & that's what the program does. The dancers and fashion questions around them that present them add interest to the program. And although there is a lot of money to bet on, but it's fun. The pressure (stress) that exists on most game shows isn't here. Many people who post messages complaining about dancers & choose how much questions & c, like millionaires, don't have the same time. All I can say is that most of you miss all the concepts. The idea here is to be happy and enjoy yourself. There is something for everyone. Qustions to test your knowledge, eye eye, suspense, fun personality of Mr. Shatner ... If that is not someone who likes fluency. And if that is not enough, you can get rich! I really miss acting From all the games that show that the game I used to hate and quite frankly, I hate acting. This game is a game that I really like and truly miss.
