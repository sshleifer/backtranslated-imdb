Young Mr. Lincoln is the first film of collaboration between the director / actor of John Ford and Henry Fonda. I remember many years ago. Fonda said that as a young actor he was worried about playing Abraham. Lincoln and feared that he would not be in the challenge. <br /> <br /> John Ford, before filming, made him comfortable. Said that he would not play as a great deliverer But only lawyers, prairie jack legs Being convicted for Fonda is an actor that John Ford directed as a classic movie. <br /> <br /> This is not Lincoln's biography. That was before in the age of sound with Walter Huston and one year after Young Mr. Lincoln, Raymond Massey played the Pulitzer Prize by Robert Sherwood Abe Lincoln in Illinois. Massey is still the exact Lincoln. <br /> <br /> But as Ford said, Fonda was not a great player, a small town lawyer in Illinois. This film is related to Lincoln's childhood, about 10 years. We saw him standing in a general store, accepting legal books from a pioneer immigrant family, whose path he would cross again in this story. And his love for Ann Rutledge, with her first death, made Lincoln the most sad thing. <br /> <br /> For about 10 years, Lincoln was a practicing lawyer at Start receiving notifications He served a few words in the legislature. But he returned to private life, not sure if politics was his or not. <br /> <br /> This is a place where there is a lot of action. The two sons of that family, he received a law book since returning when accused of being a murderer. He offered to protect them. And not a normal murder But a deputy sheriff. <br /> <br /> The trial is fiction. But the tactics used in the defense of Richard Cromwell and Eddie Quillan, the two son players, are based on the actual case of Lincoln. <br /> <br /> In addition to showing the strength of the young, Mr. Lincoln is the way John John gathers the mood and atmosphere and atmosphere of a small town in the grasslands in Illinois. Celebrate July It's almost like you are watching a movie. And it is the mood of the country itself. The bright and growing young people <br /> <br /> Fans of John Ford's film will remember the two musical themes here that are repeated in the movie. Later At the beginning of the interlude with the romance with Fonda and Pauline Moore, an anthropomorphic anthropomorphic music player in the background, the same theme used in the movie The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance for Vera Miles and In the lovely Susan Brown choreography at Fonda and Marjorie Weaver, Mary Todd is the same person that Fonda dances with Cathy Downs in My Darling Clementine at a dance to raise a church in Tombstone. <br /> <br /> Lincoln will be a subject. Favorite of biographers and playwrights forever Because of two reasons, I believe First, he is the center of the lives of our American legends about people rising from the lowest point to the pinnacle of power through their own efforts. In fact, Young Mr. Lincoln clearly displayed Lincoln's background and secondly, the fact that he was our president during the greatest crisis in American history and he made good decisions and morals in Decided to choose an independent slave during the civil war, although there were political reasons necessary His assassination confirms his place in history. <br /> <br /> In addition to Fonda and others I mentioned, special praise should go to Fred Kohler, Jr. and Ward. Bond, both cities louts Kohler as a murder victim. Bond, the alleged leader Donald Mek, a prosecutor and Alice Brady in her last film as the pioneer mother of Cromwell and Quillan And a great performance from Spencer Charters, who specializes in characters as judges. <br /> <br /> For movies that include plays and love stories of a given time, you can't do it. Better than Young Mr Lincoln
