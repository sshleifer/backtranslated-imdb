This isn't Jimmy Stewart's best movie - I have to admit quickly. However, as some people regard his movie as a pure propaganda, I wonder what happened to it. Yes, of course, just like the TV program THE FBI. This is clearly the case from the public relations office trying to support. But when entertainment can go, it is a good job. It is also surprisingly enough for the film to focus on crime rather than intelligence and "Commies" instead of assuming one of the earliest agents and careers he chose Now, considering the representative played by Jimmy Stewart, it is quite certain that the performance and writing are good because this is a movie with a real budget. Overall, it's worth watching. But not great
