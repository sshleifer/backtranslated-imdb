Maybe I'm inclined to the fox, the story of the fox and all. But I think it's amazingly done. <br /> <br /> I'm really happy that it shows when Lily isn't easy, like lights and rooms (try not to waste much here). I think it is. Important for children to see and try to understand. <br /> <br /> After reading other comments, I was a little confused. One person said that at the end - spoiler - mother and her son appeared. When she told her son about her story The movie I saw didn't have a mother or son at the end, just a drawing of a girl with a fox. Can someone teach me that? However, I enjoy this movie very much, although some scenes may be a bit slow, which may be difficult for children with high powers to sit. Still worth it if they can sit still
