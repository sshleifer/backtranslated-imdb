Perhaps this is the best movie ever created, and if it wasn't, it was one of the movies that were burned on your iris as Brian De Palma gave. This is one of the great movie art works. The first thing is the touch of director Brian De Palma, which once again proves that he may be one of the best directors of all time. There is a great performance from Al Pacino that gives the immortal hero on the big screen (Tony Montana ) Many different (intense) scenes that you will never forget (The scene with a chain of scenes in which Tony is sitting in the bathtub, which is as large as most people's living rooms) has one great torpedo. Many times, the word "f * ck" is used) with great little details (Pan American-globe that shouts "This is your world") or the great song from Giorgio Moroder without any name. That is not noble here and it is easy to go along with "The Godfather", "Good fellas" and "White heat", one of the best gangster ever created!
