The collection of old stories is a challenge for the production team. This classic character will be updated and made it interesting enough to attract new audiences while awakening memories from the past. In my opinion, their mission was fulfilled. Must see for young children, pre-teens, and parents. OK, there are a few horrible moments that have been fixed for a short time, but parents with young children should sit firmly. This movie will move to better things. I will go with a wise user reviewer who points out that Emma Roberts gave us a good example for a young woman, not a syrup about it. Nancy creates a balance of her femininity with excellent work skills. (You can think of yourself as an added bonus and a favorite character.) Nancy Drew also created a good dating movie in my opinion.
