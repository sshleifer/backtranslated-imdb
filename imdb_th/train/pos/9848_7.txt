I watched this movie with my eyes and I was not disappointed. The story is well known, some abandoned orphans have to be brought to their parents by three people who are unlikely. (Tiger, swords, tigers and lazy animals) ... and I don't want to forget to talk about the small, fierce animals of his hazenut. It works. It's funny and it's "must see" with your children (they'll like it).
