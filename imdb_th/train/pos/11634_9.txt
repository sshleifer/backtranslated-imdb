I just came back from Redeye's advanced screening and I have to say that I've never enjoyed movies for a long time. WES CRAVEN is his best ever. He brought the end of an amazing summer thriller that I really wanted. This is a thriller of the year .. No doubt <br /> <br /> All the actors are amazing and the action is realistic and fun. F / X is great. It constantly creates doubts. I was on the edge of the seat of most movies. For a long time, I heard the audience cheering and clapping and excited in the theater. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for excitement, action and good plans this summer, REDEYE will deliver. !
