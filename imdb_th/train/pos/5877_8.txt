Okay, this movie is as good as I said. But you have to see it worth it It's about two boys, Mac and Sam who are good friends and work as a fashion photographer, and when laughing begins when Mac (Akshay Kumar) starts dating 3 aircons simultaneously, causing his wife to wonder Sam attained a fortune and almost forgot a friend. But not perfect But Mac thinks that he started dating a flight attendant with garam masala in every step of the rock music movie. But something lacking The comedian is not up to the mark and deserves the prize. It's good, but not all that is great. Some people laugh until the stomach ache But it is not appropriate to laugh But of course, everyone's opinions are different. So if you want to watch a movie, you're happy to do it.
