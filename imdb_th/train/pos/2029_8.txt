As the only horse lover who can appreciate this movie There are some movies that show the ability to ride a horse like this. I like to know if Brian rides his own horse in the movie. Still want to know that if he enjoys horses, Brian is in many movies that he rides Where did he ride? The only difficult part for me is that the riding scene is always full of tilt like a horse that can run forever with full steam. The camera works first and captures the horse in a way that shows how dangerous things can be on the horse. It's very interesting to know how they performed this movie selection to find a talented horseman.
