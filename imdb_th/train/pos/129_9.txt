With the dramatic filming and the nonsense of Kafkaesque, this movie made me get a simple but interesting opening scene. love it The characters are drawn superficially and the story itself is slightly and may be pointless. But these are the failures of the movie. But there is a conscious option The film's work is not trying to make history. But is a war movie of the era Fri 1940. <br /> <br /> I will have problems proving that there are substances that are really true for movies. But this movie is a surprising movie that I was swept away. This is one of the most beautiful filming movies ever, and has an imagination in its style. I completely understand why people hate me but give 9/10.
