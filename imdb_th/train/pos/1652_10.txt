This series brought me into Deighton's writing and music genre when I was young and I liked the presentation of this story. However, I do not agree with the comments above. From what I've read in the past, it's not Holm's performance that makes Deighton refuse to launch the series. But killing all three books received from the translation to the screen A good example of this is the rewriting of regular students who finished Samson's field career. The scene was not in the book, the characters who died in the minefield were never in any book, and the crossing in Sinker came from East Germany to West Germany, not the Polish border All of this story is cloth. Changes in the same set damage the integrity of the story. My view of Holm's performance is that he shows Samson's chaos while pampering his wife perfectly, and I believe that his coordination is very good. Samson both paid for his father's ideology and suffered because of his influence on his life. As Clevemore's comments, he received an education that he might have been working in the department. I think the actual loss of performance is caused by more than anything. Tiny Holmes compared to Samson's book - an impressive physical person can use his size to determine the status
