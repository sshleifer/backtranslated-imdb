Obviously, this is one of Shemp's first shorts and Stooges (this doesn't include his previous years with the team), but the humorous moments of the three are the best here. In addition to the intense pain scene, there are other more detailed scenes, but also funny. See Larry when Shemp asks him to watch the camera to take pictures. Or see the real objects that motivate MoE to exclaim, "Oh ... Mahogany that is highly refined!" <br /> <br /> Emil Sitka is his fool. And the fool may look scary But he was funny It seems that he is frustrated and baffled by the Stooges, just like people in shorts. <br /> <br /> For those who love Shemp, this is a must-have scene. It will not disappoint.
