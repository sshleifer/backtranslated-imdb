What can I say? I grew up watching Hum Saath Saath Hain, Hum Aapke Hain Koun and Maine Pyar Kiya Soraj. There is always a difference. Movies are a part of our lives in the evolutionary era of Soraj. Love and join the loving and great family. Vivah is a journey for couples who are preparing to open a marriage and love marriage. Shahid works well. Anupamji is always excellent. One way for me, she is not suitable for that chapter. We have seen her in Ishk Vishk and Ab ke baras and Main ho on Na. So stop showing different roles that you didn't do. She's very good in Main ho on Na and ishk vishk. However, the great work of Barjatya, this film revives the values ​​that we forget. Sweet Movie of the Year Great music and lyrics I'm not sure if it's a remake, but it's a great story that is original. Soraj's movies are great, so we always expect things that are different from him. Great work by the actors and everyone Lovely family movies to enjoy with parents, siblings, friends and loved ones. I give 10 out of 10
