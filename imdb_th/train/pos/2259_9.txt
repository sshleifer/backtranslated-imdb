I bought this cheap item from the scrap that was rented at our local store. It's almost in perfect condition and I've never heard it before. Obviously nobody else. <br /> <br /> I don't want to believe that I'm lucky. You enter the whole empire of emotions and try to listen to complex messages - a moral and non-victory gesture of the Mandela Even with a large length (I have to watch it in two sittings) - it's like a book that can't be laid down. Maybe music is not something that is memorable. But the spirit of that thing shines forever I cannot understand the opinion that the musical (Designed to perform on stage) is unrealistic! I've seen "South Pacific" and read books as well and can guarantee that music is unrealistic compared to this book. I will find this precious object until it runs out. One day they will do this again with a better budget. <br /> <br />
