There are four great films that describe the Vietnam War. They are (in particular: Apocalypse Now, born on the fourth day of July, Platoon, and finally Tiger Land. But Tiger Land focuses on real wars and their characters. Boz's character is one of the most important human depictions of questions about war and its absurdity. This is done in many war movies. Dealing with his feelings and emotions is the driving force of this movie. Boz's character makes this movie very good. It's a shame that has not been released big time. It's in the shelves of fans.
