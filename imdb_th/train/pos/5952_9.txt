This movie has a sense of humor, charm and is easily appreciated for those who enjoy light entertainment. Hollywood is a place to learn history seriously, so I accept it as it is. Bing In his usual inimitable style, he worked well like a blacksmith, Hank Martin, who was accidentally sent back to another era, which was the time of King Athena. The stunning Rhonda Fleming, like Alisande or Sandy, the object of Hank's love, even though she is engaged to the brave and formidable Sir Lancelot Lottie, played by Henry Wilcoxon (Cedric Hardwicke), Sir Sagramore (Wm. Bendix) and Hank (Bing Crosby) dress up with tattered clothes and lead to high streets with their backpacks to touch the kingdom. King Arthur's comments "I say that we are not alone" while giving a scratch to his good clothes is one of the hilarious moments in the movie. William Bendix's depiction is absolutely ridiculous, not to mention his efforts. In "Olde English" <br /> <br /> The story is not deep. But did very well in my opinion and I enjoyed it more every time I saw It is also a great family entertainment. <br /> <br />
