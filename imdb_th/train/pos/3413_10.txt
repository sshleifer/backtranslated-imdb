Just go out and don't believe what this great documentary is. You barely walked out of the theater in fear and surprise. Recently, the movie has become very exciting as the excitement of discovering something special and unique will never happen. Amores Perros did this for me when the film first screened and now what I'm doing. I never knew this before and was very surprised. If you hear the concept, you may feel that this is one of the movies about the amazing victory that is covered by top music and trying to make us believe in the wonderful stories that tell Luckily, this isn't the movie. People tell stories! This is a great job to capture every moment of their participation as we enter their world and feel every second with them. There is a lot more to climb that makes everything tense. Touching the Void is a good document about climbing and demonstrating violence in participation. But this movie is more human. I just saw it today But I will go and say that this is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.
