I am far from Sylvester Stallone and I guess the only time I admire his appearance is in the French movie Taxi 3, which is a small role that is almost irrelevant. And I have to admit that this movie is not really bad, even though I'm afraid of the worst. <br /> <br /> When Gabe (Stallone) fails to help a friend's girlfriend From his peak of 4000 feet, he couldn't force himself to work as a mountain ranger. For nearly a year he had not arranged food in the reserve. But more than come back Shortly after he returned, they received an emergency call from a group of climbers who were hit by a snow storm. At least that's what the trustee believes. In fact, it was a group of robbers who collided with their planes in the mountains. After the plan, the courage to steal a case filled with money from a plane, the government flew. These cases spread throughout the reserve area and they needed the help of professional climbers to pull it back ... <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not one of the smartest movies. quite But in terms of it is a fun one. I am particularly happy with John Linthowow as the evil expert leader and the leader of a gang of robbers. I know him best from the TV series "3rd Rock from the Sun" but I also enjoy his performance in this movie as well. Overall, the show is ok. There are many actions to be presented and of course there is one of the mariners. But it has a very good decoration This film was filmed in a beautiful natural environment. I like snowy mountains and valleys, rivers, mountains and forests ... Maybe that's why I gave this movie higher than I ever had for this type of action / adventure movie. I give 6.5 / 10 if You don't expect too much. This is a fun movie.
