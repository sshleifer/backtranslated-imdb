Jimmy Cagney constantly competes with your eyes on the stage creators who are struggling with the upcoming "talk" movie. <br /> <br /> The story of love, deceit, women and dance. This is presented in the form In a manner that is an audience, you will not be treated boring. The direction of the scene in the practice room is very good. The story never disappears in this crazy rhythm. <br /> <br /> Some of the content presented here has become a little day. But it doesn't matter because when you watch here in the 1933 time frame, it is incredible to watch this movie next to many movies released during that time. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Cagney is a sight that Painful in this movie Producer of the preview work created for the theater as an intros. In this way, he tried to save his life, quit the business. He was the Broadway producer before he started doing this. Great when she received the attention of Nan's love that was abandoned. She showed extraordinary vitality for the movie of that time. <br /> The only problem I have with my life. This movie is a great ending. These things are beautiful in their own, beautifully designed and produced wonderfully. But they don't seem to fit the story The only link that they have to the main story is Cagney, having to put 3 samples in 3 days to receive the contract and that's what he does. I have a hard time believing that this is what girls have practiced throughout these movies and scenes, able to get into the cinema in this way. "Sitting on the backyard" is more appropriate than the story. <br /> <br /> Production at the end seems to be dragging this terrifying story and that is not a good thing. I was tired after seeing the first musical sequence. Then I realized that there were two more people. These sequences received a lot of laughter from the audience as well. <br /> <br /> All of the great movies that had a bad ending. <br /> <br /> 9/10
