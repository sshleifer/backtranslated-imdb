The Last Hunt is one of the few western countries that has managed to hunt buffalo, both as a sport and business and is a way to win the Indian War. Before the white man walked to the other side of the Mississippi River, the plains had a large American bison as well as some of our largest cities. In the last period of time, the end of the buffalo was exhausted in the 20th century due to the efforts of conservators to see the revival in the population of the species. But not as difficult as it was once. Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger joined in the second film together. And this one is better than all the brothers. Here, Stewart Granger is a good guy, a tired buffalo hunter who has to go back to work that he hates due to financial considerations. <br /> <br /> The partner he chose to join is Robert Taylor. For a moment, I wonder if there is a brutal spirit that is more disgusting than Charlie Gilzen, as Taylor plays. In the Devil's Gate, he is an American Indian, fighting against racism caused by racism by Louis Calhern in The Last Hunt. He is a nation here. He killed both buffalo and Indians for true happiness. He killed a family in India when they stole his lure and took a widow's prisoner. Like some conquerors, he expects happiness from Debra Paget's sexual favors. In fact, he's crazy when Paget doesn't see that way. <br /> <br /> No matter what they claim To Russham, how often is the half-sibling? I never believed that he was an Indian. It is the only weakness I found in The Last Hunt. <br /> <br /> However, Lloyd Nolan, the new gray-skinned skinner, Taylor and Granger, brought together a great deal. Nolan stole every scene he was with the actors. <br /> <br /> For those who like their western needs to see one side of Robert Taylor never see on the screen and those who don't like it. Courageous, cheap, The Last Hunt is an ideal hunt.
