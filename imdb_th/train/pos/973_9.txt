Wow! Very fun! It may be a little bit of a story for a typical American child, and actually it is a lengthy story that will call this kid's movie that this movie reminds me of Time Bandits - Terry Gilliam. While the overall narrative is quite straightforward, Miike still hurls the surreal moments and Bunuel-esquire is a lot. The first series of fiercest acts from one scene to another is the normal family life of the main child / hero, with the spirit world and more evil than that happened. And while the ending has a slightly ambiguous nature, which is typical of the Miike class of meaning and metaphor, especially the anti-war / anti-revenge of human folly With the madness and fun in the imagination of other great Miike movies, instead of being tortured and bleeding, he gives us monsters and yokai from Japanese folk legends created from CG and puppets in the adventure. Various hazards. F'n rad and one of the best Miike!
