This item is worth watching. It has the best talent I've seen for a long time. The evidence of the item is new and fresh. (I guess ABC executives don't use it as well because it's not another reality show.) However, this show is believed to have satisfying characters and great stories. I may not be in the age group that they expect to like acting because I am in my forties. But many of my friends love it (late 30s-mid 40) and are dying for quality items. I don't think this program will give enough time to attract viewers. I believe that giving time to this program will be very good. ABC once again does not give real potential performances as real opportunities. There are many performances that give the opportunity after the opportunity and not nearly worth it! They want quality to show the real opportunity and time to click and really get the audience. I really love the character and look forward to watching each episode. I've watched various episodes of ABC video and the program is getting better even though I think they owe us another episode (number 13?). We want to see what we can do! Bombard ABC with email and letters and see if it's possible to save this item from extinction. It certainly works with Jerico. Some things are just a worthwhile recording and this show is one of them. Sign an online petition with ABC AT: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
