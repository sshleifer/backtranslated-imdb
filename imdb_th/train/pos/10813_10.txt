I opened this to see the incredible Ethel Waters, which I am now reading an autobiography. I will admit that my jaw fell down when the pork chops and melon reference began to roll in. But people can't watch this movie as a stereotypical or racist work It is a short film made by blacks quite a lot for blacks. During the time when the entertainment industry is separated and the patterns of people involved are funny about their time, the old trend is too much for jokes. We see that modern black movies do the same thing. But with the new trend (pattern) "ho" and "hood" and so I think if you look back in eighty years you will find that today's movies will look like racism What the audience should appreciate about the film is the ability of Waters and Sammy Davis Jr., a pint, his contemporary, Shirley Temple, and seems to be an adult-like appearance. Everyone involved in this movie has lots of fun. Why not enjoy what it is instead of what you think it should be?
