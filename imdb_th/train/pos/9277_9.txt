"The movie theater is dead. Live the cinema for a long time!" Peter Greenaway, one of the most creative and effective contemporary directors at the Anonimul Romanian film festival last year, which reached the third generation and happened In the Danube Delta This year, the director award goes to the "Offside" of Jafar Panahi. I saw it this evening in Bucharest at the back of the festival. Movie theater died But still very lively, Panahi's movie tells in an interesting manner how the Iranian society looks. Digital filming "Offside" is a story inspired by real-life events that occurred with Panahi's daughter: problems and risks arise when deciding to participate in a football match. This is forbidden in Iran as we have been informed. The thing that Panahi can do is show with only a few methods. But there may be a lot of work, intelligence and humor about the cultural patterns in society that make women at different levels. The absurdity of the law became a joke. This film ended happily after all because the Iranian team went to the World Cup. What I admire the most is the concept behind this film. I am interested in watching Panahi's other films that have been banned in Iran as well. I guess he can think of as an activity director.
