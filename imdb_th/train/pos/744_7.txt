"Foxes" is a movie that I remember as a teenager in the late 1970s, while I was Jodie Foster. It involves disappointments, temptations, relationships and rebellions of youth. Great soundtrack with inspirational rock songs like "More than feeling" by Boston and sad numbers like "On the Radio" by Donna Summer. Songs of my late teens. Yes, I will always remember, even if it's not big.
