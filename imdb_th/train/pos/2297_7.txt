There is something about the movie "Hammer". All that I see brings me into a new fantasy world. In the movie world "Hammer" everything can happen. "Guardian of the Abyss" is one of those types of movies. It's an adventure deep into occultism and hypnosis to bring the difference of horror fantasy. In conclusion, it's a memorable movie 7.5 / 10
