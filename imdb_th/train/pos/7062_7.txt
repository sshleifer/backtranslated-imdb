Deanna Durbin, Nan Gray and Barbara Read is "Three Smart Girls" in this international film in 1936 which introduces Deanna Durbin to movie viewers. It is also the star of Ray Millland, Miss Shaarier, Charles Winninger, John King, Bini Barnes and Alice Brady. It was a lovely story about three young women who now live in Switzerland with their divorced mother who heard their father (Winninger) getting married again, not seeing him in 10 years. And knowing that their mother still loves him, they board the ship to America with the help of housewives / escorts, determined to stop the wedding With the realization that the intent called "precious" (Barnes) was not anything other than a gold digger who helped and supported by her mother (Brady), they managed to get her introduced to the rich. This is the account of their father (the king). The man he chose was drunk full time (Auer), but the girl mistakenly believed that he had true wealth (Milland). It's a boring story. <br /> <br / > This is a delightful movie, not too funny or sweet, with good performances, especially by Auer, Milland, Barnes and Brady, a beautiful woman and working well. Of course, the emphasis is on Durbin, a natural actor and a beautifully trained singer. In fact, her voice as a child is more than an adult - she has no problem with high notes as she did later because she put too much weight in the middle of the voice. She sang the delightful "Il Bacio" in the station. Police <br /> <br /> One of the most delicious things about this movie is to see the father, played by Charles Winninger. Do not want the children around until he sees them. And get to know them Barnes as a gold digger is not a child. But the girl's mother looked up there, so the inference could be an old man looking for his youth with a younger and more charming woman In fact, he found that the youth he had followed his daughter <br /> <br /> Global made Durbin a bigger star here - she had the final shot in the Ray Millland movie. At this point, still paying fees and it may be surprising that movie fans will show that he is still young and attractive. <br /> <br /> Very entertaining and of course this leads to the next and bigger sectors.
