I really like "Morrison". This movie is a budget movie, which may not be interesting for some people. But I have no problem I admire it more because considering that it is a way to entertain more than drifting at a turbulent Hollywood every year. Unfortunately, this is not a drama. I don't know about others. But I'm going to watch it in the cinema `Doctor Mordrid 'Is a very fun science fiction movie that everyone can enjoy, especially if they enter sci-fi like me I don't see why this is a rating movie. There is only one word, and there is no horrible death scene and no blood. The timeless competition between Anton and Kabal wizards (Anton wants to use his power to help the human race while Kabal wants to oppress them). Essentially, this movie is fun to follow. There is one unintended funny thing in this movie: seeing Jeffrey Combs keeping the face straight while wearing a blue robe and a silly outfit. That makes me laugh every time I see But I'm talking about ... However, the performance is excellent. Main character (Anton and Samantha, his female friend) are very fond. Anton is sympathetic and hospitable and Samantha is friendly. In addition, the settings are excellent. The floating island in another dimension is excellent. Although we only saw twice It would be nice to see other scenes happening here. The main settings are very neat; Anton's apartment is very spacious and he has great equipment, especially the monitoring system that he uses to track events happening around the world. He also has a pet crows that he kept in his apartment named Edgar. Overall, this is a great movie. It's fun to watch and the main actors give a lot of sense to their role. If you can find anywhere with rent 'Doctor Mordrid', you should rent (or in my case, buy it for sure money) <br /> <br /> My score: 8 stars out of ten. . <br /> <br />
