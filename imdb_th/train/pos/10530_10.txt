This movie is a delightful story ... <br /> <br /> Come with the award-winning RACHEL PORTMAN songwriter, the lush mood and the dream music. Pure happiness that deserves more than once a year Great like Harriett Smith. <br /> <br /> The characters who stole MISS BATES !!! She looks fascinating. Everyone finds herself on the edge of the seat that hangs with her every word and laughs madly with her. One of the most lovable characters I've ever encountered in that era. From one opening scene, when she thanked Mr. Woodhouse for sending "cute pork in this quarter ... PORK, MOTHER !!!" she shouted at her mother who had a clearly impaired hearing. Bates (played by Emma Thompson's mother Phyllida Law, Emma Thompson) who looks hopeless and lost. <br /> <br /> The funny way Emma will avoid. It was one of the true industrial scenes at a picnic when Emma cursed Miss Bates, who brought her to the brutal dug to her heart. Then we saw the poor Miss Bates and almost tears and those who were crushed and unable to help. But felt that her heart had been torn in her name It's a classic scene that will be obscured and played over and over again ... <br /> <br /> The ending is there with "Sense & Sensibility" and gives one of the greatest lessons about marriage. One of the best friends ... <br /> <br /> I hope this movie will satisfy you as much as I have. <br /> <br /> I love it!
