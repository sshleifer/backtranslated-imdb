This is one of my favorite kung fu movies and is regarded as one of the most famous Shaw Brothers in the late 1970s. The story is interesting and devious. Each character has its own character - Toads, snakes, lizards, etc. The action is limited compared to other Chang Cheh / Venoms movies, but interesting things in different kung fu styles on. Displayed from various characters I recommend this movie to people who think Shaw Brothers, especially Changchun's movies, too. Most of the movies tend to focus on 10 tigers and Shaolin and Manchu conflicts. This film is a breath of fresh air when compared.
