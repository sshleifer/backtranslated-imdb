This film is excellent. Finally, a well-written character, you can love for all their good and bad. Pierce Brosnan is a fanatic in his own role. I think it's the best thing he has ever done. He performs other functions that demonstrate the full ability of this work. But in the end this role gave him room availability I almost died when he crossed the hotel lobby in his underwear and boots. And Greg Kinner and Hope Davis are also desirable couples as well as aspiring actors as well. Kinnir was a very funny person until he was finally satisfied. You give good actors work well and they give us more.
