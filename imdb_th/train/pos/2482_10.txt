The actors played very well, especially Kenneth Branagh. It was good that Robin Williams received Osiric's comedy. Otherwise, it might be strange to see him in this drama. It's really wonderful that Kenneth decided to use the full text. This is not often happening ... Thank you for seeing the whole picture, not the appointed director - thank God that the film is in class format Classic Not to surreal fans of surrealism! Although "Tytus Andronicus" is impressive But still Hamlet is a different story, at least it's my view.
