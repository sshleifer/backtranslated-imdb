This movie is my favorite. The film tells two "characters" in New York, Steve Brodie (Rae) and "Chuck" Connor (Beer), both of which try to be "the main people" in At the end of the nineteenth century, <br /> <br /> Brodie (1863-1901) and Connors (1852-1913) were real people, although this is a story that is heavily told about their comedy. (According to the play) The Legend of Brodie (Did he do it - still Was the cause of the argument!) Jumped from the Brooklyn Bridge (1886), which he famously appeared here at the same time as the Spanish-American War (1898). The great love for that moment was beautifully created here, and it included the ragtime numbers that were fierce from singers Saloon Trixie Odbray (Pert Kelton, the youngest). The raft is his most boring as Brodie and Beery show again that Strong, big and sometimes impressive that Connors Frey Fay is the love that both children are dreaming. <br /> <br /> Full of life and energy, "The Bowery" moves fast. (Unlike "talkies"), it's not a simple movie to search, but it's worth looking at.
