This is one of the best Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers movies, or at least one of my favorites. Most A-R movies have excellent dancing. But romantic love story But not as clear as other movies. <br /> <br /> This film is not only a great dance. But there are also cute characters and many good songs The song is the main theme here and the good thing is to add a single tap by Rogers. She is not only a great dancer. But still a cute woman and another person with a wonderful shape. She dances with Fred for sure and they are always a fun partner to watch on the dance floor. <br /> <br /> Growing up in 1950, see "Ozzie & Harriet" on television. It's true. The first kick I saw this thing to see Harriet Hilliard, the younger, no surprise that Ozzie fell because of this beauty. Although she had a short hairstyle in the early 30s, I immediately recognized her voice. In addition, the film also has a quick appearance by Betty Grable and Lucille Ball, but I have to admit that I haven't released the ball. I can't find her. But I know she is here. <br /> <br /> Astaire except the nasty chewing gum in the first three parts of this movie. It's fun to watch and Randolph Scott - even though it's better than the westerns - is <br /> <br /> This is a good movie and feels good if you want to enjoy the great talents of Astaire and Rogers.
