Strange but with mood swings in the middle-aged old man (William H. Macy's) who decided to leave the family business (Murder for rent) run by his quietly demanding father (Donald Sutherland)) and flirting with other patients (Neve Campbell) <br /> <br /> Talk about the major dilemma, but "Panic" is the leading thriller that looks like "American Beauty". Meet "The Professional" Macy and Sutherland. Is outstanding here For the first time for writer / director Henry Bromell for the first time, I was surprised that the film had no chance to be in the theater for more than two weeks.
