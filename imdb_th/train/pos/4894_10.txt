I grew up in a time when music in this movie was popular. It's a great time for music and dancing! My only complaint is that I'm too young to go to the USO and the nightclub thinks that I look like I live in the past. (I have wonderful memories) So what's wrong with that? World War 2 is a bad time, except where music is a concern. The death of Glenn Miller is sad for us. This movie will be my favorite Clio Laine. Excellent. What sounds! I don't know how I will miss this movie. My main reason for this opinion is to remind the new generation to be an alternative to the Rap and New Age songs which are offensive to me. Please watch this movie and give a chance!
