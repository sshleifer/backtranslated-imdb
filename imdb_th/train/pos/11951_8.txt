Something happened to Sondra Pransky when she entered the box of a magician on the London stage. Sondra didn't know that the soul of a journalist who had just died, Joe Strombel appeared to ask her to check the person who was told. He said that his journey to another dimension was an infamous tarot killer who committed crimes in London. The only problem is the man accused of being a noble person. <br /> <br /> When Sondra recounts her experience to the great Splendini, known as Sid the Waterman, the magician. Was shocked but decided to follow both to be PIs. Think of invitations to the club at Peter Lyman to swim. Sondra, who pretended she was drowning, caught the attention of this large group who wanted to see her more. <br /> <br / > No need to pool Both will go into funny situations, and all kinds of mystery. Was revealed at the end of the movie A little real Tarot assassin thinks he can fool Sondra, who is steadfast, which proves himself to be more proficient than he gives her credit. <br /> <br /> The result is a complete summer movie. With a lot of laughter that is just One thing to leave the heat during the perfect time in the cool theater. Woody Allen has done better, and even though this sunny comedy movie will prove to him the past failures in "Scoop", Mr. Allen brought himself out of the romantic actors. Who is the leader of his beautiful woman His trade mark indicates that this funny guy will never get rid of because it seems to be his trademark. The film has one funny liners that will go to the head of the audience who may not be interested. <br /> <br /> Scarlett Johansson, the beautiful star of "Scoop", seems to be the perfect foil for Woody Allen. She plays the role while Mr. Allen makes a shtick which is the perfect combination. Both were excellent in parody throughout the story. Ms. Johansson is an amazing beauty in her red swimwear, even though they dress her up to look dizzy in most of the costumes she wears. On the screen, Hugh Jackman is seen as Peter Lyman, a complex person about the city with the right bloodline. He created a good image in this movie while the men were following Mr Johansson. Ian McShane plays the deadly Fleet Street reporter on the way to eternity. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is a light movie for Hot and humid summer. Thank you Woody Allen.
