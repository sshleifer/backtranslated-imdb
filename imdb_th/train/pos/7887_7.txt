If you are a big fan of Freddy, you may not like it. It seems to be a spoof of the nightmare series. Not much to see here. The only reason to make it happen is the story of Freddy. <br /> <br /> One of the great things in the movie Nightmare is the scene of death. But the scene of death is so bad for this. The visual effects are excellent and the performance is ok. But the latter matter is excellent Essentially, Freddie's story is in this circle. <br /> <br /> I've read bad reviews for this. But I really enjoyed it. Nightmare at Elm Street. (8/10) <br /> <br /> <br /> The last night of the nightmare (7/10) <br /> <br /> 3 nightmares on Elm Street 4: Master of Dreams (7/10 <br /> <br /> 4 Nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors (7/10) <br /> <br /> 5 Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child (6/10) <br / > <br /> 6 Nightmares on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge (3/10) <br /> <br /> I recommend if you like the series. This is Freddy fully explained. But that's all there is Next on my list, Wes Cravens New Nightmare <br /> <br /> (7/10)
