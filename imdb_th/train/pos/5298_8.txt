John Waters truly gave us a fun movie. This is not surprising without the shocking Waters-esque moments, but more than those of his old religion, like "Pink Flamingoes". The audience thinks of the same humor that can be seen in "Polyester" Overall, it's a funny movie that is very fun in a great time!
