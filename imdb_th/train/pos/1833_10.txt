The basic story here is Aditiya (Kumar), the son of a millionaire named Ishwar (Bachan) who owns the toy industry in the eyes of Ishwar Aditya. His son Aditya cannot do anything wrong. Aditya's mother (Shefali Shah) warns Ishwar His son went to the responsible path before it was too late for Ishwar to be a lung cancer patient and had only 9 months of life. When his son fled and married Mitali (Chopra), Ishwar forgave Aditya but When a happy couple, Aditya and Mitali, come back from the honeymoon, Mitali is pregnant and forces Ishwar to kick Aditya out of the house to give him more responsibility. Aditya doesn't know that his father has lung cancer and he Didn't even know that His father kicked him out of the tube to make him more responsible. Ishwar couldn't bring himself into the high school that he was dying with his hungry wife and stomach. It was a race against time, so Aditya did everything he could to prove himself to his father and the peak came when Aditya had a big break in the film industry and his father told him he was dying. > <br >> This movie is great. This is a breakthrough in Indian cinema that is necessary for the Bollywood industry. Shah's governance is almost impeccable. But which movie does not have a flaw? The best part if this movie is the relationship between a son and a deceased father. The song was placed at the right time. The only good scene that this movie failed was that the jokes between Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav. The jokes were too long and after that they were annoying. But overall this is Great movie. I recommend to everyone who reads this review to watch without regard to other reviews. 9/10
