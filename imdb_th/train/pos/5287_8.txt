This is one of the few cartoons that contain Bugs Bunny and Marvin the Martian and has a space dog named K-9. Now, Looney Tunes is very funny. It has a fairly good cartoon animation. (Marvin's animation is very good) and the storyline is well done. The end is rather strange, so be prepared to be a little boring. <br /> <br /> Marvin the Martian is now sent to the world to capture life on Earth and bring it back to Mars. With his trusty K-9 dog, Marvin departs and soon finds traces of other rabbits that are not Buck Bunny! He greeted them with the idea that they were deceitful or actors in the series. He knew that they were preparing to take this rabbit to Mars. <br /> <br /> I recommend now to everyone who likes Bugs Bunny, Marvin the Martian and Looney Tunes as far as they start and In the middle of concern, you are likely to be like this. Enjoy "Hasty Hare"! :-)
