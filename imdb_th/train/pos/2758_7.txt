This film is about an unlikely friendship between a businessman and a man with Down Syndrome. <br /> <br /> The character development in this film is fantastic. We believe that Harry was a businessman who neglects his family, and Georges is pure desire, love and care from society, "normal", the show is superb and won Best Actor at Cannes deserved. < br /> <br /> The fantasy scenes in the movie emphasize the fact that Georges is suffering for his abandoned family. The songs that are played repeatedly will complement this message. This film shows that people with mental disabilities have good habits. We treat them with discrimination and abandon the truth that is highlighted by the scene in which Georges presents gifts to waiters in the kitchen.) If we understand and share the world of these people, both we and the mentally handicapped people will have Very happy. <br /> <br /> I was drawn into the movie and the emotional experience of the characters. It is a movie that can feel good spirits.
