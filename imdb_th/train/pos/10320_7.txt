*** Possible spoiler *** <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie with my 11 year old son and was glad to see that he laughed at the right place and was excited about. The action scene Ron Ely is correct, like Doc. Cool, calm, almost controlled at all times. (And blinking from time to time) Another thing that can be requested? I never read Doc Savage, so I don't know if it's honest with the source or not. But I like the sound and the dullness. Many people compare this movie to the Raiders of the Lost Ark, which I think is unfair. The budget difference is surprising (Raiders must have at least 10 times the budget). Doc Savage doesn't have a lot of work in the area that the Raiders have at least special effects. But with the people, the story is fun and humor is correct. Sousa's songs are catchy (like that song - every time I watch a movie, I have to make this story a joke for many days). Access to this movie is to relax and enjoy. Highlights include an exciting opening sequence in which the five and Doc chase an Indian sniper throughout the roof of New York and a very funny battle sequence between Doc and Captain Seas. !) Overall, it's a great movie to watch on a rainy day. I gave 7 in 10 <br /> <br /> Doc Savage, Doc Savage ... Thank God that he came here!
