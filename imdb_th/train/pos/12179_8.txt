Jason Lee plays Paul, a friend in Seattle who is married to Karen (Selma Blair) fiance and settles the life that Nobody protested the middle class First of all, we met Paul at his bachelor party, where he did not wish to participate in his usual bachelor party party activities. (A few surprising ones) encouraging in the event that he is a little naughty And conflict Of course, the next thing Paul knew was that the next morning, the night before, he slept on a bed with a naked hula dancer and his mother-in-law calling to inform him that the Karen were traveling. Oh and the hula dancer is the cousin of Karen Becky (Julia Stiles). <br /> <br /> From the problems that may occur with this small acorn, the great oak of misfortune arises. What he did while still maintaining the appearance of being a good, honest and focused family that is extremely excited about his upcoming marriage His efforts to ensure that the Karen still do not know of any possible offense in his part, forcing Paul to come close and close to Becky, who loves fun, forcing him to ask, He wants a life that seems to be mapped.
