This is the best classic movie of Dicken's classic story. I saw it over and over again in the VHS and just received a DVD version that was formatted for the TV. (Not a wide screen) What I think is interesting about this teleplay is the British actor, who is now known because there are many people appearing in other movies / programs in North America since 1984. What surprised me most Is Edward Woodward, "the Equalizer" as a Christmas ghost.
