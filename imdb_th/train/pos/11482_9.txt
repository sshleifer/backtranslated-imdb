This film was filmed by actors on the camera. In some ways, ridicule in another way, the diary video from the killer is full of "Columbine" style attacks. While this movie doesn't answer all the big questions, it gives an understanding of how easy it is to get away. In the movie, you will show that the actors are shortened incorrectly. The gun makes an atomic bomb and comes with an action plan for "Zero Day". The actor (if you call them) is great. They borrow from life. Of yourself clearly But I did not find that they were really acting Using CCTV and 911 service providers at the end are geniuses. But I'm not sure if we want the final scene or not. Overall, it's a very good movie on a very difficult topic.
