I have watched this movie many times and I will never be bored. It is classic in every sense of the word. This movie is funny and can be touched at the same time. For people who are not fans of "subtitles" or foreign movies in general, open mind. This is a great movie for "Beginners" because of the fun story Don't understand me wrong. It's 100% Japanese (and that's what makes it available). But everyone will get something from it. (Although it is just a great laugh for one of the main characters, named Mr. Aoki, one of the most fun characters I've ever seen!) <br /> <br /> I can't think of this movie Without smiling !! I love it ... and I think most people too.
