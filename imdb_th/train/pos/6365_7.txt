The film adaptation will entertain people who have never seen an obscure anime movie. I enjoy it mostly, especially after the opening time is quite flat in the museum (although the pre-title sequence is very fun and has some of the better animations) James Garner as commander and Leo Nardimo, as King, gave an impressive performance.
