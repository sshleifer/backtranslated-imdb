I have to say that this movie is a show that shows how Melissa Joan Hart is very talented. We are now accustomed to seeing her in the sitcom, and I hope that the TV station will show this movie again soon because it will show fans Sabrina that MJH is showing in the drama when we watch her at Sabrina is now 5 years old and so the audience can taste her unused abilities as an advantage. Melissa shows her role in this story that wants her parents to "do it" so that she can be with the people you love. One thing that every Sabrina audience will notice is that Melissa works with David Lascher on this subject before he plays Josh in Sabrina, so it will look neat whenever it airs again. Hopefully MJH will receive. Good roles in movies or even in TV movies, such as Kellie Martin, which is always shown on TV movies. A lot of unused abilities are waiting when Melissa Joann Hart arrives. You always shine Melissa !!!
