Great movie, one of the best horror films of the 70s. She is a realistic atmosphere and atmosphere. As usual, it was inevitable that the usual negative comments I noticed that most horror movies at certain times are not accessible enough. Obviously, most horror movies are old and must be denigrati. It is like a mental mechanism that stimulates the minds of music critics. <br /> <br /> Before you read what you know Is the final decision In this movie is a good gift because 10 really well done. Rains read quite well and the movie is a way that reminds me of many Kubrick movies. He was really impressed. The movie is really great. I think it is the poetry of the year 70
