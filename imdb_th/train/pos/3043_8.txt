This movie will tell you why Amitabh Bacchan is a man's industry. This film will tell you why Indian movie viewers are intelligent shoppers. <br /> <br /> Amitabh is at the peak of his Bollywood dominance when Prakash Mehra, godfather of He decided to use his image again. Prakash has a habit of choosing themes and creating stories from it, increasing the size of freedom of Bollywood's sentiments and popularity. Being a heretic and Namak Halal about the loyalty of the boss. <br /> <br /> But the theme is limited to moving the screenplay through the music, dance and drama for three hours. What consists of this film is a parody of Haryanavi who went to Mumbai and became a hero in the rules. Amitabh's voice and diction skills that saw this movie received large sums of money. Thank you. Haryanvi emphasized his flawless voice. For me, this is the most important thing in the movie. All the rest is to write a Bollywood screen. <br /> <br /> Amitabh, now having a general comedy scene in each of his films, thanks to Manmohan Desai. Leaping shoes at a party over the consideration of Vijay Merchant and Vijay Hazare. The challenge of mosquitoes in the boardroom and the usual drunken scenes that now become the standard fare Amitabh. Kapoor adds an extra mile to the movie with a finicky, finicky character. (Please remember that he asked Ranjeet to go to "Shaaadaaaap" after the poisoned cake event "). He is an important role of Mr while Amitabh is his faithful servant. Acting alongside his performance in other films. It is one character that can develop more to create serious movies. But this is a jump, remember, and as long as it remains In this way, people come to see Amitabh wearing a new hat and returning home happily. In the end, always predictable and good people accept the gal and the bad ones. Focus again and everything ends well. <br /> <br /> So w hat that makes this movie a classic movie near? Amitabh Bacchan while Haryanvi Prakash Mehra also created another icon in the title of the story. Chuck stories, characters and stories My score for Amitabh alone
