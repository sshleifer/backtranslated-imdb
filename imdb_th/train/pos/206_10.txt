I am 14 years old, so you might think I have never heard of George Burns or Walter Matthau or anyone who likes this thing. You are wrong. I heard that George Burns was in this film and he won the Academy Award for this. I am a fan of George Burns since the age of ten. I watched movies. Oh God, just and liked it. This is great. George Burns did very well. Walter Matthau too (this is the first time I've ever seen him perform) and even though they have only a minor role, Phyllis Diller and Steve Alta Allen works well. The specials they filmed would be great if it really did. Let me say this, if you are a fan of George Burns or Walter Matthew, you should watch this movie right away!
