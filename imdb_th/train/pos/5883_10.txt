I watch and amaze and enjoy the sound and physical performance. The role that each character plays with excellence It makes me understand the different perceptions of people who believe in humanity. Anyone who believes in peace and gentle behavior I was detained with disbelief by the sacrifice and human dignity. The power without grace is crazy and without feeling. The need for energy by human costs is unbelievable. This movie makes me afraid of people who are no longer in this world. And it is sad that I miss them I like this movie for conversation and express everything. May this movie be blessed
