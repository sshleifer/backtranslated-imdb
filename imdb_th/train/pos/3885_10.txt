I was introduced to "Eddie" for the first time by friends from "across the pool" who know that I like intelligent humor. I like comedians who can stimulate their thoughts while entertaining, such as George Carlin and Dennis Miller in 'Dress to Kill'. Eddie gives the same social observation humor that motivates your thoughts on the whole story while making the side. Your side is split at the same time. There are various models in standby. As for how to decide on Anglert's stage name, you will fall in love. <br /> <br /> Thank you Andrew and Catherine! ... and "Do you have a flag?"
