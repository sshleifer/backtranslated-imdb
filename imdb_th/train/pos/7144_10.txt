I used to watch the movie Holes and said that it must be the best movie of the year. It brings children out in everyone. I mean, who will come up with the idea of ​​having problems, children digging holes as their punishment? Who is Louis Sasha? Although the movie is different from the book But it is still very good. For example, Caveman / Stanley should be the largest in that Weight wise and tall, clever, but ZigZag / Ricky is higher and the armpits / diodes are bigger More rather persuasive and long-lasting I want to see the present more than before. But that's just my opinion I especially like the work of children, such as Squid / Alan, played by Jake M.Smith, should be a temperament and stubborn child. Jake M.Smith shows just that and does a great job as well. Show almost all in the hole So I would say if you didn't see the hole. But you should definitely see it when it comes out again, or you will miss out the fun.
