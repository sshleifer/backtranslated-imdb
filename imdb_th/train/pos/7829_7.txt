The final scene of the wonderful battle and the beautiful scene helped make the film slower, fun. Sometimes it makes me check the clock even though there are moments that are memorable enough to make the movie stand out in my mind after watching. The ending should surprise even those who are familiar with the story of Nibelungen.
