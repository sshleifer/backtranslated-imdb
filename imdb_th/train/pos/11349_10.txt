This movie may have suspicious bloodlines because it was made for TV. But it is one of the best movies I've seen Movies and actors have won many awards. It has charm and it will absorb you completely. The story of the hunt for the murderer in the Russian iron curtain by those who are willing to risk their lives to try to save the victims in the future will be an interesting story if it is fiction I highly recommend
