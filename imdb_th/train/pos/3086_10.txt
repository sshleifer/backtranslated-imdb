Here, Italy (I wrote from Venice), why canceling ABC should be given the opportunity to create an audience. The actors (w / Hope Davis, Campbell Scott, Erika Christensen, Zoe Saldana, Jay Hernandez and Bridget Moynahan) are one of the good things. The most I've seen recently We need more acting like this, which makes the audience feel that they are smart people who are not drones without consciousness. I hope ABC will consider the decisions of new stations or other stations to pick up.
