I think this movie is very good. Heath Heather is very trustworthy and his Irish accent is impeccable. Orlando Bloom and Naomi Watts are good and reliable as well. The truth is how it really happened. I don't know. But it shows why sometimes people become what they do. Maybe those who have power may always be damaged and I think it's more than 30,000. Signed a petition for Ned Kelly that will not be hanged, so there may be more truth in this film than the first one. It reminds me of the Cold Mountain, another good historical movie. Overall, I would like to recommend this movie and I am quite bewildered why it doesn't get better in the cinema.
