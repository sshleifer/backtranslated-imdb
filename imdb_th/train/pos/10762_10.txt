I am one of many people who expect to receive praise. The Yankee-doodle dandy depicts the date (as mentioned in the famous) should live in disgrace rather than being famous. How am I wrong They were there in the middle and the pictures that they returned were both amazing and aching. And yet, it happened on a trip to the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. <br /> <br /> Two French filmmakers are collecting a documentary about life as a New York firefighter. Only from the point of view of the new generation. Up through the ranks At first we saw this picture very much to remind us that there was no idea of ​​creating a film about terrorism. This was intended to be a movie about a normal person who was rescued with faithful life and the beauty of this film, that it never lost this advantage. <br /> <br /> While checking the gas line Wondering (I think that the memory is a little fog). We can hear the plane floating over the head. The camera paned up to reveal a commercial torpedo jets into one of the towers. What should the photographer think at this time? When realizing the importance of the image that the camera still exists and may make the same thing, FDNY allows the camera to track them into the building. <br /> <br /> The following is a true view from the front. We see FDNY's commitment to their reactions. (Stunned after hearing the first person who fell to death) and the collapse of one of the buildings from the inside while the second camera recorded the incident from outside. <br /> <br /> If not for an amazing event Fear that they are covering the video alone will be the dream of a new generation of documentaries. Quite easily, images that should be kept at all times But what makes this movie truly different is the true humanity brought to the audience. We saw firefighters attacking without hesitation. People of different races helped to avoid the waves of ruins and even the concerns of each other. (They are brothers and sisters) because they cannot communicate in confusion. There are some things that Hollywood has never copied. (Although it tries) <br /> <br /> 9/11 is not a movie about politics. Or as a movie about religion, nationality or even jihad in that matter. 9/11 is a movie about people and the true indication of the best and worst that we have. 9/11 is just one of The most important movie I have ever seen and will be the only movie produced by this activity if it is up to me. You can't repeat this thing.
