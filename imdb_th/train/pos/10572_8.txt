I have a feeling that the musicals in the economic downturn of Warners Bros are becoming more relevant in the next few years. Yes, we are in a state of economic stagnation. (Or you are under a rock) and the time looks bleak But we often have movies as a way to avoid our problems. In the 30s, the movie was highly popular even during the economic downturn. "Footlight Parade (1933)" is one of the movies that the audience flocked to. While the musical directed by Lloyd Bacon did not capture social issues during the "Gold Digger in 1933 (1933)", still showing great talent. We have to wait until the end of the movie, Busby Berkely, the number three, spectacular. But boys, they should be worth waiting for me. Yes, the little Ruby Keeler is an awesome singer and actor, and her tapping is so good, but Busby's miracle of "By A Waterfall" emits her voice and what seems Of course, Busby's numbers can't really be shown on stage (they challenge the limits of gravity for one thing) and they are contrary to the realism of And "Footlight" also has James Cagney in one of his few musicals (actually this guy can't do anything). Cringe over sexpot Shanghai Lil (which is a very little ruby ​​in a Chinese girl's wig!). He starred with Joan Blondell, his cute and cute secretary. Can be seen in the favor of other women (until the last wheel, that is). Blondell is clearly the only woman that Cagney loves apart from his wife. And you can see mutual respect in every scene
