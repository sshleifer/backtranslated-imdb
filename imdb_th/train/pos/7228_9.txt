The undoubtedly highlight of this film is Peter O'Toole's performance, in a humorous and terrifying way. Who do it better than O'Toole? I do not think so A wonderful face that man has! <br /> <br /> The story is strange and quite annoying and has some emotional parts. However, I feel that this movie revolves around Peter OToole's performance and I'm sure I won't enjoy it even half if he isn't there.
