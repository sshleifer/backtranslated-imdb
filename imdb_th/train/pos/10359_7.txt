Meryl Streep is such a genius. At least as an actor I know that you enjoy doing many roles with accents. But she always emphasizes the accent Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was inspired. Mrs. Chamberlain, as shown here, is not a particular favorite or wise thing. But that makes Streep's work look more prominent I think she has a total of 10 or more of her Oscar nominations. About movies There are a few interesting things. I don't know much about Australia. But the essence of religious fanaticism among the public is important in this matter. I really missed this thing when I first watched the movie several years ago. But yesterday it was loud and clear And it seems that the Australian media is successful in seeking adversity and beyond being an American colleague Good movie Slightly different grade: B
