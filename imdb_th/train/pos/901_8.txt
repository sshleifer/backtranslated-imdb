Hmm ... Vivah is quite good, but Sooraj Barjatya's movies generally show different aspects of the Indian family, wedding ceremonies, etc. This movie is better but not very good. <br /> <br /> Great issues. The film is the direction of the music and performances of Shahid and Amrita (especially the last scene). The movie begins with the general factors of Indian movies --- a girl who doesn't like her stepmother. The story is a fairly normal movie. But it's good enough to make this movie a movie. <br /> <br /> The negative point is common in Bollywood movies. Overall, I would say that it is twice the need to watch a movie if you want to appreciate the typical Indian family and of course love!
