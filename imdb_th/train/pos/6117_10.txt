All I can say about Necromaniac / Schizophreniac 2 series is ... If you are a "PC" from a distance or without serious humor, you may not get it. As sick and disgusting as this film is, it is funny and not a "horror" movie. If you can appreciate someone pushing the boundaries of good tastes and political correctness to the limit As much as possible to the point of becoming too funny, you have to see this thing to believe. This film cannot be controlled at all. The major movie studios cannot touch this thing with a 10-foot pole (with a condom at the end). In my opinion, even the best and most art pieces come from. underground If you do not stick to the same old formula that people are familiar with seeing, they reject it. <br /> <br /> I've seen horrible movies, boring, boring, z-grade, indie movies that are Just wasting a perfectly good VHS tape or DVD-R. I also saw a pile of bombs coming from a big studio that cost millions of dollars. When the movie NO BUDGET, like these two movies from Ron Atkins / John Giancaspro, came out and exploded all other "shock" movies out of the water, you have to look at the second scene of all the indie movies. After seeing this, you will see how much indie filmmakers are free to work. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that even the other people who see this movie and "hate" agree with The fact that they laugh all the way I do not think that it is possible that anyone will be tired of watching both of these things. So if you don't take everything you see in the mainstream media too seriously and can laugh at the crazy minds and fierce puppets that have fought in the end, you have to see this. You may be able to see it for those who stand alone. The classic cult that is both Schizophreniac / Schizophreniac 2 is one of my collection favorites with over 1,000 DVDs.
