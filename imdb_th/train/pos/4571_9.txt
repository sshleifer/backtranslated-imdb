The most important thing about this movie is the great performances of Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor as Christy Brown, a Guinean artist and a fighter who even overcomes her physical condition. As a person who works with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their performances are surprisingly reliable. The enormous support Christie has created in his family, the low income working class, Dublin, encourages him to do things that are impossible and this picture shows this great support. . I recommend this movie to everyone, especially with classic movie lovers.
