In general, I like Charlie Chan's mysterious movie in 1930 and there are no exceptions. However, there are some things that do not look good for this movie. Efforts to change from a Moto movie in the brain centered around a building to a salad bar that was destroyed by a comedy show that relieved like a sore foot. The detective is clumsy and even the other characters seem to be involved in the comedy. PTSD may seem strange or an excuse for us today. But back then, the possibility of archaeological discoveries was not just a reality. But happens to be a normal matter
