This is one of the DVDs that I just bought in a six-book series called "Frenchfilm" to clear our French language before the planned holiday in beautiful Provence this year. Until now, as well as improving our French language, we have greatly increased appreciation for French movies. <br /> <br /> It's a breath of fresh air to the confined spaces. This is a good example for script writers. Movies, actors, directors and movie filmmakers to follow It's very exciting to see two characters that can identify themselves in the lead role, without them having to be the cover of their magazine. <br /> <br /> Other things I like about movies. This story is a slow character and a plot created that makes you guess how it will end. Is there really good in this selfish hooligan who continually treats his innocent benefactor with the type of insult that the former prisoner will show? The poor, deaf, heroine who has our sexual disabilities will prove herself to answer her dream questions and the circumstances in which fate is given to her or not? The audience was fascinated by these questions and the actors resolved the answer slowly and reliably because they faced an event that challenged and created feelings for each other. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie Like me you may want To see again I still have to find the psychological motivation of the director for the sub-plot in the role of the parole officer and the slight difference of camera work is worth looking at the second time. The story will be a little imaginative when our hero is given the opportunity to help the heroine who uses the wrong type and works too hard in the office. You have to have a broad mind to believe in reading your witty lips and some actions that occur. But if you go with an exciting ride with the best French movie trailer, you will come out more than satisfied. Four stars from five for me
