Created only ten years after the actual events and is located in the bunker under the Reichstag. Pabst's films are fully tempting. It is the death of sulfur that awaits the perpetrator in the First World War. Didn't see this thing for more than three decades But it's still strong in my visual and emotional memories It seems that these characters are waiting to be trapped in their caves. Talk a little between two generals: "Is God really there?" "If he does, we won't do that." This shame is not ready for the show or the purchase because it's interesting to watch and compare the film This with a documentary about Traudl Junge, "Im Toten Winkel" {aka "Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary") and "Downfall" with Bruno Ganz
