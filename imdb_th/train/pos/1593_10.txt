The performance is about two sisters together. Holly is a younger person with teenage problems. On the other hand, her sister Val has a job as a male friend. They try to support each other, which they sometimes make mistakes. But they do not give up and continue And the show is about friendship Importance in life I love this item a lot. It's funny and the actors are very good. I'm really sorry that the show is over. I still see the time for replay :) Amanda Bynes is very talented. Jenny Garth may be a funny new person. But she played really well She is one of the actresses that I like to watch. I like the relationship of Vince and Holly. They are very natural. Gary is a natural talent and makes you laugh every time he appears. With Tina Holly found a true friend and I like them a lot. The character Lauren is a funny person and she is a natural talent. I want to see you more This show will bring you in and make you laugh. I hope the list is not over yet.
