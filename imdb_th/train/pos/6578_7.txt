Ironically, for a long time without playing in a movie or video, ARMS and THE MAN continued to exist on the stage for many years since their debut in 1894 - in a small part because they were satirical. With nature Of courage and business of war Whenever the world is caught up in the conflict, ARMS and THE MAN seem to be rising in time and more relevant. <br /> <br /> This is the play that Oscar Strauss changed (leaving a good idea The best of Shaw) to success Chocolate soldiers (When Hollywood arrived * that * they left Shaw's last trace instead of paying him for rights - at that time he was the Oscar winner himself). Shaw's most often his thoughts and conversations, rather than being converted in ARMS and THE MAN. The plot also shines as well, and the boss manages to finish the happiness for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> Young Raina (Helena Bonham Carter) The officers and the richest men in her city were engaged to the skilled officers of the Bulgarian cavalry and everything looked good until the mercenary Pip Torrens) from the other side climbed. Up her drain, escape from the fighting that his army has been sent. As usual in the words that Shaw does not have for the first time, and social meetings will be on their heads in terms of simplicity - and not a simple reason. There is no "good man" or "bad person". Only those who have the best variety of their learning - just like a better life - and naturally with Shaw Wisdom, are exalted by all parties. <Br >> <br /> Version Film early next year (1932) (screenplay by Shaw) of the genre's most original and funny plays of Shaw and one of his first film to hit on this side of the Atlantic. Has been among the long gone Shaw did not sell the screen rights to his play - allowing them to use for a period of 5 years only, and it appears that with the rapidly evolving sound technology, the 1932 movie looked original only a few years later. Waw does not renew the license. Therefore, we have a huge amount of debt for the BBC in their 1987 broadcast version of the DVD box containing nine sparkling plays. (Quite a pity, PYGMALION, which many people regard as the best Shaw came out in this series for production with Lynn Redgrave and James Villiers) <br /> <br /> Even though it's like a DVD Less impressive performances than A MAN DESTINY ARMS and THE MAN create true treasures. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter continues after cutting her role in live television. To bring a large audience to this initial role They should not be disappointed for Carter to give a performance that is consistent with the innocent audiences expected from her. But under the direction of pedestrians rather James Zellan Jones (And despite the beautiful physical production and regularly observed on the BBC) the mischievous fire of the role (And her evil that was underestimated in the last act) was packed with just 80% of the total potential. <br /> <br /> Very similar to being able to talk about the real star. Of Pip Torrens as Bluntschli the "Switzer", it is an attractive show But did not show the humor in the first scene in which the young soldiers were able to awaken even though they were dangerous to life. <br /> <br /> These reservations, even though this The production of wonderful play transferred to a small screen with self-confidence. It deserves to be widely visible and ideal, showing a large screen that is lively with style and fun of the latest creation of Wilde's IDE IDE. HUSBAND * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Other surfaces * This production will make everyone's favorite Shaw good.
