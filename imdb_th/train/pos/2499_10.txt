This movie is amazing. It has the original concept. (Of the vampire movies matched with the Yakuza mob movie) It is a very funny and sad movie about friendship, love, immortality, death and happiness. In the part of Gackt Camui, Cho's role was sent to the top. Visiting and HYDE is a surprisingly good performance for his first film as a KK Vampire who tortured and humorous. I laughed and cried with a happy and lucky Toshi character growing up with Cho. I love every second of this movie, especially during times such as funny cigarette scenes, fighting scenes, and most important, happy ending.
