After reading the criticism and other irritating comments, I felt that I had to come to the film. <br /> <br /> Roeg's films are often not related and expect that this will be one of The one you like may not be satisfied. <br /> <br /> The thing that the movie is a picture that has no idea and doesn't believe in religion Other films that are liked in terms of religious news must be Tolkin's "ecstasy" <br /> <br /> I was surprised that everyone could say that the story was messy or supernatural. It's a simple film about Catholic faith, miracles and redemption - even if you don't guess until the end. It is the only movie I can imagine who will decide for himself. <br /> <br /> As a happy Catholic, I feel that this movie is about nothing. Of the most innocent love about the relationship between God and man But if you are not familiar with the type of theology that is based on the movie, then it will go over your head. <br /> <br /> As a movie that is contrary to the story - `Heaven. While `The Rapture 'is heavy with the importance of images and images in the movie` Cold Heaven' showing the quality of the movie No shots, no effects, no frustration, no effort to adjust the content to form. It is a photographic skill for people. But was weakened Do not have conversations or performances to perform in high class It is easy to spread out. It may seem strange, but the mystery is finally revealed. It looks vague But on one line, ambiguity disappears in the Catholic faith. <br /> <br /> In this story, `Cold Heaven 'has its heart in the same way that it drives movies such as' The Sting' or` The Sixth Sense. 'Or `Final Descent' or Polanski's 'pure ritual'. All of these are movies with sleeves. They may disappoint you. But they have a definite point - but the fun is at least part of being caught. <br /> <br /> Still, though it is It seems to be more than a shaggy dog ​​with a punch line. It's worth it to see if it's guiding the wrong direction. Try it out, especially if you are or have been a Catholic.
