The Ancient Mariner is a truly classic piece as the original poet used to be / that is the context / setting with the seaman himself. Good, clear and without excuse. The art that comes with poetry reading fits the time / moment of setting and the work itself perfectly holds the audience at times that are still there. But still moving by using a movement strategy, still excellent only overcome by Pre-MTV era makers and not very clear in the current work (MTV offers animated movements via television and video through frequent cuts that are not relevant from themes to themes without moving forward And there is no clear relationship with the theme or story) the tone, tone and power of Redgrave's reading With fear, conflict and pain In addition, the smooth movement of the video emphasizes rhythm and mono sounds from time to time. (In this case, positive emotions under the topic of the story itself) of the actions of the authors of ancient navigators, sad and scary stories This is a must have for classical poetry, sea stories, high stories that are almost real, and stories that leave a lasting impact on our world and culture. Who doesn't understand the meaning of "Albatross"? Or the concept of "Water everywhere. Not a drink." It is a truly good experience. Thank you Mr. DaSilva for making this a reality for us and will never forget.
