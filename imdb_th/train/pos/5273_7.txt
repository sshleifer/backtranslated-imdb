This was directed by Ruggero Deodato, a true icon for many horror fans after he directed the Cannibal Holocaust genocide. However, do not expect to see scandal in this film here because it proves to be believable. Unbelievably comparing and playing like Conan, which inspires new audiences. <br /> <br /> The explanation may expel fans A large part of the Sword & Sorcery genre that has been inspired by Conan all but before you talk about it, have to say that this movie is so much fun. <br /> <br /> Most of them play for Laughing and showing two big heroes and being highly appreciated in the form of David and Peter Paul, the Barbarian brothers, who both seem to have children with the characters. <br /> <br /> Richard Lynch B-Movie The favorite in this movie became the main villain in this movie, and it was good to see the role of Big George Eastman and Michael Berryman. <br /> <br /> Add to it. See and be lively The appropriate duration of the film. (Raw materials and ingredients that are welcomed in the category!) <br /> <br /> What can I say - this is a really fun and exhilarating game in the genre, and I highly recommend!
