Shooting into the car from the windshield. Someone is playing their latest song with others. Others don't respond according to the voice. I'm just wondering how it can happen. There are many scenes in this movie that I wonder why the camera arrived there. If the filming scene in which Warhols descends from the BJM group is true, that is seeking benefits that do not exchange for the highest value. Along the way to this movie, I still wonder what the image will be. When considering the face value, the good image of the genius (torture) that we all believe is their own.
