This movie has a fairly good story. But was sunk in many important places It's almost as if the director threw the movie together without spending a significant amount of time in the movie. Dennis Quaid worked quite well in his role ... but there was something missing from many important scenes. <br /> <br /> This 2.5 hour movie may be reduced to about 2 hours and may be a much better movie without feeling like it was thrown together. <br /> <br />
