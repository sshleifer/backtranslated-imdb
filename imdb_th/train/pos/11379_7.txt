Blood Castle (Scream of the Demon Lover, Altar of Blood, Ivanna - The best name But the exploitation of movies and the least exploitation) is a traditional Gothic romantic movie This means that it has a creepy large castle, a mysterious woman, an old man, a mystery, a hint of horror and a supernatural element and a contemporary love of that kind of word. It means that it is a very determined story and this movie will work best for horror fans who are big fans of talking. If you like movies like Robert Wise's The Haunting (1963), but you have a taste in the late 1960s to the early 1970s. Scary Spanish and Italian. You may love Blood Castle as well. <br /> <br /> Baron Janos Dalmar (Carlos Quiney) lives in a large castle on the outskirts of a traditional European village without details. The villagers feared him because the legend says that whenever he slept with a woman, she died after that - consensus was that he placed a fierce dog there. This is a great problem because the baron has a healthy appetite for women. At the beginning of the film, another woman appeared dead and destroyed. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Dr. Erna Schürer appeared in the center of the village to request to be taken to the castle of Dalmar's castle. She was a heretic who was hired by the baron as a chemical expert. Of course, no one wants to go near the castle. Eventually, Ivanna found a shady person. Upon arriving there, a strange woman living in Olga Castle (Cristiana Galloni) denied Ivanna and said she shouldn't have been there since she was a woman. Baron Dalmar breaks up whether she should stay or not. She stays but is unsure. Baron hired her to try to reverse the effects of the intense burning that Igor, the brother of the Baron, was suffering. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the brother of the Baron seems to have a rotten body. Tank of bizarre, black liquid And more than that, Ivanna is having a strange dream. What is the castle happening? Is Baron responsible for crime? Is he crazy? <br /> <br /> I need more blood than my castle. As I said, this movie has a lot of intentions to walk around. I can go in any way on that material. I'm not interested in The Haunting (yes, I'm in a very minority group), but I'm a big fan of European horror in the 1960s and 1970s. I'm Mario Bava. I still love Dario Argento's work from that time, but sometimes Blood Castle moves too slowly for me sometimes. There is a large piece that contains a number of scenes that are not very exciting to say, interspersed with Ivanna's scenes that walk slowly down the path of the castle. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of this movie is good. Director José Luis Merino managed more than the scenes and places that passed and they shot quite well by Emanuele Di Cola. However, Blood Castle felt that the budget was quite low and this was a movie produced by Roger Corman after all. (Which usually means low budget, but often surprisingly high quality "quickie"), so while hinting at the lushness of the colors of Bava and decorating the complex scenes, everything is smooth Easier Of course, it doesn't help the Retromedia print that I look like. The 30-year-old image that has been left in the sun for too long, seems "washed out" with reduced contrast. <br /> <br /> Still Sometimes Merino and Di Cola have created great images. For example, the scene of Ivanna walking in the dark hallway that was shot from the exaggerated corner and the place where there are important elements revealed through the shadow on the wall only. In addition, there are a few Bergmanesque shock shots, which the actors are elaborately blocked to show the complex relationship in addition to attracting the eye and pulling your eyes deep into the frame. <br /> <br /> Performances are quite good and women - especially Schürer - are very charming. Merino exploits this fact by combining the appropriate nudity. Schürer made many films that were soft, corny, like other movies with English names such as Sex Life in Woman's Prison (1974), Naked and Lustful (1974), Strip Nude for Your Killer (1975) and finding The erotic benefits of the Sexy Seducer (1977), but apart from the nude, there are also gentle scenes that point out rape and slavery, and of course the scene is mixed with sex and death. <br /> <br /> The main attraction here, though, may be possible. Romantic stories that burn very slowly, otherwise Horror elements, mysterious elements and unexpected twists near the end are bonuses. But in the end, the blood castle is a love story about a spouse who overcomes adversity and antagonism. (Often have physical or dangerous threats) together.
