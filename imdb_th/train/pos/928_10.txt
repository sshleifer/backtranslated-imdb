I watch the series as much as I can to watch TV. Unfortunately, starting work that made me work in the evening I managed to save some of it at least ... and of course buy the recently released DVD of the complete series. When watching a DVD, you can see that the animation looks more rude at first. But they rolled out a number of defects after the pilot finished The sound that fits the character and the writing is excellent. It's quite refreshing when seeing the animation back to the roots by introducing the theme for adults again. What is with the way that society has come in the last century, you need to be more clear about this in accordance with today's standards in order to be recognized as an adult program. The characters have a very realistic personality and put in situations that are parallel to what we face in real life. It's your typical sitcom on that matter. But humor is like what you expect from a late-night TV show, such as a talk show or Saturday Night Live ... Go back when SNL is really funny, doing very well Continue ... and improve the marketing of products for the series to help increase costs It's a challenge to do this with a comic that has a complete nature. Hmm ...
