I have to accept from EROS MOVIE COLLECTION. This is what I love the most and the one that I have reviewed. The story is what really makes you look. Many EROS movies have a plot that looks like a hammer to shatter in pieces before producing when you watch Everyone has a center for sex and those who can accept the number of different people at the end of the movie. And oh dear God, don't watch this movie when someone pulls out a gun It doesn't work that it's almost ridiculous. But you don't want to waste energy on doing so. <br /> <br /> "Loss control" is the name that matches the source. Protagonist, lead character (Those with wonderful abilities and beautiful Kira Reed) Control is to control the person who has more than their physical sensations and feelings. And a man changed everything so she made her a almost different woman But the glass broke at the same time This makes it a great movie that I hope I can get first !! <br /> <br /> 10/10
