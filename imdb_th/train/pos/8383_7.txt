Robot Jox tries hard But is a series of continuous fighting scenes - robots and robots, men and men, men and women Location has potential But it seems that the script does not receive a few additional draft Still, it's quite good for action movies, science fiction. Partly because the script was by Joe Haldeman. For those who are not familiar with the name, Haldeman wrote a science fiction novel "The Forever War". It is considered one of the most powerful battle armor novels now with "Starship Troopers" of Robert Heinlein and John Steakley's "Armor" and this movie is more like a giant armor fight than a giant robot. Close to what the fans would want, instead of imitating Paul Verhoeven's "Starship Troopers", which was fed up with the transmission that resembled the underlying novel. <br /> <br /> Despite some assumptions Not dependent on Homer's "Iliad", the two names are all the same. Achilles, who had flown his robot's feet, was not parallel to the Iliad, which does not include the death of Achilles, or the ancient Achilles, a high-ranking warrior. He is a strong man. But it's innocent and useless Even the robot jock that killed in the first scene was not suitable for him, named Hercules, while the Greek Iliad had Herakles. <br /> <br /> The effect is quite good for time and budget. Actually, it's not comparable to "Terminator 2" a year later. But this movie costs ten times The stop was done as well as the Walker robot in "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi". In fact, much better than the Ray Harryhausen animation, which is highly regarded. But quite old <br /> <br /> Don't bring expectations to this and you may not be disappointed. It's better than many other low-budget flicks and even a lot of expenses that want to get results. But the script is worse
