The Spirit's 1986 television movie is a pilot for a possible series. However, the creator of the spirit Will Eisner doesn't like this movie. I think it is a movie that is entertaining and catchy (sorry) of comics with modernity. I'm sorry that it's not true in the Sam (Flash Gordon) series. Jones is the perfect spirit. Nana Visitor is Ellen Dolan, which is good, and of course, going to Star Trek: Deep Space nine years later. Perhaps with the release of Frank Miller's movie, The Spirit, many people will be able to see rare gems of spirit history. It seems that when Hollywood creates a movie from a character or idea that has already been created, someone will inevitably find the previous version and release it to the video to make a few dollars. The When Antonio Banderas wears Zorro's mask, we can pick up the previous masked hero on the DVD, such as the excellent Alain Delon version of the 1970s (although all the copies I've seen were badly edited). Hope that someone will release The Spirit's TV adventures to DVD soon.
