Believe it or not, the final case of Inspector Gadget is what keeps me stuck with all the gadgets. <br /> <br /> My name is Miriam and I'm twelve years old. At the top of his career Of course I heard him. But I don't really know him. <br /> <br /> While reading, please note that I have never seen the original SERIES (I will do it if it comes!). Now I'm obsessed) and I'll focus on the things I like about it, because others are negative. For all the pessimists, I have some disadvantages as well = P First, for the humor that looks. As a child, you can That the film is quite funny. I think it is like suing me. I still think that the animation and character design is good and I am happy that there are more gadgets in it because he is my favorite character. (I don't like pennies) Then there are nails. (His voice is terrible) and Madcat; I think they do quite well as well. Gadget stupidity seems to be in a good position if not a little exaggeration. (For example, sucking the thumb of his hand hat will make the screen good, but = P) Oh, and I like the music that runs in the credit. <br /> <br /> Talk to the car? What happened to that You can tell that this thing is aimed at younger boys. That wouldn't bother me a lot without the fact that the car helped all day. I would like it a lot if money and brains happen instead. And obviously the gadget loves his car more than it is called natural A little strange to say at least. <br /> <br /> Oh and the boss is serious for the gadget. I mean, Che. Yes, he's not the most cheerful person. But he didn't hate gadgets from what I read His personality is exaggerated. <br /> <br /> That's all I have to say about this movie. I think the animation created for the plot that focuses on the car is essentially and it's quite good overall. More than a live-action movie gadget (slowly, butchered, BUTCHERED!) At least, maybe I'm just leaning because this is what made me enter the gadget at first, or maybe my mind was twisted or maybe I was strange But I really like this movie for.
