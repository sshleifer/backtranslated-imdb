I like this movie because it is a great film work created by people who are interested enough to make it art, not just movies at home. It was filled with Greg's home movies, Super Internet, and amateur videos from other people who arranged themselves with his 50-year passion. However, it was extended to the level that it approached. aesthetics It is full of artistic talent and athletic ability. However, you may think that surfing is a sport. Surfers are not astronauts or test pilots. And they are not a surgeon (maybe) or a doctorate (Again, maybe) It believes in the quest of the surfer. It believes in the beauty of human stupidity. It believes in the great gift of peace that comes from stopping the war. Surfers celebrate the war on the northern beaches of Hawaii that were attacked by the Japanese center fifteen years ago. Is celebrating the fall of the country which fought the Cold War instead of the hot war - with Russian socialists It is dangerous, but a little history. I wonder if Alexander the Great will not be celebrated for his surfing technique. He had to go out and conquer a few countries to receive the media he received. This movie does not have a military hero. It has no guns, only surfers, beaches, beer shops and surf shops. This is not a problem. Peace is not desperate It is the pleasure of exhaling.
