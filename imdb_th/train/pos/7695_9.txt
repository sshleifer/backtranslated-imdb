Goodtime is an advanced joke about the first nuclear nuclear family living in the Chicago project. Whether you live in an inner city, slums, suburbs or rural areas, this show is still a treasure to watch and notice families that are just families rather than poor black family performances. But they are not with it They find humor and have family values ​​and good morals. Despite the story behind this show, it's worth it to air, except I don't like them to kill my father, which I agree with Esther Rolle, who is fighting hard for the family But even though there was a fight scene behind it, Good Times showed the family. We all love JJ's bombs and his comedy performances. We watched Janet Jackson's penny grow a little. This show represents despair in gang drug use and alcoholism. Without having to preach, The Evans always tries to do the right thing instead of doing something wrong to get out of the ghetto.
