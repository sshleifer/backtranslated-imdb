Gandhi, my father is a movie that is doing well. It shows the life of Harhal's eldest son Gandhiji, the character of his differences with his father, his love for his family, the desire to stand on failure. His ego Akshaye Khanna shows. The complete role of Harilal is not just him. Everyone did well in the role they played. Darshan Jariwala is Gandhiji on the best screen I've ever seen. But I will cut three points because of a minor flaw. <br /> <br /> First of all, the movie is longer than it should be twenty-five minutes. Secondly, the movie needs more research on Harilal's characters. Some of the characters don't look perfect. In addition, his relationship with his brothers did not appear. There is no mention of Gandhi's other children in the entire movie. I believe that the characters like Harilal should have at least their brothers and sisters as well, considering the selfishness of Harilal. <br /> <br /> Continue on, although there are some shortcomings, I like watching movies recommend ...
