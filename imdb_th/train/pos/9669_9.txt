After reading the original play, I thought it would be difficult to adapt to the screen rather than Donal McCann performing in one of the great works as a Public Gar, a repressed opponent who appeared on the screen like Revealed by his outspoken people, Eamonn Kelly also plays a great "swinging ball" that has the ability to communicate his feelings being matched by Gar only. <br /> <br /> Definitely worthwhile to release. If you can find it (May not be available outside Ireland and the UK)
