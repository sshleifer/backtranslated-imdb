This movie is amazing. It's an inspiring movie. The characters are fully developed through the fact that Lucy Walker brings to the movie. I encourage people who are looking for a special movie that shows humanity in a human condition. Lucy Wlaker presents the beauty of the landscape This movie is a true example of man and nature and sometimes humans and men. Chaos and great victory in that matter The story of how Tiebtans perceived blindness as a symbol of demons was interesting. This film clarifies the unique culture that has never been seen before. Lucy Walker gives Eric Waihammer Mayer a voice when he doesn't hear. Thank you Lucy for being sincere to you as a filmmaker.
