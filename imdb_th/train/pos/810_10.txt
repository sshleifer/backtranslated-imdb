This may be the best movie of all Star Wars movies. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the movie is almost the same as the fourth episode - cabaret songs and the idea of ​​a cabaret location where The seriousness of the gangster Jabba the Hutt is even more serious. He ordered Luke to die in the basement with Bantha's broken bone, which appears to be a cross between the bear and the shark. Eventually, the power of Luke's Jedi removes monsters. Adding to Han Solo's sneaky help, which was frozen at the end of Episode V, Jabba was furious about this. Luke was sentenced to death at the Sarlacc hole. <br /> <br /> But all Star Wars "good guys", especially R2-D2, have other ideas ... and those other ideas help make Luke's execution bad. Eventually, most of Jabba's soldiers died and Princess Leia could use force to suffocate. Jabba died. <br /> <br /> Like Episode IV, the star of death in Episode VI appeared as I analyzed the division. The rebellion that attacked the guerrillas of the Empire around Death Star. The personnel of the Star Destroyer, I guess, speed up the main laser by using the imperial fighters to divert 20-25 destroyers. Ready to attack But was summoned out and replaced by Deathstar's laser weapon was shot in surprise When it was fired, the only hope of the rebels was the Death Star's shield to be struck and this affected Lando because he wanted to destroy the Death Star. But he can't do it until the shield is brought out And it was brought out by the increasing anxiety of Lando. <br /> <br /> Just like in Episode V, Imperial Walkers created a terrifying image with their twin guns, killing at least one Ewoks ... But Ewoks found an ancient but unusual way to deal with them. For example, Chewbacca and Ewok can control another person. (And actually used to break from the back of the walker) and other Ewoks using the logs to smash the other two walkers. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how Luke did it with J's power. On his Light Saber, such as the scene on the endor, which looks at the laser light coming from the Storm Trooper bike and using Saber to flick out Part of the bike Or during the climax, using Saber to separate his father's arm during the last Saber fight with Sith Vader. <br /> <br /> You may know that the Ewoks celebration after Death Star was Blowing fireworks performances, successful drumming (such as Storm Trooper Masks) and Luke finally meet Leia after Luke's own nemesis - Darth Vader dies. Stone pile The celebration includes the singing of Ewoks, but I think Lucas didn't buy it - even though there is a great respect for the composer John Williams. <br /> <br /> In the version Home movie. I think Lucas himself. In addition to celebrating Ender, he also wanted a scene of a celebration on several surviving rebel planets, including a laser-fired celebration that destroyed the statue of Sith. Ewoks were replaced with parts. Choice He may need something special to prove that by destroying the Death Star, the balance is restored to the rebel galaxy.
