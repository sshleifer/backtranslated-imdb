Try cutting the chase: If you are a baby, you have to spend time wondering the fact that in 1976, McCartney had the opportunity to participate in the hermit of John. Of course, you still wonder what happened. I heard the same report that the writer of the film heard from John and Paul's perspective, and I admit that I created a new meeting in the same way that this movie did. But my imagination can't buy tears for me, like this masterpiece and acting can do. I found it amazingly realistic, completely realistic and without 100% Saccharin. Can anyone explain why I haven't heard this masterpiece before CBC will be screened last night? I mean, it's three years old for good! And if you are a fan of The Beatles, this is a taboo show! Even the detailed interpretation of the Beatles melody is still inspiring.
