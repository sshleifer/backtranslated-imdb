Ettore Scola is one of the most important directors of Italy. My parents and I watched together "C'eravamo tanto amati" On a summer night: We like it, but we don't love as we love "Special day" I believe Ettore Scola is quite bad: we often forget him Often it may be because his latest film is disappointing. Yesterday night, my mother and I sat on our couch to enjoy this masterpiece. Writing the direction of filming, scoring and production design are quiet and accurate. But what I like most is the chemistry between Lauren and Mastrean. They are both great actors and have the main role of Antonietta and Gabriele Antonietta as a housewife: Married with a fanatic fascist fanatic. She has six children. But her husband wants to have another child to receive a reward for the big family. Gabriele is just against fascism. They spend time together on a special day, the special day of 1938, when Hitler came to Rome to visit Mussolini. I don't want to lose a story about the story anymore: Go watch this movie!
