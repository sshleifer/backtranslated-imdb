I saw this movie many years ago and still look many times a year when I have a chance. It's on my favorite movie list, along with some classic movies. If anyone tells you it's stupid or outdated, don't care about them ... This movie is suitable for everyone who likes to laugh and listen to music. The dance is not as important in this movie as in other Astaire movies, so the comedy and the show shine out. Watch this movie if you can. It may be light. But still completely fun So I know that many people hate black and white movies. They think that old movies can't actually be funny. This movie should make them change their minds. No one knows that I can watch this movie without having fun at least. The only problem of this movie: Fred Astaire sings without dancing. He may be a great actor and a talented singer. But it was not interesting and left a large story in the middle of the story Comedians sometimes get a little bit of creativity, but G Burns and G Allen's vaudevillesque performances are perfect for the episode and can satisfy anyone looking for a simple laugh. Give the opportunity to this film even if you don't Like old movies But this movie can attract interest in nonsense
