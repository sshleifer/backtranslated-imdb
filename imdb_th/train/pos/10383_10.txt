I saw this movie in 1976, which is my first year living in New York. I was there for the next 26 years, but never saw anything that was delicate and beautiful, like this small TV movie. It is part of the PBS series, as I remember and I never forget. <br /> <br /> There are no sex scenes to talk about when the delicate moments are moving, full of tension and All of this excitement is located in the Boston Conservation Area (I think) the environment of World War 1 that women play. The role of a devoted wife awaiting the return of her husband from the war and not finding a career and financial freedom <br /> <br /> Do you have a video of this movie? Sure it should be on the DVD, but at least the video?
