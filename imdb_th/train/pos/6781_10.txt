When actors have to play the role of an actor, character or real, the job is more difficult than playing a role. In his life, Ronald Coleman discovered himself as Anthony John, a double personality that was tortured. He put all the abilities and sincerity of the characters down. Facial expressions, walking postures and gestures, talking about what Anthony John spoke through while playing Otello on stage. Coleman also performed very well as Shakespeare's actor in those short scenes as Otello, who is part of the film's gem. Coleman's confrontation, while Otello was tortured with doubts about Desdemona's devotion in a scene that should be worth watching. Then, the despair of the characters outside of his stage It's like watching Spenser Tracy as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, except for this second role that is more profound and more intense. Shelly Winters looks cute, weak and beautiful at the same time and increases her abilities in movies It is believed that Ronald Coleman liked his role in this film, among other things, that he played and won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1947. I would watch this movie repeatedly.
