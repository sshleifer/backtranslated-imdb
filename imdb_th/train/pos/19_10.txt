I just read the comments of TomReynolds2004 And felt the need to jump in here I understand that he doesn't like movies. But his reason is not clear My feeling about this film is that it's not afraid to travel on a darker road of loneliness, failure, disappointment and grief. Each of these two people, as described, has many reasons to be bitter and angry. But found the tenderness and comfort of each other Only great performances can do this without having to become a moody, sensitive and witty quagmire. I became very interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity from such strong performances. I have no reason to dislike Jane Fonda for her Vietnamese actions. But personal feelings are different. She is incredible. In this role, Robert DeNiro is excellent as a man with intelligence and goodness, starting to make him fail in a world that doesn't care about his abilities This is the first time I've seen DeNiro use more tenderness than the strength to sell characters and I like it a lot. This film made a big surprise when I first watched and I hope to see it again.
