Hello, I'm Scott (A.K.A woody7739). I love the movie Twisted Desire and I like watching Melissa Joan Hart on t.v as I think she's fine. I am a big fan of Sabrina, a teenage witch too, so this helps me watch it (don't ask). I like the way Nicole plans to kill her parents meticulously because she makes sure that someone else pulls the trigger and Practicing on the bottle, so she will not allow her fingerprints Nicole returns when she is arrested while her ex comes in and puts the camera hidden under his shirt. I gave nine out of ten of this movie and put it in my list of top 10 movies and last but not the end. If anyone saw this movie in the store, please tell me that I saw it on TV and didn't save it. bye
