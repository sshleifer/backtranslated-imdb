This movie is very realistic. Of course, it's not in the category of Hollywood movies where every line has to be perfectly pronounced and every movement has precision Actors who play as lovers do a great job to show the feelings and thoughts of the characters - daily adventures. Overall, the film will lead the audience to a depressed state. This is where the realism of the whole story is clear. Not everything happens as we think it should happen. I can say that this movie doesn't end with a bad note. We watch. We learn. We touch ourselves. That may be the moral of this story.
