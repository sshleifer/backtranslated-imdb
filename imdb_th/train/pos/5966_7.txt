In fact, I never bought metal before, Satan and other things, but this movie was played according to that idea. Even if it's not a movie that is serious or gives a high rating But it is intended for entertainment while playing This story has an iron band that was burned to death in the hotel. One of their fans dreamed of this effect and the band said it would start to enjoy killing from the grave. Receiving Freddy never hurt a woman in the car before. There is another movie with a heavy metal band in it. But it is very different in playing because there is one type of band that holds the city of children and makes them crazy This person has a fan in the group that helped the killer spirit from the beginning and tried to stop him. There is nothing terrifying in it because I can't remember killing everyone that is full of blood. Quite frankly, the scene that I remember most was the scene of a girl wearing an earpiece and then being disturbed by the band's existence. There was nothing good but filling a good time
