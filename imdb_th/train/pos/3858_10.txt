American director Paul Verhoeven's American vehicles are of various qualities. But most of the movies he created in his home country are undeniable masterpieces. This is the story of an alcoholic writer (and two genders) that moved into a very rich and strange woman. But women do not know that they are interested Solely in meeting with the handsome young man's lover In the meantime, the author has strange images - at first they look like hallucinations caused by alcohol. But soon he began to realize that he was actually experiencing some premonitions An interesting, original and exciting Hitchcockian thriller. I love movies that make you think of them about something. But then you know that they are about something completely different. This is one of those movies. The thriller in the first half of the year and the virtual saga of religion in the second half. Original arousal and disrespect, not for children or those who go to church every Sunday Best movie from director Jan De Bon Highly recommended!
