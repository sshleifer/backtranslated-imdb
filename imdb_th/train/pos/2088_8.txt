From the top of the top class classic books, this clever story written by Pearl Buck, a book like this movie is called "The Good Earth". New by traveling to 'The Big House', where he brought his wife, Luise Rainer, almost from the beginning. She began to adjust to his generosity by collecting small peach seeds and planting them near the new house. yours Over the next several years, O-Lan proved her worth by sharing her husband's hard work, changing problems and wealth. Over the years, they raised their families and watched the weather in their simple homes, both celebrations and famine. In fact, it is the lowest point in their lives that each person finds the value of friendship, loyalty and love. With the changing times, their growing families receive help and are threatened by friends and relatives like their uncle. (Walter Connolly), who is a villain and sly, has a 'old father' (Charley Grapewin) to give advice and remind him of the fragile and uncertain nature of life. The two famous actors who created an impressive image in this movie are Keye Luke, the player Wang Son and Phillip Ahn, who plays the nationalist military. The film is black and white and adapted from a great novel. Highly recommended for all audiences ****
