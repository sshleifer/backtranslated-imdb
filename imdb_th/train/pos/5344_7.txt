This is a very good Spanish movie. But I am worried that there are many people who will feel lost because many people around the world don't know what the Spanish Civil War is about or when it is fighting. As a history teacher, I have a great advantage. But can easily see how this movie can be confusing until you combine all parts together I wonder if this will be a big problem in Spain that created this movie. But for other audiences, they may be a little confused until the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Carol, 12 years old, and her mother returns to her mother's hometown. Many years have passed and you gather that they are traveling to Spain from New York City. Despite the peculiarities, Carol spoke fairly well in Spanish and most movies were about the way she adapted. For the reason that she and her mother are alone, I will do it immediately for those who do not understand that Carol's father is fighting in the war. (Which was eventually defeated in this bloody conflict)) <br /> <br /> The movie received a special mark for camera work and lovely music. The speed is relatively slow and tourism is not bad if you are a person who accepts movies in this manner. I have seen other Spanish films about this war and compared quite well with them - no better or worse - just a good life movie about those left behind, including a good age flick. <br /> PS - If you don't know which side, most Republicans are socialists and supported by the Soviet Union and Mexico, including volunteers from many countries. (Including the United States) nationalism led by Franco and received help from Portugal and the fascist states of Germany and Italy
