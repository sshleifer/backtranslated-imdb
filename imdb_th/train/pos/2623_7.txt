I really like the original and this movie has both ups and downs. This is just a few: <br /> <br /> Up: Most of the original voice-overs come back. <br /> <br /> Down: I don't like Timon's voice. I know that she made a voice in The Simpsons, but the performance was very stupid. <br /> <br /> Up: We'll see Simba as a "teenager" <br /> <br /> Down: Lose It Along with Tim and Simba Competition <br /> <br /> Ups: Rafiki tells Timon about "Hakuna Matata" <br /> <br /> Downs: How can Pumbaa know? About this story <br /> <br /> Ups: Song again (Some original songs are there. But they are just music. <br /> <br /> Downs: But stupid songs (singles of .k.a. Timon) <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a good movie. I would recommend it for fans of the original, but if you don't like the traditional, chances are you won't like this. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10
