Dominic's emotions and characters and Eugene are the things that Hollywood didn't do anymore. This film is one of the films that are about the emotions, feelings and hearts I've seen! Roy Liotta, Tom Hulce and supporting actor Jamie Lee Curtis presented the Oscar Winning! There are not enough words to show how good this movie is. Of course, people who are not in the movie are probably not as interested in the rest of us about Dominick and Eugene, but for the rest of us, this film reaches the heart and compassion and humanity alone. You will never forget this movie ever! <br /> <br /> ***** The spoiler below ***** <br /> <br /> A simple story. Eugene is a practicing doctor who has to work long hours and work hard at. His brother, Dominick, the twin brother (born 12 minutes ago) is slow and slightly uncomfortable because the brain is damaged because the victim was attacked (The moment when regret finding this in a movie that will make you cry!) Eugene (a.k.a "Geno") faces pain. He must decide whether or not to end the medical school, which means accepting his residence in another city and leaving Dominic (aka "Nicky") behind or adjusting the remaining education to look after him. Nicky helps pay tuition fees in his brother's medical school by working as a garbage collector. <br /> <br /> Questions about ethics, morals and responsibilities are mixed in movies that are This sounds When Gino thought Nicky might progress to independence, Dominic turned around and did things such as helping drug dealers or guessing to use the wrong line he found at the pile. Garbage on electrical appliances br> Larry is Nicky's "character" and partner on his junk path that fills the hearts of Dominick with all sorts of stories, such as Geno and Jennifer (his girlfriend, which he teaches clinical pharmacology) at Atlantic. City and gambling All their money But deep down, you can see that Larry cares about him in their rounds. Nicky also befriends the little boy that we discovered that his father was also beaten. The result is the tragedy and the pain that you see on Nicky's face. When it happens, say many books. <br /> <br /> The sensitivity that the two brothers share can not be overstated. Nicky, everyone wants to do is love and look for acceptance of what he can do. (For example, he went to the church to love Hulk Hogan) Geno loves Nicky more than everything in the world. But can his brother have enough freedom that Geno will be able to follow his dream of becoming a doctor? Great movies that should be accepted more than they should be. But unfortunately it came out at the same time as Rain Man, who dealt with similar problems. However, I like Dominic and Eugene better because it has a much stronger emotional element. Be warned in advance that the film is aimed at the tear ducts, so Kleenex is useful! What is a movie !!!!
