It's just a pleasure to see this interesting project. Refreshing and educating not only with filmmakers who can learn what can be done in 5 minutes of the screen But still an audience that may not be ready for a lot of love in a short time But some things stand out I think the Tom Tykwer (Natalie Portman) segment is the best. Although mimes will make me smile too You read as enough spoilers. Just watch it Do not read what I write. But watching movies instead <br /> <br /> and smiling
