This movie is great. It is a very delicate story and this film is great. This movie doesn't create any conflict in India (as far as I know) and its publicity is also low. I think the movie this Wasting time because most Indian directors and producers have changed the theme, although it is very delicate and adds a love story to the original story and destroys the whole story ... Most Indian viewers will agree with this topic if they Remember Ashoka, Mangal Pandey, LOC and others. <br /> <br /> There are many movies in India that will become a major event or a big hit if the love story section. <br /> <br> But keeping it is quite similar to the movie Pinjar (must see) <br /> <br /> If I count, I would like to thank Anil Kapoor (producer) and Firoz Abbas Khan (Director) makes a great movie ..
