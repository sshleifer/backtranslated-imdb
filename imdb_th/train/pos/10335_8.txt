The only reason I gave this movie 8 out of 10 is because in my opinion there are some perfect movies. This little B picture is a tense story. I was always fascinated by Alexander Knox. But had seen him very little Here he plays Wilhelm Grimm, a grief-stricken little man who turns into a monster. He betrayed everything and everyone without repentance. The performance is one of the coolest performances I've ever seen. Since World War 2, actors who played Nazi or other evil types in the film have been nominated for an Oscar for the time. I imagine that since this happened during the war, the educational institutions felt like honoring such a show that would be regarded as evil. But Knox acted in that way - the man was bitter and wasteful with the guilt he didn't think would make others suffer. I still can't beat it. <br /> <br /> Marsha Hunt, who usually plays the role of a butterfly or social butterfly. May not be worth it to Oscar but is her best career Nothing with her; I enjoy her in the "little" role that she often plays. But here, she proves to her that the work of the drama is heavier. <br /> <br /> If you like human drama stories or stories about the fate of those who tortured Nazi hands
