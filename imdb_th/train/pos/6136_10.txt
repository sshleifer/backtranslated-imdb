I love the bed knob and the broomstick so much that I cry for thousands of joyful times whenever I'm happy to see it. I want to emphasize the simple truth that I love it too. Some people have said that I have 27 sets in the video and I love them all equally. I love others who love it. I like the dance scene in Portobello Street. I study dance and practice every day. I have recorded my own voice singing. If anyone can play drums or guitars, I'm thinking of creating a bed knob and a broom band. Love me (Liz)
