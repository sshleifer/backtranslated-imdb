Presentation Lily Mars (MGM, 1943) is a lovely movie. But in my opinion it would be better Judy Garland is great as always. But some scenes in this film do not make sense, and the love between her and Van Heflin develops too quickly. <br /> <br /> I mean, one minute, he is ready to beat her butt. But a minute later he fell in love with her. I believe that this production of movie and script editing (Although photography is excellent, the scenery is beautiful and the costume is also good). Would be a little better. It feels as though the production is too hectic. <br /> <br /> The supporting actors are also good, especially Janet Chapman, the little daughter as the second daughter Rosie. Really loved and is a shame that she did not develop into a teen comedian She was better in this film than in her previous film as Warner Brothers in the late 1930s (except Broadway Musketeers 1938. She was really good in that) when they tried to make her turn. Is a mixed breed Overall, this movie is better. But in the end, Judy gave everything to her.
