If this film proves only one thing, Keaton is, and will always be a memorable cartoon, even when dodging bullets heading to the electric chair and entering the end of the prison line. <br /> <br /> But "Johnny Dangerously" still proves more in the 80s. ZAZ (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker) is the pinnacle in the world of spoofing. But many people claim the throne this time, Amy ("Fast Times at Ridgement High"). Heckerling tried to use her hand with a number of notable television writers behind the script. (Go and check) <br /> <br /> Slap the happy slap of the movie sops-and- "gag", the 1930s sters of this movie, about every cliche and add A few cliches that never existed before. <br /> <br /> And not only is Keaton credible in his hand as Johnny. But are funny men and dolls like Piscopo, Henner, Stapleton, Boyle, Dunne, DeVito, Walston and just about All the actors in Hollywood who happened to walk into the neighborhood You will be surprised by the number of faces you can remember. I know I am <br /> <br /> and jokes? When they start, they will come to you quickly and be angry like a machine gun. There are too many to be counted at first, pouring with crazy songs by Weird Al Yankovic, but you have to be careful when they load. And they have to reload too often. <br /> <br /> Everybody tries. They seem fun and I laugh at the good times. In the end, though, there is plenty of time to think of some funny scenes. But generally it's not the best thing to think about after watching a comedy. <br /> <br /> But for a slow night when there is Nothing good on TV, come out in "Johnny" and get ready for the "dangerous" laughter. <br /> <br /> Eight stars. Let's see "Johnny Dangerously" ... Don't be a "bastidge".
