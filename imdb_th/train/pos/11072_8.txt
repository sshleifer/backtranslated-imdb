It was very easy. Jake went to jail and spent five years with the chess supervisor and master. They are sympathetic about his history, loss and failure and the full misery that he lives because of his belief in learning little techniques and controlling the laws of robbers. The They decided to give Jake maximum freedom: from the fear that was within the end of what he believed to be himself. For that, they took him on a trip that he had to release all fear, pride and hope - to be reborn as the true master of his intentions. <br /> <br /> It's a smart movie about with The journey of illumination about endless betting and games that we do with and within ourselves. 10/10. No doubt.
