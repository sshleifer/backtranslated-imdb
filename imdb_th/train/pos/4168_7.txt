This film is not only But there is only one great movie But also the third 70-year-old actor, Ike Eissenman and Kim Richards In Stranger at our home I missed it on the first run, choosing to watch another movie. Later, when repeated, I saw that I had chosen the right one. This movie is not bad. But lacking fear or surprise Although I like the scenes that Richard Crane is shooting in the family, it's not helpful.
