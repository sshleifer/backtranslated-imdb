Japanese cyber-punk movies have never done much for me. But at least I have seen most of them are visually interesting and at least have fun. MEATBALL MACHINE is no exception. <br /> <br /> The story is about the species of parasites that live above the host The human control of their bodies becomes "necroborgs" and makes them fight each other. The sole purpose of eating each other - is clearly a "game" for the enjoyment of the mentioned parasites. Most movies revolve around shy men and girls who fall in love with each other, but love stories are shortened by both being infected with parasites and being forced to fight each other. It became a test of human determination and control of parasites over their physical objects ... <br /> <br /> MEATBALL will be compared with TETSUO continuously. Although the movie is definitely different. There are many fun moments in MEATBALL MACHINE and the monster / borg FX is definitely a high point - a mixture of TETSUO-Meet-GWAR. That is exquisite and creative Depending on your taste for this type of movie, MEATBALL MACHINE may or may not be your thing. If you enjoy the cyber-punk movie Hyper-Kinetic that has a healthy amount of water splash - this is for you ... 7/10
