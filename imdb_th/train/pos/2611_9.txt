This is an extensive view in Australia because it is one of the best police drama ever produced here ... and for my money everywhere. It is a true character, a credible situation, and not shy away from the dark side of everyday life confronted by police and criminals, victims, lawyers and others in various orbits. This operation lasted for 2 seasons and was canceled because this program sold well in foreign countries. We all regret the loss: However, like Fawlty Towers, we can pay homage to this as a limited-length series with the same high quality.
