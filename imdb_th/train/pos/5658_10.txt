This is one of the best programs for TV. Full of mystery and intrigue and twists and turns Forced viewing I'm lucky I saw this thing in the UK. They may have a wrong sequence. I can't remember. But at least every week My girlfriend and I were hooked from the trailer in and we weren't a big fan of the usual American series. <br /> <br /> After the pilot We missed a couple of times and it made you sad and mad for a week. Lost them. <br /> <br /> The best actor selection for Gary Cole is really better than his role. As Custer, Lucas Black turned out to be an amazing performance for children and Paige Turco was also the best of her as well since the Party of Five and of course Nick Searcy as a close friend of the long-suffering sheriff <br /> Yes, there is a bit Confused and terrifying. That makes the ending weak and you can tell that they killed it How do we go? Why do they do that with one of the best shows of all time? Executive shot
