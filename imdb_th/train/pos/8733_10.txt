When I bought my Toy Story tape when it came out to the video after being released in the cinema, I saw a trailer for this, which was said by the creator of Toy Story as soon as I saw that I knew this would be a feature. good! I'm right! The life of Bug, like Toy Story, is a great story, excellent characters and great animations. My favorite character is Dim the Rhino Beetle, voiced by Brad Garrett and Hemlich the Caterpillar voiced by Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft. My late favorite scene is when Slim the Walking Stick (David Hyde Pierce) raises Hemlich trying to divert. Caught the attention of birds and hemlich like Mr Hoo, Bird Bird So then try the good worm that is on the stick and the slim body like I am going to snap! I will snap! I just died, laughed in that scene. Being a big fan of insects, I think A Bug's Life is my favorite Pixar, although I know that many people think it's the worst Pixar movie ever! I don't know how you will hate Pixar movies! I think they are all good movies! Very well done. PIXAR!
