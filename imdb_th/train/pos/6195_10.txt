After watching this movie several months ago, it jumped back to my consciousness and I felt I had to buy it or at least have to watch it again, even though I watched it at least 3 times when I rented it. <br /> <br >> I fell in love with the director of Hal Hartley many years ago - I found that these movies made me laugh at places that didn't entertain. It's a strange feeling to get, and I think most people go out there. In fact, don't get it or make them feel confused and uncomfortable - I think I just got it - like a movie. These are created for me. <br /> <br /> Although I can't remember that I actually laughed out loud in this movie. But it is still one of the most fun movies I've seen for many years If you don't see the humor of the grocery bag that Faye takes from the road to the church to her brother's publisher, go to the son's headquarters. You may lack the wisdom to be impressed by this film. The bag is a quiet character in itself, being dragged around as an icon of a motherhood that is often fragile. Parker Posey must bear before putting the international intrigue of the rest of her movie. <br /> > I think "Henry Fool" Hartley's favorite movie. I don't remember very well - I think the characters themselves are very disgusting. I find it boring. It seems that Hartley's right hand will develop a female character. <br /> <br /> In addition to Posey's cleverness, it's great to see Elina Lowensohn, one of my favorite actors again. Her lavish innocence is perfect for Hartley's direction. His ability to make people look aggressively helps define his style as a delicious, chronic irony. <br /> <br /> This film makes the story. Interesting at the international level, which describes the political situation in Afganistan. This thing was never suspected at first. The complexity of the development of this film is unparalleled. <br /> <br /> This is a good example of the sequel. "Stand alone". The more you know about Henry Fool, the more mysterious it spins around him as you expect his appearance at the end of the movie - as a complaint. Smoking with alcoholic ingredients. It's like discovering that Santa Claus is a bullied school aged 12 years. <br /> <br /> Although I was impressed and satisfied with Hartley's latest film Unit "the Girl from Monday" and "No That Thing" Fay Grim "goes far beyond my expectations, with humor and originality that won Oscars never dared.
