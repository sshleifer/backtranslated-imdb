Wow! Stacy Peralta has followed Dogtown and Z-Boys with an equally amazing documentary about the history of the big surf culture in America. We have conveyed the courage and freedom of the early pioneers who have a passion for sports that have occurred in industries that today touch with millions of people. <br /> <br /> Get to know these icons and stories. Their warmth to this movie You can feel the respect of Peralta for this group because we heard the story of Greg Noll from a terrifying surfer group on the beach to challenge the height of 50 feet off the coast of northern Hawaii. Or Jeff Clark reciting the dangerously dangerous Maverick off the coast of Northern California alone for 15 years before it is discovered and becoming a surfing destination in California And stories in the tales of Laird Hamilton, the surfing icon of today Hearing Gregg shows respect for Hamilton as being the best surfer ever shaking up. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Surfers The surfboard above the hill was very impressed with the reception of his audience and the movie, both he and Clark both liked them like in the movie. <br /> <br /> The giant ride shows respect. These great athletes at the same time reward us with a deep understanding of the size and terrifying power of the waves that they need to overcome the vertical decline of the intestines that must be used to enter. The surfers will experience every time they face a demon. <br /> <br /> All of this and the movies are more. For those of us who do not live in California in the 60s, we get insights about the impact of American pop culture surfing. (And to my surprise, the impact of the movie Gidget on surfing!) Peralta also continues on some technical aspects of sports and the history of innovation in the device. I'm not a surfer. But just like the rest of Sundance's audience, I am passionate about this film. Peralta settles, claiming that he is Big Kahuna of the American documentary.
