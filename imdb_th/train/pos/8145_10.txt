The first time I saw this movie about 4 years ago and I expect the funny things like CB4. I'm blown away. I'm on the floor. Laughing. Butt. This movie is great. Better than CB4. Popular independent film that received "Two Thumbs UP" by Siskel and Egbert (and if two white men can understand humor in this film, you know it's good)
