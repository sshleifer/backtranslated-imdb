Now I like this movie very much. It's funny. Akshay Kumar and John Abraham are great actors. I think after watching this movie, they should make many movies together in the future. <br /> < br /> Akshay Kumar gets herself a little trouble by dating 3 women at the same time But the way he managed when one came out of the door and the other looked very funny, he watched his movie and I hope In the future, John Abraham plays as his best friend. He plays his role very well and he insulted me for his wonderful work. obvious But he is a really good actor. I love John Neha. Dhupia plays a small role in this movie and plays well. <br /> <br /> The muse is really good. I recommend this movie to everyone.
