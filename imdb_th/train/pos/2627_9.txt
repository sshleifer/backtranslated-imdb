Finally, Timon and Pumbaa in their own movie ... <br /> <br /> 'The Lion King 1 1/2: Hakuna Matata' is a classic film that does not respect the story. What classic story do you ask, 'The Lion King' of course! <br /> <br /> Yes, if there is one thing that Disney never lacks, it is self-delusion. <br /> <br /> But that doesn't mean this thing. Not a good movie It is the event of 'The Lion King' as told from the perspective of Timon and Pumbaa and for this reason you have to know the story of 'The Lion King' with the mind to see where they came from. <br /> <br /> However, to a certain extent, I watched and thought about this. "Oh God, this is very lame ..." and the other level I have children There is a lot of predictable humor - I mean, when Pamba is composed of two beds, one big for himself and a small one for Timon. Within the first few seconds we all know that Timon will get a big one. But that didn't stop it from being hilarious, which IMO is 'Hakuna Matata' Seriously, do you expect anything else in the movie where Pamba takes the center stage? But it's a joke. These fart is especially good and should satisfy even the most specific gangster. <br /> <br /> The return sound talent is great. I was very surprised that some actors were willing to come back. Most of them had only two or three lines. (If they are lucky) Whoopi Goldberg is especially welcome. <br /> <br /> Music is also good from 'Digga Tunnah' at the beginning. 'That's all I need'. The adaptation of 'Warthog Rhapsody' (the song that was cut from 'The Lion King' and has been greatly improved in this national song) The song also made me There's nothing to complain about. <br /> <br /> At the end, Timon and Pumba are great characters, and while it may be argued that 'Hakuna Matata' is Just an excuse to see them in a fun and varied situation. If so, it's okay. It's hard to find the character that you want to spend time with. <br /> <br /> I start to be creepy. <br /> <br /> Whether in any way. 2 'It's great if you've seen too many times' The Lion King'. Especially if you are thinking "Don't be stupid. There's nothing to see 'The Lion King' too many times!"
