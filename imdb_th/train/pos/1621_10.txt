'Old Mill Pond' Harman and Isings is a true masterpiece of motion art. Complete skills and art that show the nature of this work. There is no more evidence than this cartoon. It is a shame that a lot of people can see the fault of what is and always intended to be a piece of entertainment that never tries to erase black people. If anything, it is a tribute to the humor, infection and stage of the black race. I can't see this candy for many years because The 'Competition Commission' in England is considered inappropriate to show in many countries in the UK. If anyone knows where I can get a copy, I want to see this masterpiece again. I think people who look for messages and intentions that have never been in these cartoons regularly, which is after the age of sixty years, should try to light up and remember that the world is a very different place today Everyone has the right to censor what is visible from the past.
