Look, this is probably one of the best movies that America has to offer for the rest of the world. Hating this movie is hating freedom. I remember that in the early 80s was an uncertain period. The weak economy, communism threatens all of us, and nuclear destruction is almost certain. From the confusion, Stoker Ace is a hero. Ned Betty's performance in this film shows that he has never been like an actor as a single-dimensional victim in the wilderness. His victory is an inspiration for everyone. The on-screen chemistry between Burt and Loni attracted a clear comparison with Brad and Jennifer Jim Nabors as a poet. Go watch this movie tonight!
