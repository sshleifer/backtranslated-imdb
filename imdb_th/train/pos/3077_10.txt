I missed the entire season of the show and started to watch on the ABC website. During the summer of 2007, I was crazy about acting. I think all the actors are excellent. It's one of my favorites forever. I just checked the ABC program for this fall and didn't see it on schedule. It's really sad. I hope they will bring it back ... Maybe they will wait until Bridget Moi has her child? Or is it just my wish? <br /> <br /> I read some comments posted about the program and looked at many glowing words, similar to mine. I hope ABC will consider its decision again or hope other stations will Come to pick it up
