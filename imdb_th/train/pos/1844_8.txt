I'm not sure if this will be one of the messy soap operas at night. But it looks like it's a very good performance (No thanks to the selection of talented actors) Four female friends with various backgrounds together and share the weekly behavior of their love life. One hour long program, follow each one separately by doing quests to find love and do not get bored or repetitive "Trudi" by Sharon Smalley, a housekeeper. (The alleged widow after September 11) who preached and was annoying to her friends a bit (Which is often a loser and with more creativity in the effort) is a good thing to see Small back in t.v. because she is good at "Inspector Lynley Mysteries". The character of Orla Brady (Siobhan, lawyer) may be the most corrupt woman. But still sympathetic to most women as she fought with her husband, but husband Hari (Jaffrey, who originally was "Spooks"), a child with her, regardless of her needs The last two actors are Jesse (Shellie Conn), an event planner who is a wild child who sleeps with anyone and everyone. Sex is not specific and Katie. (Sarah Parrish), a sad doctor with patients and His son sent career and love life out of control. That was said that I am addicted now and hope that the BBC still rotates this series because it is good, it is different and it is a great actor
