I have a little problem with this movie and I hear many criticisms that it's protracted and exaggerated. Actually it is longer than three hours But I was surprised that it passed very quickly I don't think it's too much. I think the IMDb ranking is perfect. This movie looks elegant with beautiful costumes and great effects, and the direction from James Cameron is rarely out of focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack and K. The cute Twinslet, like Rose David Warner, is a great actor who stole every scene he entered. The story is full of details and is very hot in character development. The love story moving well. The movie is a bit slow. The last hour was very exciting and I confessed that I was at the edge of my seat when the Titanic collapsed. I would say that the last five minutes were very moving. The score of James Horner's music was cute, but I was never a big fan of the song My Heart will Go On. The 1996 drama was good, but suffered from a situation that was not. Has been developed and some historical inaccuracies Overall, I gave the Titanic a 8.5 / 10 Bethany Cox.
