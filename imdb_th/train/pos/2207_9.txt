It's not a bad word to say about this movie. At first I wasn't impressed with it. But it grows quickly I like it a lot and I think it's a shame that many people don't see the fact that it's banned in some areas. I'm one of them. Movies presented in the shock department and atmosphere The score is a beautiful questionable delivery device. It seems fair that Chris is still one of the best composers in the business. The performance in this film is quite high if there is a little teak at some point and the effect is very realistic and brave. All of this is a great admiration for good slasher movies in my book. I have noticed in some reviews that the film was heavily damaged by the shooting of the famous P.O.V killer. And I asked if there is anything wrong ??? It is a classic shock that provokes a fear of a true fan and is a great secret to the killer's identity. The only thing that made this movie get the highest score in my book is the surprise that the twist was not handled very carefully. In addition to the tank, it is a great movie. (Although I like the original name) and it's a shame that a lot of people knock on it as just a cheap piece. Moreover But only a few people knew that it seemed to disappear from the haze in the early 80s. It's a shame .... It's a really good movie! Trust in me!
