And don't forget all the love topics! The love between the characters, the love between the characters and Paris and the love of the director and actor / actor for this project. I do not want to post details of the episode because there are a lot of But I have to focus on the range of world-renowned actors and actors from all over the world and their approach to this project. Some people play with their pictures, some of them completely destroying it, and some people interpret the map as a link to their home country or the role they played before. intertextuality Therefore received through movies Overall, I can definitely recommend this wonderful clip art and will wait for the DVD release.
