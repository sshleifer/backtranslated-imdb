This movie makes me cry at the end! I watch movies at least 3-4 stories per week. I saw many great movies and many other movies. But when the scene ends - it's the main heart - come, I cry! And if you don't have - you have a serious problem! The story is typical - nothing new or original. But it's true - because things really happen and people actually exist. Glam is not my song. But I appreciated what they had passed in the early 70s ... At some point, this made me go to the Velvet Goldmine! Docudramas never worked really well. But this movie really makes us believe that ... because they didn't try to make it a path full of glorious concerts, modern musicians who are young women heroes in stupid and emotional groups. Do not honor the medicine And alcoholic drinks. They promote revival and redemption that comes very slowly for up to 20 years ... another great movie since "leaving Las Vegas". I never felt impressed with the movie at all.
