I can not say more about the story of the movie that is not spoken. I didn't see this movie in about 25 years and the memories of it never left me. I searched it everywhere I searched the network in the past. But is empty Last night I thought about the movie again and tried to remember who was there. But I'm only about 10 or 12 when I see the last time and I'm not sure if I have the correct movie name or not. Another search and finally I found this thing I was right. If someone knows that I can get a copy of this wonderful movie to share with your family, can you please give me now that tawnyteel@yahoo.com I will really appreciate it. And for anyone who does not watch this movie and has a chance to get it worth it
