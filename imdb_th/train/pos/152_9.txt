I saw "Elmar" yesterday and thought it would be a great movie. It started with an episode of childhood in the lives of three main characters: Ramallo, Manuel Tur and Francisca. After that, we jumped for about 10 years to the hospital where all 3 friends met again > <br /> Religion, illness, love, violence and sexuality are angry throughout the making of films and movies full of tension.> <br /> I see people complaining that this movie is too bloody. And i think They miss the point It is a violent and sad story. People expect to suffer crying. Heartbroken. To bleed. And I think the things that this film shows are not created to create shock or to show offensive I know that some people like their movies "clean" even those who are violent. But sometimes movies need to make you feel unwell to work. This is one of those movies. And a great movie. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I found was that there was a period of 3 or 4 moments with details of the plot not 100% clear and after thinking about them He at the end All movies are sensible. But it didn't matter to the overall story, so I still let this movie be 9
