Adapted from the book 'Finding Fish', this story is about a young sailor with a problem, Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke), who tells his former painful story to a psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). Visit Derek Luke and the impressive performances of Denzel Washington. <br /> <br /> This movie is amazing in many levels and I was disappointed that it didn't win the Oscar. It was released at a bad time, that is why it was overlooked. I would like to recommend this movie to everyone. You will be impressed with his story and it makes the audience feel sympathetic to this young man who is Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> If you like the real story that is created Inspired and watched Antwone Fisher <br /> <br /> Thank you.
