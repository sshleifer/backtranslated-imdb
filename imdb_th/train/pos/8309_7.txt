It was amazing when movies created for TV became fun, such as Little Richard. This is a movie that can be seen about the story of Rock and Roller. Little Richard, played by the actor Leon, I never saw Before But works very well As a television movie, most of the people who make less noise are made for Cinema, which is a shame because I am sure there are many things we can see about the controversial Little Richard. But we see that there is a lot of rubbish in religion, which is the only thing that damaged the film. Overall, this movie is very good, and the performance is higher than the average movie TV 7 out of 10.
