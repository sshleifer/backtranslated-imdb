This film is actually relevant, although today it has been threatened by biological terrorism and the threat of superbugs, the West Nile Virus and SARS as a serious stressor. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are more useful in Their role The domestic scene between Widmark and his wife is a good scene for the main scene. The actor in this film who left the most traces was Jack Palance. His clearly defined qualities and simple exterior looks to not reveal the way to reveal the greedy and cruel people beneath the surface. The chase scene through the packaging factory is impressive even today. Recommended 7/10
