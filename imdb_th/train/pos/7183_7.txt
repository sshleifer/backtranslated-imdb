This is the perfect series for family viewing. We gathered around the TV to see this on BBC America. It's a modern version of Robin Hood and it attracts children and adults. Teens and tweets of our ages enjoy sitting with mother and dad and watching the exploits of the next Robin. We cannot wait for the next episode to be aired each week and are delighted to see "on request" for free. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe has current fashion points. There are virtues in each subject. It is entertainment Violence is not necessary or unnecessary. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with the feelings of John Williams. It is a story of an old world that has been brought back to life again with the flair of a new world. <br /> <br /> There are lots of garbage on the TV, from the perishable "reality" TV to violence. You should use this for what it is, and that the updated "Robin Hood" should not be compared to Errol Flynn's exploits. This is a gem that everyone favors. Parents who are concerned about their children who see excessive use of violence will enjoy Robin losing tastes in war and bloodshed. He is a Robin Hood trying to find a reason for his escape from conflict rather than fighting. Maid Marian is also an attractive model for young women. Instead of standing and not doing anything, she played a role in helping the poor by being a "Night Watchman". The Nottingham sheriff had deliciousness over the top evil, like the sheriff that should be and looked like a cross between Billy Joel and Tim Curry Guy Gisborne, played by one of the most handsome actors that make most women want him, do not play the role of a bad "Guy". <br /> <br /> The only question we have The "Friar Tuck is?".
