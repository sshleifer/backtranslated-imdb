While I do not think this is the perfect 10, I agree that it is a way above 6, which is rated here. Brokedown Palace is not perfect and yes, it has been planned many times. Does not mean that it should not be done again if done well and I think this movie has a good time Claire Dennes' performance, as mentioned many times, is impeccable like Kate Beckinsale and I think Bill Pullman is great as well as supporting acting. (Pullman's wife, police, crooked, crossed, or traveling or whatever name) The movie has beautiful filming. There are many good things for this film, although there are negative movies. (Three big stories that I discovered) as well <br /> <br /> This is something I don't like. Friendship between young women - in fact, the personality of each woman - not developing in depth until the middle of the picture It would not be possible to lose interest before that, because despite the positive aspects of character development, it should be done earlier and some scenes like when the girl was arrested at first was almost Will defuse I do not think the characters and the surrounding scenes are suitable for this type of movie. However, that's not my main problem and warnings - Spoiler alert. <br /> <br /> The ending, as mentioned dozens of times, is AWFUL. It's scary in two ways. First, though it can be predictable and is very Hollywood. But I want a happy ending! Yes, it's an emotional and powerful end. But in this movie, there is a feeling that he will receive justice and I sit down to see that I was truly shocked at the end and it was performed perfectly by everyone involved. But I feel that both women should go out or except that at least the police should receive what came with him. I mean, nothing happens to the bad guys. They all go with great distractions. <br /> <br /> Also, I don't understand the ambiguity of the ending. I understand the ending that inspired me to think. But this is not a mystery movie or "clue" that we are watching and I want to know about the actual things that are wrong, etc. with this end. Left to decide for ourselves But since I suspect that there will be a sequel, I do not want to guess. <br /> <br /> There are still many things that I like about this movie and of course acting. At the top of the list, I'll give you a score of 7.5 and say it's worth watching.
