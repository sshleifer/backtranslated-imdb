This is a small, neat flick, made on an invisible budget. Take a moment to warm up The performance was so poor that it soon got a Zen charm. After a few scenes, you will stop observing the awkward lines or the rehearsal sound of some deliveries. The characters all develop strange charms, especially "Richard". Forget Anthony Hopkins, a girl I want to hire to play as a delirious psychopath. He seems to enjoy it a lot! When mixed with crazy blood scenes and the spread of zombies is a truly powerful image of the title character "The Midnight Skater" that zooms into the campus in a black hoodie looking for the whole world like Grim. Reaper and speak of The Silver Surfer. These images sometimes make the laughing thing that the characters say about Skater is a hunch. The soundtrack consists of a fun Garage-Punk song and its rude and haughty humility that fits well with the mood of the movie.
