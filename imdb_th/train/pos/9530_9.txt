Conrad Hall went outside with a bang. An excellent film photographer finished his famous career with this film before passing away. He is proud of himself because this is one of the best-looking crime movies you have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Sure, acting is not bad when you have Tom Hank and Paul Newman as the leader. ! The amount of action here is also correct: not too much, not too little. <br /> <br /> There is no character here, frankly, a "good man" because Hank is a professional hit. For Newman, the city chief Hank's only exchange quality does not require his little son to wind up a killer like him, even though he taught him how to be an escape in robbery! Well, <br /> <br /> As good as acting and interesting as the story, the true star of the film is the filming hall, which draws scenes from beautiful scenes with his lenses. His work is great.
