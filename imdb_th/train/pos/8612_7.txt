I disagree with other comments posted in this movie. For example, movies are made from books, and if the author has a gay character in it, "Hollywood" will act as a gay token in the movie. And there are also two gay characters and I think they reflect each other's greatness One is normal and the other is more women. But not on top And Diane Keaton gave a great performance, and if other reviewers were really suitable to watch the entire movie, they would see that her character developed throughout the story by interacting with other characters. For example, when she and Adam go to see the car that Sara is in the garbage collection, you will see the side that her mother came out and later in the movie you see that she is innocent as well But I guess if you are worried about the characters and characters of gay men that are too flawed, this movie is not good. But if you are more generous and I don't know if there really is something good then you will enjoy this movie.
