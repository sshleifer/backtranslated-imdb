My Take: Chaos and Creativity <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves (Yes! Keanu Reeves) and Alex Winter return again as two punk rock actors in the sequel to the movie BILL and the great adventure of TED in this sequel. Bill And Ted received more than time travel They may also travel to heaven and hell too! At the beginning of this sequel, Bill and Ted are preparing for the "Battle of the Bands" competition, which may make them more famous. At the same time, many years in the future civilization, the wizard from the first movie (George Carlin, who has always watched) is working on a university to honor Bill and Ted. There is an evil tyrant (Joss Ackland from THE HUNT FOR RED October) plans to eliminate both rock stars. Two people immediately and for everyone So he sent two identical models (in the words of Bill and Ted: Robot Us's) to do the dirty work. <br /> <br /> After that, Bill and Ted had to die and have to find their way through hell too. Residents who happened to combine both of the worst memories of both of them through the heavens in an attempt to return to the world to preserve their girlfriends ... and their performances. They play board games without anyone except Death (William Sadler from DIE HARD 2). Reminiscent of similar moments in the 1957 international classic movie THE SEVENTH SEAL. Helped by intelligent and intelligent human counterparts. <br /> <br /> BOGUS JOURNEY, special effects, rich techniques, not up to date standards, and even humor and look and feel, sometimes quite outdated (to say in the picture. This story feels like being released in the wrong year, even in the 90s), but with the lack of imagination and vitality in the show and direction, BOGUS BOGUS JOURNEY of BILL and TED have fun, imagination and yes, fake. Rating <br /> <br /> Score: *** 1/2 out of 5
