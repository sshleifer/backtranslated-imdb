I saw The Big Bad Swim at the Temecula Film Festival in 2006 and I was not happy with how I was drawn. <br /> <br /> This film is the center of the life of a group of adults. Swimming class for various reasons A funny idea in itself. The classroom acts as a catalyst for significant changes in the lives of students. <br /> <br /> What surprised me about this movie is its feelings. real Character that is well trained I enjoy the scene in the classroom very much and the drama that happens outside is very intense. It seems that nothing happens outside of the character, and in the end it leaves a strong feeling, such as going to school or entering a summer camp where you will meet a friend who quickly creates a strong bond and finds himself. But must go away too soon. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that Paula's character has a strong and unusual advice that makes you want to know more about her than to be revealed at the end. the best I think you will not meet everyone in the class, even though ... <br /> <br /> Apart from this, I found that this movie is very knowledgeable and fun. See if you get a chance
