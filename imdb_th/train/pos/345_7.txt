The first hour of this film is mostly boring to say the least. However, it was developed later when the Valentine party began. In addition to the distortion of the identity of the murderer at the end, the murder scene of a hot bath is also one of the memorable aspects of the movie. The scene in the garden with Kate is well taken and is the last scene ('Twisted'). In those scenes, there is real suspicion and excitement and the murder scene is so hot. The previous murder was a mess.
