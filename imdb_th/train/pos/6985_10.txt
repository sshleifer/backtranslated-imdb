I must say that as a BSG fan, I'm not sure what I think about this program. I saw it on the big screen at the Arclight Theater tonight (as part of the Paley Center screenings) and the creators, actors and filmmakers spoke about patients. Ron Moore said that they wanted to take a clean break from Battlestar and do something different, and yes, they would lose some fans, but hopefully they will get others. "<br /> <br /> Even without talking Now I'm a big fan of the new program. But this is what I think about movies. <br /> <br /> I like it very much. It's really good. I think I'm a true sci-fi (or 'syfy' - do I really have to type that? ) Beyond description because I watched it all in the series. It has a strong story and full of interest. <br /> <br /> It started with a little story. The group of teenagers planned something, which for me was the weakest and the slightest confusion. The actors playing "Ben" should give us a glimpse of his intense beliefs. The actors playing "Zoe" seem not so good. But she is playing teen (And I'm sure I won't be the only one who thinks "Zoe" is the first episode of the BSG overload) if they hope these things will be a new Bamber / Helfer / Park. Want to think new? Surprisi ngly is an adult that attracts the attention of the audience. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz starred as the protagonist of Daniel Greystone, the man who was haunted by the tragedy in his family, which he jumped over his first chance Grief and not release He worked quietly and enchanted to convey his knowledge about the inner world of computers and people, especially in the scenes in which he spun the web for his young daughter's teenage friend. Trapped her. Unlock and publish The 'serial killer' that he played in Grey's anatomy. Really impressive performances. <br /> <br /> The equally strong, even if not in it, his wife Paula Malckon. Is Amanda Gracestone She is intelligent and well-written and plays well as part of Stoltz and I am completely convinced that they are lovers and couples who are forever together and have a strong relationship. I hope to see what has happened to this family and hope that they will let you do what Roslin has in BSG - you are strong and intelligent and when you strike your child, you are very good. No need to mention her eyes to have magical powers. The scene in which she plays the role of a government agent - a short scene but plays well - gives the idea of ​​her power. <br /> <br /> The other part of the performance that is not 100% effective for me is the scene with Esai Morales and his mafia group He works well overall. But I do not believe in this mob power or threaten their threat I find myself wanting this whole story quite mysterious and difficult to understand. The method presented is almost a homage to the godfather. They beat your head a little. But at a given time, I can see that this will develop into an 'Upstairs / downstairs' that is interesting to the poor minorities (Morales et al) with the wealthy tribes that rule the world (Stolz et al). I enjoy it when he talks to his son about the origin of their name - which is a good scene. <br /> <br /> Note for BSG fans. Children who play 'Willy Adama' don't look like. Olmos really, but he's just a kid No matter how important he is in this movie, who knows? I can't tell But it didn't bother me because he was not as interesting as everything that happened around him. <br /> <br /> Polly Walker plays the role of 'Sister Clarice' and she feels cold and strange. In every scene she entered I'm not sure where she is going or who will end up with anyone. But I'm very impressed with her performance In this film, she is on the side. But apparently was set up to play an important part later She is not like her character in "Rome". What I find in an impressive actor <br /> <br /> One of the surprising things - better music and less clear than BSG, even if it's The same person, Bear McCreary, has a haunting and unusual method that surprised me. I will buy this score if I have a chance. <br /> <br /> For 'debate discussion' after the show, it is hosted by Sami. Green. Ron Moore is very smart and David Eick is very smart (like his video recording) Esai Morales tells a long story about his acting methods and Eric Stoltz is very funny and doesn't really answer questions (but I always have something for him) Paula Malcomson Strong (she took Seth Green to work unintentionally that she was at '24') and the girls who played Zooey and Lacey both loved each other. Grace Park and Tricia Helfer were there as well, answering questions about the scenes they performed. Manually in BSG as a whole and It's an interesting and wonderful evening. <br /> <br /> I give the show 9 out of 10 and hope to see it all. <br /> <br /> Note: I just watched once. This is the second time and hope that they will explore what HOLOBAND was created for. I don't know what it might be. But it makes me very obsessed
