Just saw World Preem of Fido at the Toronto International Film Festival and enjoyed it thoroughly. Here we have a welcome reworking of the widely thought category that will be pioneered (certainly 'flesh out' widely and successfully) by George Romero. But this is a Canadian film by a Canadian director and a joke! And yes, actually, I think it's better than 'Shawn of the Dead'. Thoroughly believed, and more importantly, a fun performance by Dylan Baker, Carrie-Anne Moss and the young actor K'Sun Ray, which I suspect we Will see many future features However, I have to admit that I am the happiest that Tim Blake Nelson is the neighbor of Theopholis, who is the player of Victor Van Dorte from the bride's corp. (Or for those who have watched movies) that aren't better read here as Pride Corpse?) And of course, Scottish actor Billy Connolly in the anime movie His smallest length Just think that he will not get this role if not Peter Stormare's duty to jail break. (As revealed in the question & answer after the Thursday night show) I can't help but speculating that the author must be inspired by a lot of 'Bub' '' Day Of The Dead's Zombie. I am not keen to reveal the details of the plot during the comment, only saying that Fido is not one of the tedious zombies that you can rely on from Romero. You Farah tours constantly and although. (And I have to think back carefully to make sure that) there is enough blood and violence. Delicious humor. Created by director Currie and the author of his co-writing far to make this seem like a feature that should be rated. PG-13 I want you to see this little Canuck jewel. I will definitely buy a DVD. When the summer next year has hope
