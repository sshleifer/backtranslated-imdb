What can I say that I haven't talked about "The Haunting"? It has everything to make a good image. Great scenes, music, mood swings and perfect sound design Although the screenplay sometimes confuses the mind in a strange and surreal way The entire team must forget to read it, probably because they are too busy creating cg effects and creating gothic outfits to observe that the storyline is weak. Each member of the performer provides a cost-effective performance, even if there is little confidence in the material. Lili Taylor has the most to do while others respond mostly to her But that is about it All I can say is that it's a little fun for two hours. But you will want more
