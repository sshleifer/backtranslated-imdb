I have to admit that at first I was worried about watching this movie. I thought it was a little stupid romantic movie about a French woman who met an American in the train and decided to visit Vienna with him. I'm not really fascinated with this type of script because it still makes me believe it's just a movie. I watch it! And I am surprised ... "before the sunrise" is one of the few movies that dares to speak philosophically, rather wondering about the fact that during the time we were born, we were sentenced to death or were The complex idea is the fact that couples should stay together for eternity, or that we can sometimes afford to live in a fairy tale. <br /> <br /> The ending is carefully chosen. Amazing (We don't know if they will meet again in six months at six o'clock in Vienna's station.) - In a good light, we hope so. The actors performed in a very good manner, so I began to believe that I myself could live in this love story.
