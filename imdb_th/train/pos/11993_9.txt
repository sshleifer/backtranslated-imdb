Along with Darkwing Duck, this was unfairly canceled. Disney has been reduced since Tarzan, and we need such a show so Disney will follow Ed Gilbert and Jim Cummings, perfect for Louis and Baloo's voice (sounds familiar, right?) Theme theme Catchy From all the bad guys that are excellent for their own advantages, Tony Jay stands out as Shere, Kahn, Louise and Balu. Sounds like the sound of Jungle Book, which is not a bad thing. Actually, it's quite inspiring! The animation is outstanding and the script has many intelligence that lacks serious movement for many years. Please bring this to show! 9/10 Bethany Cox
