There are many talks about this film and I want to join with those who admire it. It is a unique movie that uses elements of various genres: drama, comedy, gangster movies without confusion. At the point where you just laughed out loud. On the other point, you felt that the character with errors and failures that you watched the genius of Sabu can be shown in the order of the movie. One is where the three men chase each other. There is a day of erotic dreams about the girls they just came on the street. This sequence is very beautiful and shows the character of the three runners as well. It is erotic and funny at the same time. Another example of Sabu's genius is part of a film that tired runners. Their first one, the general loser of the three, saw hallucinations that the women who left him for others to come back again, and you see them dancing together, and in the next match he dances to himself. Every runner comes to the point where they think they have something they lost or follow again. And in part of the movie, they stop chasing, running in line, laughing, just this is the beauty and ludicrousness of what we call life that Sabu manages throughout the story His character failed. (In the end, what do they do?) But he didn't rob them with dignity. "Monday" and "The Blues Postman" created justice for Sabu's claim that he was a genius to watch them! <br /> <br />
