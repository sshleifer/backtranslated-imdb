Telemundo should definitely consider making a DVD set of novela Xica! I know many people, including myself who want to buy Novella Seka! It is a very entertaining novice located in Brazil. The costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the city where the novella was born is beautiful. Xica has a lot of history at that time. I hope Telemundo will convey it again, even if it's 2 in the morning. Suggesting to watch Xica. If there is another show on Telemundo, I send millions of Telemundo emails to show the novella again. The only warning message about Xica is that sometimes it has a violent scene, so I recommend that children under 14 do not see Xica Xica, including merit making 10 out of 10!
