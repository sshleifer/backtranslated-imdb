I have been prepared for the most exciting TV drama. But was pleased to find a fast-paced script, an excellent moral moral narrative from all actors, especially Peter Finch, remarkable special techniques, suspense and beautiful movies - even the images of the majestic stone Buddha that had just been Destroyed by the Taliban Not to mention Elizabeth Taylor, who is beautiful and sympathetic to her, before she enters the poisonous gas that makes her work later. All players helped support it and I wondered who trained those elephants. <br /> <br /> When talking about the stone-buddha sequence, you can notice that it is Vivien Leigh in a long shot. And her movement method is different from Taylor's The only thing that is incompatible with that sequence is the shock. The process is not good, with the background moving too fast for horses that walk. <br /> <br /> If you want movies that are beautiful and not thought-provoking. I have ever seen Boring, spend a couple of hours with Elephant Walk
