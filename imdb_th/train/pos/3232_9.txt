Went to see this Finnish movie and I must say that it is one of the better movies I've seen this year The attractiveness is made up of 5-6 different stories. The whole story takes place on the same day in the small Finnish town. The story comes together very much. At the end, it may be a part of Tarantino's way of making movies. Most actors do very well, which is highly desirable in realistic dramas in this genre. I especially enjoyed the performance by Sanna Hietala, lead actor and Juha Kukkonen. I noticed that btw that IMDB received wrong information about Sanna. Her name, as you may have noticed in my review;) Not Heikkil√§ but Hietala.
