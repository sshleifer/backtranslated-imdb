This movie is quite fun. The actor is quite good and I will talk about the comments before I say - Glenn Quinn is outstanding and he alone has enough reason to watch this movie. He played with the friends and managers of the band "The Beast", which is selfish. <br /> <br /> There are many songs performed by "Beyond Gravity" in this movie. This movie is the production of VH1. However, if soft rock / pop music is not a favorite of some people as well, may forward those scenes. <br /> <br /> The band's plot Trying to make it to the top in LA, but must overcome. Many obstacles on the way are not too original. But to entertain with some surprising plot changes here and there
