I was delighted with John Cassavetes' debut, which was his first film that I had seen that seemed to expand. So it was more important. But still did not feel as though he had made himself more rational than he had in his previous film That may be a harsh thing. In addition, there is something that is no doubt about watching this movie. <br /> <br /> It's about what in reality Cassavetes has become the core of his ideal career that he has shown. On the camera throughout his career as a director Here, showing it in front of the character of the middle-aged Rowlands, Myrtle Gordon could not bring himself to play in the production that would have happened as written, so she would analyze the impulse after an unexpected impulse resulting in Chaos on the stage It is a brave abstract place. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that does not fail to capture the power steering naturally occurring during emptying. No one understands why Myrtle does the things she does and it is seen and even shows that it is destructive. But it may be the best thing for you It may be cleaner than breakdown. Withdrawing the cocoon of rebellion, it all caused the collapse of Cassavetes, causing her character to feel mercilessly truthful, which was at the beginning of the story. She argued strongly that she didn't have anything in common with the characters of you But she is in peace But the opposite mood /> The final scene Myrtle's most wonderful performance was shared with the characters that hurt her from acting with her, one of the most interesting, hilarious and difficult moments.
