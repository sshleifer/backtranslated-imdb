Hello, my name is alanrickmaniac I'm still crazy about It's just another movie that I watched on TV. Then I had to take a video tape to find out how it would end. Then I wanted a DVD because the tape showed the first symptoms after a few weeks. After the DVD, I had to put my hands on the soundtrack. Then, in many movie posters and screenplays Now it's much worse than I tried to push other people to be addicted to my website and Crazy Party. <br /> <br /> How did it happen? What makes me addicted? <br /> <br /> Ok, it's one of the funny comedies. But it's sad and funny that the only melancholy English can create. <br /> <br /> Okay, this movie is a world that is different from things like '' This Is Spinal Tap '' because the character is not. Children or very cool but true This is a story about an older man as well. A story about a pair of men or not. It has some of the best performers possible. Tim Spall, Stephen Rea, Bruce Robinson, Jimmy Claw and Bill Nini. Bill Nighy, the creator of the show. The best I have ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is unbelievable. Mick Jones, a foreigner, composed the song for the Strange Fruit band in the imagination. Jimmy Nell, bass player, Wisses and Bill Nien, the bassist, singer Ray Simmons, is innocent. But awkward, really singing We know about Jimmy Nail, but if you hear only Bill Nighy's singing voice in "Love Actually", you don't have the idea that his voice is great and powerful. <br /> <br /> Well, you will feel bored. With every scene that came for the second time, especially the concert scene You die to be able to truly stand in the crowd dancing when Strange Fruit is doing "All Over The World" singing on your lungs. You desire to cry and celebrate with thousands of people. The new birth of strange fruits at the stage of Wisbech. <br /> <br /> It's hard, but ... I stick to this movie. I stick to strange fruits. If there is a world in which this band exists, I want to move there. <br /> <br /> Still crazy about ...
