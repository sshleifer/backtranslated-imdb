There are a few movies that are made about flying that is lighter than the air. But this is one of those, and it's a good story, just a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Most movies take place at the Navy's airship operations at NAS Lakehurst (by NAS Tustin, played) Wallace Beery plays the senior leader, Ned Trumpet, which is a favorite. But a high-level pilot with a noble story that no one believed him much Half of the fun is close to the end of the movie when the event begins to prove that most of his tales are true. <br /> <br /> Located in the Second World War, the main planning center around. Tri-trumpet is a local widow. Finally, having a father-son relationship with Jess, a deformed son He said that he would never walk without crutches, with the trumpet doctor's leader pulling some strings and the naval flight surgeon helping to restore the lame leg of a young boy. Jesse continues to join the fleet as a flight officer, flying back to Lakehurst and facing new challenges. <br /> <br /> The movie is doing well, even though there is no dialogue. Smooth flow Through technical consultants and Beery unable to march Otherwise, this movie will get a good grade for technical accuracy and makes it difficult to look for the LTA operations of the Navy. The Cash Register Scene The exchange between Trump and Cathy, the interesting future of Jess, is a horn. Of course!
