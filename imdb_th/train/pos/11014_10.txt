I enjoyed watching Cliffhanger at first when the woman (Sarah) was full of fear when she slipped. I thought it was a scary scene as I thought when you saw the sight. It makes you panic and heart beat faster. I like watching Cliffhanger. I think Silvestar Stallone is a great actor and I think he will be known as playing Rambo and Rocky.
