Lars Von Europa Triers is a very good movie, how exactly? Von Trier has a way to tell a story in style. At least he has with Europa. For me, all movies are like experiences, even though I can see it on a small television screen. Even in my opinion, this movie is the most complete movie, realistic and animated movie, including most of the first 250 movies. Okay, there are many other good people as well. But this one is my favorite The final scene is one of the most harrowing scenes ever.
