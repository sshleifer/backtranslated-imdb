Let me say that I love Adam Sandler watching my rule. I pay attention to his performance. <br /> <br /> When he voiced his voice, I couldn't help. But thought gilmore happy shouted at the golf ball I snap back while Adam Sandler sucked me in. <br /> <br /> The reign of me is a great movie. The movie came out slowly at first with you expecting emotions in every scene. <br /> <br / > Don Cheadle has always done an excellent job and there are no exceptions here with a truly excellent line and deserves an Oscar for every movie he can. Adam Sandler is People who are amazing in many aspects. The best of his career. But I remember laughing out loud in many parts of this movie. <br /> <br /> The supporting actors were great with Saffron Burroughs and Jada Pinkett Smith. <br /> <br /> I want Will recommend this movie that has NYC's great performances, great jokes and the new discovery of Adam Sandler. If you doubt him or be confident in the great Don Cheadle
