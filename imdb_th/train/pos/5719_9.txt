As I noticed with a lot of IMDb comments, some critics seem to claim that every movie they see has a cleverly clever plot. I am not one of those people. If I watch action movies, I want to see guns and hero bombs. If I watch a funny movie, I want to cry with tears. You get the idea Therefore, watching the horror movie I want to be scared of is the main thing. The Grudge is a very scary movie, both in the scene with 'jumping' and has a creepy picture I have been a horror fan for many years and I'm talking about professors such as Dario Argento instead of a director of teenage horror runners who have been upset today. If you want to be afraid of watching this movie It's more terrifying than Japan, like 'Ring' (which I think is a great movie too).
