Roman Polanski plays Trelkovsky, a tenant in France. Previous tenants were in the hospital after trying to commit suicide. He met her there and found Stella (Isabelle Adjani), Simone's friend. He and Stella were quite close. Simone died. Began to think that the landlord and neighbor tried to turn him into Simone, so he would eventually jump out of the Le Locataire window (the tenant) in 1976 as the last film of Apartment Polanski's Repulsion and previously was Rosemary's Baby Roman Polanski perform poorly as directed. But his performance is excellent. Isabelle Adjani with her big glasses is wonderful. Monsieur Zy, played by Melvyn Douglas Van Fleet, plays Madame Dioz. Shelley Winter is the gatekeeper. Rent is a terrible thing from time to time. It gives a lot of psychological fear. The film is not the easiest movie to understand or explain, but that makes it very fascinating.
