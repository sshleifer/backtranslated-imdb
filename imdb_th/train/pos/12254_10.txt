I used to watch this movie after watching the version of Paltrow. I found one very good and I thought it wouldn't be good ... but I'm wrong: the English version is better and fun! I found Jeremy Northam "agree" more than Mark Strong, but I can say that Strong has better captured Austen's Knightley. However, both versions are good. But everyone who loves Austen's books should watch this movie. I agree with * caalling *: Andrew Davies changed something But still honest with the original <br /> <br /> 10 from 10 <br /> <br /> My 2 cents!
