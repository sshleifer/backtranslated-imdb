In 1996, "101 Dalmatians" Cruella De Vil was a London Metropolitan Police. (God protected) to try to steal and kill 101 puppies - all Dalmatian covered with mud and hay. She spent the next 4 years in "cans". Released from prison I said that it was about 28 years - in the year of the dog !!!!! <br /> <br /> So in 2000, Disney decided to release the sequel to the classic classic action action movie. Successfully dubbed "102 Dalmatians" in that there are 102 Dalmatians added to the family (Oddball is the name I think I should know since this has recently appeared on TV recently) and puppies. No points !!!!! In addition, while Cruella (played by Glenn Close again) escapes again, she needs a bigger and better coat - made from puppies again !!!!! <br /> <br / > I especially like theme music - I'm sure everyone likes the song "Atomic Dog" from the 70s or more. And now we hear this little story in this movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> "102 Dalmatians" is a great movie that I'm still wondering - when will "DALMATIANS 103" ??? "Haha, <br /> <br /> 10 stars
