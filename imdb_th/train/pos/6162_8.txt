I like this masterpiece and, quite frankly, I find Mary Poppins (although I love Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyke) is stupid and sweet. Angela Lansbury plays the role of her character perfectly and I don't know Why do people think that this movie is distorted? It's great and fun to watch. Every scene has one charm when you know the characters better. You will see that this little family gathered together to learn how to bond with each other, despite the age and differences. I think the characters are well developed, especially Charles, which is at "Age of disbelief" Mary Poppins may be more popular and liked by others. But this gem is always something that I will love and cherish.
