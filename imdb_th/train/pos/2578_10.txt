Superman and Mole Men may be the most difficult adventure of Superman. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane and Clark Kent are sent to Silsby, the deepest oilfield in the world. At that time, there was a mole of radioactivity. Some people walked through an oil well and explored the city. Jeff Corey and other townspeople try to get rid of the invading mole. Can Superman change people's lifestyles in time to help the mole? Superman can warn people in time about the danger of radioactivity that a mole can bring or not. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Superman and Moles are movies that are intelligent and good. Although we have seen Superman fly once in a short time, but still makes the Superman adventure great. Must have for everyone <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars
