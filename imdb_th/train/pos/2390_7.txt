My 2 year old likes to show Doodlebops. He seems to be interested for a moment. The characters are interesting, bright with the main colors and all. There is not much educational content that the target audience can benefit. But it seems that they have individual themes and try to teach children about sharing and respect and other fundamentals. It is well produced and has a high production value. But actually it's just an average item like most programs on TV today. We do not buy in the corner of the product and let our son wear everything at Dooblebop. I do not think we will pay to watch live performances if they ever enter town. Going to a zoo or science center is a better experience for everyone involved and in my opinion is to spend better money.
