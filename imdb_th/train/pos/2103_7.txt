I do not know "Largo Winch" is a comic book. (Or is a graphic novel, actually I don't know) but I have to admit to hearing about the agent / hero movie. I expect something different. Than what I actually received. <br /> <br /> While it's shocking to see this thing at first You can't tell where it will go. (Some twists predictable But in general, you can't really say whether it will end or not). The show is more than a star from a leading actor and a very good actor. Acts that are not as packed as someone might hope or expect for such a movie But it's a really good ingredient
