How do I get through the opportunity to see Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger together? I can't do it, so I rented this movie. <br /> <br /> I have never heard Ned Kelly and amazed at what I discovered about the legend of this young man. I was pleasantly surprised that the film was moderate. Perhaps the fact that it was very slow and at the end of the 4-hour marathon movie, or maybe because it was a bit slow, I found this difficult to follow. Not because the story is complicated But because it's slow Despite having a slow story, Ledger and Bloom were able to create interesting dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> Even though I was struggling to recommend this thing to see, it was a wonderful story of Australian history (Considering that the child is this country, it is very rare and should be appreciated) and the movie has Good action sequence <br /> <br /> 6/10 See historical values ​​.... (Yes ... and that's the only reason to see it ...;)
