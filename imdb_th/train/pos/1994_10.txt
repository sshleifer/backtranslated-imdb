Oliver Twist must argue and succeed after Dickens published it in 1837. Pictures of his life in the slums of the city are shocking and new and the main character creation of the novel is The criminals are innovative. <br /> <br /> One day, he walked in London and passed the girl he was friendly with. He said hello. But she was quite stiff with him He didn't understand this. A few days later they met again and he asked what he had done to make her angry. "If you have to know, I don't like your final novel," she said. "Everyone actually thinks that," he puzzled: "Is there anything wrong with it?" "Oh Charles," she said. Jewish people, how do you create a character like Fagin? "He didn't expect this:" Well ... Do you know that the last year of Ikey Solomon, a bandit trainer, is a model of Fagin? And he is a Jew. "<br /> <br /> The ghost found that he had not settled." Yes, "she replied. Got what he deserved. But Charles, they didn't call him "Solomon the Jew "As you call Fajin," Jews "! In addition, Solomon did not plan murder. The ghost must admit that he may be taken away. He left his thoughts about what she said. <br /> <br /> Oliver Tweedy published in many editions. The ghost tried to improve on Fagin a bit. Then he had an idea. He adjusted Fagin's "Last Night Alive" chapter to show his fears when he faced hanging. He also added some additional details. <br /> <br /> He informed his female friend about the decision to change Fagin. The next day he found her at a friend's house. She looked at him as though he was crazy. "You don't like changes?" He asked. "What changes did Charles - he was also a vicious villain called" Jews "!" She replied. "Yes, I kept those things. But you do not see whether or not he is afraid of being in a prison cell. "The girl noticed this. But felt that he was so bad that he deserved such fear "Ah ... then I was right ... and did you see the little details I added?" He asked. What is it? "She replied." When you see Fagin for the first time, he is now making dinner himself ... Do you read that? "Dickens looked at what she expected to have a sign of recognition. The woman seemed confused. "I read him in the fireplace. But I have to read the story without missing. "Dickens smiled as though he was smart. "He cooked pork sausages for his dinner." "What!" She exclaimed. "He was eating my beloved pork ... Look - he's not a good Jew!" His friends looked at him shaking his head and Causing him to fear leaving the friend's house She has not spoken to him for many years. <br /> <br /> The ghost never shook his mania. But the situation has led to some attempts to correct in his last completed novel In our colleague (2408), he has a little character, Mr. Riah, which is used by unscrupulous landlords to collect high rents from poor tenants. The landlord thinks that Riah will be blamed because he is a Jew. <br /> <br /> But Mr Riah is a good person. He is very good. He is very good and very good - very good. Unbelievable. If Fagin saw Mr. Riah in practice, he might chase him out with wood. <br /> <br /> Fagin's anti-Semitic image. Still to this day It is a measure of Dickens' genius as a novelist who overcomes it. However, in presenting the story on the film, it still causes problems for screenwriters and directors: after the disaster, can we keep the novel's precious movie without causing upset? David Lean shows that Alec Guiness appeared in one or two scenes showing the human side and facing the crowd at the end with true dignity. Sir Carol Reed, in the musical version of the novel, did better due to the original script of the musical. <br /> <br /> Oliver was made into a hit song of the West End in the middle of the year. 1960 and then brought to Broadway where it was beaten again With an excellent score by Lionel Bart including "Food Glorious Food", "I'm reviewing the situation", "Considering myself", "Boy For Sale", "Who will buy", "As long as he Need me "It deserves it is success And Harry Secombe as Mr. Bumble. There is no major musical success in Hollywood for ten years - Lastly, the winner of the Best Picture Oscar was GIGI. In 1958, Oliver won in 1968. <br /> <br /> and Fagin - how to deal with eternity The problem of caricature? In the musical, Fagin was not arrested, tried and executed for the murder that occurred. In the end, even Lean showed that Fakien tried to control his allies in his actions, but here Fagin realized that he was too old to rely on this life. Although he lost his treasure (Those who steal because they know the value and appreciate their beauty) He decided to reform. He was allowed to do that along with the faithful followers, Artful Dodger. I don't think ghosts will appreciate the change. (His female friends may have) but modern audiences agree that it is appropriate.
