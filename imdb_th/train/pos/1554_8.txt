I saw this at the theater in the early 1970s. The most memorable and scary scene was when the German army attacked with yellow mustard for the first time. The Germans and their horses were covered from head to toe (or hooves) with a creepy protective suit. British soldiers with experience wearing gas masks (only) and waiting for gas clouds and German attackers again The gas clouds move in as close as possible. The Germans stepped forward slowly, dangerously in a scary look. Suddenly, a scream from the guardian ... This kind of gas was not like they had experienced before ... <br /> <br /> Now you know why I remember this scene during 30 years ago and still Shiver, I think you will too!
