The main problem I saw in this movie was its score, which shouted with notes every time. "This is a cheap movie." There is nothing to say here again. <br /> <br /> The second problem, which I see is quite severe, as well as related to solving the plan near the end of the film. (One of the money shots if you will) is a dialogue between Martha. (Adrienne Barbab) and Sunflower Man (Richard Seaman), whose Martha is revealed to be the leader of the experiment Throughout this conversation, the audience realized that he / she was listening to the movie dialogue. In other words, suppressing disbelief will stop here. The integrity of the credible dialogue between the two people has been sacrificed to contain the information that the film producer wants to present to the audience. <br /> <br /> The third problem is Adrian's selection. Barb While I sincerely believe that she will be a great actor within her work, I feel that this part may be stretched too. The main point of her performance that doesn't seem to be considered is the spectrum in which the character moves through the film from the beloved mother of a family that has problems to a woman who looks like Rambo almost on a mission. Obviously, this chapter has a character that is stretched out for one actress and cannot be blamed very much with Barbeau at the level that she has done her duty properly. However, I will call it a serious problem. At a moderate level for the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film works great in the first half. Is a creep factor, especially during the horror movie flashes I feel that this film will benefit from the commitment to flash these more as a mechanism to prevent the trance of the creep factor in the second half of the movie. <br /> <br /> So what? My holistic story, this piece? I will give C + and B-heavily, depending on how much credit you have for the producer to make this film with a limited budget, even though there are two serious problems and two moderate problems. But this film has also been plotted on the stable plot of the Jungian side of Nazi mysticism. I don't see any problems with plot development or coherence; The dialogue with the exceptions mentioned above is excellent, especially the important keystone scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the movie. As mentioned above, the creep factor was well built if the second half was very dazed. And Nicholas Brendan related to the production also delivered a great performance. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is definitely worth seeing - see with the Nazis. you love :)
