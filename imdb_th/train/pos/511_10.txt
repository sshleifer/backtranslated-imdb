I watched this movie for the first time almost 21 years ago when it was ITV. (Before the date of cable and satellite) Matinee I left the school with mumps and I was wrapped in a whole film. I have it in a video that has been purchased for about 10 years and I want to get a DVD copy of it. David Niven is my favorite actor all the time and I think it is a imitation that he has watched many times over the time. Come in I also think that the queen should be his knight as he did it for the film industry easily. If not more than Sean Connery or Anthony Hopkins, the way the film turns from black and white to color and back again and again The film has starring actors such as Roger Livesy, Marius Goring and first appearances from Richard Attenborough.
