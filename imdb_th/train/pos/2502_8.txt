This movie surprised me! Never heard of Hyde of Gackt. I didn't expect much! The reason I wanted to watch this movie is because someone said that this movie has serious action scenes in John Woo style! Normally I will be very careful when claiming this! Only John Woo alone, and to this day, no director has approached his abilities when it comes to action! The fact that "Moon Child" will make vampires more confident! How can you go wrong with the blazing vampires! Sounds promising and interesting! The first thing I noticed about this movie was that the rhythm was very slow! Need time to set the mood! This movie has a good Hong Kong action scene! But "Moon Child" is not an action movie! It's a drama about friendship and loyalty! Focus on the characters and their relationships! Pop singer Hyde and Gackt work well in acting and believe as friends! The only problem I have is the plot! A couple of times, the movie seems to skip a few years without explaining what happened and why they crossed! Example: When a member of the gang dies (A very remarkable moment) Alexander Wang saw Kei (Hyde) drinking the blood of an attacker! Without warning and the description of this movie across 9 years and most friends do not live together anymore! Also, there is no reasonable reason for his son (Alexander Wang) and Sho (Gackt) to kill each other! I know it's done to add serious drama! Because the actors are very effective But sometimes it feels forced! In addition to the shortcomings in the story, this movie has an atmosphere and slippery that doesn't like this movie! It's hard to explain why this movie is fantastic! But it's just! The overall experience you get is warm and sincere!
