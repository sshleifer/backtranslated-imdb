Do not expect to see images of "truth". However, accounts of veterans from the Iraq war and Afghanistan need careful consideration. <br /> <br /> The main strength of this film is that it clearly shows the words. Speak and wounds in the war of these vets and their post-war struggle to create a normal level. <br /> <br /> My important reviews Of the film is twofold: it is one-sided and it supports anti-war activities We have to suffer and still suffer from war. These things are not a serious flaw in the movie. <br /> <br /> I know that the aftermath of this terrible war is real, and these young men and women clearly show. These veterinarians describe the physical and mental pain and suffering that most veterans suffer and the general public must understand because the horrors of all wars are painful and annoying.
