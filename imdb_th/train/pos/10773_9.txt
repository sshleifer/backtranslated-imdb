I would like to recommend this movie to everyone, not just with the fans of Luciano Ligabue, a rocker. But including all movie lovers Because sincere, funny and true because Ligabue is a storyteller who is born and loves movies and every frame of his film is created with love and attention. Because his character is loved and asked to be loved Because most of the Italian debut movies are lousy, and this story is made by outsiders so it is a real pleasure to watch and listen because Stefano Accorsi is beautiful and reminds me of Andrea Pazienza who is like Freccia and beautiful Capable and good and died because of heroin. Ligabue shows that it is not outstanding and ugly without good morals Because it is a movie that speaks to the heart, our ears, our souls And because I rely on the experience of FM radio and it is like that. Thank you Luciano!
