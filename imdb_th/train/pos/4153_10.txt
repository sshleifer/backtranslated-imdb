This is a great episode. I saw clips from YouTube and I swear that I should show on TV. I will glued myself to the scene to see. I'm sorry to see it with one of my friends who is gay and the two of us cry at the end. This is a really heartfelt episode of the forbidden love between the two policemen that I felt was really (in Coop's words) "lucky". In the CBS, I waited anxiously and called "Forever Blue" again because I would watch again and again.
