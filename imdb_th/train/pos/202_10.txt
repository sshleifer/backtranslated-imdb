A Give this movie 10/10 because it deserves 10/10. Two best actors of Walter Mattwater and George Burns together with Neil Simon and other actors. In the film + director Herbert Ross, Sunshine Boys is one of the best movies of the 70s. I like humor in this movie. It makes me laugh so hard. <br /> <br /> I received this movie in VHS 3 days ago (yes Then VHS because it's only 3 dollars cheaper) I watched it as soon as I got home But I have to watch again because I lost a few times at the first time The second time I watched it felt a lot better and I laughed more. Of course, I will get this DVD again because I have to watch the special features. <br /> <br /> It's very funny to happen. Two people work together as actors / actors / actors. They get along well on stage. But really arguing on the stage, they can't survive for another minute. After that, 15 years later, you want to gather them to watch a special TV program. You can find it in this film. Matthau & Burns is great in this movie. It's a shame that they die. George Burns deserves that Oscar. He gave a strong comic performance. He was 78 years old when this movie was filmed. Until now, he was the oldest actor to receive an education award at an early age. Jessica Tandy broke the record as the oldest actress. Richard Benjamin is also great in this matter. He received the Golden Globe Award for the best actor. He deserves that golden world. Although many people may not agree with what I'm saying But everyone in this movie has a strong performance. This comedy is an instant classic. I highly recommend Another thing: Anyone who hates this movie is "Putz"
