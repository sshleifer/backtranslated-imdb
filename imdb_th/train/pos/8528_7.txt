I like Peter Sellers for the most part. I have never seen him draw a top-class picture until this movie. He pulled it out quite well, even if you saw a bit of Clouseau's inspector in the mixture. It's not interesting until Goldie Hawn arrives. <br /> <br /> I never expected that Hawn, the younger, would show the performance that Excellent like this Her time is very good and her expression has no value. The way she photographed the seller alternately and made him look attractive Just like the words I didn't see in this movie. At that time, <br /> The last thirty minutes of this movie were flat. It's worth going down just to see the first sixty. Hawk bare in a few seconds before glorious enjoy it...
