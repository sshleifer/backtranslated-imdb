What I like about the adaptations on the screen of The Stone Angel is that it is still true for the novel! Great movie! As an avid reader, I found that the worst thing about movie adaptation is a book that has lost its way. You can tell that the Stone Angel team is careful not to make this happen. Ellen Bertin is an excellent selection for the role of Hagar and she is definitely a movie star. However, I think Canadian actresses (Christine Horn) chose to play Hagar. In her childhood, she was able to do a great job which was guaranteed to receive a lot of praise. I have never seen Horne's previous work before, but I will find it out after seeing her Stone Angel performance. <br /> <br /> I heard the opening act of Canada's The Stone Angel in Spring or summer 2008, I can't wait to see it on the big screen again!
