"October Sky" is a movie that will steal your heart, fill your mind with bright images and raise your spirit. Homer Hickham's story and his dream of creating a rocket are simple at first, especially when the film is located in a mining town where the future is clear as a coal in mine But Homer can't follow his father's footsteps With the support of Miss Riley (Friendly teacher) The staff members of his father and friend Homer try to make his dream come true. <br /> <br /> But like the real life story there. There are many stops along the way. Director Joe Johnston helped us into the coal mines where we witness the fate of the workers who fell under the stone ceiling. With a hat with lights and gestures that bend, they resemble aliens rather than humans in darkness. The hacked cough of the miners and the dark face is a reminder of the dangers that the workers have to face in their work. <br /> <br /> The troubling burden of mine shafts is a picture Homer and friend's rocket Under the blue sky, the rocket will be placed on the plate and launched in the stratosphere ... and nothing can match the scene when Homer sees Sputnik for the first time. > <br /> But what makes this movie Love is the relationship between the characters. Homer's father is a classic hard man ... but he has a soft side as well. We saw that he loved his son despite many arguments. Miss Riley's love and support is also evident. Above all, the film was uncomfortable. It doesn't bind everything with a beautiful bow. It makes you tears. It makes the air of reality that is important in this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is considered a complete work. At first I was disappointed that this film didn't carry Homer's life. I don't want it to end. Then I realized that ... that is what a good movie does for people. If it works successfully, you won't want it to end and "October Sky" is done.
