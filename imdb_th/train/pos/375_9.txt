This is one of the most moving movies I've ever seen. I am about 12 years old when I watch it for the first time and whenever there is a TV, my eyes will be caught. Amazing performances and plot It seems true to reality and experience many controversial topics. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama.
