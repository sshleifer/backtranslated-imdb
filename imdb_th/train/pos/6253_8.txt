This movie is very good. As often heard, it is very true and sometimes cruel, but unlike other people, it is obvious that I do not see it as depressing, rejecting or dismantling Austria as a proto-fascist society. While there are some very heavy scenes in HUNDSTAGE and some characters are called very bad people at the same time, you see the love, beauty and humor in the movie Ul. rich Seidls and that's what makes HUNDSTAGE different for me from other films that try to show the life of 'ordinary people' in a rich and realistic way Hustle, desire, darkness: Seidl never tried to prove that the life of the working class is a waste! In my opinion, the audience who came to this conclusion seemed to be very scared to admit that almost nobody lives to 'clean' and 'normal' as we want others to believe. And every life has darkness and often falls on the side of the most beautiful scene: an old Viennese man looks at his dancing girl in an oriental way while he is calling it I think everyone who finds this scene is ugly, lacking beauty and should ask themselves what it is. That is proto-fascism: the characters in the HUNDSTAGE or the audience closed by the body of the 70 year old woman With dancing All her charms for her lover
