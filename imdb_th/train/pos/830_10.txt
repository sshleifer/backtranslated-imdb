I didn't expect much with the movie. But I think it's great. Pierce Brosnan has a very distinct role. He left the Armani suit to look ridiculous and show that he is a great actor. Pierce and Greg Kinner show each other great songs and create the best partner for a long time. That humor is dark. The performances by Brosnan Kinear and Hope Davis are great, combined with the elements that touch stories about friendship and you have a great movie. This may be one of the best friend comedies in a long time. This is a film that certainly shows that we can expect great things in the post-Brosnan career.
