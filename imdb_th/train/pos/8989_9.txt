Anton Newcombe and Courtney Taylor are friends. They are both leaders in their own groups. Anton and The Brian Jonestown Massacre and Courtney and The Dandy Warhols. The interesting thing about their friendship is they are competitors It's love that hates relationships. Sometimes you both hear them admiring each other. But a second later they complained that they were stupid and obsessed with themselves, while Dandy Warhols achieved commercial success. BJM remained stuck in the underground scene. And for good reason why <br /> <br /> Dig! There is more to Anton and BJM because there are more substances. They are the most unusual band. During the gigs, they will fight and beat each other. Anton will attack other members if he feels that they play incorrectly. With the amount of alcohol they consume, the fight is always waiting to happen. You know that people go to race to see how a large car crash occurs. That's why people go to their gigs to fight. <br /> <br /> Anthony is not stable. Always thinking of himself as a Messiah, he wants to change music and create a revolution. But he never left the underground He is a very talented musician. It is amazing that there are many instruments that he can play and have such abilities. But his draw is that he cannot escape the world he created Prolific musicians are caught in drugs, black holes, alcohol and depression. On the other side, Dandy Warhols is experiencing his own problems. They were not very successful with their first album and continued to fight with their music labels. But they found great success in Europe But Courtney is still sucked back into Anton's world. It's interesting that both Anton and Courtney have things they need. Courtney wants to have a musical talent like Anton, although Anton won't speak. But he wants a commercial success that Dandy has to revolutionize. <br /> <br /> Throughout the seven years that the movie team pursued These two bands have many clips. Never had a dull moment in Dig! It is moving all the time because it has no time to slow down as much as it has to be said. The seven-year storytelling in 1 hour 45 minutes is a hard work. The best music documentary that always makes you want more. Even if you don't like the band, it's still worthy to watch. It transcends music that will reveal the great story of successful failure. <br /> <br /> You won't be disappointed.
