Some spoilers, if you're a big horror fan, you'll know that Halloween paved the way for many slasher movies. Often uniquely imitated, this movie is a really classic horror movie and one of the most scary movies ever, if not a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie. This story really doesn't ask me why.) I watched 7 other movies before seeing this. That's how it works. But I must say that this one blows all others It's truly scary and seeing Michael emerging from behind the bush or walking around in darkness will send your spine to cool down. The part I liked in this movie was when Michael stabbed a man and leaned on one side. It is one of the most eeriest images in movie history. <br /> <br /> Later slashers, such as Friday the 13th movie, are more fun and less intense than this movie. I like the F13 series better than the Halloween series. But this movie is only better than all F13 movies. Michael Myers is a horrible villain because he is real. You can imagine a crazy guy like he is killing people. I admit that this movie made me a nightmare after watching it for a few nights. <br /> <br /> The wonderful thing about this movie is that it doesn't depend on blood or humor to entertain. With the audience It's just pure fear. It is terrible that the next movie will be released from this movie, because this is a good example of an amazing slasher movie trailer when they arrive.
