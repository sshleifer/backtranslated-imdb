Director Sam Fuller has something to follow, especially in Europe. But his films are too many to forget However, he directed one of the best movies in "Pickup on South Street", created from the beginning of his career. The movie that followed was extremely inferior. <br /> <br /> From the first to the last frame, "Pickup" is available. With all levels It was filmed with flawless motion. Richard Widmark and Thelma Ritter, both players with excellent acting statistics, were at their highest point. Widmark, which is not a stranger in bad character while meaningful. To the true essence still able to reveal only a little humanity that makes his character charming. Br> Fuller does not have to punch in this strong movie There is a scene where Jean Peters is groaned by Widmark. It is truly shocking in reality. This is not the case of carefully designed photography. <br /> <br /> The less consciousness of Noir's films in this era is a good example of the movie genre.
