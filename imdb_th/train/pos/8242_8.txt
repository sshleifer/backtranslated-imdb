I watched FIDO on some movie channels and have to say I'm a big fan. This film feels like a comic book that perfectly captures the image of the 1950s. You know that a good decade when they dance with Elvis while dropping nuclear bombs in the desert. People were innocent at that time that it was scary and the idea that the clean cut would find it normal to have zombies as pets. Actually, here <br /> <br /> Glory Great actors include Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Henry Czerny and children. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that this movie is not very popular. It deserves more recognition. It's better than Tim Burton or the Sean of the Dead team. Oh, well, it's a classic right away.
