And another South Park came to an end Now it's not as strong as I hoped for, but the Night of the Living Homeless is a finisher that is stronger than Stanley, Tsst, Bloody Mary or Erection Day. It still can't hold candles for Woodland Critter Christmas and Goobacks, but not How many episodes <br /> <br /> The night of living in homelessness is a spoof of the type of zombies. Instead of being a flesh-eating zombie, a homeless entity that has changed and seems to have survived. <br /> <br /> Randy and the other residents were trapped in the Community Center, although this time they were on the roof exploring the scene, especially funny moments when one member discovered that his house had disappeared and became a person. Homeless. Let Randy have no choice but to shoot him. <br /> <br /> At the same time, four boys set out to solve the problem. The whole story behind the homeless revolutionary attempts to communicate. But did not receive serious attention South Park is the best place many times when it's ridiculous. Matt and the points played safely this week and didn't really criticize the problem of homeless people. Just taunting <br /> <br /> The shocking moment of this happens when scientists shoot themselves to try to avoid. Avoiding homeless people. This is the first time that Suicide in South Park has crashed and we watched the poor think of his brain and tried to shoot himself several times while he died painfully. One more moment of South Park that has been inspired. <br /> <br /> Overall, now is a joke. But it was prevented from being a great person by suppressing real opinions about the homeless and clinging to zombies The ending is quite funny. But nothing new. <br /> <br /> Now we have to wait until October to see the next episode. It's a long distance But South Park had to be applauded because it ran It seems that the program will run out last season. But now has come back fully
