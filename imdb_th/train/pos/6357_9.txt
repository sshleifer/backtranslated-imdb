I found this to be an entertaining little child movie that is suitable for adults with a lot of humor and humor that they will understand. Some things are not suitable for small but little ones. Othewise, "The Grinch" (Jim Carrey) breaks many jokes that you can't follow them all, from sex to culture to the inner circle - Hollywood. Lee to the skin <br /> <br /> Look good on the little girl's DVD here. "Cindy Lou Who" (Taylor Momsen) is really cute and the little hairstyle and hairstyle here. Enjoy Seeing Anthony Hopkins's voice is also a favorite. That his storytelling continues to elevate the film His music is fun to hear. <br /> <br /> I saw this in the cinema, although it was "fair" but on the DVD it was much better. I've seen it three times, and it's better each time.
