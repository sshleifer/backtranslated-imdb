Eddie Murphy Delirious is the most fun thing you have ever seen in your life. You can compare it to any movie and I'm happy that you decide that Delirious is the most fun movie ever! This movie takes about 1 hour 45 minutes and all the time there was a time that I didn't laugh. You will laugh for hours after it ends. Repeatedly punching in your head over and over again. Eddie Murphy has performed many comedies in his career (48 hrs., Trading places, Beverly Hills Cop, Raw, is about Come to America, Teacher Nutty, Shrek, etc.) But this is his most important moment. I have watched this movie many times and it is more fun every time. Never lose the edge From now on, every outstanding performance will be copied from Delirious ***** and two thumbs up!
