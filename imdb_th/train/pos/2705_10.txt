This is the script that Ed Wood has worked for over 10 years in trying to make Aris Iliopulos. Finally, chutzpah came to film the script that Wood saved from burning his house with other expenses that have a temporary value. br /> <br /> This is a movie that has no dialogue. In fact, it is a very noisy movie without having to talk crazy about most movies. In the hands of these filmmakers, the music and sound effects provide a perfect sound experience that works better than most Hollywood script mills, especially the stupid Billy Zen movie. The most in the movie 'Beware'! ! - J. Cameron .... ick ...) I will use Zane's distinctive roar in this movie in an empty conversation every day. <br /> <br /> Billy Zane is the leader. The team of the players is obvious. Really want to be in this movie Richie is as bright as ever, and the gods will shine when you can put Sandra Bernhard, Rick (y) Schroeder, Eartha Kitt and Andrew McCarthy into the same poster. <br /> <br /> Complete design. Pyramid The excellent settings and performance of Ron Pearlman are excellent animals. Overall, this is a busy masterpiece and about the internal organs that are created with love from fans of Ed Wood, Jr., director and cinematographer. Must see for everyone who loves movies like Iliopulos and his actors do. Movies that will make you hope you do it yourself
