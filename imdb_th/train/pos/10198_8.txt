I am grateful to Cesar Montano and his team for the revival of the Visayan film that had never happened before. "Panaghoy" hopes to be a pioneer of resurrection in this native language. (Which claims to have more speakers than Tagalog). The language and life details are precisely reminiscent of the Philippine region. Disadvantages: Repetition and arrogance of American enemies Another item that I didn't appreciate was the lack of accuracy in the "period" of the same character and, above all, his bright red kit car kit that I thought would be passed for the driver. Era car If none of those little details, "Panaghoy" seems to be 9 in 10, at least in my rating - daghang salamat, Manoy Cesar! Appendix: This film is sure to win "Oro, Plata, Mata" of Peque Gallaga, which gives a different view of the Visayas during World War II. In addition, there are some parts that the movie returns again with Spielberg's "The Color Purple" and the story begins to become a memory of "Noli Me Tangere".
