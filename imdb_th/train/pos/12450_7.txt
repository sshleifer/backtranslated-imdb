Rent and watch this short event (<90 minutes). It is the best treatment that Modesty has received from the film - and the creator Peter Donnell, her creator, agreed to participate as The characters and me, dear, she is managed with respect to the direction of Spiegel. The best that he has done to date and the casting is very good. Alexander Rastaden is almost perfect in the whole body compared to Modesty's original image of Jim Holdaway. A great discovery from anyone who handsome her! Raymond Cruz, as a child, Raphael Garcia is great as well. I hope Tarantino & co will continue to make more series - I'm especially interested in seeing what they want to be. Willie Garvin who is comparable to anyone!
