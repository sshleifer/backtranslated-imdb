I must say that Clive Barker's Undying is the best horror game ever. I have played Resident Evil, Silent Hill and Evil Dead and Castlevania, but nobody in them has captured the pure joy that this game practiced. Barker is good at what he does, which is attached to horror in our world, and it shows that his hand is clear everywhere. In this game, Heck's voice is still in the game as one of the main characters. Full of lush images and an atmosphere that is enough to shake up the game. Undying is a game that has been overcome in my book as the best horror story. I just hope this makes it a console system. But the PC sales are not good enough to reduce sales
