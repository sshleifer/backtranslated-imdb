This is the ultimate Barbara Stanwick, a double bill in one sheet. The first film - and believe me less than both - MGM's "To Please A Lady" (1950), which she paired with Clark Gable. Basically, it is a gable star vehicle that normally dominates the movie by having a face. His screen Here he played a male racer who was pressured by women's journalist Stanwyck and the female fight began. Of course, after their worries, they eventually ended up with each other's arms and everything came close and predictable. A bit of real movement, but Gable and Stanwyck - two icons of the Golden Age - make it look! <br /> <br /> But the real texture on this DVD is the second feature - amazing and not known. A little thriller called JEOPARDY, produced by MGM in 1953. This is a wonderful little gem of a movie that isn't dated a little! Here Stanwyck plays Barry Sullivan's wife and mother of Lee Aaker's son on a desolate and distant Mexican beach vacation when a sudden tragedy occurs. The dilapidated wooden pier collapsed, trapping Sullivan under a heavy pole and guessing what? Yes, the tide is coming, there is no spirit in the eyes and can not release him by himself. Stanwyck drives out for help. After driving far away, the only help she could collect was from unscrupulous prisoners. (Ralph Mecker), the assistant in return - wants more from her than money or change clothes ("I will do anything to save my husband") She or she? <br /> <br /> Meeker runs with the picture! He changed the performance very well! When he comes into the movie, you can't take his eyes away! Actor in the Brando style at the prison, he never did much in his career. Although he gave a great acting offensive to the dignified cavalry officer in Mann / Stewart, who had a distinctive Western "Naked Spur" (1953) and was one of the French soldiers who sacrificed in the WW1 drama. The glorious "Stanley Kubrick's" claim to true reputation is Mike Hammer in Mickey Spillane's "Kiss Me Deadly" in 1955. His performance in "Jeopardy" should do wonders for him. But he has a career in movies only He died in 1988. <br /> <br /> Because of the release of "Jeopardy" now can happen proudly as a classical musician. A memorable and thrilling thriller, thanks to a good performance, the tight direction of John Sturges, the brilliant Monochrome Cinematography movie of Victor Milner and the special atmospheric score of Dimitri Tiomkin. And trailers for both movies. <br /> <br /> This disc is part of the Barbara Stanwyck box set to celebrate her centenary. It's hard to believe that the woman is over 100 years old if she is still nearby. <br /> <br /> JEOPARDY - MGM winner!
