Not at the same level as the ring (or ring 2), but still a good horror movie of Japan. I hope the North American horror movie maker will take the lead out of the Japanese horror template and place it. More 'horror' and less bumps in their flicks Many good examples in this scene, the scene in which a white face is staring at the back, the actress, a photo on the wall, has a smile, just one second Should check which type you like
