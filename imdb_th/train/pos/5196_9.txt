Human Tornado (1976) is a better movie in many ways. The director knows what he has to work with and responds to Rudy Ray Moore's limitations as an actor. It's a fun movie that gives more sound and shows more technical. The actors are not too serious and it seems that everyone is now in a joke and going on the stream. Rudy Ray Moore seems more relaxed in front of the camera and is not as solid as he is in Dolemite. <br /> <br /> I am very happy with this movie and I highly recommend it. As with his first film, it received a response to some audiences. (I doubt very much that Moore tried to expand his target group at this point in his career.) Try it out. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
