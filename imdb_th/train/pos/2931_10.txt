Eddie Murphy is undoubtedly the most fun thing I've ever seen in my life. When I saw it for the first time about 2 years ago, I was sewn for several weeks after that. Up to the day I saw it again 17 times and I still laughed every time. For those who do not know, Eddie Murphy is a great comedian before he is a Hollywood star. There is no boring point in this genius, which is different from Eddie Murphy Raw, which was launched in 1987, which is flat between the middle. If you are not a person who cannot swear by oath, I do not recommend you to watch because you may hear some swearing words every 5-10 seconds. All of them in his best time
