I think it's not bad. Not a great art, but Dermot M is a stronger actor than before. Patricia Arquette takes too much time. In fact, he played cello, which was very impressive and his stripes were never forced. In addition, he is also incredibly sexy, really sexy, adding that to his abilities and what he gets is more patience. He always gave everything, even if some of the projects he was involved in would not get the highest score. He, unfortunately, was in some strange movies that didn't reflect at the box office. Always with the actors, but not always "hits", but he is "worth every penny" of DVDs that are rented or purchased. See the wedding day with Debra Messing - one of his best overall movies. Worth every place! ;) (If you haven't seen it yet, you will understand that!)
