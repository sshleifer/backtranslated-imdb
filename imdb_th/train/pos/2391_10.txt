My husband and I enjoy the DoodleBops as much as our kids are 8 months old. We buy DVDs and CDs for him so we can watch and listen to them. They are fun, powerful and fun. They encourage children to be enthusiastic, share and care. They often have positive messages along with entertaining entertainment. Every time our son hears a song, he turns his head to the TV quickly and starts to rebound with excitement. Well, it's a great singer. She has a very good voice. Mo is a great dancer. I will recommend The DoodleBops to everyone who has children. Our favorite songs are bird songs. You can't help But smiled and wanted to dance when you heard it
