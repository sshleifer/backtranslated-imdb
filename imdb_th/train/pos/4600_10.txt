This is a sad story that this movie is ranked at least, should be in the top 250 of the movie here. This is the best action movie ever. Action movies today do not work well. Actors and action directors do not do fighting methods and show proper strategies. Only some people do not do so, mostly from Hong Kong, such as Jackie Chan. The acrobatics are clever and fierce. I don't think we can see what I like. The beginning of Chan and his team chasing cars on the hill through the city is amazing. The final battle tactics for me are the best stunts I've ever shot. The stunt at the end slid down the pole, slammed through the glass. Jackie was seriously wounded.
