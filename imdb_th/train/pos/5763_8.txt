<br /> <br /> I have to admit to enjoying bad movies. I love them. I watch them all. Especially horror My friends and I all gathered together after a week at school and at work, renting tapes, ordering crazy pizza and bombs. One of the things that we received from Hollywood Video is this Zombie Bloodbath. This box has a great box, so I expect less than usual. <br /> <br /> Stories about housing projects built over nuclear power plants. With a basement above the ground and others. The basement is easily covered Residents of this neighborhood found extensive facilities when some children fell into a hole in the cave. This causes some zombies to disappear. <br /> <br /> From this point, it's a big city. Blood effects and actions never stop until they run out of credits. <br /> <br /> Ok, it's not great art in the evening. In fact, it's one of the best "party tapes". That I had enjoyed watching And you can tell that it's done without money with crazy people. There are hundreds of zombies and the director looks like Brendan Frazer (he has a pendant) and it's a wild trip.
