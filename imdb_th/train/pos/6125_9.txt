Okay, this is what I think about Jack Frost. I looked at the box morphing for the VHS tape and I thought to myself this thing looks interesting. I rented it and brought me home. The boy was me. It's interesting. They put a continuous killer spirit in the dream in the body, walking and inside the machine every day. But this must be the most unique place to make the souls of serial killers Inside the snowman figure I like the friendly snowman pictures, landscapes, pot holders, snow globes, and more. I like actors playing Jack. He brings fun to the killer that hasn't seen since FREDDY KRUGGER. Daddy, it's a "cool" level. I hope that some puppet effects will improve. Mouth movements can get better. But I chalk at a small budget Actors perform great work, have torpedoes and are afraid to make fans horror hardcore. All and all are great stories, great effects, great conversations and excellent actors. I gave Jack Frost ... 9 stars
