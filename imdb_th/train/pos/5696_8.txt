What do you do with 14-inch porn stars that are related to drugs and murder and die of AIDS? You definitely create a movie. The possible reason why it was not done earlier is the fact that Eddie Nash seems to be involved in production. So it's not a coincidence that this movie was created only a moment after Nash was sent to prison. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is the fast pace. There is no time lost with unnecessary shit. Why? There are too many good materials here to want boring scenes, good actors. Kilmer is a normal person in many movies, so eventually this has a proper role for him. Bosworth is so cute, so it's not related to her actions (she's hard) and McDermott, which is quite annoying. Quite good, quite big because he put on my face so much that I can't remember him at first (I hope they will do that with every movie cruise so I don't have to look at my stupid faces.) I can't remember Christina Applegate fully and won't know you if I don't see the name. At the end of her credit, Kudrow is charming. As always, it's strange to see her in an amazing role (Btw, "Friends" is the worst sitcom TV of all time). Is Carrie Fischer, who was in the early and near 90s. Moron Janeane Garofalo, do you think I will include Paris Hilton, right? I think Hilton is the ideal choice for her 10 second appearance. Like a stupid whore Because movies about degradation above all else ?? And about porn actors ?? She is perfectly compatible.
