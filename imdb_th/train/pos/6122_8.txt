This movie is absolutely hilarious. Essentially, the plot revolves around a serial killer who has been transformed into a snowman through a chemical accident in the movie B. He then heads to the city and begins to scare people in the area. It is up to the local police chief and other characters to try to stop him. It's done in a small budget and it certainly shows. But the great thing about this movie is that it knows that it's garbage. The refinement of Styrofoam and styrene imitate the snowman, the giant killer is a classic story, and this is a clear intention - one of the few issues with the budget as the main selling point. In addition to comedy in the comics, there are still many funny moments, waiting to hear the sound from the time when his father was afraid of his child until death and the most fun rape scene ever filmed. Fun without tastes is great.
