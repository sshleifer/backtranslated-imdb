Is the best Estonian movie I've ever seen, even though it was created by Finnish director Ilkka Järvi-Laturi. Tallin Pimeduses is a fun thriller about gangsters trying to steal a lot of gold, which is a treasure of The nation of the Republic of Estonia But at the same time, it was a summary of the conditions of many Eastern European countries at that time. In the early 1990s, the Soviet Union fell apart, and many countries, such as Estonia, became independent. Now conditions may improve in most countries. But at the beginning of the 90s, many new countries had to fight the corruption and crimes that the Soviet era had left them as heritage. (And many people still do ... at least at some level ...) <br /> <br /> Tallinn is a very realistic movie of that era with reliable characters and scripts. Well written The actor is also very good, especially JüriJärvet. (Probably the best known Estonian actor playing the role of Tarkovski's Solaraut Snaut) But the most surprising performance came from Monika Mäger, a child actor who played Terje, a young girl in her early childhood. (And her name is not mentioned in the credit list!) W <br /> <br /> There are a few movies in the world that manage to be entertainment and art at the same time, but Tallinn Pimeduses did so. Other of Järvi-Laturi Uneasy is far from his first success. Kotia päin is too invented and his history at night is just a strange matter.
