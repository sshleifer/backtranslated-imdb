Cold weather on December 28, 1986, two children, 14 years old, bored to hire movies. "Hmmm. The police look interesting.", "Who is this Jackie Chan?" From the violent bag from the collection of JC movies!) This film still grabs me like no other. Ok, maybe I have a weakness because it's my "first" (Cannonball Run, not counting !!) JC movie. It contains JC Classic elements, action, humor, action, heart and action! Some reviews say it dated, it was created in 1985. Of course, it dated! But then must Jaws, Casablanca, Singin 'in the rain and godfather !!!!!! If there is no movie like Police Story today, where is the Hollywood show? Many standard PS sets have been stolen in other movies. If you really want to admire it, you will have to watch it on a wide screen. You miss more movies. (Yes, he falls from the bus to the corner!) If you haven't watched this movie now !!!! <br /> <br />
