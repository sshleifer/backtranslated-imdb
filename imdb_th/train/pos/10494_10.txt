Great view of an old woman who is losing everything. (Even a mortgage user) The way she participates in a special "business", the innocence and true love that exists between people in a small town. Light and funny I can't stop laughing with the funny scenes of two old women in a pharmacy. <br /> <br /> I love European movies and this kind of movie makes my opinion stronger. The movie I recommend when closing my eyes in this same category is Waking Ned Devine. <br /> <br /> Saving Grace is a funny movie that many friends like. You'll love it.
