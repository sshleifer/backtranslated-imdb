It's been a favorite since I was 14 years old. I didn't watch it many times a year, but ... This is not a movie for an older generation that needs a deeper meaning This movie is fun. It's quite old-fashioned, but Parker Posey is fantastic. If you want to be fascinated by the 90s breakfast at Tiffany's, join 90's raves or love Parker. This movie is for you. Otherwise, don't worry.
