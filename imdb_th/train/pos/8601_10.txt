My observation: The vamp dress at the end is attractive and wonderful. Exotic and wonderful. Jeanette is well dressed and even innocent. The boat crashed into his balcony. His female mafia costume is well designed, especially according to current standards. Costume designer in 1942 did very well. The theme of the main song was lovely. <br /> <br /> Caution for negative posters: 1942 is the time of WW II; Pearl Harbor occurred last year. The United States recently left the Great Depression. Need to leave and spend rare money from singing, dancing and wonderful fantasy. Dictatorial dictators are trying to rule out RL, extinguish freedom. Thank God that people have plot films. These amazing stories come together to listen. Going to see a movie is a special matter in a depressed moment. When your negative posters become actors or movie stars, you have space to talk and criticize Jeanette and Nelson's movies. It's a test of time. <br /> <br /> Angel wings are great in fairies The real RL wing at the party is not very hot. But excellent in Jeanette when considering SL. <br /> <br /> Beautiful singing by Jeanette and Nelson. As always, Jeanette's dance is true happiness. <br /> <br /> 15/10
