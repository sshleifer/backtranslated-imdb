Does anyone know what type of pickup truck John T is driving? I look like Ford in the mid to late 70s. This movie is my favorite as well as my wife. It is the first movie we remember as a married couple. The pickup truck is interesting because it is similar to the first truck I drive and recently found another car. I want to recover the pickup that I have to resemble in the movie. The song was excellent and the performance was excellent. A woman who shows John's aunt's picture where and where John had stunts for the tower scene when he almost fell down as well? In addition, the year that Mustang drove Debra W. in this program as well. Looks like the model of the 60s. Thank you.
