I have never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before. But I have a Shakespeare book with me and can follow the conversation through it. My perspective about movies may have some prejudice because I have never read the drama before. But I was drawn into the understanding of this film Shakespeare is one of the best writers that has never been seen before, and Hamlet's story is one of his best achievements. I found that every actor in the movie had a strong understanding of what they said and made it possible to speak quite well. Leonardo in Romeo and Juliet is nothing compared to Kenneth Branagh and the King. What I like about this is that it works very well as "MOVIE" and not the drama you are studying. You don't have to be rich with Shakespeare to be involved in the small village of misery. I would like to recommend this movie to a large audience. <br /> <br /> That is my two cents.
