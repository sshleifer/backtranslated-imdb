This movie may not make the Catholic Church the best. But is telling stories from real events Unfortunately, not everything in life, including all religions But good and cheerful Sometimes people and groups do things at the right time. But in retrospect, it doesn't look as good as they used to do. "Divide love" tells the story of the family. Yes, it combines religion. But actually the story about the family and the ability of the family to be together, no matter where they are thrown This film is based on real events which do not say that this is a true story. But if you look at the news articles at that time, you can see that both churches do not handle events in Useful ways for families These two churches were wrong, the Catholic Church that enforced this rule in the family from the beginning and did not respond to the violence that came with it and the Protestant Church to tell the mother that she should obey his husband and monk and refuse Fight in this case. Both of them let this family down. I believe that this film works well in this fight, both in the church and in the family. Whether in any form or form, placing the Catholic Church on the other hand, it shows that one event can change the path of the idea of ​​that religion and how one person can have More impact
