I like Dedee Pfeiffer (spelled correctly?) In Cybil. Still not seeing her for a moment and forgeting how much I miss her. I think she is doing very well in this matter. The factor is also quite good as well. In some corners, the daughter looks like Nicole Kidman, still young. The kidnapper looks creepy and the story generally has a good twist. Boyfriend is hot I think my husband has something to do with this. <br /> <br /> Just have a lifelong movie network for Christmas. Maintain my interest and I'll watch again when they call it again. Who can recommend this similar movie? You can post on the board or send a personal email if you wish. thank you. Aboutagirly
