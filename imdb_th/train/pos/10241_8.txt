I tried not to rate IMDb as a heart, but I felt bewildered when I saw the rating 5.4 as one of my childhood favorites. It didn't surprise me at the age of 17, but as a family movie, this story is a sweet and well-meaning movie. Children will definitely love it and will not mind the flaws and adults can guess the characters that are. Behind each character and admiring the subtle message of this film No movie is being taught. In reality, it has a good message that adds sweetness. I will admit that this story is on some side, and some scenes like the death of the Screweyes (which still surprised me) may be a little scary. But the animation is better than the average with good color and good character animation. James Horner's song is very beautiful and the outstanding song is memorable, catchy and amusing. I really like the characters. Louie should be the one who delves deepest. But the dinosaurs were at least involved Martin Shortton's comedy was both hilarious and troubling when he told Screweyes that "I quit!" There was me in stitches. My favorite thing is Screweyes, but the villain is good and I think it's wise. If there is anything, I hope this movie will be kept when he explains how he lost his eyes and why he was afraid of the crow because of the way he can develop more in terms of depth. The script, while not receiving the Oscar, has a funny and heartfelt part and should entertain children and adults. The sound that is displayed for me is what makes John Goodman, Martin Short, Rhea Perlman, Felicity Kendall and Yeardley Smith all have a great performance. But the special mention must go to Kenneth Mars because he is great like a Screweyes and almost can't remember In conclusion, this is a good movie. I do not get honest ratings, I do not. Sure that this movie isn't perfect and it's not as good as dinosaur movies like Land Before Time, but it's fun. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
