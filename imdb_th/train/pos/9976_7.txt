Of course, it's wonderful and ridiculous, and sometimes it looks repetitive. But at least the filmmakers didn't try While most TV movies are in the scope of ordinary people But this movie has the ability to exchange real stuff The film was quite good for TV movies and Viggo Mortensen showed Aragon's shades in movies about men playing by his own rules Most historical sequences are wonderful. But the scene with the mountain lion is severe I was annoyed with the role of Jason Priestly in the stubborn jock movie. But after that again, it's a TV movie! Despite all the good things, the music is cruel. However, it's good to see Tucson, Arizona featured in the movie.
