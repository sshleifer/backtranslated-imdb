Hello, I am from Taft California and I like this movie because it shows that our small town people who love football, our sport is important in the Taft and this movie shows how important it is that I think. They should build again. The actors use us, kids, to play the game well, showing our determination that we beat Bakersfield every game in the last 6 years and because I am a senior next year is my last chance and from that State and I'm next, if you want to know me, I'm Kyle Taylor and I'm averaging seven to eight yards on the portable and about five times the game isn't good, go out on the 75 or round the run field to check us at the website our And go to our sports page bye
