This film seems to criticize bad people for some reason. Probably because of the large number of people However, this is a very interesting movie. This movie is a low-budget sci-fi movie that actually works due to interesting stories and well-done scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie may not be suitable for everyone if someone has a sci-fi fan. Which read this, I really recommend this movie if you like good science fiction. This movie has a crazy idea. Settings, including countries that will war with GIGANTIC machines, which the whole country invests with all the money! The world has been divided into territories. Can anyone challenge others to make a war? 'Robot fighting' means war is cleaner than nuclear war, because now everyone wears a protective mask. Movies that make you think clearly Smart, well-written and a good effect for a vicious budget. <br /> <br /> I tend to like movies that have a small budget and actually work.
