All I can say is the first movie in this season that received my attention. I chose it because the actor Gere and Claire and the story looked bright .. I just watched it and I can say - I feel bad. There are real shocking scenes. But that is what makes it more realistic We should not run away from our reality. These things are happening now. And there are experts who try to change things and make them better and those who laugh out about their commitment to the cause In fact, I can't feel "Hollywood touch" in the movie .. and that's what makes it better. Both Claire and Richard did a great job and deserved 10 from me.
