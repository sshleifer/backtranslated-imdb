Overall, this movie is ok. I think it's better than Sepet and better than Gubra in terms of its emotional value story. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that impressed me. Yes, I agree that the boy is doing very well. I can say that his performance is almost natural. <br /> <br /> However, the song 'Ne Me Quitte Pas' by Nina Simone is really "'menaikkan' my 'bulu' 'roma' "<br /> <br> I love music, both" Ne Me Quitte Pas "and" Hujan ". I just downloaded beautiful songs. <br /> <br /> And greet with Yasmin. The movie impressed me again. We can see how Yasmin appreciates her parents in a unique way. <br /> <br /> I think this movie deserves the Grand Prix Of International Jury at the Berlin Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I give 8.5 1o stars
