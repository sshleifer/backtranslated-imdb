I received a few weeks ago and loved it! It's modern, light But full of real complexity of life It's a question and an answer, like the other Eytan Fox movies. This is my favorite, along with Jossi & Jagger. This image is more universal than the bubble that we may live. Enjoy this - I'm not, but the movie will go into my top ten movies. At first it seemed pure entertainment. But it keeps you thinking The relationship that we have to live with is superficial, has a deep and dangerous meaning to life. You name it. You don't know what will happen, and of course you don't know where this story is heading while watching the first time. It's worth seeing many times. Fox movies have great bonus content - this is a great music video and "creation" (including a description of the title, interview Lior Ashknenazi, who plays himself in the movie Arabic with suspicions about the way of life of Israel)
