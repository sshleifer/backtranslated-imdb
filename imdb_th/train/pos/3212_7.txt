I used to watch this movie a second time to try to figure out why it was not successful. (Commercial or artistic) as it should be, and discover many valuable arts - which may eventually be a commercial trade. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie tries serious science fiction. "Social criticism" rather than action adventure There is an action in it But that's not all about If you focus on that, you will get cloned. (Aliens as others have stated) Clones "Aliens" that aren't good, but that's not something about <br /> <br /> Todd's movie about Kurt Russell's transition from Humans are close to machines and return to human beings (mostly * after *), but since it doesn't try to give you a typical Hollywood answer, Kirk Russell has to make this change without talking. What And he has done a great job - it takes two perspectives to appreciate it. <br /> <br /> The "social logic" surrounding is flawed and has not been adequately explained as being able to fry. To control his army or not High-level forces that are predicted from his experience on the battlefield or newly discovered humans or anything. But this movie still shows great talent for Russell's talent
