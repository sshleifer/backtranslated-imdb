This is a movie that has many things that only Japanese people can understand. Despite having a good translation, there is something that is a private porch or a regional symbol. I guess it's trying to send some messages. But it makes me disappointed. <br /> <br /> What I feel is that in general, this is an ordinary movie with special effects. Some children became "one" and eventually there was almost no relation to the war that was not reasonable. It's good to understand what they're talking about, but between the Azumi bean washing yokai and the person who looks like a big tongue (Rihanna eats your heart away!). Good picture. Children screaming very. The river princess is very cute and everyone else is shit.
