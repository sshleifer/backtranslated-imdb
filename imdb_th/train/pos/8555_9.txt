* First, although many say it's the worst in the series But I do not think that it will be true because this consideration reflects the thoughts of teenagers in the 21st century. It brings a perfect opportunity. When you want to enjoy the characters <br /> <br /> * I agree with the fact that it's a teen movie. But the current comedy shouldn't be for teenagers, right? I mean ... Most theaters are places for teenagers to hang out. In addition, watching this movie during a backlog or something good for having a good time. <br /> <br /> * Many comments about the number of nude pictures in this movie. To be true ... that doesn't reflect the thoughts of young people like those from movies, right? What would you like to see ... smart books, romantic stories? That is not what will be in those teens' thoughts ... <br /> <br /> * To conclude, I think if you are a teenager, you have to watch movies and even if you are Men or women that are actually growing, you should see it if you still have a teenager's mind or think about it as a teenager or something like that. Thanks for reading!
