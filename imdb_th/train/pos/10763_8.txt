I must admit that I was very skeptical about this documentary. I expect that it will be all American propaganda that we here in Europe do not like. I am wrong. This is not propaganda. In fact, it is hardly political. <br /> <br /> It shows the 9/11 incident through the eyes of the firefighters who call the scene after the plane crash. It's an amazing miracle that this documentary was filmed! This film was originally filmed as a document about a rookie firefighter. NY became a "man". We thank the filmmakers that they continue to work in times of hardship facing them. /> <br /> Great work Absolutely beautiful materials Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Sincerely
