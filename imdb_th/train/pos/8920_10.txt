I do not know Steve McQueen in 1958. I only know that I am extremely scared to watch this movie. (I was damaged by the movie "Trantula" at the age of seven ... but now I'm ten years old) Scene 1 at Blob crawling the farmer's foot and holding his hand enough to make me want to leave. From the theater But I rest and suffer from the attacks of each of our monsters I was horrified when Steve and his girl barely got out of the doctor's office (the doctor was bad) and, moreover, when The Blob entered the theater and ate a lot of viewers .. in fact many IT oooooozzzzzzzz Coming out of the front door too big, now fit through one. Seems to be indestructible and not limited to growth potential, and when it is caught with a bad Steve in a restaurant that looks like a sieve, he seems to be an absolute dinner. That was cold, probably a modern explanation But in the end, the ice is better, the scary and the broken heart. <br /> <br /> I remember walking home. In the evening with my uncle, Nick tried to show courage. He knew that I was having problems, and when I slept on the bed that night I couldn't feel only a drop in the room. But when I called the courage to look down on the ground, there was a red rhythm. Sitting, waiting for me to try and get up and go to the bathroom. It takes several months to recover. <br /> <br /> I am now 57 years old... I have done it. <br /> <br /> Of course, the Blob is not destroyed.
