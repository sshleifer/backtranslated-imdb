How can the movie with Curtis Mayfield's singing be bad? It is impossible! The Groove Tube is a scatological black sketch that makes everything fun. From 2001 to the Olympics, the high tones (easy-to-use lubricant koko) are smaller ("dealers" that are too long) but Even the low sound was funny. The best thing is Ken Shapiro's crazy dance on the busy Manhattan sidewalk. (That is Shapiro, not Nat King Cole, singing Just You, Just Me). But at that time, The Groove Tube was not respected, brave, unscrupulous and humorous. Ken Shapiro created this minor cult. Then, 7 years later, a Christmas bomb exploded. Modern problems (Although I enjoy it) and since then, unfortunately (He may play drums in a jazz band) The Groove Tube is still my positive power, which is a movie that is 26 years after my first viewing and still brings true happiness to me!
