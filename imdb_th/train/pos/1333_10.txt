I love this movie so much. I keep watching. I don't see why everyone thinks that this movie isn't good. Maybe you see better or whatever I love. It's one of my favorite movies and I'm not a Hindi at all, but I love it. It may be like "Pretty Woman" but I don't see and don't think it's better. I don't know why you ended up with this. But maybe you have a good reason But i think i'm saying enough But I like this movie very much. Watch it and any movie that you think is good. For others that I watch with, they are also fun, so it surprised me that many people dislike Rani Mukherjee (I think that's how you spell her last name). She's a very beautiful person.
