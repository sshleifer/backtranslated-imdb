This movie is a very romantic romantic comedy that is very fun. Meg Ryan works very well as Albert Einstein's intelligent granddaughter, although she believes in her own skills. Tim Robbins performs equally well as a mechanic who falls in love with her when she enters the store with her fiance after her car is crammed. I love Walter Mattau as one, Albert Einstein. This film gives a very relaxing feeling while still maintaining seriousness. (If possible, it actually happened here) <br /> <br /> I found this movie especially fun. Old scientists - I think they are fantastic and hilarious! It seems that this movie will be underestimated for understanding. If you have a cheeky humor, this is the movie for you!
