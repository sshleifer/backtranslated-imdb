This document truly opened my eyes to what people outside of the United States thought about the September 11 attacks. The film was expertly collected and presented this disaster more than US soil attacks. The aftermath of this disaster has been previewed from many countries and perspectives. I believe that this movie should be more widely distributed for this point. It also helps in the healing process to see things other than news reports about terrorist attacks. And some pieces are really funny but not so This film introduced me very much and I went through the same feelings.
