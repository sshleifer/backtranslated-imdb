A lot of fun for both children and adults. This film works in many levels: everything from car crashes and facial cakes to good jokes (still fragile) for adults. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close is at The best of her wickedness is Cruella (`Call me Ella '). De Ville <br /> <br /> After three years in the clinic, the behavior change of Dr. Pavlov, even the puppies that she wants very much She still has all her fur coats placed in the dungeon of an unusual castle that she lived in. <br /> <br /> But it's not Dalmatian's movie without chaos. Some things will change her behavior. And now she needs an additional puppy (For this reason, Dalmatian 102 people) to complete her evil plans at this time. <br /> <br /> Ioan Gruffudd has received attention as the hero of this film. Although he was in the 'Titanic' and last year on television (in the Pip story) of `great expectations 'But I can't remember him. He is the fifth Lowe Officer in 'Titanic' and I don't see `Great Expectations' so I am not surprised. <br /> <br /> Gerard De Padier is a formidable person of Cruella. He danced and posed in the most strange and wicked fur clothes you have ever seen? And doing well. His respect for 'Wicked Witch of the West' is hilarious. <br /> <br /> Tim McInnerny is great. Isn't Cruella's evil counterpart? He is also Alonzo, Cruella's butler in `101 Dalmatians ', and you may remember him from the Brit-Coms' Black Adder. All, he plays a good character, is kind, normal, and quite dim to get good results. > <br /> Oscars for general performances are usually obtained from all the photographs in the movie. This is an unfortunate matter, because the clothes worn by Glenn Cole are amazing, right? It has unbelievable details. (Please note that her handcuffs when she was released from the behavior modification clinic) and should be worthy of a great character. Her clothes deserve the least nominations. <br /> <br /> Animation is a special place in my heart. But comparing this film to the original cartoon movie is like comparing apples and orangutans: not able to do enough to say `102 Dalmatian 'is better than the movie version of 101 Dalmatian that came out in 1996, there are many things here: from the eyes, the dialogue and the costumes to the casting - it's a good movie for the whole family.
