There is no denying that Aink's comedies are good. But for me, this movie stands out as one of the best movies. <br /> <br /> The basic evidence of this film is that a small part of Pimlico in London was discovered to be Part of Burgundy, not the United Kingdom Then we followed the lives of residents in the fight to collect the treasures found after the explosion and prevent traders in the black market, which soon realized that it was excluded from the laws of the United Kingdom. are When they became prisoners in their own streets because the government decided to close the boarder, we saw that they were fighting the system. <br /> <br /> They were forced to ration the water and food at the right spot. In fact, worse than before, that was the beginning of morality, that is, when they released all the food they thought they were beaten and demanded to give up. By sending a lot of food <br /> <br /> This film is the right song throughout the show. It's a great story by Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren. Not too appreciative and moral of the story does not force your neck. Worth watching
