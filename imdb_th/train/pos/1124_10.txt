I agree with all the awards. I got through the toilet paper box to watch this movie. It is reliable and violent in all areas. <br /> <br /> The questions I will raise show the current feelings about animal treatment. I have a very difficult time with the beginning of killing sheep and goats and dying deer that have trembling and blood combined when the life that flows out is ugly. <br /> <br /> This is the era of "no animals hurt in the production of this movement". Iphigenia was created in the late 1970s before the computer simulation. Is it possible to pretend these animals died? Or are these animals killed for art?
