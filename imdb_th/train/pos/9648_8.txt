I like this movie a lot. The story jumped quite a bit and was not easy to follow. There is no modification of any matter and you will be left to wonder what actually happened. Since I like that genre, I like it. I like the "dating" scene between the boy and me into their lives. And of course, any movie that has Staphane Rideau will get double the score ;-)
