Returning to the lakeside cottage, perhaps one of the few sequels that can live until the original. It has black humor, great suspense, good-looking women, and of course a psychotic killer. What are we missing? I don't think anything Except that we were left to have Gore and a small amount of nudity because it was made for television In addition to being one of the best sequels, it is also one of the best thriller movies to watch as a family. Recommended for everyone
