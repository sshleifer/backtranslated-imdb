This is a really great movie. It just proves that you don't want ridiculous things like continuity and script to create movies. It traverses the continent in a matter of seconds. People are shot and nothing happens to them. The fire samurai sword fights against the galleons that are sinking. David Essex is a good example of weak evil and the screen. Johnris I enjoy this movie But I like the movie ** t. This is a perfect example of the movie. ** Only with the KICKS ASS. If you like Battlefield Earth, you will love this movie. A quick slap, stupidity. Peace of mind !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! As if it were built in 1972
