Of course, I would have to give this movie 10 out of 10 because my uncle is the main screenwriter for Once Upon a Crime Rodolfo Sonego, writing a screenplay for over 50 years living in Italy. He is a great storyteller and has suggested that he write his story. So Rodolfo Sonego did. If you check his history, you can see the number of movies made in Italy. My uncle went to Australia and my city in 1968 to check the place for "Girl in Australia" and create a great movie about a proxy bride after World War II You can see his humor in all his movies. I recently found a copy of this film on DVD. GREAT
