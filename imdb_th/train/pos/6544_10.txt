I really like this movie! Although it is not like anything else, it is still a classic Nancy Drew style. I have seen many advertisements for this film, and since I am actually in Nancy Drew's book, I have very high expectations for this film and they certainly achieved those expectations. Every character is quite as I imagine from reading books. I am very happy to watch this movie. All actors and actors act like acting like books. Ever since I saw this movie, I wanted to read all of Nancy Drew's books there. All the actors and actors were really into their characters, and it certainly shows when the film is broadcast on the big screen It seems that all the actors and actors are in the position of the characters in me. Of course I will give 10 out of 10 of this movie.
