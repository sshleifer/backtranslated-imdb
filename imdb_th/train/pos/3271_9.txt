I am always a big fan of this movie. First of all, you have seen actors, great performances, and helped the movie move very well. Cybill Shepherd received good reviews for her role and they deserved Nicely The beginning of the film began in the past when Corinne Jeffries (Cybill), whose perfect marriage came to a halt when her husband Louie died suddenly. Fortunately, Lice was shot for the second time in life when he agreed to "Reused" returned to the world as Alex Finch (Robert Downey, JR). Newborn Alex still has his new life, forgetting his past life while Corinne tries. Will fight with you But the fate crossed the path of Alexs 23 years later when he met Miranda (Mary Stuart Masterson) Corinne's daughter and suddenly was filled with many unpleasant memories. Feel the heart and very cute You will not be disappointed if you give the opportunity the opportunity you will like. Very funny and sweet!
