The combination of superb black and white photography and the plot of 'Eugene Onegin and the twist' made me a real person. The atmosphere caused by the shooting of very dark images that intersect with the white is too bright, sometimes capturing. There is a wonderful time where transparency - is clearly a normal holiday. But the actor's face reveals the character and the situation thoroughly, but immediately - is shown with the song that is the heart of Lensky from Tschaikowsky opera. Eugene Onegin <br /> <br For me, the mark of a good movie is that it should be used. Benefiting from the opportunities presented by the media, which means that the story is often less important than the photos and the atmosphere - last year in Marienbad is a good example of this movie.
