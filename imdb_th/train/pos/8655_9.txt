"Kalifornia" is one of my favorite movies of all time, and it may have been identified as one of the best psychological thriller in the 1990s. The film has a very modern surface, but after that it is a good image. Annoyed and expressed the madness of the murder and the great violence they have made to others. One of the strongest aspects of this film is Brad Pitt's performance. Excellent as a psychologist named Pitt potrays. His scary character is almost impeccable. Juliet Lewis is a person who plays an innocent girlfriend as well. Her innocence almost causes the heart to break. "Kalifornia" has a simple plot to go forward slowly and about one. Hour But it plunged into the fun of harrowing murders while Pitt released his mental personality There are many shocking scenes and everything depends on the power of the powerhouse that will haunt you for many days. "Kalifonia" is a movie that should be watched seriously because it is a violent manner that humans can be like and not just But will cause violence and blood flow
