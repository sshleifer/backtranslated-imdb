Saw it as often as I could before it left the scene Pleasant movies and entertainment with my favorite stars Hopefully I will find it again! Will definitely buy / see if I can Please bring it back. Fred MacMurray is perfect in his role as a patriot during World War II and Joan Leslie, his leading woman. It's a stage play But it's romantic, funny and intelligent This is my favorite movie starring June Haver, although I always like you. Her amazing smile shines on the screen and her beauty and ability are valuable to every movie. Credit to support their role Movies that are balanced and have a good heart Just hope that we will like more!
