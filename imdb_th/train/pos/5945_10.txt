Let me do one thing that is clear ??. Most of the ideas of those acting in Hollywood frankly p * sses me immediately in general and especially in relation to the treatment of many beloved characters from icon Why is the comic book page? Now let's try the Hollywood Executive Board meeting situation to show that we have to be an executive or not? .. <br /> <br /> Executive # 1, 'Hey <br /> <br /> The # 2 manager' is a good spot to create chaos! ?? We will wear a lucky hat and choose a superhero randomly to create the movie accordingly! (The immersion occurs and pulls out the name of the famous hero) <br /> <br /> Executive number 1 'Great! Who can we play now? '<br /> <br /> Executive # 2' Who is the big box office star at the moment '<br /> <br /> # 1 executive * * The name of the great actor * This is what happened this week. '<br /> <br /> Executive # 2, but is he suitable for this chapter? I mean, he doesn't look like the character in any way. '<br /> <br /> # 1' Who cares! He's the big name. We will create this movie with him in the next story. '<br /> <br /> 2nd executive,' You're right! And in addition, we will fill the whole movie with a special effect to appease human beings that no one will ask further questions! The most modern movie superhero hate All forms, without substance and pathetically handsome of the symbolic lead Of course, to be equal, there are exceptions to the above rules. When did Hollywood make mistakes? Performed the original casting. (And still the best, easily!) Superman; Christopher Reeve and recently Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen in the X-Men movie <br /> <br /> But go back to the general negative nature shown by Hollywood Today or not? Do executives have to choose the actors that are suitable for the role? In a world that is less than ideal, one filmmaker believes just whether or not by casting an actor that is similar to their comic book. His name is Sandy Collora. Sadly (but usually) Hollywood hasn't allowed Collora to direct a full-length movie. But fortunately for us, he let us provoke what the outcome would be like in the form of two people. One short feature of the superhero is Batman: The Great Dead End and the other is a parody movie trailer for the movie called Worlds Finest. <br /> <br /> Okay, don't say our words here. ? This is definitely a wonderful thing. <br /> <br /> Selection of actors from Mr. Universe and male model Michael O'Hearn (those who look scary in the same way Play iconic iron man In fact, in terms of physical similarities, there is no doubt that it will be closer to the characters <br /> <br /> added to Clark Bartram. His as the Dark Knight in Batman: Dead End; Again, there are many smart actors. <br /> What can I say? If only this was a real long movie! Hollywood studio executives take notes! This is what you should do! <br /> <br /> As a final note, I was fascinated again with a very different reaction. This short film was received by fans, unpleasant symptoms from acerbic and the most severe to it. Clear up again (As with Batman: Dead End) from younger and less experienced audiences in movies Truth is betrayed by traditional grammar and many free words. This unfortunate mental state is a sad phenomenon, even though our studio executives mentioned in Hollywood do not doubt that they are very satisfied with it. In the end, those who misunderstand them all But there is a possibility that CGI will stick to the same thing: popcorn that makes many people feel dismal today.
