This movie is almost fantastic fantasy movie. A mixture of Shakespeare, pop, jazz and fairy tales This movie is a creative concept in the Cinderella theme, featuring a strong character led by the perfect actor Kathleen Turner. This movie has everything that goes. Everything except the production cost I almost never thought that this movie needed special effects or a large budget. But with this superior production, it comes out with awesome qualities like everyone else created for TV movies. In addition to better movies, this film is almost perfect. <br /> <br />
