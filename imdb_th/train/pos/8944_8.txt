Bell Book and Candle was released in December 1958 and James Stewart Kim Novak, Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovaks. The film features James Stewart and Kim Novak in their second screen match (After Alfred Hitchcock's classic dizzy was released earlier this year) This was Stewart's last film as a romantic lead actor, because he was too old to be 50 years old. To show that role anymore This film is about a witch played by Kim Novak, who attracted James Stewart to play as a human. She spell him a spell and he falls in love with her. I enjoy movies and actors. This film at that time was moderately successful, which was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Comedy. GimmeClassics
