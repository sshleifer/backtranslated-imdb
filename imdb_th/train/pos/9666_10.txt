Bette Midler is a god again! Comedy is in love with a parody. Can bring you into tears, both old jokes and new sets or old songs that are more powerful and more punch all in All Singing, new ballads, powerful old music / perennial songs like "The Rose" "Stay with me" and yes, even "wind under my wing". The best way to appreciate the Divine Miss M is always interesting - because this is the next best thing. I recommend everyone with ingredients. Of enchantment and appreciation from adults
