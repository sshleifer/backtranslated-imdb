I just bought the complete American Gothic series on the DVD and it depends on my memory. I am very grateful to be able to watch the first time that I have never been televised before. I like "Ring of Fire" especially the stories I have never seen before for the first time. <br /> <br /> Gary Cole is a great person like Lucas Buck, the "sexy evil" Lucas Black. Caleb is also a great player. I think Brenda Bakke is Selena Coombs. It's great to paint her picture. Actually, all the actors have excellent abilities and have excellent chemical properties. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the series was drunk by the network. For adult viewing A mixture of comedy, tragedy, comedy, romanticism, gothic and horror genres. It presents a great character performance that is supported by genius performances. <br /> <br /> Life Gary Cole, who has a long life (Sheriff Lucas Buck), the most charming "fallen angel" that had ever existed.
