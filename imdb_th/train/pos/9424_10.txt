For me, this is the most complete movie of Ealing Studio - as well as fresh and relevant half a century later, like the day it was released. <br /> <br /> As a statement To demonstrate economic growth and commercial needs Obsolete, it may be minute-by-minute And in other films that can be said that the hero wears a real plot. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, there is a comparison with Jurassic Park, where the busy environment will turn. And bite you But Spielberg turned away from the great center of this book. Well, <br /> <br /> In a man's suit in a white suit, Alec Guiness is an ideal scientist with a cloth that has never been dirty. And never wear Suddenly, the workers and the capital at the northern English mill, where he worked together, like never before, to protect their way of life. Of course, being Ealing is a joke. But it is not necessary Complex interoperability of benefits (Should be appropriate or not) is a very interesting thing that all parties realize that 'Progress' is a threat and the dumping of waste and waste is what causes change. <br /> <br /> But yes, this is a joke - even if someone is keen - and amidst mockery. The political scene with some delicious performances and old-fashioned laughter. <br /> <br /> However, it's a scary satire. That thing remains - dazzling and white.
