I appreciate movies like this: smart and good craftsmanship, entertainment, absorbing good deeds and well directed. No one - even Pacino - is chewing the scenery. * Trying to stand out. One of the most powerful moments of this film (Aielo pulled up on his favorite ramp) was cold, precisely due to restraint. <br /> <br /> Not as good as saying the quiz show CITY HALL. Is a similar fabric: the participation of the mind as well as the eyes, ears and heart Why is this entertaining entertainment that fails at the box office is a matter for everyone to guess? <br /> * Did you know Pacino made it chew on one of the scenes? But precisely because it needs Great scene as well.
