I saw this movie in a video store a few years ago and rented it. My husband and I enjoyed it a lot. We bought VHS and enjoyed it since <br /> <br /> The plot has been talked well so no need to go again. The point is that this movie deserves to be watched over and over again. Americans in particular will not receive all the jokes at first. I know I can't do it. <br /> <br /> This movie is funny, sad and sad - all at the same time. When Ray offered toast at his daughter's wedding, it was flattering. When Karen called Tony "Brian" as he tried to kiss her, it was sad. Finally, when Beano entered the corner by a woman in black, it was too funny to say. <br /> <br /> And music: It's as good as the soundtrack of movies I've heard for years I dance in the living room for "all over the world." <br /> <br /> The most complete performance. Bill Nighy has been greatly appreciated for drawing Ray's people with terrible trips. Stephen Rea is perfect as Tony, a lovely keyboard player who has held the torch for Karen for many years. He has an attractive appearance that makes women want to hug him. But all the actors are equally excellent. <br /> <br /> Don't care about the pan you read about this movie and watch it. It's a gem
