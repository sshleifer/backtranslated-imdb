This movie has everything, action, fighting, dancing, bull riding, music, beautiful girls. This movie is an interesting image in Central America. Believe me, I was there in 1980, a lot of oil money, many women and many prestigious tons. Unfortunately they are now gone. This movie is just a boy met with a young woman, a boy losing a girl gets a girl back. But it was exchanged by actors and songs There are no movies that have better songs like this movie and that includes American Graffiti. It's a movie that I watch over and over again and never get bored Every time I watch it, I'm still young again and it's time to go out and make a horn. The only reason I gave 9 is because you can't rate the movie center. I don't think you should give 10 points.
