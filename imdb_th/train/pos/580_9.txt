When I first watched this movie, I was with my father. He encouraged me to watch this movie because it was one of his favorites. After watching the movie, it became one of my favorites immediately. <br /> <br /> The river runs through. It is about two brothers who each use different paths in their lives. Norman Klein ( Craig Sheffer) is the brother of two brothers and he is on the education path. Paul Maclean (Brad Pitt) is a stubborn brother who travels on a path full of obstacles. The movie follows these characters as each person tracks his own path. <br /> <br /> There are no disadvantages for this movie. You will be entertained along the way. Performing, directing and scripting is perfect. Two great things are movies and scores. Which both are attached to you in this world. Robert Redford created for you. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie around which is defined as a classic movie. It sure is in my book If you haven't seen this movie for sure, you'll be with you forever.
