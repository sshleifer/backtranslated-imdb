This show is about three little girls (DJ Stephanie and Michelle). Their mother was killed by a drunken man, so Danny, his father, invited his brother-in-law (Jesse) and his old friend (Joey) So all the performances are about living. Girls face life problems and have life lessons. They develop over the fans and many more. All the performances follow the stream. You don't have to hold back the resentment that you just let go. I think this program is very good and fun to watch. I grew up watching this program and still watching today. I'm glad that they also broadcast this program on television. I watched it almost every day. I rate it 10/10
