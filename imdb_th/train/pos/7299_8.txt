Poor actors, scary scripts filled with holes, hot blonde girls are bitten by life. Evil scientists have serious nasty mustaches. A man uses a trained sniper. Out of the monster ... scary. The only thing missing is the unnecessary graphic sex scene during the killing. Ha ha. The more fun is full of guessing and twisting one torpedo. I enjoy this movie a lot. But before you look, make sure you laugh well. I recommend this movie to people who can watch movies and not be serious about it. I can't imagine that this movie was created for people who are serious. However, if you can watch and sit down and have fun, I think you can enjoy this movie in a way that should be very easy. Get popcorn and beer and enjoy with friends and this movie. It brings happiness to my life.
