Running Man is not a great movie. Actually it's stupid. But it gives you what you need in Arnie's movies and that is action and entertainment I do not see that anyone can not enjoy this picture. It is silly, silent and above all, making yourself fun. By this method may be one of the most calculated Arnie movies out there.
