I will not say that this is a bad movie. In fact, it is normal for the type of movie studio. "Poverty Row" was released at that time. Bela Lugosi shot Monogram very effectively in his role as a dementia doctor scientist who disguised himself as a respected member of the community. In this film, Bela and his associates have a disgusting habit of stealing a young bride and after their death, spraying Bela's wife with a serum brought from their bodies so that her child Lugosi is more The mission of making this movie fun. However, this film suffered from the extraordinary performances of Luana Walters and Tristram Coffin. For kids in horror movies) is not good, especially in this case. I've seen him in a lot of movies and TV shows and he's always the same. Solid wood and not fully reliable Miss Walters is only slightly better. But she lacks acting ability to make her role reliable Even so, the audience can enjoy the wonderful Lugosi, another form that is cowardly to be destroyed! Despite the bad performances, some "The Corpse Vanishes" are fun movies for everyone to see.
