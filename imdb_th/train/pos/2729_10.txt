I voted very well for good performances, not for content. It makes me feel cold after reading and watching movies. The former two prisoners are traveling to destinations to rob a family money from a safe prisoner who learned while in prison. During the journey, the tension began as the soundtrack in the movie increased overall expectations. After the murderer worked at the farm the next morning, the daughter's church friends found the remains of the family. The screams of the blood flowed out while the pan-phone scene and the cord caused my blood to cool and made me cold. The killer's encounter with their only fate is a small convenience for the family that has reached Robert Blake's agendas in Perry Smith's description.
