Describing the love of children towards the school in concrete form But still attracting a very old audience like me It has both ups and downs, twists and turns and makes me shed tears. We rarely see movies with black urban characters that attract older audiences, not blacks, and show real-life images of young black adults. <br /> <br /> This film takes place in Universities and cities Meet and fall in love The back is a friend, acquaintance, and situations that affect them better or worse. Some general plot may say But this is an unexpected story. <br /> <br /> I found myself rooted in the survival of the relationship of both of my past in their story. The moment with profound thoughts and revelations arose from the actors' performances. <br /> <br /> It's a bright movie that I will endorse for children at heart and in love or in love. Very good movie. I will look for a copy to add to my movie collection.
