First of all, let's start with a negative point: 1) There is a large, open mouth in the story and questions raised that will not be answered in the near place; 2) This movie is not for everyone, so the impolite audience will start to rest and start playing this movie. <br /> <br /> The second point above is important because the movie is very quiet. In the old theater (As I go) You can hear the wheel spinning through the projector sometimes. I love that The movie doesn't make you busy with music and effects: it helps you to reflect on what is happening. <br /> <br /> There is no rhythm that creates a fascinating and fun atmosphere. The same atmosphere created by Stanley Kubrick in Eyes Wide Shut is not for everyone. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend to the fans of the cinema because of the amazing movie work. Only one person who appreciates this movie will be disappointed. Is a story that you have to create a link in your mind after that (My version is really cool, but it's quite astounding!) If you go to watch a movie, it has a great part: when two policemen are talking on a mobile phone Great sound effects that impress you. Hats away with people who think to do this.
