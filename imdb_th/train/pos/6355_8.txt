I love "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" when it was released and now I still love it 5 years later. There are still many people who disagree with my opinion and this movie has never been. Get so much love when it comes out. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie is the best. Is the same reason why this movie is so charming and appealing All dresses, costumes and characters are made perfectly in a fun way without having to become truly nonsense. It's a fascinating movie. It's a movie created from the best camp! The director Ron Howard was really amazed with this fun little Christmas movie. <br /> <br /> The main reason why this movie is usable. He carried this film with his good and fun role. Of course, he received help from a credible make-up that won the Oscar. Of course, if you are Jim Carrey, hate you. Don't think about it. This movie is really his movie and he makes it work and enjoy watching a lot. Other fun and memorable roles are being played by Jeffrey Tambor, Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans as the youngest Grinch. <br /> <br /> This film has good morale. It may be because I am a Dutch person and we are not celebrating the great and enthusiastic Christmas here like in the United States or England. For me, this movie is fun and entertaining and morale makes me quite cool to be honest. <br /> <br /> James Horner's musical score is good and fun, even if it's your average every day. Horner. It still works perfectly for movies and helps the work of the scene. <br /> <br /> Perfect Christmas entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
