I just watched the movie. I was afraid that it would disappoint me. At the end I was quite surprised. The American Pie franchise remains in my favorite movie franchise all the time. Yes, it won't be true if I say I enjoy it like mush like I like traditional. Beta House, along with two previous pies, lost something with two paddles. First, it won't become a classic like the first two. But what the hell - it's still funny with a very good time and I think it should be the first movie to choose if you want to have fun and relax after a work day or school. Beta houses should receive 6/10, but I give 7/10 to be another part of PIE.
