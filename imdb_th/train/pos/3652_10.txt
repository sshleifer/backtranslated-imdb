I started watching this TV drama again on Sunday afternoon, thinking that it was a terrible air disaster. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> "Pandora's watch" is a political thriller that is too smart. Than the quality of most TV movies It can be easily launched on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Great actors, including professional actors like Richard Dean Anderson, Edward Herrmann, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume and Robert Loggia Daphne Zuniga One of her best performances as a medical expert working for CIA and Frasier's Jane Leeves is also very good. <br /> <br /> The conversation is well written and the story is interesting. In fact, the last hour is full of twisted plot and wondering if you can't leave the seat. If you have the opportunity to watch this movie, try investing - almost four hours. You will be rewarded abundantly!
