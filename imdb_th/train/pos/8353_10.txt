I remember seeing this movie as a child in 1977 or 1978. HBO will show it late at night when they are the only ones. Back then, it was not prepared and was the only movie that had been screened on paid television ... especially at that time. I like to see it now as an adult, I will tend to understand its style. It may be the closest thing I have ever seen pornography at the age of 7 or 8 years old. Fortunately, I have a nanny and a parent going to a weekend party. Most of my memories in this movie are completely unusual sexual behavior of these two men. Breaking into the house to inhale a stranger's breastfeeding bra on a public bus and overlooked in a taxi at the request of one of their female volunteers. The movie is very lively for the early 70's until I checked IMDb. I don't know if this movie has the following. Most people I talk never heard before.
