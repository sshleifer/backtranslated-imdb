The sudden impact is likely to be regarded as Eastwood's artistic failure in his career when he built a good reputation as the director. That reason is not the movie itself. But it is an attitude that requires caution which seems to support In some places, it actually owes more to Death Wish than traditional Dirty Harry movies. Some people may argue that at the end of the day, it's a movie about guilt, justice and revenge. For me at the end of the day, it's more empathic than empathy. However, in the view of these arguments, it is easily overlooked that sudden shocks are superbly created movies. Forget "forward, punk makes the scene in my life" symbolic. But not the original But looking at the view of San Francisco taken from the air, zooming into the city 15 or 20 minutes is quite exciting. Or see a superbly created scene in which the character of Sondra Locke visits a mentally ill sister in the hospital Eastwood makes great use of the face of the news. So overall, Sudden Impact is a movie that shows how Eastwood really is the director. And if I remember correctly, it was actually the first time Eastwood put it on the screen, even though in the action movie of a debated ideology In addition, I think this is the first film directed by Eastwood. Although Eastwood has a lot of talent as a director, the drama is always his weakness (see Play Misty for me, Breezy, etc.). The area of ​​lecture leads to The visual elements that blend well with the movie and don't distract from the story. The only thing that is really annoying is the dog that is spilling.
