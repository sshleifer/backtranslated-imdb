This flick is a good example of the status of B-erotic movies: Bad porn movies without hardcore sex. The plot in this one is not as bad as these things go. It involves a female lawyer who tries to prove that her lover is innocent that kills his wife. However, the rest of the movie leaves what is needed. Bad performances, bad directions, bad looking women, bad dresses, bad movies, bad sounds and bad sex scenes Filmmakers should learn the difference between pornography and eroticism. They have no common sense to have Gabriella Hall naked or in love. <br /> <br /> How stupid is that
