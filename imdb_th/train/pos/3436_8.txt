Characters that do not have a destination will appear in another world in the back room of the post office. Here, Alice manages to find work, hoping to find the missing father. What she discovered was the torture spirit of Frank's boss. A quiet little Aussie coming and going to the cinema. Now you find it in the dark corner of the video store, obscured by fifty copies of the horrible GODZILLA movie. It's a shame because this is a satisfying movie that tells a brave story with simple images and performances. Efficiency from both sides The film was a success, with Garry Marshall, the other dead letter character, failing. DEAR GOD (1996 - USA) failed and approached the meaning of not Turkey. Kevin Costner
