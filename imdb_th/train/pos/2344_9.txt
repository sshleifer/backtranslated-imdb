I am one of those people who always watch the program and keep my feelings about personal items. However, pushing Daisy is my exception. I want to know about programs from broadcast advertisements that make the location of the program visible. I wondered at first, especially after the ending of Six Feet Under, still in my head. I go here again, I think I watched the first, second, third and all other episodes. Wow! First of all, I think that this is a matter of death and presented in a manner that should be eaten without being sick. The character is cute and I like the idea of ​​Ned, the main character who cannot truly experience the love of his life. Chuck, without being affected by her death, <br /> <br /> Character Most have wishes What they don't have Besides Ned and Chuck Olive still wished Ned Lily and Vivian want their grandchildren. Chuck and Emerson are always hoping for financial rewards from the mysterious deaths they have solved. I think the characters are perfect and reliable. I like the way Emerson is a black person, playing with other characters since being an African American. I like the delicate cultural humor that sometimes comes from him. <br /> <br /> Overall, the fairy tale that is seen is one of the most valuable entertainment I've seen in the 2007 season. The show is romantic enough for love and enough for those who love mystery. I just hope the writer will come back to work so that the program can continue to develop.
