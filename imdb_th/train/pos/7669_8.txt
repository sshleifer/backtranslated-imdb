Dr. Mordrid is one of those rare movies that is completely under the radar. But worth it It reminds me of old serials from the 30s and 40s, which is the reason why I like watching movies, follow-up ... but judging by the rest of the Full Moon there, just the nipples aren't enough to meet the general audience. Unfortunately, thanks to the sacrifice luxuries completely make family audiences too many people - which is unfortunate, because if not, they could be magic with Harry Potter kids as Jeffrey. Combs and Yip Nipar are great - I'm not sure that Nipa didn't leave the picture to this movie. She can believe it very seriously! However - it's a shame that they don't have a coin to allow Dr. Strange because I think this may be all small.
