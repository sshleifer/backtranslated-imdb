I am a big fan of Cybill Shepperd since I saw her series a couple of years ago !! This film shows her the best light of her !! This movie is handsome and plays great !! Every time you put a little line pattern just to make this movie one of the best movies I've seen !! Everyone really went out to do it by themselves !! Especially Robert Downey Jr and Cybill Shepperd. They make this movie a reality !! I like a little that Mavis lost her wig and she almost died when she fell to the ground !! This is the best movie !!
