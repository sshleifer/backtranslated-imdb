Most people may say that if anyone takes a Saturday night watching a movie, you will have to be really bored. In fact, I just went home from going out and turning on the TV and that was "Polly". <br /> <br /> I missed the credit open so I didn't know its name. But I saw that there was Cheech Marin in there, so I thought I had adapted to "Born In East LA". Naturally, when I saw him talking to Parrot, I was ready to stop this because it was a movie They show late at night. <br /> <br /> Happy to say it's better. As you know, if you haven't yet, Paulie gets lost and tries to return to his original owner. It seems that it will take many years to meet her. What should benefit Polly is an advantage in the wrong way. People find parrots that know books and what they see is how to make money or make a profit for themselves. <br /> <br /> While the character of Cheech Marin "is" making money from him, he can't. Meaning to him The dance sequence with the parrot is something that children will find cute. I find them amusing. <br /> <br /> Polly, innocent. 'Quickly learn that all human beings are not good people. Especially the owner of the animal research laboratory The man said to him that he would help him find his owner as long as he helped in animal communication research. Polly is stuck now. But decided to fool people out of the demonstrations for others with Polly's voice ability. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film's story Other animals and find the location of the owner Polly It is an impressive gathering. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 scenes of wings should be assumed and not shown. That part may disturb young children Otherwise, it will be a great movie for older children and adults with children with heart (end).
