One of the lowest budget movies from Germany! Is this the dark side of the new era? If you believe in secrets, please do not watch this movie! It blows your positive imagination away. This film shows that apart from the front of finding a peaceful soul, the world of abuse and fear I hope to have a 35mm copy soon! Andreas Marschall's first film is just the beginning of a new area, creating movies with just a few Euros! I'm waiting for the second attack!
