Those of you who know the group des recognize Tom Barman, the lead singer. He directed this movie like he created music. It was a mix of everything. This is a funny story, although the most irrational and insulting of the drama, there is no main character who has a happy life to say less, and it has no real purpose. Friday morning in Antwerp, Belgium, with the scenes of many people. But they will communicate between day and night There are several main characters: a teacher, an author who has no reading, a researcher, a young man with a taste of death, and a sister, a gallery owner, two young men in constant contact with the law, a man who works in a movie theater and a young woman. Two people throughout the movie have a man who has something about the wind. Every character has a problem with family or friends or just living. <br /> <br /> The movie is located in Antwerp and shows beautiful pictures of the city and harbor. Events that day cannot be explained easily. I recommend watching movies easily. There are too many to say. But I can say that the Barten has excellent camera performance and uses a lot of music. (Mostly dance music, not rock music) to create a mood especially for a party that is filled with great music With life, maybe you have to live and not waste it or have false moral truth. <br /> <br /> In short, it's worth it!
