De Sika became one of my favorite directors. But this one is very popular for me The smiling boy who is smiling becomes the leader of the illegal settlement community in a deserted area outside Milano. It is a detailed and sparkling story of a naive mass that is filled with evil capitalists and happy police forces, but it gradually evolved into a magic fantasy tale. Super unlimited. I arrived here with Toto who smiled after 10 minutes and when the magic came in I was left in the dust. There are many great things to prepare for the great characters among the settlers. I think it's a waste of time because this movie is not serious about its content. The Congress of neorealism and fantasy emerged in the more experimental of "see-what-we-can-do-moms", in order of more than a piece of work / art that is fully developed.
