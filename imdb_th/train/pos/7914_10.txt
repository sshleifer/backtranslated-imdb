I might see this movie for the first time in about 1995. Since then, I have come back to see it many times. It's great! I like the first clip and two clips, especially "creation" and "civilization". Wow! This is a very cool picture of the CG CG animation age that is older than me. As I know, the movie "Tron" was created 7 years before my time. But this movie is a landmark in the early 1990s. It may be the first collaboration of various CG experiments defined in music. I like it a lot. I think I'm going to watch it now.
