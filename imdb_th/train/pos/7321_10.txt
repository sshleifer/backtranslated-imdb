Halloween is one of the best examples of independent movies. It works out very well and has more psychological elements than you know immediately. It's a simple movie that can be said very well. This song is perfect and one of the most haunting scores ... If you haven't watched this movie, you have to try it. The actors were excellent. I hope they never continue the sequel after the sequel. The first one is the best and should end as it used to be without having a sequel. It was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie. It seems that she isn't old. (Today she is so beautiful, no clothes, hairstyles and seventies). The scene through the mask is one of the most terrifying things ever!
