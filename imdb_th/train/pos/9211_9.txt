Action, horror, sci-fi, director of exploitation Fred Olen Ray shows that he has special abilities as a director. The character William Smith is one of the strongest men in the industry. He treats the audience with the best performance of his career. For Randy Travis, he gave Lee Van Clef the best impression. He wasn't bad in Smith and Travis. For the remaining actors, no one really stands out. Ray performed very well in directing this flick. Smith and Travis were good. I would give this West B award to level one to ten.
