Clean family themed movies I laughed. I cried ... I like it a lot. I was worried. I couldn't see Steve Carrell as anything but Michael. Stupid from The Office. Of course I will buy this DVD when it comes out. My husband enjoys it and he is not a movie of this type Of course, only 1 word cuss! Not even sure why it is PG13. I would like to recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy, drama, romance and more!
