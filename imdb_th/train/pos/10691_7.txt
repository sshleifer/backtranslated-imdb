Last night I caught this dish. I like movies I traveled to Russia 3 times (accepting our 2 children). I couldn't put my finger on why I liked this movie, in addition to seeing "bad", opening "good" and "good", changing "semi-bad". I liked the picture. The look that Bet Chaplin has throughout the story, such as "I can't believe that this is happening to me", whether good or bad, it looks the same. (And it works) The great ending 7/10 Rent or catch it on the plate as I do.
