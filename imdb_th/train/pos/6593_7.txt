I have watched this movie twice and thought it was quite good for the limited equipment used to create this movie (filmed in 1947). Dr. Heyer Dahl explained his theory of migration. Of the Indo-Czechoslovakian Indians of South America to the Polynesian Islands by means of a large balsala tree raft This film follows Dr. Heyer Dahl and his team as they chose the Balsa tree in Equator and drifted with them into the Pacific River for a rally in Peru. They launched a 101-day marine adventure to test the strength of their original raft that survived by the means available only to the natives of that era. See for yourself the real adventure!
