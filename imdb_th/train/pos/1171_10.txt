I found that now is one of the most fun stories I've seen for a long time. South Park's garden creator has made the best Romero movie I've ever seen. They experience the basic social criticism of Romero that he does with each of his films. I like to know what George Romero's opinion is now. I'm sure it is truly positive! Maintain his true vision for his complete zombie epic! Most of the deceit dealt with innocent blood without making the audience think Romero was trying to do with his movie. I think if there is an outbreak of zombies, we may be concerned about our property values ​​before our lives, as shown now!
