Cliffhanger is a crime adventure that is suitable for the director Renny Harlin, who admires the creation of this film about an expert climber who finds himself being held hostage to a friend by a dangerous criminal gang. Full of stolen cash Rocky Mountains Sylvester Stallone is impressive while Gabe Walker, an expert climber, especially in the action / fighting scene, but some people stick to unrealistic genres. For the sake of the film, although I am willing to suspend my disbelief The remaining actors, including John Lithgow, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner, Rex Linn, Caroline Goodall and Leon, were regarded as characters in the film. Action / battle sequences have been performed well. But as mentioned earlier, some things may not be very realistic. The climbing sequence is very good, because instead of making a whole movie in a studio somewhere in the place where they choose to feel very real and the scenery of the Ariel mountains in that mountain is even more realistic. For movies Death is an invention while others can guess. The villain is strong. But it would be better if they focus more on the center rather than having them. The pace of the movie is a bit slow. But the advantages are good compared to bad in this matter. If you are a big fan of Harlins or Stallone more than likely, you will enjoy it as well. Overall, Cliffhanger has developed characters with action, drama, suspense, excitement, excitement and good performances from The actor makes this movie worth the time to watch.
