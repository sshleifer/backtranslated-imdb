When I started watching "Fay Grim" I didn't know that it was the sequel of "Henry Fool". Now, the latter is not a movie that I imagined had a sequel. But has arrived and is quite good I think you've seen the original, so I won't explain it. This started with Fay (Parker Posey) living with her son, whom she had been with Henry Henry. Simon (James Urbaniak) remained in prison. One day, his son was fired. From school to bring porn toys to school But this is not an ordinary toy It is a secret that explains many things that happened in the first movie. And this secret digs deeper into political politics than "Syriana". <br /> <br /> I must say that I am quite impressed with what Hal Hartley can do here. But it looks good what happens in the world And finally opens up the opportunity for the sequel. <br /> <br /> Starring Jeff Goldblum
