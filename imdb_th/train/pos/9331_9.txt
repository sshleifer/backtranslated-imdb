This movie was screened last week and although at that time of the day (around 6:00 pm), the quality of the movie is almost bad (At least on a Mexican TV) I can't turn off the TV. The story about Madelene Moore really touched you. At first, she didn't see a very sympathetic character. But seeing the whole movie, you just want her to succeed. This movie makes you miss And I think it's because of Brooke Johnson's wonderful performance. I have never heard of her before and have never seen her in other films. But it was a great performance, praising Brooke. I hope to see you in other movies soon
