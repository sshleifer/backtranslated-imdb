I was given the opportunity to watch this movie in 1926 in a beautifully restored theater that was once part of the Warp Music Theater. This great, great Wurlitzer organ has also been beautifully restored - which used to coincide with the silent film of that day. <br /> <br /> We were lucky enough to have Dennis James, who was a major figure in the movie revival. International silence at playing the appropriate Mighty Wurlitzer, music and mind elements suitable for action on film Typing is a complete digital copy of almost all of the decaying rotting nitrates and the whole experience is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to watch silent movies as they should be. <br /> <br /> This is the first American film of Greta Garbo. She is only 20 years old but has 6 Swedish movies in her drama. <br /> <br /> It's quite ridiculous that this is a movie. About opera star, although a significant increase in the Mighty Wurlitzer. mise-en-scene But it is necessary to have a lot of imagination. <br /> <br /> Most modern audiences do not understand the movie quietly ?? The performance is different from that, with a broad gesture and extensive facial expressions. So the audience laughed at an inappropriate time ?? The show was seen as 'hammy' and exaggerated, but it was just the style of that era. <br /> <br /> Garbo, with all her subtlety, made many things to lead. New era of acting: She can speak more with half closed eyes. Read quickly down or shrug easily She is an example of the fact that `A picture is a thousand words. <br /> <br /> Although Garbo's first American film But clearly, the studio knows that they have something in hand: this is the creation of the MGM movie. It's the best. Which current standards are relatively weak Still exciting and amazing. <br /> <br /> The script by Vicente Blasco Ibanez (from Entre Naranjos's novel) seems to be something created for Garbo; It shows her strength, expanding her assets, and without annoying language problems in management: Swedish actresses can play Spanish tempters without stopping to believe in our part. <br /> <br /> Her co-actors are MGM. Rudolph Valentino's answer: Ricardo Cortez. He's an admirable work and doing a few romantic stars that he had done in a movie: Allowing himself to look devoid. Wisdom looks stupid and Raw grown up fearlessly /> <br /> There are some <br quite well. The part of the character that serves more than enough ?? Especially when you consider Garbo's power plant What is notable among them is Lucien Littlefield as? Cupido 'and Martha Mattox are? DoÃ±a Bernarda Brull '<br /> <br /> This is when the filmmaker William H. Daniels meets Garbo ?? They made 20 movies together. (He is a movie photographer in 157 films and his career spans over five decades!) He can capture the beauty of her uniqueness and it is his photo that is responsible for the nickname she knows: The Divine Garbo. Without his beautiful ability, she would not have been as successful as he had ever been. <br /> <br /> Seeing this movie is a rare opportunity: If you have a chance, don't it slopes
