Many years ago I found a copy. "Bargain Bins" of this movie at a price of one or two in many ways "Row of Poverty", Majestic. However, while the film is relatively continuous, it is worth watching and giving a little surprise. <br /> <br /> The story is very familiar, just like in Some traditional cities, people are not happy because some people The last death that seems to be the work of a vampire! Adding to this familiarity is Dwight Frye. He plays Renfield in Dracula and here he is very similar - even though he plays strange, harmless people. In this case, he was obsessed with his pet bats and people began to blame him for his death. This film serves well in the provision. Some "red herrings" (such as false lure lines) and while it doesn't use geniuses to find fries may not be responsible for WHO and why it's interesting Average horror movie In addition, while the production has little money to talk about, there are still good actors of the day - Lionel Atwill and Melvin Douglas - and also using the Universal Studios series at night (when they were filming the whole day). As a result, the movie looks good overall. But I think that Fayray is usually very bad - think it won't deviate from the movie. I saw her in movies more than most people on IMDb, and I noticed that her character wasn't profound - she was often portrayed as "Women scream" and show new movies in each story. <br /> <br /> Overall, for old horror fans, this is great and worth watching. For those who are not fans of the genre, it can be skipped.
