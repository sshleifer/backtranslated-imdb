The literary genius of Vladimir Navokov was brought to the screen again, and many in the world that are trained will notice. The director puts us in a double examination with the story of Alexander, the missing chaplinesque study of addiction chess. Nastasya is vacationing in a resort with marble pillars, which is a place to manage a chess tournament She meets Alexander by picking up the queen piece that he drops through his coat pocket. The magnetic attraction evolves as he proposes the next day. The mother warns a telegram to her husband. He arrived and questioned Alexander. We faded in the past, ala 'Godfather II, where we saw Alexander, a wonderful boy. He was under the wing of the school teacher and took advantage of his genius for 10 years. Alexander thought that he reached the peak of his abandonment. But became a legend The old teacher caused harm, trying to win with the old rival Alexander. In a serious chess game where the victory in the World Chess Championship is one way of immortality, the chess clock will tick the time in the race to end to conclude the next day. That day was the wedding of Nastasya. The old teacher was disturbed and Alexander was sent to the nerves. Nastasya caught her stomach and looked through her mantle of love, found his strategy for the competition and followed the movement. Although this film is swaying from the roots of Russia But the cute low back dress Alexander plays lightly. The director evaluates her audience low. We almost never played and the only hint of Luzhin Defense. King's opponent with 3 paws & your king to sacrifice the castle to suit your partner. Nastasya is a great game. But feel the conclusion that deserves more concentration But perhaps the right emotion to check chess means more to him than her. The Luzhin Defense honors Navokov gracefully. The complexity of his work in the image is a global event that should not be missed.
