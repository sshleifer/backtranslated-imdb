I didn't expect much from this movie. But it's not bad. Actually, it's quite good. This movie is part of the most fun writing I've ever seen from movies. Now I don't say that this is one of the most fun movies of all time. But I laughed hard in some parts "The police decided that my father's suicide was a suicide. They said that he fell into the elevator shaft. Now this movie is not for everyone. Humor is mostly stupid, like Zoolander or Dodgeball; So if you hate these movies, I may suggest you avoid them. Overall, it's a fun movie about a group of superhero fans who eventually become real heroes. It is a very exaggerated comedy that many people may not have seen because, like me, before watching it, expecting it to be rubbish. After watching this movie, I finally understood why this film was able to collect great actors such as Ben Stiller, William H. Macy, Hank Azaria and even children from Good Burger because the Mystery Man was full of moments. Great funny writing 7 of 10 Great surprises
