Very few movies have an impact on American culture in the way that Urban Cowboy has a Thanksgiving. It's temporary, but UC is almost in the class by himself as one of those movies that when you flip the channel at 3:00 You can't keep your eyes on it .... My third rank is Animal House and Walking Tall. BTW, but that's the point. I remember that Urban Cowboy entered the theater and there were open honkytonks every corner. Penny loafers and boots, and if you do not know how you two steps, it is a wise man in society! Personally, I think it's a great movie. Travolta was really surprised at the heels of SatNiteFever. Who would be thunk? He also believed. Great soundtrack Charlene Tilton is terrible from Dallas's television reputation, destroying Johnny Lee's career, making that man so wonderful. The act of cheating here is Scott Glenn as a former cowboy, a radical gangster. And I don't have nothing compared to being a semi-bull of greaser ex-con, but I'm jealous of what I feel is the greatest power ever .... "Pack-at S * # t!" Clint's "Do my day" and watch him slap Sissy around. It's the closest thing I can see with my Julia Roberts fantasy. So ..... like I say beautiful 9/10
