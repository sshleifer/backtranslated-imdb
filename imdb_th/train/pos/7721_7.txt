UFO (By letter) by about 20 crews exploring space, traveling hundreds of millions of light years from Earth to investigate in the colony, established 25 years ago on a world that is forbidden What they found was a robot that was more advanced than anything imaginable in the world, a beautiful and totally incapable young woman, and her father, philosopher, hermit who was haunted over the demons of the ancient civilization he had absorbed. <br /> <br /> On the surface, this story is a terrifying murder mystery. Some people compare it to the Shakespeare's Tempest, but this is a stretch, and in some ways is a Scifi insult. What makes this movie a sci-fi movie is of course the movie The Tempest, but how many similar stories can you say? br /> <br /> Under this is a story that warns in advance about the progress and technology and social evolution needed for proper use. of safety But the film continues with the hope for our future that we expect from the show, Star Trek. <br /> <br /> Anne Francis is not the only reason for This film is the most beautiful. The special effects and the beauty of the background are powerful enough to make the director who is not inspired and acts unevenly almost invisible. If not for Retro-art-deco-ness of props sci-fi in the 1950s. You might think you are watching the parts of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> This is a classic of a very special sub-genre of sci fi.

(Especially at the highest point of the movie) Walter Pigeon, although very good in other films, he also played his role as well. Mrs. Francis Earl Holman and Robby the Robot are outstanding actors in this crowd. But overall, the actors in this series do very well. I think the problem with acting that is outstanding is the fault of the director and the editor as much as anything, even if they are most definitely given.
