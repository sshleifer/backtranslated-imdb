This film has been described as a joke. But it's not a joke. Like all Panahi movies, it is a very realistic drama that shows social inequality and hypocrisy, but it's very funny, much lighter than the darkness and seriousness of the director. (Iranian movies, my favorite story) The wealth of girls and teasing between them and soldiers are completely believable. (As if it were a documentary) and completely hilarious. <br /> <br /> The actual shooting and the consequences were amazing. It adds Australian realism like Kenny. Of course, it's a very different movie. <br /> <br /> Every performance from non-professional actors ?? Soldiers and girls? Is very reliable It is very moving when seeing the passion, disappointment and excitement of these women. Everyone in this country who thinks Muslim women wear chador dresses, unlike their own daughters, should go to see this movie ?? It will be a real eye opening. <br /> <br /> For me, the military represents the current paradigm. They started by responding to the official policy of shares that responded to all the needs of girls. When the movie proceeded, they found it more difficult to maintain this position. When what seems like everyone in Tehran is divided into a fierce celebration, everyone is stuck in it and the laughter of the current policy is evident that one person and everyone. Unexpected ending And make the movie a good mix of emotions, insignificance, drama and social commentary Although it is an adult movie But I think that children with seven or more adult ideas will like this movie. (As long as they can read the narrative) <br /> <br /> It is remarkable that countries that suppress such as Iran Producing films of this quality by the likes of Panahi and Kiarostami. Perhaps the constraints that forced the director to be extremely wealthy. Australian film makers (and others) can take this book out.
