Time is not kind to this movie. When the controversial adaptation of Jeffrey Konvitz's best seller, now this movie looks like a typical version of your typical spookfest, a gruesome touch. (Especially the mania in the final scene of the drama) This is a shiny horror movie for those people who are not very interested in this genre. It has a special role in a small role (Jose Ferrer, Ava Gardner, Eli Wallach, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken and many others), but there are some things that tell me that producers want such expensive performers to convince. Audience Not your average lowbrow movie (Producers of the 1970s disaster film have similar concepts) I like to see familiar faces. But the story is very stupid, and no matter how much the movie pretends to be a nobleman, it operates at the level of the average exploitation of the 70s movies (not entirely bad). Especially for viewers who enjoy watching the stars As usual, the lacquer of Albert Whitlock is outstanding, quite fun.
