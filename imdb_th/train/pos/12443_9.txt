I enjoy this movie It was a joy to see a model close to the vision of Peter O'Donnell. <br /> <br /> A lot of people don't like this movie. The film uses a retrospective story to show modesty. Of the child and the event that made her become the woman she became Before the previous network, Willie Garvin <br /> <br /> The rhythm was a little slow and for my taste it wasn't enough to develop in the current scene. However, this is only acceptable to get a honest version. <br /> <br /> If you like Modesty Blaise, you will enjoy it, even if there are bugs if you want to flick the action with the car chase br /> <br /> It feels like being the first franchisee. But when I never saw it move anywhere now, I wonder if nobody will follow anymore. Sad.
