<br /> <br /> In the 1970s, after a five-year absence, Kurosawa made what would be his first movie in the color of the D-Ka-Den. <br /> <br /> This name comes from the voice that a mentally impaired boy did while he imagined that he was practicing train. We gradually get to know more people in the small community. Two drunken people who do Trade wives because they were not satisfied with what they have. The old man who is the center of the city that helped the thief who tried to rob him. A poor father and son who couldn't find a house, so they imagined themselves. At the end of the story, the whole story came to a full extent. Some were happy and sad. <br /> <br /> Since this is Kurosawa's first color film, you can see that he uses it for his benefit. And it shows. Maybe too much This movie goes in many different directions and it is difficult to settle and enter the story. But don't understand me wrong. Dodes' Ka-Den may not be the best Kurosawa but from the greatest director of all time. It's better than 99% of movies today.
