Darius Goes West is an amazing teenage documentary (Weems) with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and his 11 friends who take him across the country to see "Pimp My Ride" will pimp his wheelchair. >> I just watched this movie at Sunscreen Film Festival. It was played twice during the festival. This film is an amazing story about the human soul and the souls of Weem's friends. I don't talk about this often about movies. But after watching this movie, I felt that I had done something to find the cause. Every film festival is involved in this film, receiving some awards. It is in the Tribeca Film Festival and will go to London and Athens, Greece. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie won the Academy Awards. It was a snowball out of control. If anyone has the opportunity to watch this movie, no matter where they play, go! Take as many people as possible and go! It is heading to New Orleans for the film festival, then going to Atlanta and Palm Beach, Florida. Darius comes from Georgia, so I expect tickets for the show in Atlanta to sell out quickly if it's not open. Please go and watch this movie! DGW (talking about it) <br /> <br /> -Kish
