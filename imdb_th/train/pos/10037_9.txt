The boat may not sink but the movie !!! Director James Cameron from 'The Terminator' made it again with this amazing image. One of my favorite scenes is the scene. 'Dinner table' where Rose's family and friends meet with Jack after he saves her life. Rose has a look that every girl should have when you meet 'THE ONE' ... I wish I had That way, when I was in the room with my future husband, <br /> <br /> Jack and Rose had a connection that was 'MOVIE STUFF' but it was a good movie. We have a coveted mother and her wonderful colleague who is attached to her husband's wealth. Rose almost killed himself, but the actor Gilbert Grape saved her life. I liked hanging over the boat scene. It's a great risk. <br /> <br /> This movie has a long time. But it's great !!! Good story, good flow, good actor !!! Go see twice if you want it worth it !!!
