My girlfriend and I have things for android So I tried to search for movies with robots. And this movie has a big robot. They beat the clang and hit each other with the fate of various nations hanging on top It's really cool. You have to forgive this movie. It has many flaws and just trying to appreciate what the director and his mechanic team can put on the screen while working with things that are obviously a limited budget. It's very difficult not to. Like this movie Because the big robot They look like Transformers and fight like a professional wrestler! It makes my boyfriend smile And that was good enough for me And a special mention must be made from an experienced character like Paul Koslo: a ruthless Russian villain, no matter how mercilessly trampled his opponent, tasting "like blood" (The lines that he sent with a subtle accent of delicious Bela Lugosi) He clearly had a ball and this film gave a lot of benefits when he was on the screen. This is a good little flick that deserves the reputation of the cult.
