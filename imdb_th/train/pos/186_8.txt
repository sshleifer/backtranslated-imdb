There are some great things about this movie. Marion Davies is able to act because he has received the right rights. She's great in funny roles. William Haines can be shown and you can see why he is one of the most famous leaders of the screen. (Until the scandal that may have forced him to leave the business) <br /> <br /> The story is quite boring. But managed beautifully until you didn't notice The King's direction is one of the main reasons for this. Producer? Genius Boy Irving Thalberg <br /> <br /> It's about making movies, and you will see the process that happened in 1928. Camera, series, director, director and actor. You will see some stars in the daytime. Even Charlie Chaplin turned to find his signature. You also see a glimpse of Eleanor Boardman, Elinor Glyn, Claire Windsor, King Vidor and many others who are just names and old photographs. <br /> <br /> Please, even if you're not a fan of silence Take the time to watch this movie when you can. It was a really wonderful journey back in time.
