I like this movie But as everyone says, there is something that is not developed enough. I personally think that girls are very fun before they go to jail. Of course, they should be innocent American girls. Still ... I feel that they lack the ties that the best friends should have. For example, in the editing, they see how they hold together to take pictures. Looks awkward. <br /> <br /> Then there are some parts that are not clear. I think it is quite understandable that Danes' characters didn't do that. But I can see that it can be confusing In addition, why did the camera live on Manat, which was horribly expressed after he placed the bag in their taxi's trunk? I think it's something to suggest. But it turned out that nothing. <br /> <br /> In addition, this movie was great. I cry when Claire Dennes takes the blame. She is a great actress. <br /> <br /> I also want to see that Thai prisoners with this illness will be kicked in her ass. Speaking about the lack of closure ...
