As my Beatlemaniac, I approached the two of us with a combination of fear and passion when seeing 'in his life: the story of John Lennon.' I was quite worried that the two of us wouldn't be better. The fact that Aidan Quinn and Jared Harris have nothing like John Lennon and Paul McCartney? Even with makeup and suitable for some hair styles ?? Can't help a little. <br /> <br /> But I was very surprised. It may be due to the involvement of Michael Lindsay-Hogg, director of Let It Be in the 1970s, and probably knowing that John and Paul are quite good about the characters and the dialogue that they believe (The writing credits for the two of us were given to a man named Mark Stanfield, which I didn't know at all. I'm sure the director Lindsay-Hor has more to do with the script.) The two of us are not. The biography of The Beatles; It really has a plot that happened on the same day in New York City. Imagine a meeting between John and Paul in 1976, while John lived in New York. Of course, that meeting was all a lie? Even if it cannot prove that such a meeting actually happened But with imaginative conversations, we can see the personality of these great musicians? Their intellect, humor, their different reactions to celebrities and most of all relationships; What makes them a great team and what makes them break? <br /> <br /> Since it's a movie, there is nothing more than talking between two characters for an hour and a half. Really boring, fans of The Beatles; But it is a great writing and storytelling and has both information and touch For those who are interested in both music giants, you will be quickly shocked that the actors are different from their partners and how John and Paul come back to life again? An intimate and convincing screenplay and a committed actor like that. The two of us give you valuable knowledge about the lives of both geniuses and sad and funny stories. Most definitely recommended
