So when I was young I received this movie as a gift and my sister and I loved it. We will watch it all the time. When our friends come in, we will sleep and we will look at the mountains, big stone candy and grandfather's magic toys. I am now 21 years old and I still love this movie. Some old friends and I just gathered and watched it. We knew all the songs and we danced and talked about how much we hate Profster. A friend bought. This movie and the grandfather's toys for her 2-year-old daughter, because she wants to convey our love in this movie. This is a movie that you can let children watch and feel safe, no violence, no bad language, great music and many important lessons.
