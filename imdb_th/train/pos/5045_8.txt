This film is complete in what it is, making one that is constantly interested in childhood events and growing up with bizarre dads and interspersed with the tail of successive murders, one simply can't go wrong. The story itself. The story and essence of this movie is fun. It's a story that director (Bill Paxton) can do a lot with, and in this case he does a lot with it. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, you expect more and more about things. That happened and where the movie went and the creativity behind this story was first class I felt as if the film was elaborately done from beginning to end and one of those rare gems that seemed to have no dull lullabies - the action flowed in a mess, fast and tight from one scene to another. One <br /> <br /> It shows how far people can go: to do this horrible thing to those who love and do evil in the name of God. He is indifferent to this event. Sometimes it's an interesting 'twist & a with the concept of moral /> <br /> Overall Overall this was <br kind of movies that are easily visible. But I suggest you do the same And to watch this movie - it's worth your time
