Never watched this movie in 1971 and was greatly entertained by this great creation created by Walt Disney Studios and the creation of an excellent animation Angela Lansbury, (Eglantine Price). A prominent role as a woman who studied witches and was an apprentice who started flying brooms and had little problems. Eglantine discovered many tricks and could travel to different parts of the world. Her final exam became a successful witch. Mr. Emerlius Browne (David Tomlinson) is the seller of the Eglantine course in spells and he tries to help her in every way to find a solution to her problems. About her madness and that is to stop the Nazis from evading England Great family entertainment and we need more movies today.
