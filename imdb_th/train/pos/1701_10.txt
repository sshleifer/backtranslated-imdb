This is a ridiculous movie of people who are thinking. If you don't expect Star Wars and enjoy English humor, this may become a classic cult for you as well as my wife and me - from the "voice" performances of Cary Grant and Jack. Nicholson's Big bean is a movie that you can sleep, relax or watch carefully and enjoy one way. <br /> <br /> It's not for everyone. But if you enjoy simple humor, relax with a quick mind to see jokes. As you flow, you will enjoy this movie.
