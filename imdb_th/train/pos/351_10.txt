It is a colorful movie. It's about it. <br /> <br /> It has a mysterious element that SCREAM has been popular in slasher movies, but I have never been interested in things. Considering who is a bad person is not interesting because of that clue. <br /> <br /> The scene of death is an invention and fear. <br /> <br /> Another good story about this movie is that it is difficult to identify the surviving woman. Different from SCREAM Each IKWYDLS /> <br /> obvious dislike <br slasher movie will not like this movie. As easy as I truly enjoy it and I plan to watch it again while waiting. <br /> <br /> --MB
