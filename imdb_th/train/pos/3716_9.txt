Last night I was watched by a pocket nutcracker before the movie trailer of Disney's hole. I don't know who decides to show But I'm very happy that they made Cracker Bag the most complete gem in Australia in the early 1980s. When looking through the eyes of a child, "conversation" between Eddie and her brother is funny and the rest of the movie. This is true for life. Each shot brings great nostalgia because it reminds me of my childhood. (The same age that the director may help a little) and the sound adds to the feeling. I hope I can see the pocket nutcracker again on some days.
