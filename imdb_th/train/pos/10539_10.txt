This is a good movie. But not recommended if you don't like intelligent movies It's about two men who hope the world will disappear and that's what they get. The performance is excellent, the ending is unpredictable, and actually it has a good story, unlike most movies today. People complain that the film is too simple or boring. I think they should stick to movies like The Toxic Avenger (I actually like the movie B) or The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy. One note: If you notice this, there are the same actors from the Cube except the four actors person Make two notes: wait after the credit (Trust me in this) Watch the movie for fun.
