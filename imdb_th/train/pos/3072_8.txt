Panic is a terrifying little gem of a movie - you think you have only thought out in the first half hour to realize it with great pleasure that Henry Bromell is a much better writer / director. <Br /> <br /> The film was created slowly with a quietly devastating scene. After that, another scene was starring William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter and a child actor. Amazing At the end of me David Dorfman used to be the son of Macy's, who saw his line as if they were creating ideas that were not defined in his heart. This movie will be with you long after the credits have accumulated.
