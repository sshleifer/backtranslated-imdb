*** Spoiler *** *** Spoiler *** Full of memorable moments (Like the above words immortalized by Primus). The delivery tells the story of four people who are traveling in the jungle rafting to go rafting. And flee from the big city for a while to find that their fun has changed soon This is not a Hollywood movie. There are almost no special effects. The settings are very realistic and nothing is sugar or beautiful. The boys in the city look like boys in the city and even the strongest man Louis, who shows the accuracy by Bert Reynolds, clearly being the mercy of the wild on the journey. Hold this This is a perfect example of the movie What-if. What if there were two friends rafting in a river that was unaccustomed and ended in a desperate attempt to avoid trial and conviction on charges? Murder as they are forced to save themselves? > <br /> Obviously there is a very strong element of the movie related to social structure and class and relationships. (Or lack of it) between rural and urban residents When the four men arrived in the forest at the beginning of the movie, they didn't know how to interact with people who lived there clearly, and they spoke to them as if they weren't sure they understood or could. Communicate This communication block has the most memorable illustrations in the battle scenes in which they try to refuel in cars and trucks and take the driver along the waterway, while Drew and the boy with a markedly impaired brain May have to fight with guitar and banjo (One of the best scenes in the movie) Louis is having trouble buying gas and Bobby commented on genetic defects. How pathetic it is When the boy turned from Drew, who offered to shake hands after an amazing jam session, Bobby told him to give the child a few dollars for the child knowing that no one was sure how to respond. <br /> <br /> This is what we see in the rescue that creates many tensions. This wonderful scene that has lots of fun. (Including the scene that 'dance the narrow-minded' the most fun until O Brother, Where Art Thou?) Ends with everyone not sure what to do with each other These people are apples and oranges and they live according to a completely different life rule. The people of Louis Bobby Drew and Ed face up to the hills growing up, separated from modern society and modern law, and live according to the laws of nature, which do not include you will not be killed. Confused with their awkward behavior, the four friends set out on the river, hoping that the weirdness would end and for the adventure to start. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler) When they were separated Bobby ran into a country outside the river that changed smoothly. The uncertainty about how these people lived - which was founded by the scenes above - came to create the most tension in the scene. I think the good symbol of this quality thriller is the tragic element of the movie, which is physical assault and murder. It actually takes a little time to show the movie. But still the most memorable part of the movie There is no violence here. Everything is intended for clear purposes and surprisingly powerful results. <br /> <br /> The movement is about a violent clash of two different types of people. Very different and what can happen when They find themselves in war unintentionally. Traveling along the remaining river after the attack, which spends most of the movie, creates an amazingly powerful tension and allows you to sit on the edge of your seat while not bombing you until dazed. It was surprisingly effective when we found that Ed might have killed the wrong person on the cliff well and the tension in the film didn't stop when the three members of the team survived to the bottom of the river. Because they sent a suspicious explanation to the police about what happened there on the river and why the brother-in-law's secondary disappeared. <br /> <br /> This is a very annoying movie that is a testament to Its success, because it is clear that the film is intended to make people slightly shaky. Hillbillies are human beings (such as being more realistic), a version of sub-intolerance seen in children's movies. But quite similar, such as Gator Bait and Gator Bait 2, which can not be compared to immortal movies such as Deliverance. When we follow these four men during the weekend, their fate in the forest is a natural element that is true and We will get to know these people very well and in a delicate form that is almost like us as individuals. The fifth member of the team Often this film can pass.
