I may be one of the few people attached to this movie. I saw this movie when it came out and I agree with the latest post that Up The Acedemy is a way ahead of time. Humor in movies is a pure MAD magazine. I don't see why MAD doesn't support this feature. It is also one of the few films in the early 80s that had a soundtrack that came with the punk band and a new wave band that was born at that time. I own the soundtrack and I play it all the time to this day. What can I say? There are some of the worst movies. Of course, I don't think Porky will be funny like Up The Academy. There are some really good laughter in this movie and the jokes will fall into the pattern or act Hey, no one said that this would be The Maltese Falcon.
