Super Speedway makes a great demonstration of your new DVD / bigscreen / 5.1 channel audio system. The IMAX camera puts you in a race car where you cruise along various routes at high speed, reminiscent of the driving sequence in the Grand Prix (If it only appears on the DVD!) I enjoy watching again and again. <br /> <br /> The only negative and why I don't give 10 is the order of some driving. This story was accelerated. The soundtrack also needs a little faith suspension, all of which you hear in a real car is the engine. You will not hear the noise when you walk along the bridge.
