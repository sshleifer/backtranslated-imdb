I felt a little protection of this movie because it was my introduction to U.N.C.L.E.-Converse. The year was 1972 and I.TV ran all eight properties in one bumper running. (Followed again - the run of the cast by actor Tony Curtis and Roger Moore) on Saturday evening, 'The Karate Killers' was chosen to open the season. It started with a cool action scene, while the Solo and Kuryakin sports cars were attacked by THRUSH's mini-police women. I'm a big fan of life from that moment. <br /> <br /> After Get the main credit (Pleased to see the sequence of special titles here instead of the usual practice of slowing action.) We went to Dr.'s lab. .Simon True (Jim Boles), the inventor of a new formula for extracting gold from sea water. True wife Amanda (Joan Crawford) has a relationship with the agent THRUSH Randolph (Herbert Lom), a brutal friend. He killed both the doctor and his wife. Before hunting for True recipes prepared for the event - he divided it into five parts, each one writing in his own photo and sending it to all his five daughters, all scattered around the world. <br /> <br Single and Kuryakin out The way to receive the formula for the first time leads to various chapters in various locations and hijacked from Telly Savalas's television program (an Italian version with an aura). Terry-Thomas and Curt Jurgens, one of the daughters of Dr. True-Sandy (Kim Darby) - Along with UNCLE, a boy on a mission around the world <br /> <br /> Collect the THRUSH formula back and make them deliver before taking them to The secret base in the North Pole ... <br /> <br /> From UNCLE, all feature films, this is what I feel should be produced specifically for the cinema. It hurts by being a television product even though it is slightly more expensive than usual. There was no filming of places and groups. Repeatedly found that in general would cause debris between UNCLE and THRUSH of the actors. Joann Crawford played a large role in her small role and Kurt. Gurgens expressed displeasure as Terry-Thomas's sugar dad was as happy as he had never done before, and Herbert Wind was the villain leader. Kim Darby is considered 'Sandy'. She should be ordered to stay at home. <br /> <br /> The surprising thing about this is that it will create more fun and entertainment than many official movies. Times include 'In Like Flint' Casino Royale 'and' The Ambushers'. I like to know how Solo and the company escaped from THRUSH HQ after Randolph's death, though.
