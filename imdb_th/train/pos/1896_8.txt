Arthur is a personal movie for me for two reasons. My good friend who worked in this movie was special and helped out with the horse in a stable scene recently. If you look fast, you can see Frank Graham during the back restaurant scene while Dudley Moore and Jill Eikenberry are chatting. Frank is a champion horseman and will not miss anyone who knows him. <br /> <br /> Secondly, even though I actually know the real life of Arthur Bach, he is not as rich as Arthur but takes 47 Year in general life as a child His parents tightly control his purse. But his rent and utility bills were paid in an underground apartment in Greenwich Village. He spent a lot of time making himself drunk with various spirits and showing himself to the public as Dudley Moore did. /> <br /> The doubt with Arthur is the reason why everyone doesn't care about his wealth. But that is the other half of the equation My friend is the most charming person when you know him. In fact, it is almost a charming force. He couldn't buy a newspaper or magazine without trying to build a relationship with the seller to a certain extent. He lives his life as a perfect party guest. The wasteland that is commonly used in the 19th century will be used for him. <br /> <br /> And that's what Dudley Moore is a wasteland. Unlike my friend, Moore had John Gielgud to clean up after him. That's a routine that we see in Arthur. My friend never met Liza Minnelli, who was Liza Minnelli, male because he was gay. Moore's image is still Moore's Arthur, which is accurate and true to me. <br /> <br /> Arthur, who was a wilderness in the 20th century, was forced to marry. With another trusting child fund Because he will not work for a living, threatening to be cut is true for him He only had Butler Hobson, played by John Jill Kut and driver Bitterman, played by Ted Post to pour out his problems. We should all have problems like this. <br /> <br /> John Gielgud, in almost a century of his life, worked better in Arthur on film and in fact Gielgud is clearly known for performing on. His stage, but in 1981, was a year of confidence in Oscar. The Academy awarded Oscars to Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn for On Golden Pond and Gielgud, who received the Best Supporting Actors Award for Lifelong Work. The man was amazing, still in his craft until the end. <br /> <br /> So Frank Graham, who worked in this film and with Jackie Weis Arthur in real life I truly dedicate this opinion.
