Lol!!! Delirious. Very funny .. I tears. Eddie Murphys impression is the exact point. The best impression is James Brown and Mr T> SO FUNNY !! It's strange that Eddie Murphy is back, and now he's something to watch. But if you don't like the language that is rude, don't look But amazing and funny .. I have seen it 6/7 times and still pee myself every time .. This is Eddie Murphy, his key and you can see how he gets the humor and ideas Movies like Mad Teacher from He impresses the family as well, which is really funny. <br /> <br /> If I were only there ...
