I think "The River of Souls" is a very good Babylon 5 movie with special performances from Martin Sheen, Tracy Scoggins and Ian MacShane. If this is the episode of the series (Without humor) It may be one of my favorite stand-alone stories in the series. <br /> <br /> Personally, I tend to like Scoggins and Christians. JMS didn't write her either for Serie And you have to be patient with the plot of Byron / Telepath. If you bring out the mischievous humor about the brothels and actors "Poor" in those scenes shows that this movie is a stable story. May be my third favorite in four movies. But not bad at all
