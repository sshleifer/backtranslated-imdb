It's very rare to find a movie that gives a plot that can't be thought of in every turn. Surprising throughout the joy. <br /> <br /> Two things I can't understand a lot are here. You have a female character who is a leader. "Good boy, hard worker" and at the end she ended Is an anti-social risk That's not enough to make me dislike it. But it makes me pause. <br /> <br /> The other thing I can't do is the old man being pulled away by the police. At the end of the movie, I never received who he was or his problems what is it If anyone has any ideas, I would like to hear what they might be <br /> <br /> The movie is always exciting and fun and makes me guess, always worth it.
