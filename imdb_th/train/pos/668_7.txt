I just watched "The Last Wave" in the school's fine arts library. It's an interesting thing, like everything of Peter Weir, but it doesn't attract as much attention as it should. I found myself fascinated by the idea that was thrown at me. (Because they were well taken care of by the director of the movie Weir) but at the same time I didn't get enough motivation from them. AKA I was bored at a little point. Aussie lawyer who is obsessed with some dreams that he connects him with the Aborigone group he protects. <br /> <br /> It starts with a series of extreme weather conditions and has a great emotional effect Some great The time (Especially strange sounds, "sound spraying" sound design) and strong direction; But it did not entertain me like the new movie of Weir I may have to see it again. <br /> <br /> A good movie about passion and mystery. Because in the end, the mystery that exists between the white and the Aboriginal people is very serious. <br /> <br /> May God bless Peter Weir. For him alone, this movie is worth watching ... a very natural director like Malick in Australia. I will give 7 because it has a good idea to overcome a boring time.
