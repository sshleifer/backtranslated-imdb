These two parts are the best since the series came back. The exact story is compressed from the previous movie. But what TV programs don't do today What we get here is the story of sci-fi. Big monster (Really scary) that was trapped at the base of a deep hole. Some great aliens in The Ood - the best "new" aliens in the revived series come with a set Human sympathetic drama Safety partner "No charge" Two people in Star Trek format, really, some large philosophical themes (Love, loyalty, faith, etc.) and some special effects on the drawer. <br /> <br /> I love every minute of this.
