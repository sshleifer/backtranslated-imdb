I do not remember seeing this one before tonight. It may be a very common name. But it is a western skill that has a compelling story that compliments by acting from good to repeating. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum slipped into an open city looking for a wife and daughter news. For a while as a city assistant Normally, good business people tend to have mixed emotions - they want to get rid of bad people. But like the business they bring It is still applicable: relax, drink laws and gambling and promote the industry. But pretending to reduce the impact on ordinary people There is something interesting about this film: Mitchum's violent image of going to clean the city of Baddie and the acceptance of the townspeople that his method of violence is the only thing a bit like: The sudden death of 2 of the baddies in the Red Dog saloon, but it's an effective way to fight the spread of poison. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a very good movie with The statistics alone are likely to be good - not very good for people who do not want to live in collective bargaining with evil, rather than end it.
