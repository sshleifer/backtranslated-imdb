Yesterday I watched this movie for the third time. It recommended to me by frying several weeks ago. I have never watched or noticed before because it falls into the category. "Swedish movies" and those who rise up (like me) and Hollywood productions often wonder in any foreign movie. Hell is a paradigm shift! The movie touches me because it keeps my hope forever that humanity can change in a better way. The Swedish village is just a form for all areas on the planet where people live together - controlled by religion, misunderstandings, lack of courage, predictions of cruelty that lurk External stimuli to cut the mask of everyone (stored) and to make them feel that we are all human beings who have the desire to live our own lives. I can't stop watching the story like this, because that makes my hope as described above. Five minutes with the story of Gabriella's music, including her performance as one of my movie highlights! Thank you Kay Pollak for only 5 minutes, which makes me happy!
