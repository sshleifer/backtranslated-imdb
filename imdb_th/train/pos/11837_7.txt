This is a great movie in many ways. Everyone in the family is happy. The animation is great and can be easily demonstrated that there are many manufacturers that create great movies like everything from Disney Studio. <br /> <br /> One difference from Disney fare. In general, the Dreamworks movie doesn't have a clever side-by-side kick feature to alleviate comedy. And there was no time when the characters were broken into songs I'm sure the scene at the beginning of the movie will not appear in Disney Pictures: The Birth of the Soul. But it is done tastefully and is not offensive at all. "Spirit" is a breath of fresh air. do not get me wrong I love Disney for many years and will continue. <br /> <br /> "Soul" is another example of a great animated film. As soon as it ended, my children wanted to look again. I have the same feeling I thoroughly recommend
