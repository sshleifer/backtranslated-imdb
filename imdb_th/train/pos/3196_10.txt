This movie is amazing for many reasons. Harris brought a very awkward documentary into a socially relevant Groovin 'comment. Gary is a small town boy who likes to imitate him. When he decided to play Olivia Newton John in a show of local talent (Which he was very passionate about) Gary's actions showed that he was in conflict with the conservative social environment in which he lived. This resulted in him having many reasons for his actions so that people would not think that in reality he was a homo or others. In the second part, Harris took advantage of the fight between you. Reed and Beaver in a novice attempt to create a narrative from the original documentary The third and final episode of the trilogy is truly remarkable for Harris' sensitivity to the story. Unlike the second part, "The Orkly Kid" shows that Gary is a truly problematic character. He struggled to be accepted within his own community without benefit. His secret to the example of Olivia Newton John made him far away from people who thought he was a heretic. This film is realistically transmitted as well as reality. It gives itself a lot of reactions. Of course, anyone can see that Gary is a ridiculously ridiculous character. But may indicate that he is an outcast
