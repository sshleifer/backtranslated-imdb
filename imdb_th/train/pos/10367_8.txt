When I saw "A Cry in the Dark" for the first time, I didn't know what the plan was. But when I saw it, I was shocked by what it showed. When I saw it for the second time in the Australian cinema class, I realized two issues: communication problems. Do you see that when dingo snatched the ball of Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep), she and Michael (Sam Neill), her husband, were not happy. As an Adventists Day, on the seventh day they believe that God wants this thing to happen and therefore they cannot mourn. But when people all over Australia saw that they had no grief, everyone began to believe that Lindy did it herself. <br /> <br /> The point is that the message is wrong, communicating with the public and causing people to turn against Lindy Although this is a pure accident But still happens It may be one of the biggest disasters caused by the existence of the media, regardless of the political views of any media. <br /> <br /> For the performance, Streep works very well with the Australian accent there. ) And Sam O'Neill is equally excellent You may be blown away by what you see here. Of course, one of the best movies of Fred Schepisi
