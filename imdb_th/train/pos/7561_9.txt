The version I saw in this movie is the movie Blockbuster for rent with a similar name. But as an oath in this story, <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke like hell. It is true with bones as well. If you've spent time in Hollywood or nearby, you'll understand humor. If not, you may not 'understand' it. <br /> <br /> The story of two people in a business that struggles to get until they reach the breaking point. It states that it is a drama. But it's a drama that Deer Hunter is a comedian. <br /> <br /> Lauren Dean is a great person, as always, as an actor. Jamie Kennedy can hold himself well. His performance is particularly impressive in the poodle scene. The only downside is Carmen Electra, but we don't have everything.
