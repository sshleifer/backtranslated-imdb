I have the opportunity to watch a lot of movies on BluRay and HD DVD. This movie continues to wonderfully and is a great story. Even if you are looking for a movie with great pictures But this is not it Without this movie on the DVD, it makes buying easier. I am happy with the intense performances and great performances that have not always been together. Overall, what makes this movie a fun and wonderful movie Now in the Blu Ray level in many Blu Ray movies, you will get two things. Images that are almost clear, without distortion or motion pictures with small HD images. I'm disappointed when I made my first Blu-ray movie. I almost started to think that this is a Blu-ray standard. Even after watching another movie, I know better. I do not believe that they spend as much time as they should to transfer this movie to hd. That is a general problem of some movies. And for the price of Blu Ray players and Blue Ray discs, you should only have the best images. So I think this is a worthwhile investment for people who have never watched a movie or didn't buy a DVD version.
