Whoopi is the only reason I watched Oscar that year. She is hilarious Of course, there is a very important part of the performance. She's great, not just because she's funny. But because she says something that needs to be said in the public forum White people must be reminded that the awards ceremony and representation of Hollywood is not caused by racial balance. There is no need to show "black" awards. Those nominations and judges milquetoast white bread must put their heads into the sunshine and see how good materials are not limited to directing "white skin" producers, actors and others. Allowing Woody Allen to be in the air He has no business there. The truth of this story is the first Oscar presentation I have watched since "The Color Purple" won the award. The failure to vote made me bitter when watching the show until 2002, which did not negate the presenter. other people Billy Crystal is a riot.
