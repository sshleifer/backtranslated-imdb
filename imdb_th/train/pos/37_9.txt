From the elements that make this the best. At this point, I must say # 1 is Christine McIntire. Shemp's scene when poisoned and her reaction is truly beautiful. I think, as one person suggested, Christine tried to hold back and laughed during that scene. But actually it makes her look even more scary Helping this thing stand out is a fool. His appearance is a great hybrid between horror and humor. The characters that I rarely choose to meet in the dark alley or for that matter everywhere. I would like a bit of a real investigation into this mystery. But wait, when is this good? Who will complain, not me?
