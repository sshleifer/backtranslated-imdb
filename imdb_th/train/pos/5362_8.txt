THE RUNNING MAN, along with the TOTAL RECALL, is my favorite Schwarzenegger movie. No, this isn't 2001, but it's not for you. And the performances and scripts here are not based on other Arnie movies such as PREDATOR or THE TERMINATOR, but I propose that the IDEA behind this film is one of the coolest games ever to watch the big screen. A state-sponsored game show in which criminals convicted of serious offenses must compete with "heroic" stalkers of all kinds. (No armed runners) to meet the sports and blood needs of the people. The highest prize for winning runners: independent, so the rules claim <br /> <br /> For movies that have a bloody death scene and a terrifying fleet, there are many things to say. There are others pointing out all the comments about the culture / government presented in this movie, so I won't go here. It can be said that if you can look beyond the stupid feelings of the movie, you will enjoy it a lot. (Especially if you are an avid SF fan who has a lot of imagination) as I said it didn't try to be a serious art movie But it was a surprise for the 80s shooting gun that was surprising. This evidence is borrowed from Richard Bachman's short novel. (Also known as Stephen King) but very different from the source, especially at the end (This book ends with destruction rather than having to say that this movie can't) I like both of them. But I like this movie better than <br /> <br /> My favorite line: "Guess it's caused by steroids"
