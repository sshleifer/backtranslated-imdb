I saw this on TV a long time ago, which I do not remember when it happened. But it still stands out as one of the most scary and scary movies I've ever seen With subtle fear But it is intense, which happens simultaneously by women in black who are lurking at the edge of the frame, not being able to see clearly, so you feel It is one of the few things that makes me afraid to watch. "Production value" is hanged. A good movie is about the director's ability to create an atmosphere using movies, actors, locations / music scenes, attention to detail and ... Imagine true gems.
