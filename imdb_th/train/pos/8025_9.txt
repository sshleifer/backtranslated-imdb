I love this movie The song and the story are very fun and the song "Saying Farewell" makes me move. It's a great thing to do to make the puppet live the way you really care about these things made of cloth and Fabric and whatever Great sound and great talent Why do stupid movies, other things that follow the movie, are so interesting, moving and less funny? That is Mr. Henson.
