"GI Samurai" saw Sonny Chiba and others being taken back to the feudal civil war in Japan without any reason and the killing took place. It is an article written on the top of the sword and a machine gun that gives the most interesting results. <br /> <br /> The plot runs along the tracks that you might expect from the name. Start the fish comedy show out of the water. ("What is this flying metal box?" Etc. etc.) "We're not better here" discussions and finally a great fight. This film does not give much importance to this story, most of the killings in the second half as the Samurai army fought with Chiba's division. One page will be fully expected from the name. But still able to dominate with creativity and waste Of course, it is one of the most unique combat sequences of the time and not even dragged out for a long time. <br /> <br /> Chiba gives defeat as Iba at first. His own morals because the situation slowly affects him. This is one of his better vehicles from his excellent CV. From the last action the two worlds have affected each other, you have to wonder if it is a matter of destruction on the part of the writer as if they seem to ask. But this may be a little reading, generally can be described as a continuous (almost) two-hour action
