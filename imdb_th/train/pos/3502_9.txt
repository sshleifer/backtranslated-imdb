Wow! I love this movie and like Judy Marte !! This girl is not only a beautiful face, a scary, she is really funny and talented !! She made me laugh many times, just roughly with Victor, who came to see her violently! We will see you a lot in the next few years ... and probably from director Peter Sollett and co-actor Victor Rasuk! <br /> <br /> Raising Victor Vargas is one of the best movies I saw a long time! Very refreshing! It's true, good, funny, well-shot, got everything: good story, good actor, good movie direction! <br /> <br /> If you like simplicity, slow, real life, movies in the city, like maybe The girl from Kevin Smith, you will love Victor Vargas! It is better!
