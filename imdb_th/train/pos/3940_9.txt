This film is not only But is one of John Ford's personal favorites But there are also director number Sergei M. Eisenstein and Bertrand Tavernier is one of the top movie lovers Ironically, I just caught it myself through Criterion's latest 2-Disc Set, after missing from a few original screenings on Italian TV many years ago and a few times on TV while in the hall. Lee! <br /> <br /> This film marks the first collaboration in nine of Ford and Henry Fonda and is also a prime example of Ford's Americana vein.

Attorney <br /> <br /> von Da, of course, is an experienced lawyer. But strict and sympathetic to those who were completely presided over Fonda will be shooting fake politicians in other films, especially in the best movie THE MAN MAN (1964) by Franklin J. Schaffner and FAIL-SAFE (1964) Sidney Lumet's. Surprised to know that he was hesitant at that time Lincoln's role since in his view is that "Like to play God"! <br /> <br /> It is interesting to know that Ford had previously dealt with Abraham Lincoln (Tangent) in the Kingdom of the Shark Island (1936). But perhaps less known, which has just been released In a special DVD format by the UK's true stereo standard, the "Masters Of Cinema" label of Eureka. In addition, I have two other Abraham Lincoln movies in my DVD collection, which I have not yet. Have watched and are also directed by DW Griffith - BIRTH OF A NATION (1915) and ABRAHAM LINCOLN (1930) - and once I have not only received many movies that I have never watched before, now I am happy to give them He rotated upon his experience. Watching satisfied with my YOUNG MR LINCOLN.
