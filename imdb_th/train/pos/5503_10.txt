The content of this documentary is so powerful that it causes tears. Yes tears i tell you The popular struggle of the traditional exploitation population should inspire all of us to stand up for our rights, pull out the better benefits of the community, and stop making excuseful excuse. fearful Chavez represents the weakness and misfortune in the same way Bush is the face of a dirty company and capitalism runs rampant. Indeed, Latin America is reshaping, and in the end, most people have a voice in five centuries. Although in the case of Mexico, the election was clearly stolen by Calderon. Chavez was not perfect, far from it. He tried to change the constitution so he ruled indefinitely. That cannot be tolerated Enough for politics and going back to watching movies The pace is breathing, taking time and deep philosophy that others show. Chavez is a popular hero, not afraid to challenge the power of the United States and the possession of world resources. If you think that the author has a bias towards Chavez, nothing stops you from doing homework. One of the important messages of this film is the questioning of information sources, which are clearly shown by the casualties being blamed shamefully for Chavez supporters. Venezuela makes Americans accused of democracy be humiliated by Hasta la revolucion siempre!
