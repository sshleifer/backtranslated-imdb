I almost didn't go to watch this movie because I remember the penguin's march wasn't very exciting. I go mainly because Disney promises to plant trees if I go to see it on weekends. But after I went to watch it, it was just amazing; The fact that a photographer can capture an impossible picture is worth your money. You will see different habitats, plants, animals and natural phenomena that not only shock you - just because you never expected nature to be magical and lively - but to touch your soul. The world that our lives deviate from nature to the level we receive from the natural beauty and miraculous miracles of our biosphere. You don't have to be a soil lover or an environmental conservationist to appreciate the greatness of this documentary. You just have to be a curious spirit that questions the value and magic of living fun!
