(See the actors and rent it - you know you want to know) and the first bishop director gives them the opportunity to spend their time allowing the characters to interact and chew the scenery as they wait. Come back "Great Chief" and any vengeance. <br /> <br /> For some of us, the highlight is seeing Christopher Jones after being exiled from the movie; He is still a film director and yes, with Christopher Jones, Larry Bishop and Richard Pryor involved. This is a "Wild in the Streets" gathering party!
