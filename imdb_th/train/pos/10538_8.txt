I work at a movie store and I always look for great movies. I decided to check what it was sitting in our parts of Canada and I was trying to support my country's film industry. I was surprised. This film presented David Hewlett and Andrew Mee. Dealer in a very fun story that seems to delve into our hearts and relationships ... without having to work hard. It's funny continuously through the interaction of both characters, including funny exchanges ("We can't die, we have cable!") I can say more things without noting that it's worth the shot even if you Will leave it within the first half hour
