This is the average Jackie Chan flick because of the excellent ending and the great humor. Every character is very cool and this movie is always entertaining, including Jackie Chan, it's great in this story! Jackie and Wai-Man Chan have excellent chemistry together and both are very funny! And I think the main opponent looks really scary! However, the dub is terrible! Character development is higher than the average of this! And the main battle is great! Plus some bumps that Jackie uses in this game are serious! With a lot of humor and stupidity in this matter But it makes me amused and the ending is a hilarious joke! Plus all the characters are favorite It looks quite cheap. But in general, it can be done very well, and while there is no amount of fighting that you expect from Jackie Chan's flick, it is enough to let you see, including one of my favorite moments. This movie is when Jackie Dragon) and Wai-Man Chan (Tiger) are playing with a rifle and it is off! This is the average Jackie Chan flick due to the excellent ending and excellent humor. But otherwise, there is nothing great. But it's worth the watch! The direction is good. Jackie Chan works well here with a stable camera job, a great angle and makes the movie go most quickly. The performance is very good! Jackie Chan is a person who is always amazing and amazing. Here he is a very hilarious favorite, as usual, having to show some stunts, having excellent chemistry with Waimanman, kicking that ass and Toss this wonderful character I just hope that they will stop polishing him! (Jackie's Law !!!!!) Wai-Man Chan is a joke. As Jackie Chan's best friend, I really like him. He is also a very good martial artist. The remaining actors do well. I guess. Overall worth the look! *** from 5
