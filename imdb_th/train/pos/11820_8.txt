If I told you to compare The Dark Knight and the movie adaptation of the 18-year-old comic book about 5.9, would you call me crazy? That is just to grab your attention. Every day I meet people who complain that there is no good movie. Who knows what the latest movie? Finding and exploring old movies is not a bad thing, especially for movies that have great artistic value. Dick Tracy is one that is not easily obsolete in terms of technology. <br /> <br /> Negative reviews Big complains about DT's "messed up", but it seems that the story is quite clear and I don't have any trouble tracking. I don't see comic books But I'm not an avid cartoon fan of America But I admire making and performing popular movies Perhaps the expectations of most people are too high about the story to tell. But if you see Madonna and Warren Beatty together, what do you expect? I have scratches on my head and can't help. But wondering if we really saw the same movie? The role of the name, though not as good as it should be But still able to pull him up and create a charm for the audience Madonna expressed much less than "breathe" in her attractive role. But add fun to the story Al Pacino is funny and wonderful to himself. Obviously he was brave enough to satirize his previous successful role. We can see Scarface hybrids, Michael Corleone, Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro punching our stomachs to make us laugh. And thanks to make-up <br /> <br /> for me it's not bad at all Surreal feelings really made me
