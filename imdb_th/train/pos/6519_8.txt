This movie has a great star in previous years: Ingor Stevens has never been so cute Charlton Heston performed quite well like Andrew Jackson. But some times are quite arrogant It is a good flick for students to learn a part of our history and it shows that all happy endings do not include couples who come together - sometimes the happy ending is They sailed away. Will understand them better in the long run I watched it at least twice a year for 16 years and although it's not the best movie I've ever seen, I love it every time!
