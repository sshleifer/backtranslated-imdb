This is a military drama that I like very much! Tom Berenger plays the murderer, Thomas Beckett. This Marine is ridiculous, absurd in your face, and there are no questions asked about the people who have worked there. You have Billy Zane ("The Phantom" and others) who play Richard Miller, a former SWAT from DC, works for the government and receives orders from them only. Who needs civil servants? I do not! When pairing these two, the sparks should fly anyway. However, Beckett teaches young civil servants to know how to work. When another sniper gun hits the cat's wits with the gunman's mouse and gunner And when catching a seasoned gunman, it is up to Miller to put politics and help him Who wants politics when you are a professional like Beckett? He orders from anyone other than himself, playing according to the rules, not books, and mutual respect occurs even though politics. This movie is a popular movie. Watch it. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
