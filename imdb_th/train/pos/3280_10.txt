I've watched this movie about ten years ago. I bought the DVD two days before and after watching it, I thought it was better than I remembered it. <br /> <br /> Paperhouse is more than a horror story. It has a great emotion and looks fantastic. I think Charlotte Burke is really great here. It's a shame that she didn't do anything else because she has always been a great actress. The depiction of her emotions in this film is complete with a little ingenuity in order to receive messages, especially at the end when she knows that although Marc has died Many scenes make me jump. (Which is a rare thing for me in modern horror movies), the most eye-catching scene in the bathtub, the scene where Anna's father chased her with a strange radio on the back and legs in the leg Cracked and broken into pieces. <br /> <br /> All of them are great movies and can move very well.
