I do not give movies or programs ten times often. But this item touches the nerves in the way that there are no other items I found the whole set on mysoju.com and thought that the evidence looked interesting, so I watched I was not disappointed with what I saw. I was moved. This story remained in the tenderness while the main character moved us through various scenes. Sumire Iwaya, played by Koyuki carefully, showed the human nature as she wanted. That will not show problems No one wants to put their souls in front of their souls. So instead of being a human instead of her, played by Matsumoto Jun, a cute pet instead. This pet is like other animals that we will consider pets. Differences; He can respond in the same way after Momo is a man, not a dog. As he was treated like a pet, he responded to the situation that the dog might respond. She spends time with a new boyfriend. Momo is jealous when she realizes that her pet is not just a pet that the sexual tension between the two begins to become thick - Momo is a dance genius. Her thoughts changed slowly as we began to see his thoughts. Matsumoto took us from seeing two-dimensional characters in the beginning, two-dimensional, when we saw that he was a three-dimensional character dancer when we saw that he began to fall in love with the boss as a man. Yes dog In my opinion, it is worth watching this story to see this character developed. Matsumoto Plus plays Momo with such tenderness. You almost start to want as well. Do not want to think about the future and how their relationship will change while Momo (the name you give him as one will name their new puppy)? We both know that this cannot be sustained. Watch this show with an open mind. It's worth it.
