I fell in love with "Daisy Push" immediately. This item manages to put a smile on my face with a good storytelling, interactive interaction, flair and great performance. But that's not all: it still makes you finish The basic concept behind the show brings people back to life with a single touch, ending the death status with seconds - interesting and probably still in the next season. But the suspected murder, the appearance of the show and the highly skilled narrator will add to the experience, but "Dun Daisy" is more than its part. It has some charms that I really like and I look forward to entering the world of Ned and Chuck as the second season.
