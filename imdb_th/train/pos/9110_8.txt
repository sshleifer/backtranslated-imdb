you know? Our soul depends on this revolution. It sleeps ... I can explain. I think !! Well ... until it happened on April 25, 1974. Our freedom was limited. We had no freedom of speech. But when we received the revolution, it seems that the Portuguese lost their opinion. Freedom of speech! That's all the result of the revolution! I think it's clear! ... about movies ... I think it has a slight error in the character's performance. But in the way I use Portuguese movies, it's quite good !! I really like it!
