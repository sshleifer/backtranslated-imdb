John (Beep Chaplin) is a solitary banker who lives in a small town not far from London. Although the internet, he will contact the Russian bride agency. He chose Sofia. (Nicole Kidman, the man may be lonely and shy But of course there are good tastes, not him?) And when they meet, they know that she doesn't speak English. Communication between each other is limited by sex (again, thinking of a bad situation for men, just having sex with Nicole Kidman!) On her birthday, her two Russian friends visit them. Then many surprises will happen. I like this movie: First of all, it's almost a 'label'. Can't it be an action comedy, thriller or thriller? I believe that all of the options are correct. Nicole Kidman is as beautiful as usual and I am curious about her Russia: do you speak Russian with the correct accent? However, I found it to be a fun movie. My rating is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "A Isca Perfeita" ("The Perfect Bait")
