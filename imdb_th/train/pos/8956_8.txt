I watched this movie after watching Practical Magic and the older movie was excellent. I like the way the lighting, makeup and costumes change when Gillian changes the story. The courtesy of Jimmy Stewart didn't do much for me in this movie. But I think they act to focus on Gillian's character reservation. I was also fascinated by Nicky and Gillian's manners - as if the director wanted him to look weak and Gillian would appear as a man. Nicky's gestures made him show Redlich's power, especially causing me to lose. I never thought that Warlock was a young woman, so it was an interesting way to compare those characters.
