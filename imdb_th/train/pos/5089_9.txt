It's true that it doesn't closely follow the book. The role in Swayze is much better than I expected, and Doody avoids "stupid women that are deep into the wilderness", which is our most anticipated image (compare Kate Capshaw In "Indiana Jones & Temple of Doom") <br /> <br /> It's more amazing than Richard Chamberlain, who is very terrifying when the Quatermain duo. <br /> <br /> It's a reminder of many Westerners. About the only thing I didn't All attention is magic But I think that is part of the genre, such as "How do you have the story of African adventures without having to be a sorcerer, a witch and a tribe that has strayed before?"
