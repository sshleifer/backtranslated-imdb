Great flick in the 90s! Parker Posey is an incredible story about the nightlife in Manhattan that requires a lot of money. Posey gave a great performance as a librarian and a night collector. This is a good and light movie for Saturday night before you go out. Rock soundtrack set out of this world, funny plays and actors do a great job. Redemption: You can do it in this world. If you just try to find your channel, I believe Parker Posey is an actor. Perfect for this type of character: incredibly young and broken (You have to search for movies "Clockwatchers") If you watch Party Girl, you have to have a good time. Have fun!
