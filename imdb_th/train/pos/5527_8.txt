There may be special reasons why foxes and children get special notes in my heart. Have to say goodbye to my new fiancee - oh ... one day - in an unknown time, I was a little confused with the different emotions and suffering from putting on a brave face that she wanted to see /> < br /> I watched a few movies and TV shows.
