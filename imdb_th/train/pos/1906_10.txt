Sadly, 8 simple rules for dating my teenage daughter are the last sitcoms that John Ritter had to work on after his tragic death in 2003. He is one of the favorite actors of all time. me He has everything funny. (Who can forget him in three companies) but he is also a great actor (not to forget) watching TV movies) as much as I love other actors in all shows and Martin) John is a star. He has a lot of reasons I am attracted to acting at first and it is his perfect joke that can break me every time. <br /> <br /> I like acting that doesn't. sweet (As far as I love The Cosby Show, they are too good to laugh.) They show excellent family dynamics in general. It is true enough for things that are competitive, brothers, and quarreling between parents. But they are still funny Many American sitcoms try and fulfill their performances with morality and nothing and this program doesn't do that. Yes, there are some issues, such as solving important problems such as drugs and bullying. But they didn't try to do anything other than family fun jokes. <br /> <br /> The way they wrote about John's death. The performance was very good. I also cried like a child every time I saw it. You will feel the raw emotion in those difficult times. <br /> <br /> I regret that the program was canceled. I still enjoy watching the show again and I'm not bored. <br /> <br /> John Ritter, you will be remembered because you are the hilarious image of the guardian father who wants to lock his daughter in their room rather than letting them date their children. !!!
