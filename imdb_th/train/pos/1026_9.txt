I like this show for two reasons: 1. Richard Dean Anderson 2. Amanda Tapping These two actors have performances that can be supported by regular actors and repeat actors. Replacing the RDA in Season 9- 10 is enough to bring the heart out of the show. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between all the main characters is great. You get the feeling that the actors like to do after the camera stops spinning. This relationship leads to a program that we have seen. <br /> <br /> RDA gives the character of the 'O'Neill' character. He never knows when someone will give him wisdom. Watching other people roll their eyes with fear in their words. But even then, they knew that he was the one who had to face when the situation was full of danger. <br /> <br /> There is so much going on between 'Carter' and 'Neal' under the surface. They manage to keep the lid on. But often just recently, the episode 'Solitudes' in Season 1 has the best drama ever seen on TV. The love between the two makes the opportunity to die because they face each other. <br /> <br /> 'Carter' and 'Jackson' often have to be smooth with the turbulence created by 'Neal'. Nonetheless, O'Neill's tactical instincts are always good. He understood what to do without having to think about it. The team has been attacked many times by others who do not listen to his commands. <br /> <br /> Quality is clearly reduced in seasons 9 and 10. Most of the original stories are gone. Catch my attention Ben Browder is inferior to the RDA. In the performance, he has his rare time with Claudia Black, but that's all. Amanda touched gently in her performance for both seasons. You can see her dramatic changes after having children. She may think more about children than the show. <br /> <br /> The spin-off 'Stargate Atlantis' has a short period of time, but is mostly a weaker effort. The main character lacks the chemical qualities of the original character. The villain (Wraiths) is unlikely to be ridiculous. Perhaps Amanda Tapping may live as part of the show, or not longer than the fourth season. <br /> < br /> There is always a problem for me in special effects for acting. To have a spacecraft shaped like a pyramid is a surprise in Sci-Fi. Using a flashlight to illuminate these ships is not as good. The use of the decoration from ancient Egypt that concealed the cutting-edge technology is difficult to accept. <br /> <br /> I wonder about the continuation of the show as well. In season 2, Daniel Jackson was shot and his uniform had a hole in which he was injured. He crawled into the coffin and healed his body and restored his uniform as if it had just come out of the closet in the closet. When 'Hathor' had a coffin in the hands of the SGC, he never spoke again. This device can be used in many episodes later in 'Daniel', 'O'Neill' and 'Dr. Drama'.
