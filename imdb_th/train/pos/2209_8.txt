In my opinion, this is a good show of panic. I enjoyed seeing Greg Kinnear as the host. There are many reasons I say that, even though Hal Sparks is the host. But sometimes I hope Greg Kinnear will not leave. If you ask me, it seems that nobody is on TV for the rest of the run. Still, I still enjoy seeing various families and other people teasing celebrities. If you ask me it's funny Before I conclude this, I must say that I miss this program. Now, in conclusion, I would like to recommend this program to all the fans that you have shown the sketch of death. You will really enjoy it.
