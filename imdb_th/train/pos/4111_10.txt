I saw this movie as a pre-teen boy about the age that children began to think about their identity. I was greatly affected by the scene of the men and children he raised as his own. The eldest boy was mocked that his mother was a prostitute and there was no brother who had a biological father (which Kurosawa clearly had with a child that didn't look the same). Their father by the single definition that counts The man is regarded as the father of all children, but there is one person who still likes her brother. <br /> <br /> Each article has the same interest for the story and conclusion. <br /> <br> It's a great movie, though it's not the greatest Kurosawa movie.
