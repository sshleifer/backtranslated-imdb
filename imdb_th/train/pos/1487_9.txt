"Casomai" is a story that shows the story of a young couple who wades through the dark waters of marriage. This is a very convincing story to tell about the strange look between forgiveness and ongoing intervention, which is typical in Italy. Pavignano and D'Alatri are great at writing and that is one of the strengths of Stefania Rocca and Fabio Volo's movies are discreet and attractive. And the shape of a sympathetic priest is funny and well-rounded Overall, a movie that truly deserves may be one of the best Italian movies of the year.
