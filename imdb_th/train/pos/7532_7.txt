New Batman Adventures (also known as Gotham Knights) will take place 5 years after the last episode of Batman: Animated Series (B: TAS) and broadcast only 24 episodes. This is not a horrible performance. But it's not as good as the original Batman Animated Series. I'll start with everything I find not very good. <br /> <br /> The first thing is the animation itself: long and sweet. Next, the sky is always bright red and orange. B: TAS does this too. But it was painted on the dark ceiling, the color of the sky seemed ominous in this show, the color of the sky was too bright Everything looks like other kids and doesn't seem like Batman: TAS is made with a cool and cool art style in Gotham. But don't warn me about Batman anymore Every character consists of straight lines, squares and triangles, making the characters seem less human. In the original series (B: TAS), the characters look like real people. The animation may be more consistent in B: TAS, but certainly not as good. <br /> <br /> Next: Some episodes are too stupid and innocent. But some of the content is stronger than in B: TAS (two faces trying to kill Tim Drake / Robin 2 and some criminals are treated cruelly). This leads me to the next point. <br /> <br /> Because This should happen in the future, just like the last episode of Batman Animated Universe. Many criminals face death or leave forever. Apparently, Poison Ivy drowned when the two-face cruise ship almost killed Penguin, Killer Croc and himself, so he moved to Arkham forever; Joker fell into the exhaust tower of an industrial factory. (Although he returned in the Justice League Animated Series series) Catwoman moved to France to leave Batman and others ... just because the ending series didn't mean they had to. Get rid of the great characters! The motives of the villains are not good as well. No! In B: TAS, we learn that these criminals were mentally tortured and their lives destroyed. That is why they follow the way they do on this list. The criminals are committing crimes to develop the story. It's like Batman doesn't care about the remaining consciousness in the people he fights. He will overcome them without consciousness. This Batman is a character that is cooler and has a lower meaning. But since he has been working for many years, I can see why he is cruel. <br /> <br /> Next, the character of the newly designed character: It's terrible. Gordon lost about 100 pounds ... Is he sick Many villains look stupid (Joker, Riddler, Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, Mad Hatter and Killer Croc are among the worst), although I think some characters look better (Bane, Scarecrow, Batgirl) Harley. It's the same thing, and Ivy (which is now hotter) has pale green skin. <br /> <br /> With a series of many flaws, some episodes are great - Over the Edge, Mad Love, Beware of Creeper , Girls Night Out, old wounds, Legends of Dark Knight and Never Fear are my favorite here in my opinion. All the crosses with Batman in the Superman cartoon series are great as well. <br /> <br /> The worst part about this performance is how the creators say they like Ani. The animation of this series In the DVD feature of the original Batman animated series, they talk about pride in the style, art and difficulty of some characters in the animation. But they eventually succeeded In the DVD feature of New Batman Adventures, the creators often say "To Hell with B: TAS. This is a fresh new word. It looks better and we like the way we break the set." ! (Okay, that's an exaggeration) when the creator left the amazing art style of B: TAS that really bothered me. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad performance. But I still don't like it as much as the original animation series. At least the program doesn't speak to the audience, so for this reason I still appreciate it. Although some episodes in this new series are fantastic and worth the look. <br /> <br /> Superman: Animation series and Justice League: Animation series is Batman's follow-up game: New animated series and Batman's adventures
