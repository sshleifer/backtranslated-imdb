This is a really great movie. Not only is it a document about the eternal struggle of the indigenous people and those who do not have the right to receive their correct voice? But it also shows the United States of infidelity, trickery and intrigue Chavez shows that he is a brave and charismatic leader who struggles with things that can stand out as a worthless noble class in terms of proportion or justice. These filmmakers recorded the coup, which was not like it had been before. <br /> <br /> And in the fur, we see the United States again pulling the strings and blurring the reality. It is surprising to see the beginning of the revolution that knows that the demolition of democracy that we see is a tool that has been used for a long time by the continuous American government and citizens who blink their eyes This image makes it clear that this is not the management of TV or video in general. But is a document that is used by the people and the government to fight for the future Is a truly moving experience for everyone who has conscience These Irish filmmakers deserve our gratitude. Chavez, who has a long life, <br /> <br /> We need to support the idea that each country must be allowed to choose their government and to develop in ways that most people deem appropriate. The first step in this process is to know what the reality of the situation is and how well this documentary serves.
