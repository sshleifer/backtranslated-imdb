Kusturika do it again, another masterpiece Funny coral reefs filled with their landmarks with glowing rhythms and many glorious moments. We laugh and laugh as a party! Music is everywhere, including photography of animals, monsters, crazy people, sex and gadgets, and amazing artifacts. Everything is colorful for entertainment purposes only. Pure cinema in essence Great experience to watch And one of them was especially grateful because the good comedies were very rare and excellent This is a single story, and if you like Kusturica's previous movie, you will love this, although in every joke it's about chemical reactions and you have to be in its mood.
