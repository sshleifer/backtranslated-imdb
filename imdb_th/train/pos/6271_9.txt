I like this movie. It's very cool. It has everything: cars, guns, fights and even token girls. It's not great for this, except cars. A little shot, a little fight, kissing around and a lot of cars with a good chase near the end. Jumping, you might say it's impossible. But according to our good friends that IMDB is possible, so the movie is not as good as the drawing people. It's quality and I like to watch it. In fact, I love movies. And i don't need to close my brain to see it I never thought "Is it possible?" Or that homeless person 9 in 10
