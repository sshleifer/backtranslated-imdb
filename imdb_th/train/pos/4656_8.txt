An undeniably fun and intelligent performance starring Peter Ustinov as a misappropriation career, along with his image of a US group in London. He is obsessed with Maggie Smith, Sly (and spiky), Maggie Smith, and threatens to be revealed by Bob Newhart, the envious man. This is a robbery movie that has many brains. Ustinov has the same specials as Smith and Newhart. It's quite funny. The real surprise is Karl Malden as a tablet. "Executive Vice President" Malden is not going to loose. Cesar Romero and Robert Morley appeared in a funny style. The great song score is by Laurie Johnson. Eric Till's direction is fast and the script of Ustinov and Ira Wallach is excellent and very smart. Good time swinging!
