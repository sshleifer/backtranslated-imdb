It is amazing that many people I know have never seen this little gem that I turned back to use with the same reaction: What a wonderful movie !! > <br /> I have never received much care for Brad Pitt. (Although his work in the 12 monkeys and Fight Club show show), but his performance in the film as a psychopath is shocking, dark and accurate. <br /> <br /> Other people in the movie This gives a great performance and a slow and thoughtful walk of this movie. The feeling of fear of the characters increases as they realize that things are happening. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps this thing from 10 in my book is compared to what happened. before The ending is a little too long and too much. But that is the only flaw that I can find in this classic cult. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie, try to cut the director who doesn't have a rating in the letter to get the pick. Best watch <br /> <br /> Score: 9
