I've seen this thing for about 2 or 3 times and haven't regretted it yet. Returning home is not just a typical animal movie. It is unique, fun and full of adventure. The thing that makes the movie fun is the animal (clear) that has been miraculously trained It's a good effort. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10!
