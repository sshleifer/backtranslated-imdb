From the whole story of the Disney princess, Cinderella is probably the most attractive. I can't say why But for some reason, the next generation model pushed her to the top of their list. As a little girl, I don't need anything more than being a Cinderella with her glass slippers - it's my favorite set. <br /> <br /> Actually, I don't think There will be any story, human heart, more than Cinderella. Who never wants to escape from boredom in everyday life and find someone who sees you like no one has ever had? The story is older than English, and it is still loud. <br /> <br /> For the characters, if nothing else, Disney can create a great villain. Lady Tremaine is evil for T in great calculations, not Openly physically Her tongue and sharp eyes act for her - she doesn't want staff to reduce fear in your heart. Animal friends often satirize, especially the stupid Gus. I would be glad if he found his fate in the mouth of Lucifer. Cinderella has no driving force, sometimes talking about cats. However, she just lacked the motivation to make her truly sympathetic. Of course, she is a good person and raising animals. But what made her in that place? We never knew. Although she became a maid in another house, at least she was paid and respected. It seems that the only reason that things will come out at the end for Cindy is everything that falls on her lap. She has never worked for her dreams that she sings with love. <br /> <br /> Which led me to the sound of lovely music. As always, the Ilene Forest has a lovely melodious voice, probably the favorite heroine Every Disney Some great standards have happened here - dreams are the desire in your heart, so this is love Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo ... <br /> <br /> Cinderella is a story that Amazingly While it lacks the development of some characters But there are classic bad guys and great sounds If you feel uncomfortable at the heart, insert it - it will keep you warm and make you hum. Mmm Mmm is good! <br /> <br /> Refer to the movie: <br /> <br /> - Surprise! Surprise! -Duh duh duh- happy birthday!
