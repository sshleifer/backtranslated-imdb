Perhaps not the biggest item in the Hammer House of Horror series, but it won the award for the most creative episode! "The house where the blood of death" ?? I can shout this name all day without being bored! And in addition to the name of the miracle, this short film also benefited from the hard-written script and truly suspicious moments. It may require special viewing before you understand the strange end. But it is a traditional concept for a short horror movie. The story opens with the image of an elderly couple drinking tea at a middle class home. The husband killed his wife brutally, and many years later at the house "cursed" still sold. The young couple and their lovely daughter moved in and began to restore. But mysterious events occur and affect, especially Sophie Young Her beloved cat was killed even when her birthday party broke down when the pipes in the house sent blood spray around the guests. Is the old house really haunted? Or maybe a useful neighbor seems to be the cause of all horror? The answers to these questions are provided in the traditional and fairly unpredictable climax, and there is still room for real shock at the end. The tension was created expertly and the house was filled with creepy scenery such as the husband's husband used to kill his wife. A little warning that the sequence with cats is hard to see when you are an animal lover. In conclusion, another winner for Hammer's short TV drama!
