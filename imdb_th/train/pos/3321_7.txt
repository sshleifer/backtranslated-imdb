I saw "Fever Pitch" by accident. It was playing on a plane that flew to Europe. In fact, it wasn't bad. Half (Ben, Jimmy Fallon) was the No. 1 Red Sox fan in the world. His relationship with Drew Barrymore can be stressful. The movie is a fairly interesting story of how events in the world can affect people's relationships. Especially the eye-opening now that the Red Sox have ended their 80-year losing streak. I guess these things happen all the time and we don't notice too bad. > <br /> Another movie that shows unusual relationships with baseball is "frequency" in the 2000s. Check them both out.
