This is my personal favorite when I was young. It has everything that is fantastic with movies for children of the 90s ... Cute dinosaurs, cute kids, freak bad guys and a few great songs (Not a typical little mermaid / beauty and beast type song But it's the most fun song!)! I ran into this movie again recently and I still love it too much! I advise everyone of all ages to watch this movie and I think it should be introduced to a new generation! Sorry for not giving the most information. I hasten ... please. Please trust me. Everyone who is against this film is killing their children!
