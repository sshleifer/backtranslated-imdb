It has a scene that has been strikingly modified and some scenes that have truly destroyed the nerve that will lead you to the edge of your seat. The best scenes come from movies; Museum scene and elevator murder There are some slightly erotic scenes and the rhythm of the movie may not be fast enough for general viewers to fully appreciate this movie. So this movie may not be suitable for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story itself is quite good. But it's a style that makes this movie work! May be for fans only, but the general audience should appreciate the increased tension in the movie. <br /> <br /> There are some good characters played by good actors. Michael Caine is an option for selection. Interesting acting and Angie Dickinson performed well as well as she looked good. (Not bad for 49 years old!) <br /> <br /> Pino Donaggio's musical score. In general, De Palma likes and suits the movie as well as his score for De Palma's movie "Body Double. "Another story <br /> <br /> Great nervous thriller. I love De Palma! <br /> <br /> 10/10
