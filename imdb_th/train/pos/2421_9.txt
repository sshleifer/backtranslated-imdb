You shouldn't use the things I'm going to say softly. I've seen many movies and have reviewed many of these stories in print. So when I tell you that this movie has the most fun scene I have ever seen in a movie, you might want to listen to me. There are various opinions about what makes this movie INCREDIBLY stupid. Funny as it is. And for those who don't get well, I can't blame them too. The scene that I spoke occurred about 30 minutes and involved a prisoner who was tied to John Candy. Until that point, I found that the movie was dumb, confused and it started to make me lose. When this scene came up, I laughed so hard. There is no movie that has been done before for me. When the project started, "Going Berserk" should be a SCTV movie. I remember it was announced. Over time, the character is staring at John Candy, Joe Flaherty & Eugene Levy. There must be a change to the Universal regime as it was shot because when it was released. Was shown in the cinema almost zero When I watched this for the second time, I listened to the song (which actually showed the story that was hard to understand in the lyrics), causing me to relax my nerves. In addition to the above-mentioned routines, "Going Berserk" also has many other hilarious scenes to suggest. This is a 3-Stooges flick, except that it's a lot more fun. Director David Steinberg has a sharp rhythm and he must laugh all the time Candy, whose duty is here, has never been more fun. With the whole plot device and the explanatory scene that was thrown out the window Horrible and declaring to follow him easily. There is a plot, but the plot, like "Animal House", has a plot and yes, the script is uneven and starts a little slow. Once you know this, you can admire the full SCTV craze that appears. It's stupid, but it's stupid by purpose and you have to remember that when you see it. Take a look and discover for yourself if it has the most fun scenes ever.
