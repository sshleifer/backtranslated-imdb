Strangler of the Swamp is produced by PRC budget studios, and of course is one of the best movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The man who was hanged for murder, he didn't receive a ghostly return for Revenge on those who accuse him He used the rope to strangle his victim and after several deaths, including the old man who carried the ferry across the swamp, he disappeared. The niece of the old man took himself across and fell in love with a local man and they decided to get married. <br /> <br /> The film has a foggy atmosphere that makes it very creepy. Also, <br /> <br /> The actors include Rosemary La Planche, Blake Edwards and Charles Middleton (Flash Gordon) as Strangler. <br /> <br /> Strangler of the Swamp is a must for movie fans. Old horror like me, excellent <br /> <br /> Score: 3 stars, half from 5
