This movie is wise. That is more than most other movies. It is above the minimum participation. - The fool may not appreciate it. The story still requires a heavy conversation. It has some lines that are lost in translation, even before the sun is much brighter. <br /> <br /> The script, the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere give the feeling of realism. The actors are definitely good players. I rarely see movies that are completely melodramatic and acting. <br /> <br /> The conversation moves to a very personal problem with a risk of becoming a little bit However, it is on the right almost all the time, even though I find it a little awkward and embarrassing for a moment. Balance adjustment in this field requires talented actors. Sometimes it gives great results and overall this movie is great! There is only "love" in movies that are expressed in a way that I find reliable and realistic. Every time achieving the results is excellent. I think the amazing and timeless beauty of a female lead can help in this respect. She still looks beautiful in this movie after 12 years. <br /> <br /> This is just a gem of a movie that you shouldn't miss. One of the best movies I've seen from 1990!
