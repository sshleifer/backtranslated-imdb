I went through a very painful personal loss (twice) and this film shows the truth that arises from a very good experience, an unbalanced life, nothing reasonable. Again She is one of my favorite movie actors forever. <br /> <br /> I laughed and cried when the story was resolved. Great stories and actors. Well done!
