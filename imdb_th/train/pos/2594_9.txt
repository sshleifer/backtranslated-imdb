This film uses Jerry Springer's approach to superhuman strength. "Wilder Napalm" is a film that I like to say about the idea that geniuses in America are determined by gifts or by trying to hide At the same time, the film points out that every genius is only human and not scary or worshiped than other humans. This is a great joke, fun and humanity with a little satire.
