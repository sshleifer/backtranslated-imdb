The embarrassing pre-code movie is actually a film that makes people insist on the strict Hayes Code. Barbara Stan Vee is a girl whose father sells liquor without problems with her. When he died from an accident, she was released into the world with the knowledge that her body would receive what she wanted. She went to New York and proceeded to climb the stairs one company at a time. Although it is obvious that there is no real sex, this movie is rather lazy. Unfortunately after the initial charge faded away (During the time that Stanwick checked the tram so she could travel for free), the movie became monotonous and boring. Stanwyck herself is the only thing that makes this movie worth sitting. As always, she is excellent.
