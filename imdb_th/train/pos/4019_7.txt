The fact that I'm not a fan of Snoop Dogg as an actor makes me more concerned about watching this flick. I remember that he was interviewed on "Jay Leno" and said he turned to the role of Adam Sandler in the big budget "The Longest Yard" to participate in the movie. Apparently Snoop was on a serious mission to prove that he had acted shuffling. I will not boast about his acting in "tenants". Of course, there are better rappers / actors like Moss Dave, who can do more of his duties. But the point is that Snoop works well. He seems to be unable to shake off the movement of the body, trademark and diversion of the singer. But that's something that even Jack Nicholson has a problem. The point is that I find him believing in the role and tension between him and the characters of Dylan McDermott. Although his delicate performances are obscured by Snoopy's performances As a big reader and an aspiring writer, I can't help but find characters and plot interesting stories. It made me more frustrated that Snoop's character would ask McDermott to read his work all the time and scold him to criticize it. But you know what? I'm sure many writers are like that. His character should have the same flaws as McDermott on his way. My only gentle criticism about this movie is the ending. For some reason, it just felt too hasty for me, although the resolution was reasonable and inspired by the characters rather than the plot.
