Steve Carell, starring a person you can relate to (in the form of) in real life, movies that I would not like But ended with liking Regardless of whether this movie will laugh out loud and funny, just that it has a great heart, we all like Steve Carell. This is not what The Office fans expect to see from him. But do you know that I like this movie? <br /> <br /> Karel, a star like Dan Byrne, a widower who doesn't really like him. One weekend, he and his daughter traveled down to see his family. At that time he went to the bookstore and went to find a woman. When he returned home, he found that his brother Mitch (played by Dane Cook) was dating this woman (played by Juliette Binoche). <br /> <br /> Dan in real life sometimes I found A bit unbelievable Burns family is a type of person who exercises together and plays board games together and does other family activities? I highly doubt that I don't know the family that is like that. That makes me stop thumbs up. <br /> <br /> Real life: *** / ****
