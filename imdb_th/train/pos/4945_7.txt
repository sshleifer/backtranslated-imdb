It is a movie that is difficult to categorize "10 items or less". In general, I don't care about the orientation. But there is something about this movie that makes you want to put it into a specific category to pass, even with only one word, only your feelings about it. I completely recommend this movie to everyone and if you really enjoy the movie and if you enjoy life you will have to do that as soon as you see it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. And called it beautiful and delighted to accept that it was not perfect But didn't do anything wrong I do not want to listen, it seems I conflict with myself. But I believe that writer / director Brad Silberling knew what he had received when he wrote this script as an inspiration. I'm sure he wants to achieve a product that doesn't involve perfection: products that are simple, attractive and uncompromising are the names of products. He has done it. <br /> <br /> Silberling, the director of a long and complex film, such as "City of Angels" and "Moonlight Mile", proved with "10 items or less" that closed in just 70 minutes Passionate that he has Have his work and the faith he has Placing actors (Morgan Freeman) in front of women (Paz Vega) in the grocery store and taking them to places where normal life will take them is something Silberling offers here. <br /> <br /> Can't tell you anymore because the obvious simplicity is a thought-provoking background which should not be overlooked. Because everyone here has been revealed: the camera will focus on two main characters sharing endless conversations in a ride with an endless stop, just because life is life. And let me show how admirable Silberling handles the situation by saying that he had arrived in less time (not only during the movie period only) But on the same day that the movie developed activities) and in a small place, the connection between the two characters that Sophia Coppola created in "Lost In Translation" <br /> <br /> that movie, location Being in Tokyo met with actors and a young woman and they talked about the time they lived. Their life It is in the dialogue that we can experience the quality of "10 items or less" and, like in the movies of Coppola, the naturalness of every situation has never disappeared, and every image with music and without Any words in the picture are 'buying time'. <br /> <br /> In this sense, the cooperation of Silberling and the director of photography Phedon Papamichael, who shot a beautiful scene in "Sideways" and headed Focus on every emotion "Patch Adams" makes us happy here with images that are visible from true natural beauty. <br /> <br /> But the highest beauty of "10 items or less" can be found. In the actors (by Avy Kaufman) in two protagonists They are the ones that convey the feelings I spoke at the beginning and I couldn't identify them. We feel their connection and we can tell that they are fun and that they might be blurted out. Oscar winner Morgan Freeman, who is a filmmaker, stands there and confirms the status he has in the film industry today and another thing that deserves: a quiet man full of wisdom. That can make you cry easily Can make you laugh and Paz Vega beautiful (I said that she's wonderful in "Spanglish") ?? Here she proved that she was a real deal and Hollywood was not small for her.
