There, he finds a blacksmith (Emile Meyer), daughter of He (Karen Sharp), her boyfriend (John Lupton), Field Marshal (Henry Hull) and the owner of the saloon (Ted de Corsica) Clint, as a lawyer, was appointed as Deputy Director to bring peace and said: ¨ Do not wear guns or other weapons in the city. All hardware can be found at the Marshal's office. ต์ Clint finds his former girlfriend, Madame Local. (Jan Sterling) in the care of a saloon (Angie Dickinson, Barbara Lawrence, among them), but the city council is afraid of how raw it is performed by Clint. At the end, an important landowner appears and tries to kill Tollinger with his own hands. <br /> <br /> This is a very exciting story of a sheriff who only hired one killer. It started in a slow western style. But followed to surprise us with black letters and a stable story The storytelling is almost scary. Cork came to town at the time to make sure that it was a citizen. But later the event became worse The highlight is the burning at the Saloon and the weather showdown ending. Great phenomena and roles for Robert Mitchum as an avenger angel and a bitter gunman. Bright and lively musical score by Alex North (Spartacus, Cleopatra), atmospheric movies in black and white by Lee Garmes, Richard Wilson (Al Capone, three people in the attic) as the creator. This film came up remarkably, which created a great western work as "Inviting gunmen and episodes yZane Gray" The results can be viewed for Western irregularities.
