What the 60s film really showed (for those of us who grew up in America's stomach at that time) was the chaos and diversity of the decade. Even though there are characters that are exaggerated and stereotyped But the true truth of the problem remains clear. <br /> <br /> Not only is the moment of change But also cause confusion as well Two basic things changed our world: Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the influence of the media. Both new freedom began to change society, which soon became an institution. <br /> <br /> From chaos However, remember that most Americans do not participate in this story ... They work. They play them. See news ... and they are gradually affected by the efforts and struggles of the group. Less ... civil rights, workers, political activists, anti-war efforts, war of poverty .... <br /> <br /> Representation of the power of the media and TV in particular is reflected. Until The conflict between The attitude of the general public and those who want to change things is the best thing that has been ignored ... and the worst is misrepresentation .. The middle-class Americans do not stand around with anger that holds. Baseball bat or angry daughter They are also confused. Do not forget that the folk singer became a protest singer, and suddenly the Beatles began an attack that killed the folk protest movement. There was no Beatle song in the movie or even talking about them. You do not live in the past decade, you may not feel like this movie about anything. The picture is rather dim. At one point I worked stable while my sister lived at Hog Farm Commune and went to Woodstock. Another point that I was in Haight Asbury and Detroit Riots while she worked and played housewives in Maine and Connecticut. The role has changed over time. <br /> <br /> The film represents three brothers of the middle class family. They represent hippie children, political activities and enthusiastic military personnel. Father represents the general attitude and the mother represents the voice of reason, patience, and sometimes compromises ... for peace. <br /> <br /> The black family consists of ministers and his sons ... asymmetry. I think. I think manufacturers know all the variables and have to judge by limitations. Otherwise, this movie will become a long and boring boring documentary. Father's message is that anger causes bitterness and bitterness causing chaos. Obviously it is a message that leads to today's youth. <br /> <br /> We are looking for ways to solve social problems that are unique and still a problem that breaks us ... 60s is unusual in That style and only a roaring 20s comparison. In other words, this movie has morals. In the end, it is our individualism that is still alive. Put it in your conversation list. <br /> <br /> Everybody is a sage or independent genius. In the 60s it was a time of magic and madness. No one can nail 60 seconds into it ... It is too diverse. (This movie is close by) At least we can say that we are not ashamed of what we have learned and grown from it, and that it was one time that people of that era changed shape and changed America. .. Better
