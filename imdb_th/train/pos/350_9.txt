I want to see Valentine since I saw that Denise Richards and Marley Shelton were there because they used to play in my favorite movies. When I watched Valentine's Day, I was amazed at the fact that the story was good. It killed me to see that it had a low score because it wasn't scary at all. Actors and actors play a magical role and the way it ends is excellent and cunning. Some scenes are unbelievable and a little poor and I admit that the little part is a little boring. But overall, it is a never-ending and suspicious entertainment. It has a distorted story that makes you guess all the way and it doesn't deserve to get all the crap. I recommend this movie to watch at any time, especially on Valentine's Day because of course it will make you feel chills. Oh and don't pay attention to samples or ratings, please don't ...
