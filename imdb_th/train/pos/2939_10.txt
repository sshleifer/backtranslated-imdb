Eddie Murphy is one of the funniest comedians ever. Delirious is the best joke I've ever seen and it's a must have for everyone who loves a good laugh !! I have watched this movie hundreds of times and every time I see it - I still enjoy the separation. This is one of your video libraries. I guarantee that you will have to watch it many times in order to listen to all the jokes because you will laugh a lot - you will miss half of them! Hilarious delirium! <br /> <br /> Although there are many comedians outside there - after watching this comedy, most of them seem to be second class citizens. If you've never seen it - come, let's watch it - then you'll love it !! It will make you shout !!! :-)
