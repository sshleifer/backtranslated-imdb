I am happy with the first part of this two parter, The Impossible Planet, and a little worried that the second part is not as good as it used to be in the past two parters in the past 2 series. That my fear is unfounded because I find myself enjoying now as much as the previous episode However, we started with a crew member who survived the escape from the Ood, which became a demon of the devil. In addition, there is little practice in the Doctor section when I am happy. No need to say that it is the story of a strong Doctor Who. Too strong for a younger audience. <br /> <br /> My grade: B +
