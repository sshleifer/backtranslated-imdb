I'm not a fan of martial arts movies. But the video store is almost empty and Jetle is in Lethal Weapon 4 and I get free when other movies I rent. I like it very much, my flatmates and myself. (22-year-old biochemist and accounting student) spent half an hour after the film made strange kung fu sounds and threw white skin shuriken. I can not explain (Maybe a little tequila) I never enjoyed Bruce Lee, the skinny doctor, the big doctor kick, the beat, the kick, the big doctor, etc. ended up thinking that Jackie Chan was a less funny person and acted a lot. up
