When someone asked me why I liked the movie a lot, I always replied that "Have you ever seen a sequence of art galleries in De Palma's Dressed to Kill series?" The scene is alone. Very beautiful, showing everything I want to see in the movie. If I'm a film director, that's what I want to do. "Pure cinema" is one way of explaining that sequence and it is absolutely amazing to see how all the film director De Palma works with the same high frequency of that scene. It is a dream movie that is as intelligent as hell and has more fun and intelligence than the ten films that gather together. I think movies raise important issues that are often the topic of hot discussions: can movies rely on only one technique and still be considered artistic success? This film has no message to say about the performance that is great. But it is ready to serve in style, and the script is short, according to De Palma's movie logic, making it a very good case in that style when properly managed, can maintain the feature length movie. Giving great performances But this is the director's film all the way to the scene. Is an exciting demonstration of the possibilities of movie media I will not tell you that this movie Hitchcock gives respect. (I don't want to lose any surprises) But I think De Palma stepped over the curves of the story. Not for the weak!
