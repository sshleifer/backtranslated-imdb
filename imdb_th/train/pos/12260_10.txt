This is a great starting point for Micky Rooney's acting career. His ability here shows that he has a long career waiting for him. The car and truck chase is exciting for 1937. The beginning of this Andy Hardy series is an American treasure in my book. The performance of Spring Byington is excellent as usual. Please please Rooney or the owner of the film rights to receive this opportunity and produce it as a DVD. I think it will be a winner.
