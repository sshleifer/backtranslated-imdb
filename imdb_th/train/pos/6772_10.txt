Unlike other users who say that this movie is sucked (and Olivia Hussey is terrible) I don't agree. <br /> <br /> This movie is amazing !!!!!! Excellent Olivia Hussey In everything she is! Yes, she may be old now because many people remember her from Romeo and Juliet. But you are wonderful! <br /> <br /> This story may be used frequently. But it's a movie that is unique and I will fight with anyone who doesn't agree! I enjoy this movie as much as I have Olivia Hussey's other movie "My Lady" by Olivia and I love her work. <br /> <br /> I saw this for the first time on Saturday (4 14/07) and fell in love with it Not only because it is Olivia's movie But because of the unique story and the great direction
