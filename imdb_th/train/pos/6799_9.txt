Now quite confusing Some people say that you have to start from the beginning. But I must say I'm a little confused from the beginning! <br /> <br /> Clark then blows his head and wakes up on the floor of the Fairview Mental Institute and makes it fun to believe that he is a superhero. Clark says that the life he knows is in his head. Psychedelic. He also finds some unusual things: Martha is married to Lionel; Lex is tied to a wheelchair with his limbs cut off after an accident on the bridge. And Lana dedicated to Clark But he found a familiarity Other people devoted to Clark: Chloe. He also found that mental patients came from the world known as Smallville. And the doctor is the escape from Phantom Zone. <br /> <br /> Now that makes me think back to the episode when Buffy called "Normal again" that Buffy started having a daydream about a mental hospital The doctor tried to convince her that what she knew was only her imagination, and in fact she was mad. Her parents are still married. They still live in LA. Her friend does not exist. Angel has never been her boyfriend and she does not have a sister named Rung Dawn. Demons and vampires do not exist. Both were quite sad because the doctors were not only But told the character that it was just her imagination But it tells us what it is: fiction and it brings us back to reality However, it is good to have a sense of reality every once in a while. But we watch these programs to escape from reality. It's a good story again because the characters have to overcome new challenges.
