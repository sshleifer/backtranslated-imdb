This film is one of the most rated movies at the moment. When you watch this movie, you are full of action and when something that is not really satisfying, the humor doesn't match. Excellent writing for movies created to give us a mixed blood of game shows that criminals are contestants and the near future that every general public is bloodthirsty. We're disappointed. One of his best liners. I don't want to lose anything for you. But I will tell you when Arnold gave him "I'll come back to the line". He received the best response of all of them in this film. Hope you enjoy this gem as much as I do.
