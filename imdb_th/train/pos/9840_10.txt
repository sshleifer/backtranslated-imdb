Born again. Limerick: <br /> <br /> If a man can come back from the dead <br /> <br /> And live in the head of the little girl <br /> <br /> Revenge will be Get <br /> <br /> The murder he met <br /> <br /> By the man in bed, his wife <br /> <br /> For me, born again for me. The episode that made me part of what sets X-Files to me before I start watching I saw a few segments before when the show first appeared, and I was too young to watch, such as The Jersey Devil, but I remember, especially when watching now, at the age of 11 and certainly crawling out of the scene. The man who had been choked by the bus until his death, then a hypnotic scene with a small girl, I told you that I couldn't sleep for weeks! For this reason, now there is a special aura about now from the creepy factors that I have grown up. It is enough to let me see some of the obvious flaws in the plot, such as why women have to wait until she is 9 years old before the soul of her previous life begins to exact revenge. Or what she is doing, just randomly sitting on the bus in the middle of the night You think your parents are worried. And maybe they are, we just don't see the part of the story really and live with telekinesis? In addition to adding an excellent Carrie factor to an already creepy story, there is no good explanation for it. But even with a little flaw in my opinion, this is a classic episode and there is little reason to not like it. 10 out of 10
