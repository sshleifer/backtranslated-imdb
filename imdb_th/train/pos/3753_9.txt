This short film that inspires long films like Spatula Madness is a hilarious movie that fights with similar cartoons. The short film Edward the Spatula, who was fired from his job, participated in the fight with the evil spoon. This evidence allows for funny content near the beginning. But almost did not appear in the rest of the feature. The 15 minutes of the film were absorbed by strange ball comedies and small music numbers. Unfortunately, nothing more is below. The story that is set has no time to show. But of course, it is better to follow it than many limited-budget Hollywood movies. This movie is worth watching at least a few times. Get what it is and don't expect a deep story.
