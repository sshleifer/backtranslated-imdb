I have seen many Disney movies in my life, even though they do not match Bedknobs and Broomsticks, although I personally do not skip action with animation. But it is an improvement to try to dress up people as animators The film has three immigrants from World War II who were sent to live with women who are quiet and socially illogical in the country. I must say that casting is great. Angela Landsbury made Miss Price perfectly while David Thomilson created a very interesting love. The ending always surprised me, and this was no exception. It's not happy or sad. But I do not know whether it is intentional or not The conversation is not good. But considering that it was designed to be a children's movie, that's okay. Overall, I will give you nine out of ten conversations, six in ten chapters, nine in ten selections, and eight out of ten sets.
