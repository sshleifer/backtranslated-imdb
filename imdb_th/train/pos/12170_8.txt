Romantic comedians can go anywhere. You will see things that are really meaningful and you think you want something more realistic. You will then see a realistic picture. But may be too boring to make you interested Or maybe you see someone doing everything right But failed to make you smile Romantic comedies are difficult movies. You enter them with many expectations, and usually, whether you like it, it's just a matter of creating a movie that expects your expectations or that of a man or woman next to you. <br /> < br /> Of course, if you have a woman next to you and you are a guy like me, it doesn't matter how good this movie is, you have other things in your heart. For you, I said "Go take the tiger!" For the rest of us, I said "See _A Guy Thing_." It's so fun. <br /> <br /> Because _A Guy Thing_ knows that you will go to see this movie with anticipation.

But maybe it's not true or you think it's cruel. _A Guy Thing_ covers that matter.
