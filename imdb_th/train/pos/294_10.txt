Important and financial failures when first launched, critics turned and said that this film is the best movie of La Ronde's film director who feels like a movie developed rapidly when they Detective from the detective agency (Ben Kassara, John Ritter and Blen Novak) came to love the most beautiful and unusual women in the movie, Colleen, Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hansen). Big is a repeated advertisement or rewritten on the filming day, which makes the movie feel fresh. Ben Gassara is the head of the great detective, Audrey Hepburn. After leaving Colleen Camp, the singer and see Patti Hansen, a taxi driver next to John Ritter Follow Dorothy Stratten and fall in love with her immediately. Blen Novak has a few women he chases (including Joyce Hyser and Elizabeth Pena). This movie has a great performance from a male actor. The outstanding thing is Audrey Hepburn. (She doesn't have a line in the first half of the movie) Ben Gassara has never been better. (And an inspiring choice for a romantic lead actor) and Colleen Camp has her best role as a singer Christie Miller in the country She is happy to watch as she shoots her line in the delivery of rat-tat. Highly recommended! ********* Stars!
