I managed to see the features last two nights on the last night of "Before Sunrise" (1995) and "Before Sunset" (2004) and watch the two films in a row without having the opportunity to experience my breath during or reflect The meaning of each movie separately I have to say that I like the past, the latter, and I will explain why <br /> <br /> Before the sunrise, introduce us to the young actor Ethan Hawk, Dead Poets. ) Only 25 when the movie was released and Julie Delpy (tri-color trilogy), 26 later (although it looks younger), he is a charming American writer traveling Europe after breaking up with his girlfriend She is a young French student traveling back to Paris. They met on the train in Budapest-Vienna and decided to take the train at the same time. Both spiritual and intellectual people spend the night together, walking down the beautiful streets of Vienna, exchanging thoughts and ideas and slowly falling in love. <br /> <br /> This film has Writing in the 90's, technology quickly leapt to the new millennium, with hope and dreams waiting nearby and young adults as they appeared in this film. The life of love and passion for the future. The character of Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy) with flaws and inconsistencies. (Celine's accent is wrong, or the purpose is half the half of the French people and it swayed from one spectrum to the other. Reliability) is a mirror of time Seeing innocent couples swallowing life with this meaning and excitement, showing ancient thoughts and romance. But management so that the audience falls in love with them as well. It is really what makes this movie work for me. The fact that the director did not inform you that their relationship continues after the film or does not make it even more worthwhile. <br /> <br /> All in all, Sunrise The Vienna, a romantic rendezvous that tells classics and movies that I will come back again to look deeper into the future.
