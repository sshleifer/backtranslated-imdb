This film is a violent and intelligent action movie. Story: A businessman is blackmailed by three criminals. Roy Schieder works well as a lead character and special credits have to go to the psycho player John Glover Mischievous I must mention that the villainous characters are very complex and interesting - something very rare for action movies. There are also beautiful and sexy women - the most amazing is Kelly Preston as a minor for the character of Schieder. Vanity gives a very good performance and appearance as a prostitute connected to three blackmailers. I am glad to say that Ann Margaret has not disappeared - this woman is a real baby boy. Do not look at the rate of this film. I don't really know how some people and critics have on this movie. But my suggestion is to ignore them and watch the movie that is worth watching. You will enjoy it. That's a promise. A +
