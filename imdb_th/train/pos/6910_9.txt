There is someone who has made Dave extremely hard. It's the same thing, it's not a joke. <br /> <br /> Paul related to me this morning about the scene. Sammy Davis sings Parado's new national anthem. He arrived in Brazil after a long flight from Vegas. Three planes drove to the set. He was beaten. He almost couldn't stand, had to use a cane. He stayed in the trailer about the size of my bathroom. <br /> <br /> He didn't know he could. Then he saw a crowd of over 6,000 people paying 7 dollars. He returned to life again and they filmed that scene for two hours. He is a beautiful person and almost collapses. <br /> <br /> Paul is a very good person. Real talent
