A really cute movie that is similar to the popular "My Sassy Girl" in 2001, but can be fascinating all the time. The biggest applause should lead to both sides. Ha-Neul Kim is both sweet and strange. Sang-woo Kwon is both attractive and stubborn. The chemistry between the two is very good. Kyeong-hyeong Kim uses CG inserts to look at the image and also has an impressive fighting scene in which Sang-woo Kwon can shine. I like him a lot better here than in the highly overrated "Volcano High" and the boy has a future - those looks, fighting techniques and a bad romantic leader. <br /> <br /> Well, I can Make it short: good movies My rating: 7/10
