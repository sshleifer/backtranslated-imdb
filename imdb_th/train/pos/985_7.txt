This film has many similarities. "The enemy of the state" with Will Smith and Gene Hackman because we have innocent men (blacks) who are pursued by the 'government' with modern technology known to humans. Normally, when copying this kind of story, the results will be disastrous. Not used here Of course, I love everything David Morse does, so my opinion may not be fair. But there is a good story about this movie The main character played by Doug Hutchison is excellent and the story is filled with many specialties such as David Paymer and Robert Pastorelli. Our hero Alvin Sanders. (Played by Jamie Fox) is mostly annoying He was out of place. The story was not good. There was no sympathy from the audience. Or not starting with the strange thing is that he grew up with you (And his followers as well!) I didn't expect much when renting it. But was surprised by a good action movie with a little comedy 7/10
