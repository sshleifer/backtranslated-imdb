This film deserves more recognition than it really does. It is a beautiful and rich image of blood relations, favor and loyalty within the criminal world. This film was beautifully filmed and presented stories about classic crimes such as betrayal and power. This film is a movie, an audience. It needs attention and understanding and is fully rewarded. It is the godfather of Hong Kong and is a much more pleasant change than other wire-like battles. The epic martial arts that seem to be an important part of the film world from Hong Kong and China It has a great sort of character, actor and development, although it's fair to say that I have to watch it twice to emphasize what happens to some characters because they have many interactions in movies. ALL in all 8/10 great characters. The characters, however, have characters that are not outstanding enough, and the music doesn't make me go, and sometimes I feel that it doesn't sync with the action. (There are actions by the way) so it loses some points for that
