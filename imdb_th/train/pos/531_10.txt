This film has the most beautiful opening scene ever. I have watched this movie for the first time last week. Since then, every day I saw the opening and every time I was excited as I felt the first time I heard David Niven speak the immortal words from Sir Walter Ra Leigh The Pilgrimage: <br /> <br /> Let me quiet the scallops, my faithful staff will walk, my happiness leaves, immortal food, my bottle of salvation. , Rung set My relief, insurance, real hope. And so I will take me to a pilgrimage Great job like this? Because they have long been accepted in the Paradise of Poets before they make this movie. <br /> <br /> I imagine that they both faced each other during Doomsday and spoke unabashedly to God. Angry: I forgive you. So you want to know what we do during our lives? You see: We write and create: I know where I am going, Colonel Blimp, Red Shoes ?? Do you think that is enough? Obviously these two great artists have performed their duties with God. Nature the Muse or whatever you may call it when they shoot the story of life and death. The fact that other people's lives are the right thing for their actions may not be clear for everyone. However, I feel that my life will be meaningful if I have never done anything else to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, the old people will be tempted to say: They don't make movies like this again. They are partially misunderstood; They have not done this movie for the past time. <br /> <br /> I've already claimed Keats. But I will repeat: beautiful things are forever happy
