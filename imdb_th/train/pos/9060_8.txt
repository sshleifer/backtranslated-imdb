Seeing this today with my 8 years old, I think it's cute. I agree with other posters that it is not something like a book that I can remember. But we still enjoy it Every child is quite good and everyone is fun. Billy is a new kid who dares to bully from school to eat 10 worms per day. If he loses, he must walk down the school hall with a worm in his pants. The beginning of the movie was created to show that Billy had a very weak stomach and almost everything. The hilarity came along with the various ways to cook worms. A good message about standing up to the gangster and of course the happy ending is happy.
