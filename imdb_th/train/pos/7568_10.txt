Seeing this is my last day at the festival and I'm glad I'm stuck for a few days. Animated poems and the most surprising, funny in their own way, strange It is very difficult to see the director who works in this style, which can find the real strange and humorous in a world that is too exaggerated without thinking of value or losing balance. Manage to see both improvise But still completely controlled I hesitate to compare because these filmmakers have a deep influence (Cassavetes, Malick, Loach, Altman ... suspects as usual) and find their own unique style. But if you like modern directors in this tradition (Lynne Ramsay, David Gordon Green), you're in real practice. This is a great movie and I hope people will see it more. If this movie plays in the festivals in your city, go! Go! Go!
