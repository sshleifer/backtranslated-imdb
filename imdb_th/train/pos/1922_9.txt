Let me first say that this program is the highest level when John Ritter was there. When his death ended, the performance began to decline slightly. But the producer didn't give up on the show. Add James Garner and David Spade to the cast team from 2003 to 2005. <br /> <br /> The center shows around the Hennessy family, Paul (John Ritter asks him to rest in peace) Cate Katey Sagal, their daughter Bridget (Kaley Cuoco), Kerry (Amy Davidson) and their son Rory (Martin Spanjers). When Ritter is on the list, I will scream with laughter. (And proud to admit it to me) but now he has gone, I will only laugh a little with occasional laughs I am very glad that I fell in love with this program after Ritter died prematurely because it made the eps and Ritter a lot better. <br /> <br /> Ritter's character is doing well and is very harmonious. Love him. He always takes care of girls about dating. But he really wants them to be happy It's the best father who doesn't like entertainment from fans. <br /> <br /> Katey Sagal is also great and she is also a favorite character. After Ritter's death, her character gave this influence and strength not only to her children. But I believe Sagal has forged the life of Cuoco, Davidson and Spanjers because she and Ritter have been friends for a long time. <br /> <br /> The funniest person in the program must be Bridget Hennessy. The spokes played by Kaley Cuoco. She is a wonderful blonde girl: slow, slow, beautiful. But she is intelligent She is outside the hilarious wall with humor. The innocent 'blonde girl' and how she thinks she is. <br /> <br /> Amy Davidson can make her look annoying like Kerry. The only mistake of the program is the performance that never gave Kerry a pleasure. She always followed Bridget and her character felt like being thrown into it. <br /> <br /> Come Spaneses, as a lonely Hennessy son, is hysterical and when Ritter shows When the death of Ritter, the show makes some stories for Rory. <br /> <br /> David Spade and James Garner have nothing but laughs. There are also occasional stories for CJ. With the character of Spade Garner plays the role of Cate's father, which is the basic information. <br /> <br /> All I gave this performance was a great review because it was a wonderful program with a tragic event. You will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> 9/10 --spy
