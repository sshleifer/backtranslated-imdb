For me too, this special Christmas is another book that I can remember with love. In 1989, I picked up two CDs that I discovered from the recording of my sister's soundtrack and kept another sheet for myself It is part of my family's Christmas tradition now and I like to see the show again more than I can remember while I listen. <br /> <br /> There is another record at John. Denver made a number of appearances on the Muppet Show and they performed more than one item together. The good harmony between Denver and his vague companions arrived here clearly in a charming and fun performance for all ages.
