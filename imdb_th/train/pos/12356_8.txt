In contrast to the conclusions of some people, women who appear in movies are not geisha. They are oiran (prostitutes) who live outside the most famous entertainment zone and their lives and experiences represent the lives of Tokugawa women. lots of I can't say that the stories are clear. But their charm is that they are role models The theme is universal and every day: love, friendship and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy the direction of art and acting. I feel like I get the time and place that I can't see. Actors, especially the 4 women who played the role of Orian, are exciting people. I recommend this movie to people who want to experience Japanese culture only or those who like quiet and emotional stories. It is a good example of both.
