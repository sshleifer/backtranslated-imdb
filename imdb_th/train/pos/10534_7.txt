Whether it's a good movie or not, I think this type of movie It reminds me of "I love Huckabees", a film that is puzzled by Isabelle Huppert, who was sodomized by an American man in a mud pond. I hope the director will cross the border as if I felt that the choice that Vincenzo Natali did was not always subtle. (Some scenes are like "tarte-à-la-crème" slashing like children) talking about scripts and movies? The color of "Cube" is black. "Nothing" is more cheerful white than Natali's past movies.
