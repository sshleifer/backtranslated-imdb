I saw this movie in Hallmark and thought it was great, especially when it came from real people. Pierce Brosnan is a very good man, because the lonely English man who plays half a gray owl. The shooting is beautiful. <br /> <br /> This movie makes me research more about this character. Archie Belaney easily known as Gray Owl. I want to read the most about him. At that time I didn't know Richard Attenborough directed it, but I wasn't surprised. I like all of his movies, whether he is acting or directing. I give the highest score However, I would like to see more in the movie about the reason he played this role because it showed only two aunts who raised him and his room in their home. <br /> <br /> You can't go. Wrong with this movie if you are like me and enjoy the beautiful story without having to hear the vulgar language and special techniques planned every few minutes.
