I believe that many people vote on movies, not because of lack of quality. But it doesn't follow the standard Hollywood formula Some conflicts are not resolved. The ending is just a little too much for others, but the journey of the rich characters and the long list of sponsors gives both stimulating and entertaining ideas. Although filming is excellent due to the urban environment, the governance is excellent and creative. <br /> <br /> This is 10 in my book. They are risky and slightly different. I think it works well. I intend to avoid direct references to movies because seeing yourself is the best answer, not accepting other people's interpretations.
