Yesterday afternoon, after I left the theater, there was no dry eye when I watched the gems of this movie in a house sold out as part of the Hamburg Film Festival this year And the tears were all laughter This movie is hilarious, there is no way to say this again. I laughed through it and with me, our other three hundred lovers of French cinema. <br /> <br /> Alain Chabat is really great. Great clowns if necessary and serious if the situation demands Of course, acting is more complete than above. But this is what the story needs and what makes it work Equally wonderful is Charlotte Gainsbourg, which I like to watch a lot, and the mother has good performance as well. Sisters may have little details about the character's role. But besides that there was nothing to lament I had a good afternoon watching this movie while Hamburg was sunk in the rain outside and I hope this film from France will be released in Germany regularly. But the distributor is that this country doesn't seem to understand that France creates a good movie. At least I can't wait to find a DVD with subtitles. (Hello Australia? Please?) Because this movie that I want at home to see many times!
