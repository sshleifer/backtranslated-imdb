I have read other reviews and found that there is something to compare the real life of movies v (such as things that need to be used in music schools), Britney Bashing, etc. etc. So let us focus on movies and texts> <br /> I rate this movie 7 out of 10 for ages 8 to 14 years and for family movies. For the average adult man .... 2 out of 10 <br /> <br /> I like pop / rock. I'm 45 years old. I know Britney Spears, but I never knew that she actually sang. Stronger until I read These credits and reviews I do not recognize her poster on the wall, so I do not worry about 'Self-promotion' <br /> <br /> I watched movies for entertainment. I don't care about the selection of light actors, directors, film directors and others. What is it and entertain me? <br /> <br /> I watched this movie to receive news. The greatest epidemic in the world is low self-esteem. (Which is all other matters), so have to keep an eye on the message because it is interesting The movie is bright and the wind blows. Suitable for children. I found Texan twang starting to fade across the movie and of course there are only a few ways to convey the surrender / uncompromising message. Great message, even though ... should have more. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great family movie. But for himself
