The only opening sequence is worth the entrance fee due to Cheech and the drag box where large garbage can cross the gas-filled parking lot. "Don't spill it!" The hilarious thing, and then, while the 'plot' happens, you'll sit one time. I watched this movie recently, and it ended up being funny in each watch. Try it out.
