First of all, I'm a white skin. But even with a handicap, I love this movie. It's about real people Real time and location And of course, New York City in the 80s. I have many gay friends growing up in New York in the eighties and one thing that I always admire is the courage to live the way they want to live No matter what heppens That is courage You have to appreciate that. This is a great movie to watch and apply to what is like a colorful African-American man or gay Hispanic in New York in the eighties. It's real life The bottom line is it's real life.
