First of all, I saw this movie without knowing anything. I just knew that Joel Schumacher did it and that was enough for me. Friends and I went to see the Danish Film Festival, called the Night Film Festival, which is a lot of movies that are shown after time. This festival specializes in movies that are not shown in Danish theaters. Anyway, my friend and I went to see it and we were surprised by the reality that appeared and it affected our feelings.

Dark Trier (Dancer In) <br /> <br /> In summary, this movie is worth seeing as it gives a different perspective for what happened to the GI in America. Joe left school at Expected to serve their country in These /> <br /> fighting far from home, Colin Farr <br Torre also featured in this film, I had never seen him before. More of him <br /> <br /> Lars P. Helvard
