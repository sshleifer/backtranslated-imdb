They filmed this movie on Long Island, where I grew up. His brother and girlfriend are special people in this movie. Apparently there was a party scene in which they were drinking beer. (Which they told me that it was a tasteless and very difficult color to swallow repeatedly But we have never heard of the movie that was released in any form. It never came out in the cinema. (Clearly) and as far as I know it has never been released in the video and I am sure that it was not released on DVD. Still, it seems that some people will see, though it may be very small. So there must be something I would definitely like to buy this thing for my brother. But there is no way I can find anywhere Does anyone know anything about time / place / how to buy this movie? And what format will it be?
