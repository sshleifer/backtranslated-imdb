Let me go to the bottom line here: I have 3 children aged 5 to 10. I think the trip to the theater is successful when there are no talking animals. I have watched the videos of most children in our collection for at least 72 times. I can tell you that when the film was revived in The Wizard of Oz, more than 18 sex jokes in El Dorado and the tragic flaws at the end of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. May I tell Nemo the story of only memories? <br /> What makes me support my only child? (It's different) Who introduced this title for family movies in the evening? In a word: Showerman <br /> <br /> A moment of silence ... <br /> <br /> * Sigh *
