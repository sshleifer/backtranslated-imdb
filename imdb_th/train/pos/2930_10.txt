This film is separated from the side. Eddie seems to bring that identity to the stage and make the most basic things funny from having ice cream from the children to the old traditions of the family gathering. This film is very rare in this country. But not sure if it will be available in other countries. I have searched through a lot of websites and still have no luck. The company called for a rare video search and had a waiting list. If anyone likes Eddie Murphy as a comedian and watching the video received, it's worth the money and can't go wrong.
