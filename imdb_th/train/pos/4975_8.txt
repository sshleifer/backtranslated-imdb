By God, it has been a long time since I saw this. Maybe about 18 years ago. <br /> <br /> The film tells us about human blood and the circulatory system. Professionally gathered - Disney-style animations, including human actors - it was directed by Frank Capra for the benefit of Pete. <br /> <br /> The kind of diligence I wonder how much the production value is worth the amount of information on the human body? But those boys will watch the children learn: now I can clearly remember that Dr. Baxter has been challenged by Hemo himself to name the most common material that is similar to human blood, which the doctor immediately replied "sea water"
