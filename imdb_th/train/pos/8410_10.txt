In this glamorous and gloomy movie, a poor student sold his soul to the devil with a large amount of money in return for the devil to use his mirror image. (This is done in the movie Training the sword in front of the mirror) is a visible metaphor for "The man who war with himself", which is a symbol of his near future Students enjoy their money. But the woman he loves is unattainable (He made a deal with the devil. He was cut off from love and other treasures of the soul forever.) You can have love or exchange your soul in exchange for money. You can't have both Balduin being haunted by his partner. (This narrative shows beautifully, as well as some actions that are incredibly disastrous. When Satan disappears with Balduin's mirror image, it is amazing. Out of human society (The scene where he ran away from his partner and ended up in The 'wasteland' at the edge of the city is no longer human at all. (He lost his soul) He was like an animal that was hunted outside of human society. There are many things to say about this amazing movie. Paul Wegener is an excellent actor and director who is my cultural hero. It helps if you know the story of German history at the time of this film. Built and about the German tradition (not google, it gets the right book). Just remember that it's a very fast movie. It's quite clumsy. Sometimes But considering what to say and it's a tragic ending, it's one of the best things that has ever been!)
