I just watched this movie and had to say that I was very impressed. It's very creepy and there are many moments that will make you jump out of the seat! I have to smoke many "emergency" cigarettes along the way to calm the nerves! If I have to criticize, I would say that sometimes if there is anything, there are too many jumps. It comes to a point where every new scene ends with a jump and this will gradually shock the effect because you are a new thing coming. <br /> <br /> Although it is Ancient thoughts in all types of ghosts They did very well to maintain the scary and scary factor. It has elements of The Shining, The Sense 6 and The Changeling (especially the song that reminds me of The Changeling). <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this to anyone looking for an old fear!
