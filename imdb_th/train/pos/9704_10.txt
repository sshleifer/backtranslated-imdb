I can't believe that it's been ten years since this program aired on TV for the first time and made viewers happy with a unique combination of humor and horror. This is a show that gave birth to a good part of modern English humor: Dr. Terrible's home. Horrible; Garth Marenki of the Darkplace; The Great Boosh; The medicine box. Many people mimic the style of this show and I do not deny some people more than its quality, but Jermy Dyson deserves recognition for starting the trend with actor Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith. <br /> <br /> They jointly build the Royston Vasey, a scary little town in the beautiful countryside of England. And the people who passed by found an overwhelming pair who wanted to keep the city to be a city free from strangers Where the unemployed were abused and insulted at the job center Where the farmer uses the real person as a scarecrow That the vet killed all the animals he tried to treat The gypsy circus group kidnaps people. And where the butcher adds the secret But irresistible to food that will attract people. <br /> <br /> This is just what the audience can find in The League of Gentlemen by themselves. All three actors give birth to dozens of unique characters. And ten Makeup and prosthetics are very good. Actually, I think I watch more actors than ever. But it is a great show: the way they change their voices and body movements to become real people. <br /> <br /> Most jokes start with ordinary things from real life and from Then burst into something Insecurity, sometimes filling in the stomach Sometimes it is a pure horror story without setting like in the character of Papa. Lazarou just thinks that the creepy circus owner is bargaining for someone's house and kidnaps the woman as his wife. he There is no explanation. It's creepy. Then there are references to many horror movies: Se7en, The Silence of the Lambs, Nosferatu, The Exorcist and others. <br /> <br /> Fans of horror movies will love. It's fans of funny movies will love it. When tourists know that there are signs that 'Welcome to Royston Vasey: You will never leave.' The audience that gave this show the opportunity to agree. When you discover the League of Gentlemen, you won't need anything else. You'll never forget it.
