Tarzan and Jane are happily in the forest. Some men are looking for ivory and bringing Jane back to civilization. But Jane loves Tarzan and refuses to leave A man falls in love with Jane and is determined to take her back ... even if that means killing Tarzan. <br /> <br /> This is a rare thing - a better sequel than the original "Tarzan, Ape Man "in 1932 is a good thing. But with awesome special effects and dragging This has a much better and more mature effect. There is a ton of racism. (Black men were shot to death until death - and no one really cared) but this was in 1934. There was also blood, blood and violence. (For the 1934 film) and the type Jane Cut Swim underwater with totally nude lengths! There is also a clear sexual content and Tarzan and Jane wear on their side and they sleep together and have sex without marriage. This will not disturb anyone today, but in 1934, this is really fantastic. <br /> <br /> In addition, this movie has a fast, full of adventure and excitement. Seeing Weissmuller in the stingy lion fabric is something that keeps the eyes and Jane's dress out as well. I also think Maureen O'Sullivan is as bad as Jane, but Weismuller is perfect like Tarzan. Others are ok. <Br /> <br /> This is a Weis The best muller - O'Hara Tarzan looks good but not for kids!
