David Webb Peoples meets Paul Anderson ... If it sounds strange to you, you are right because of that person. <br /> <br /> People are well known in his script about the right and wrong things. The value of life, etc ... He discusses these problems in Bladerunner, Unforgiven, and quite a lot in his screenplay that has something along those lines. The first successful movie of Paul Anderson. Not surprisingly, there are all his other movies! And this is a violent thriller with a moral meaning! <br /> <br /> People script is quite clear in the first half of the movie. The soldiers were trained from birth, taught to kill and never had a normal life. They were replaced by soldiers with better genetic modification, and Todd, one of the original soldiers, was left on the planet and left to die. There he had to deal with a group of refugees, some of whom wanted him to be with other people, hated him and had interesting plays here. New moves to the world for military exercises and tries to kill everyone. The great and violent actions that followed came and the chapters of the people became the Anderson Festival. It's hard to believe that the script is written in that way. But the final product is better than I expected Entertainment is quite acceptable, not very stimulating and exciting when the action begins. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rate R: Very violent.
