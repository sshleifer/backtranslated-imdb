By watching this movie, you can learn more about our world than just reading a book. It shows that we are buried in the flow of life. This film is not only for "environmental enthusiasts", even if people who want to see good movies must have a message to watch. This film taught me that we not only But there is life on earth ... We live with the world and through plants and animals of all kinds grow and die with us.
