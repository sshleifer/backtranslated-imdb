I watched movies for a living. Choose which ones are good enough to give ... Throw away what you didn't do. I'm not saying that I know more than anyone, according to this story, I just take you to see how I came to see "The Gospel of Lou" ... Many bad movies are on the table and In fact, I sat through them all. In fact, I didn't "watch" everything. I always looked at the TV from time to time while I was scanning how well the production value, performance, and presentation story If something striking, I'll take the time to see "Lou" pulling me in the first few minutes when I close my laptop and wheel my chair to the TV so that I can listen completely. Said that I was attracted throughout the movie The story is well told, the characters are cute or disgusting. (Depending on the actors and the director's intentions for the characters) and play very well Sometimes I find occasional amateur errors in camera work and editing. But the emotional nature of the story makes these defects easy to cancel I have heard other people's opinions, saying that sometimes this movie makes their tears very satisfying ... I laughed one minute and cried further and was very impressed with this film. Sadly, I couldn't buy it because I was - as told - at the end of the week and the dollar was short. That's the way to go sometimes ... but at least I'm happy to see this one and I can't wait to get a response. Good luck and great fortune for Bret Carr (if you read this). You will no doubt have the ability to watch.
