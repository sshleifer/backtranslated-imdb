As a collector of movie memorabilia, I have to buy a movie poster for this movie, which I have now seen in the end, must be the best thing about it. There is nothing more attractive to hang on your wall than the 27x41 inch image of the melter. However, there is nothing terrifying to put on your VCR for more than an hour and a half. At first I thought that this movie was pure garbage. But then I realized that it had some qualities that made me laugh. Dr character Ted Nelson must be the most terrifying character that has ever appeared on the screen. His conversation is almost boring! ("It's incredible! He seems to be stronger as he melts!) <br /> <br /> And someone can tell me how they know how they know when Steve left before him. Will melt completely, plan to "help" him if the film is intended to make the audience scared, I think it missed the call
