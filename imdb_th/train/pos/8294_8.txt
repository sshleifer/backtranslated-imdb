This movie has a great fight scene. Now it is true that the show is quite rough. But if I want to watch movies from acting skills, I'll watch the Cheesy Like American Beauty movie, but if you want to watch a movie that has real martial arts in this movie and with stunning stunts without using wires and Flying in the air like a lot of movies in this round that killed the matrix Then watch this Now it is true, two stars in the performance of the children performing the Power Rangers and the other members of the show have a slight part in this film. But wait a moment, the fight scene is enough to make Jet Li p ** pants and acrobatics worth it to Jackie Chan to sit and appreciate.
