One of the most devastating and cruel movies I've ever seen. But is one of the most sad and moving movies This is a comical act like the world has never seen before. Sometimes the plot makes me close to tears while in the next period, delivering shocking revelations like a bone burst, jabbing with courage. The cold performance by Edison Chen, the story of the HK-Cop police and Cambodian killers who hunted together while losing their humanity is a good thing. Offering very little dialogue to get haunted images and violent camera work. "Dog Bites Dog" is HK-Bloodshed without courage.
