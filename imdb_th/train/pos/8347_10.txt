Maybe I'm too generous with scoring ... but I just love this movie! I've seen it many times But every time I see it, I fall in love again. It's just a romantic comedy that has nothing big. But I am a romantic person and this movie is * romantic. I love Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins and Walter Mathau is very funny. Scientists make me laugh a lot ... I recommend this movie to anyone who does. have seen It's a good and clean movie - and it's very rare now! My 20-year-old brother also likes this movie, so it's not just a chicken flick ;-) I would suggest if you want to laugh or if you're lonely and want to * see * love if you can't join. It is good
