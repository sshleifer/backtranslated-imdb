Child 'Sexploitation' is one of the most serious problems that our world faces today, and I am afraid that any movie on that topic will go straight to the scene with clear sexual characteristics in order to scare and annoy people. watch After seeing both 'trade' and 'holly', one movie made me want to see changes in international law. The other person felt that it was a terrible attempt to make me cry for five minutes with strange emotional and suicide songs. <br /> <br /> I don't believe that turning this problem into a tearing problem. Hollywood is a useful or necessary strategy to use, and I have to praise the 'Holly' for thorough involvement. Was forced to endure sadness. The 'trade' was shaken during the seriousness and stupidity of the scene related to the death of a cat that followed after a picture showing a child who was forced to perform some horrible acts. I found that there was no match and sometimes causing dissatisfaction. If I want cheap laughter, I won't sign up to watch a movie about child trafficking. <br /> <br /> For everyone who wants to watch a powerful movie that means something, I highly recommend it. Collect money in movie tickets for the launch of 'Holly'.
