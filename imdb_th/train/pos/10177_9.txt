'De Grot' is an excellent Dutch thriller from the book written by Tim Krabbé. His other book, 'Het Gouden Ei', was created to be a mysterious thriller of Dutch called 'Spoorloos' ( 'The Vanishing') In 1988, this movie was not as good as the 'Vanishing' thriller We saw a man later. We learned his name was Egon Wagter (Fedja van Huêt) that came from a plane in Thailand. When he took his bag, it was quite clear that he was smuggling things across the border. These scenes are perfectly directed, photographed and performed. The type of suspicion that is created, usually you are not in this open scene. Later, we see how Egon created a deal with women in Thailand, both indicating that they have never done anything like this. <br /> <br /> From this point, this movie is backward and forward. Continually, we see how Egon is still a child. (Here played by Erik van der Horst) befriends a man named Axel (like a child played by Benja Bruijning). We learn how they grew up as friends and Axel (as an adult played by Marcel Hensema) Became a criminal, Egon, at the same time went to college and settled with women During this time, he met Axel but didn't want him to do anything. <br /> <br /> The movie is in chronological order. It shows that Egon and Axel are more children than adults and in the mid-thirties. But sometimes I said that the movie went back when they were kids and jumped forward again. Every time we see them as children, it explains some things that happen when they are adults. <br /> <br /> Those who devastate a little here <br /> <br /> That name To 'cave' and it's a cave That makes the movie end happily, even if it's actually not happy Like the beginning, the ending is great. The middle part of this movie is entertaining and it makes us interested in the first scene just to come back to that point at the end. It is a montage that makes the movie a happy ending, although we can say that the amazing ending is also happy.
