I saw this in the show last night as well. I blown all that this movie was better than I expected. There are a few movies that can combine dark comedy and current stories and not make it break down. In conclusion, <br /> <br /> I won't be too busy about plans because I think you know little about it with It makes it a lot better But I will say that Adam Sandler's performance is very refreshing and realistic. He is more funny and fun than his latest comedies. Don Cheadle has faith as well. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a joke like Borat or Billy Madison, but it has a good rhythm about it. Big movie Through this film, slow down to mention the end of things and perform very well in combining them together. <br /> <br /> I still think it's really cool. What a white friend, they choose to ignore it and focus on their relationship.
