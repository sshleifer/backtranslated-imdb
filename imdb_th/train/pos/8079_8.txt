There are not many reviews, so I think I will add one. <br /> <br /> Don't follow other reviews! This is a great movie. <br /> <br /> RKS is one of the few Indian directors who can really make a good movie. <br /> <br /> AB and Akshay are excellent examples. Otherwise The same performance as bhoomika, which is a little unexpected <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that there are not many advertisements. <br /> <br /> Or other movies / awards. Consider how good this movie is. <Br / > <br /> It's better than I thought, and I think Khakkee is a good movie as well. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie. But it's worth it and While watching, it seems to be a long time. <br /> <br /> Can't wait for the next movie RKS and AB next to the Akshay movie that they seem to be working together ... like waqt <br /> <br /> Pumika performed very well in the movie and should do very well if she remained in the same way in the future.
