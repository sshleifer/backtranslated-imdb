Big surprise, probably because I expected to suck. The criticism is not quite interested, even though they all agree that the idea is golden: Men know that his new boyfriend is a superhero and finds that when he wants to break up with her psychosis, I expect it to fall But never did Of course, it does not create as good evidence as it should be and choose to be short when it might be better to expand the film universe. But I can't blame it. Uma Thurman is great as a Super Bipolar G-Girl and I've discovered it after many years of dislike for him. Luke Wilson can be perfectly perfect when Show as a priest He received two of the best comic performances in 2006 (another story in the unreleased Idiocracy). I spoke out in his face when he and Thurman had sex for the first time. It's one of the funniest sex scenes ever. My only real complaint is that they make G-Girl too psychologically almost unbelievable. There may be some background. I can accept better. But I can forgive its shortcomings because I have a really good time. Look, it's definitely underrated.
