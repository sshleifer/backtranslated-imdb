While we all know that romantic comedy is a genre that has a known ending. Both leaders must always be together. At the end of the third chapter, I try to think about how it will end and how they will gather. Clues get from the beginning. But you will never know until the end It is a simple hook but can be used. To Be To Be You covers a lot of normal areas. But will revolve when possible I like all NY characters and I like the place. It's a postcard of NY. It's also good to watch movies and not find anything offensive in it. So if you like old-fashioned romantic movies ... this is what you want.
