Those who love Elivra, as I do in the event of hosting a late night movie, will love this movie - she's just so cool - her car is great and she is Transylvanian Dolly Parton - She is innocent and innocent - and sexy all the time - plus more than the western mother's touch - <br /> <br /> That scene is well done and the best comedian by Edie McClurg is the best. As usual, her - plus Sally Kellerman as Patty is a hilarious person. Whenever I have to crunch something for topping, I think Elvis is a potato. <br /> <br /> This movie Is a matter that must be viewed again After that for the fun of it Now I have to get the sequel to the Haunted Hills of Elvira and see if it has this life. ----
