I really love this show! I always like Space Ghost in 1990! This show is hilarious and I can't believe why Cartoon Network's adult swimmers are using this kind of comedy out of the air. I hope they will bring this performance onto a DVD or something. The show is about Brak (from Space Ghost, SGCC and Cartoon Planet cartoons) that live every day with his mother and father and his best friend who loves to fall in love. Zorak! My favorite moment was when Zorak received a really good singing voice. His voice didn't give any money to Zorak from singing. One more episode that I like is that Brak and Zorak did not complete their homework. After that, they returned from Sunday to Friday and they went out. They then returned to the invented homework Current homework doesn't exist! Another episode that I like is that Brak's father and their next door neighbor. Thundercleese the Robot came into this and then they were eaten by a giant worm. The other one that I like is the place where Zorak stands the bully, and there are new people to replace him. I like many other episodes! One thing that never made me laugh is when Zorak was smashed, destroyed, bombed and shot!
