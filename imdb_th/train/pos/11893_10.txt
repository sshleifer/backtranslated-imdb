The next two seasons of this original series are less than lackluster. The major catastrophe in the latter season affected the short time of the three seasons. Maybe if the plug is pulled out after the first season, it will be tracked. <br /> <br /> In addition, the first season is really hilarious! Witty, brilliant writing The first season of great brew, with the right ingredients - characters / actors, stories and more, plus comedy about journalists Paparazzi is the original boot. Nora and her co-workers "photographer" in the prowl of the night, day after day, every day for special things <br /> <br /> Many things are not reasonable. Like this method of acting and one thing I like - Gross Pointe never "done" if only the first season of Naked Truth and Grosse Pointe was released on DVD.
