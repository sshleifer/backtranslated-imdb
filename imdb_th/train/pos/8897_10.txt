Me and my sister rented this movie because we were in the mood with something worthless and didn't want to watch. However, this movie exceeded my very low expectations. <br /> <br /> It's more than just a performance of the century. It has a picture of the real character in it, and most actors do a great job. Different stories will be combined with real videos from the time that gives a unique touch. While watching it, I felt that I care about what happened to the character. <br /> <br /> I want to praise Julia Stiles in Katie's image. She's a great person in a distinctive way! <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie to everyone ..
