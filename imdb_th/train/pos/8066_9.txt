One of John Ford's best films, 'The Informer', doesn't have the greatest scene of Western Americans. Instead of being a famous drama drama, Ford is known for playing on the rough surface of the English actress Victor Mackelen. The former priest, who had confronted Joe Louis in the arena, delivered an embarrassing Academy Award-winning drawing of the IRA Gypo Nolan, the worst night of his life. <br /> <br /> Story Simple and elegant Dublin, a starving and humiliating man who was thrown out of the IRA because he could not kill the informant in cold blood, so he became a reporter for Â£ 20. Which he drank and gave his blood money in the fast jerk of guilt, rejection, self-pity, and a great desire to escape his consequences. /> <br /> remove it as complicated <br remarkable that the character of Gypo seems simple, the most impressive success of the film. In most movies, Gypo's style is heavily overweight. He should have two or three lines that are best and quickly eliminated so that the heroes and villains can make their showdown in 'The Informer'. Gypo himself is both a hero. And the villain while the showdown is in his inner turmoil, where everything is shared with the audience clearly. <br /> <br /> Because Liam O'Flaherty's novel had been before filming in the year 1929 RKO offers a very low budget to Ford. His superintendent and co-worker, especially director of photography Joseph H. August changed this to be an advantage in creating a nasty masterpiece about men who waged war on themselves. In addition to the Academy Award for McLaglen 'The Informer', John Ford also won an award for Best Screenplay and Best Score.
