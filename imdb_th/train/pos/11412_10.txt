Mischa Barton plays a clever and intelligent child like Frankie and Ingrid Uribe Hazel. Although the story is quite imaginative, Young Hazel runs to find the mayor outside the premises. While the performance is very good by everyone involved, this movie tends to lack the true atmosphere of the drama. Maybe we will grow up to expect the horrifying reality in the movie instead of comparing Pollyanna and How Green Was My Valley! It doesn't matter. Each of them is good at their own style. <br /> <br /> I admire Joan Plowright, although her role is quite quiet here. Central street entertainment is ideal for younger audiences and a good time to experience great classical music, which is almost rare! <br /> <br /> I found this movie to be a delight. Values ​​for ideas for year growth and no violence. Thank God. Warm family movies to enjoy.
