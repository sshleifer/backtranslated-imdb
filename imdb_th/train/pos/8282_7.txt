** Possible spoiler ** <br /> <br /> The biggest part of the movie that doesn't work is Wendid and when your character fails, your movie will always be far away. The filmmakers' interpretation of Wendigo's style is interesting and can be intimidated correctly when filmed correctly - when the escaped murderer sees Wendigo in the flash in his rearview mirror - and the tree pattern is good. Much However, as a monster character, it never really came to life. We didn't get much explanation about its behavior and what we saw from it was not important to the story told in the movie or the legendary Wendigo that I had read. <br /> <br /> I think one. The main reason that the monster fails is that it does not give enough in the movie. When you boil this movie down to its bones, what you have is a thriller thriller with a slightly supernatural element instead of a movie about monsters. <br /> <br /> The movie is a wonderful story; The filmmakers use the scenery, light and time of day to convey the atmosphere and mood quite well. Otis's character is truly dangerous and unpredictable, making him a true monster in this movie. It may be more effective to explain his behavior as he is possessed by the starving spirit of Wendigo, which will be a more accurate representation of true myths. <br /> <br /> I heard reports that were not possible. Confirmed (from newsgroups) that the reason that Wendexo did a lot is that when the monster set was created, it would become harder and more uncomfortable. (In order to imitate the gesture that stands on the gigabyte) the actor must walk. On his toes) that is almost impossible to run, walk, or show in it Therefore, the flash light, a lot of living things remain, and the clear sped-up image of it works. I emphasize that these reports are not confirmed.
