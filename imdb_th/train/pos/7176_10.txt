OK - You want to test someone about their comfort with their teenager and the shameful and crazy changes - then get an immediate response from watching this awesome doctor about More children than any movie I've seen, this movie deals with sexuality and the ego burden in a completely human way, never boring and clear. In the natural goodness of the youth that has been discolored by an adult world full of fear The quirks of youngsters are guaranteed to be insane to distortion. Mini-mogul Darren Stien seems to have access to a deeper understanding of his triumphs and worries as a strict old world boy What he found in himself and others is not always beautiful - but shows how we can improve and reconcile with age. What does change mean without reflection? I love this movie.
