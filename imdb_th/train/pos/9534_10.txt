This movie show is a movie that serves very well. I would say that acting is sometimes weak at times; But most of the performances are very good The only actor who disappointed me with his performance was Jude Law as Harlan Maguire. He's really incredible! Tom Hanks doesn't seem confident at some point throughout the story. But he was incredible too Paul Newman as well Filming is what makes movies a masterpiece. (And I rarely use that word) Conrad Hall is a true genius. If at any point in the movie you are paused, you will see the exquisite craftsmanship of this man. He set every appointment to prevent anything from falling out. When the camera still has quality postcards like the screen When the camera is moving, every shot is planned for understated perfection, but it doesn't stop there. Choose colors and contrasts between brightness and dark settings as art. The way he shines, the dress is the most amazing light work I've ever seen. His work in this film made it the way it was. This film is in the top of the list of great movies with LOTR, Black Hawk Down, Hero, CTHD, Moulin Rouge and Vertigo. Stories that people will say that this movie is a gangster flick in the 1930s. He missed the important point of the movie. It is a love story about a killer who failed to try to protect his son from the life he chose. It is a cleverly created story that reveals the magnificent bond between two people who have nothing but each other. Screen writing is worthy of the song Oscar Thomas Newman showing a sad score. But there is hope for more sad and hopeful stories Music is the most beautiful and moving music. Sam Mendes is a new director who feels experienced directors. The symbols he used and the performances he received from his actors are rare in the world of filmmaking today. I'll wait to see the movie Sam Mendes. The next story 10/10. One of the most animated and beautiful movies I've ever seen.
