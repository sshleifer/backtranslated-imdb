During the Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy Craze Paramount Pictures cast the ball into the revival. Anthony Quinn, film director Cecil B. DeMille, directed the movie and brought it on DVD and Blu Ray with all the extras. It is clear for me that Paramount Pictures is a blind execs and ignores the fact that they have a great pirate movie in their vault about a real pirate who lives in New Orleans, Louisiana, which helps to make The Crescent City once. One is famous again for the connection of pirates. Finally, when the top executives at Paramount get together with the program and release this movie in digital format, I will be a happy camper. The more the image is up to you to get rid of the evil and restore the movie right now!
