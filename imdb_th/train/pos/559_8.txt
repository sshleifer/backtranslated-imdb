A good movie as well - at this time - a story that is long and dark, reminiscent of John Ford's "The Searchers", although not cruel. The story begins quickly and does not give up with many scenes of good conversation between Jeff Webster, Ronda Castle and the horizontal axis sheriff. This film has many ways to think of "Bend of the River" (1952), which is the work of Mann-Stewart. But I found it to be a little more interesting and interesting. There are a few caveats: the ending (and quite sensitive) ends too quickly; Corrine Calvert is 24 years old, unbelievable as a naive French teenager, and of course this film originated in the Mythic West, a land of tales that national laws and physics don't actually use. But these are a few concerns. James Stewart is a good person who is surprised by the darkness, the one who thinks he cares about anyone. But he himself and the mountain scenery cannot be overcome Good western drama series
