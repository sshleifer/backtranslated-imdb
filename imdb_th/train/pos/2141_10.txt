Masayuki Suo, the director of this film, has been portrayed as a "classic dance" after good and classic. (In Japan anyway) Sumo comedy "Shiko Funjatta" Sumo tracks his own great footsteps with great success. <br /> <br /> The story is engaging. We both laughed often (Naoto Takenaka is a hilarious comedy as if he were in Suo's previous two films) and rooted in the characters. But for me, the big bonus is the look at this movie for the audience to enter the Japanese society - real life in Japan. Suo has a unique ability to show real-life activities with a fun flair. The result is a movie that will draw you into making you laugh, making you think and both enjoying you and providing insights about Japan today. <br /> <br /> Look for the 8 main actors from Shiko Funjatta while they all appeared again in various roles from the supporting characters (Takenaka) to the short pendant (many people)
