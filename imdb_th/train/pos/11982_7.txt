This is what I feel about acting. <br /> <br /> I started watching the program again in 2001. <br /> <br /> I enjoy acting. <br /> <br /> <br /> I hate Michael and the characters JOEY! <br /> <br /> Steal stories from old TV shows. They stole from "The Partirdge Family". Then, in episode 1, "Partridge Family" was mentioned. <br /> <br /> Actors have different roles in various episodes. MTV Martha Quinn did something amazing. Most especially when she plays herself on episode 1. <br /> <br /> Michelle's character isn't funny. But then they have this little child acting Funny with them. <br /> <br /> The story comes and goes. In episode 1, Joey receives a TV show with Frankie & Annette. Never heard of it after that. Danny plays the guitar unexpectedly. Episode 1 He trained football 1 when he trained softball / baseball. 1 game. And are you going out? <br /> <br /> Jesse & Joey continue to work fast without experience. Only on TV. <br /> <br /> I like D.J & the character Stephanie wishes Jodie Sweetin will learn from Candace Cameron Bure and live a life free from clean drugs.
