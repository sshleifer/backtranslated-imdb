I like it now, but it seems to me that I should have a quick reference to the secretary who has been punished as an effective conspirator. While I liked it when Columbo's episode had such an unpredictable nature, its resolution should be part of the chapter's conclusion, along with the revelation of the murderer. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Peter Falk and Ruth Gordon is invaluable. At one point, Gordon acted as a famous writer, commenting on the fact that L. Colombo was famous for making a reference to the detective's real-life reputation as a crime solver. This is one of the best of many wonderful Columbo periods.
