I do not understand your objections to this movie. It is an exciting and exciting extension of the characters created in "Basic Instinct". The only part of the story that is slightly unrealistic is the fact that Sharon Stone's characters are still alive and not in Cook on this scheduled day. <br /> <br /> Spoiler. Alert: When the movie continues Presented with three theories of what happened: 1) Sharon Stone's character is killing all these people because she is crazy. (Risky drug addiction); 2) David Thewlis' crooked police are killing these people to frame the role of Sharon Stone; 3) David Morrissey's analyst killed these people for revenge. What makes most people dissatisfied with the movie seems to have no theory that is described as "real" (although analysts are in a psychiatric hospital to kill the police. <br /> <br /> I think this is a great plot device in the spirit of "2001, A Space Odyssey." Who cares about reality? The blonde girl is really crazy. The police are very crooked and analysts want revenge. The important thing is to interact between these characters and other characters in the same story as real life. Everyone is more complicated than everyone thinks and reality is more complicated than movies. Get more than that!
