Spoiler alert! This movie, Zero Day, gives life to two students, Andrean and Calvin, who are upset and hated for everyone and everything related to school. <br /> <br /> They go. With their own set, thinking that all "missions" lead to a great mission, which is a content center. Zero Days is not specified until the middle of the movie. The audience knew that it was serious and full of hate. But never sure until the end. <br /> <br /> Now we all know that if this film is based on the Columbine massacre And the ending is no different from other movies about attacking them and killing their fellow students at the end. <br /> <br /> I have seen many movies about this attack and the film. By this Far is the most favorite and respected. It makes viewers and insiders look at the lives of these two teenagers who hate life and in good faith. I never knew the intensity of the shooting until my English class was assigned to write an essay or story at a given time in our time. I know everyone will choose Twin Towers. But I want to be different, because of course, the Twin Tower is tragic and very determined. But I don't think it is the right choice for me because there is no way to really relate to that because I am only in grade 3 and I don't know what it all means. But shooting and effects I remember the interview, the view of the school and the pain and fear in the eyes of thousands of people. <br /> <br /> This film is interesting to the ground and is a terrible masterpiece. And i will Recommend to everyone
