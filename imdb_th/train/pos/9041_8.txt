This is the story of a teenager named Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal), who grew up in a coal town in West Virginia, where the normal fate of the boy is "Ending at the mine", but Homer stared at the sky and the love for the rocket that flew for fear of his father, the chief of the miners, and the general shock of the city Indeed, he and his three equally evicted friends started making rockets, which they flew from the arid land, eight miles from outside the city, so as not to scare the community anymore. Unfortunately, most cities and especially Homer's father (Chris Cooper) thinks they are wasting time However, people were intrigued and began to come out as a group to see 'Rocketboys' sending out homemade missiles. Only one teacher (Laura Dern) in a high school that understands their efforts and makes them realize that they can participate in the National Science Fair with a scholarship from the college as a reward. Now the gang must learn to make their vehicles perfect and overcome the problems they face when they shoot for the stars. Director Joe Johnston has always been famous in his films such as Jumanji and Jurassic Park 3 and "October Sky" stands above his other movies. Without a doubt, "October Sky" is his best effort and is clearly his best movie. But even though it is a movie But it has everything needed for a high-end movie theater And with Johnston's extraordinary special direction, there are some special performances. Jake Gyllenhaal, about 19 years old, when the film was released and he gave a beautiful and natural performance He is the perfect actor. Chris Cooper, as his father, also gives very good performance. Like Laura Dern and she looks beautiful too. Even the remaining performances were very good.
