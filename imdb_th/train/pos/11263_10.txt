This is a great performance! I have a professor teaching US history in a high school like this. There are many "facts" in history that are not true and Mr Wuhl points them to see them well in an unforgettable way. <br /> <br / > Mr Wuhl teaches students in film classes But as a student of history and Even the general public will appreciate the clever ways in which he exposes the well-known mistakes in the history of the world and tries to impress the students' brains. Using live actors to perform "skits" is also fun. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this set to anyone interested in having a history that they learn when children turn upside down.
