Jerome Crabbe has a leading role in this film. I watched this movie 6 times, but I still don't get bored. This film is similar to Flesh + Blood. In some cases, Gerald Soetman is a great writer. He wrote all the Dutch films of Paul Verhoeven. Paul Verhoeven is one of the greatest directors. I watched all his movies except Showgirls. My mother didn't like him very much. But i disagree I think all of his stuff is a must-see, especially Total Recall and Basic Instinct. Jerry Goldsmith made some of his films, including Total Recall, Basic Instinct and Hollow Man. I hope Jerry Goldsmith won't die. Different But still fun
