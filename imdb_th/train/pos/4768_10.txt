I love it so much and it is broken up until there is no more season !!! I hope they will! It's the best show of all time !!!!!! There may not be a chance that they will decide to cancel the show there! Haha, I hope to have! I will be very excited !! I will really! I miss it! And is especially vulnerable to not knowing what happened to Jason !! I think they should do it again .... I also think it's stupid that you have to write ten lines to comment .. It makes your comments drag on .. and nobody reads I want to know what will happen between Jason and Nicole ... maybe they will spin !!
