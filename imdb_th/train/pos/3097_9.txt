This performance is excellent. It's complicated and well written and every character is cute. Even Jonathan Cake, a passionate boyfriend, is also a favorite. Because our waves are full of shit, such as American Idol and Dancing with the Stars. It's always interesting to see how each character is connected to the situation. It's really annoying that we finally have a list that makes you think a bit and is thrown out because of some mysterious numbers that most of us don't care about Some of us are not sheep. This show will not be missed by many people, but by cute fans.
