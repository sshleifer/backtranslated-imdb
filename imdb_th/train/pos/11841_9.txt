This is a great movie that has a good story, my children (10, 7, 5 and 4). Everyone loves this movie, including myself. The song is also great. Not the horse did not speak But the spirit tells the story instead And if you hear a story from a horse, if the view is fun, <br /> <br /> I think the headline says it all. 4 years old and a 5 year old girl actually touched on this movie and even went into it, they laughed so hard Your spirits with a heartwarming story. Your child will love it. I think you too
