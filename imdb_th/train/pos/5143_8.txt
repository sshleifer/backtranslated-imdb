By cutting the scene quickly of the crazy people in the hospital and editing / overlapping and obscuring the combined narrative, this is a very difficult movie to follow. Obviously, a man (Masue Inoue) received a job as a concierge or janitor at the hospital so he could be near to his detained wife and may help her. But she was clearly crazy, tucked away on the floor while constantly expressing and fearing the misery and confusion written on her face for the rest of the time The filmmakers switched to her view sometimes and we saw her vague images on the side of the baby's sinking pool or caught the drowning child. She suffers with something When the perspective changes or other madman, the filmmaker uses distorted lenses and things to show us what the madman sees and reacts. And this place is full of crazy people, hiding and in one case, dancing day and night like crazy At one point the man tried to take his wife outside. But the night outside the door shocked her and she ran back to her cell. The man gradually went into a nightmare where he was interrupted in an attempt again to steal her away and he killed a lot of doctors and attendees and while the villagers were crazy laughing and applauding. When he woke up, he was relieved and rubbed the floor. Some interesting images of life in Japan, roads, buildings in 1920
