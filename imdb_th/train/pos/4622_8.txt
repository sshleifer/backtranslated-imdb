I have met Seven Seven in Heaven when I was 14 and working at a video store and I like it. I just watched the movie again and realized that it was a lost treasure. This film starred Jennifer Connelly twenty years before she won the Academy Award for Beautiful Mind, while Natalie Becker Byron Thames played her best friend in the world. Jeff Moran This film is less violent, more cute and cute than in the Pretty in Pink version and some great things in the 1980s, which is why it's good. It's honest, not forced like those movies, and parents will enjoy watching this movie with children. <br /> <br /> When Natalie's father leaves home on a business trip, Jeff convinces She said he should move in with the support of Natalie Polly's friend, played by Maddie Corman, so elaborate that she left him. But this movie is not about making children fall into the situation and seeing what they can do. The three leading actors looked very natural and the script was surprisingly honest that the best thing in their performance was a broken heart. These characters are really interested. It's a great movie that shows children who have access to teenagers before teens. <br /> <br />
