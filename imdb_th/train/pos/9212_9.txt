Yesterday I went to the cinema because I was in Mexico. Most of the movies from other countries are part of "cam√°ra alternativa" (alternative camera). But after I watched this movie, I realized that not all foreign movies were Choice Unfortunately, this is a good example. But I must say that I enjoy this movie very much .. Finally I am happy .. This movie is a little hope in this day. And the main lesson for me .. is at the end of the day ... Love is the main force behind us. This is a good option to watch good movies in Spanish ... and I have to talk about good music .. especially the main song of the movie .. Cosas que hacen que la vida valga la pena .... the song Great! !!
