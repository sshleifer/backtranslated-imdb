One of the best drama movies I've ever seen We perform many shows in the church and this is something that can be used as a resource that highlights all the good things that actors can do in their work. I would like to recommend this, especially for those who are interested in acting as "must see". There are many scenes of notes. One of the cemetery scenes when Hamlet meets Yorick (everyone knows about that scene, just by going to elementary school) and his interaction with the skull is very good. The logic used in this scene is huge - I think Shakespeare's will is more than anything else. I'm happy with the scene that Hamlet Horatio and the characters played by Robin Williams talk about the upcoming battle.
