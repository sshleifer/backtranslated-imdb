I have to be honest and say that I bought this movie, not because of the content, but because David Cubitt is in there. I know ... shallow or anything - but come, Mr Cubitt is a great actor who brings it lightly. <br /> <br /> I don't really know what to expect from watching this movie. I will read other chapters on other websites, but I have to say that I was attracted to the world of brothers almost from going to David. Cubitt is Theo and Colm Feore While Ryan had faith as a sibling brother, the film moved their relationship as they began to get to know each other again after the death of the father. In the scene and trying to go out without noticing Ryan, of course he has. <br /> <br /> This film has been well researched and Is an incredibly sad story, movement, elevation and celebration of life in various parts I went out of feeling sad about what Ryan had passed. But with the knowledge that he had received unconditional hope and love by Theo, the brother of a drug addict I agree with other critics who found the scene in which Theo said that he would be a moving father and I would go a little further to say that I expressed my opinion at Ryan when he spoke to Theo as cruelly as a father. Theo simply said, 'You' Theo walked away. But a small exchange of talks speaks of Ryan's poor story that was quickly brought up by a simple counterattack. <br /> <br /> A smartly crafted movie in every matter. show Writing, writing, and others are doing very well. I can't find anything else to say about this movie, except to say it's very difficult to deal with the death of loved ones. But it was done superbly to an endless level Respect for the topic and the flow of love (Without having to feel guilty and insulting) speaks of a story in a world that is more selfish than we live today Well done for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> There are a few movies that make me tears and let me stop thinking about life in general and also glad for everything I have and not sad for things. I can't, but this movie is doing it to an incredible level when considering issues.
