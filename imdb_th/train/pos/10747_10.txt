Gédéon and Jules Naudet wanted to make a documentary about a new firefighter in New York City. What they received was the only film in the World Trade Center on September 11. <br /> <br /> Having worked with James Hanlon's ladder company before, Jules went with the captain to check and repair the gas leak. Where Gédéon is At the fire brigade in the event that something interesting happens A plane flew low over the city of Jules, which distracted him and pointed the camera one second before the plane crashed into one building. <br /> <br /> Jules asked the captain to follow him into the tower. The first thing he saw was two people burning something he refused to shoot. He was at the site for several hours ahead of the shooting reactions of firefighters and others who were there. The Naudet brothers cared so much about not making this film violent, grizzly and full of blood. But the language from firefighters is quite rough, and CBS shows that there are a lot of children that broadcast that didn't check. The Naudet brothers filmed with one-on-one interviews so firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions <br /> <br /> Unlike the similar documentary films, most of the money from the sale of DVDs goes to charities that are related. Want to 9/11 did a very good mood and movement without political propaganda perfectly as the best documentary of sorts to date.
