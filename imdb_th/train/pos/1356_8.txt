I started watching The Apprentice about 4 years ago (maybe 5) and I like it a lot. The first thing that impresses you about it is a refreshing style, which, though similar to many other reality items at its core Donald Trump is excellent as the host and is the main judge of the program as well. The coup in selecting good-looking intellectuals has been selected because the contestants are also appreciated. But the best part of the show is New York City. Mark Burnett may waste a lot of time in his time. But the management of his film is great because he makes NYC look like a character himself. Jazz music combined with great camera work makes New York look impressive. <br /> <br /> Apprentice will make my top 3 reality shows all the time (The Amazing Race is no. 1) but like the competition. Amazing. This list is most often watched. If you continue to watch it for a while, the initiative of the show will deteriorate quickly. (Like TAR). Star World, the broadcaster in this country, does not work well in presenting programs. The first three seasons are shown in a row. After 2 years, there will be two performances for the next season, which gives a fresh new concept. <br /> <br /> In summary, you will love this show, especially in the first 2 seasons. Constantly watching the program after that, its charm will deteriorate and quickly.
