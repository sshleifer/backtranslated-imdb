Yes ... I will go with 1-0 and this is the cause. In the past few years, I have watched a few comedy movies and left only a few laughter and a few video rentals because the film was easy to forget. Then I stumbled upon "nothing". Interesting. I didn't expect much. I was wrong. This is probably one of the most fun movies I've ever had the opportunity to watch. Dave and Andrew create a great comedy duo and humor is enough to remember. But not too complicated to be a joke that is missing I don't want to talk about the real scene because I feel this is a worthwhile movie to see once. With more and more pointless concepts that come into the movie (You know, like a killer soldier item and "live" remakes that destroy old classics), this movie will make you happy to say that
