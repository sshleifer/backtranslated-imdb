Good pictures are worth every word This film has the most poetic scene ever dreamed about people with Down syndrome. And I will not destroy it by telling you You will want to see it yourself. <br /> <br /> Pasqual Duquenne is an amazing actor. I don't need to understand the one word he speaks to understand his meaning. <br /> <br /> This film has its own magic. After watching, I understand that we value too much success and not enough for the people we love. Love and simplicity are what we need.
