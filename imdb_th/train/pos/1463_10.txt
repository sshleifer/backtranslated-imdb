Mardi Gras: Made in China provides an excellent and complex connection between popular culture, nudity and globalization through the production and making of beads. I saw this film at the Boston International Film Festival and is expected to launch into the globalization era. But what I received was showing impressive images of shocking videos from both China and the United States. Films that are eye-opening, have a deep sense of humor, not serious sponsors and make you want more credit roles. It's worth it compared to Murderball - it's very good. Young women workers in China have various perspectives and owners are open about discipline. The passionate carnival is highlighted. But because this great film provides an in-depth context within the factory in China without subtitles Cheers to the filmmakers to go inside and decorate the film! I never thought of the connection between Chinese beads and New Orleans. Now I think of the human connection between almost every object. But also the role of globalization, inequality and fun More importantly, I can connect these without feeling guilty after watching this movie, unlike other movies about the globalization I've seen.
