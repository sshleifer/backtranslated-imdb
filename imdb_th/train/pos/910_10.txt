It's a good thing to see Suraj Barjatya coming back to the best things about weaving around the wedding. It feels good to have a movie that doesn't have the only scene you can avoid watching with your family. Although the story is easy and there are no new elements, but you still like this movie because of the presentation of the actual show and treatment. Hats Off to Suraj .. A movie about the fact that participation leads to love The description of the change in the way of thinking behavior when you participate is great. The director has given the idea and the actor has done it perfectly. Of course, this movie is slow. You don't mind because you are involved in the story that you want to see the happiness of this movie. In general, there are many sentimental scenes that tend to make the audience shed tears. (Especially women) but when you come out of the cinema, you are satisfied and feel that the ticket is worth it :-)
