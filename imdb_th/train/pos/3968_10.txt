I saw this movie for the first time when I was a kid and just bought it on DVD. <br /> <br /> James Stewart brought his depth to the role of Chip Hardesty, a FBI spy who worked hard and dedicated. His life in the office was interrupted by his family life, not all roses. His wife (a wonderful painting of Vera Miles) lives with fear of the dangerous nature of his work and them. Was separated for a while Chip's best friend and friend representative Sam Crandall (Murray Hamilton) was killed in a gunfight; Chip's son Mike enlists in the Marines during World War II. The family proceeded with courage and dignity. <br /> <br /> The action scenes are quite exciting and the semi-documentary movies of this film work efficiently and Max Steiner's songs tell everything. Honesty, courage and honesty. <br /> <br /> This country is a great debt to the men and women of the FBI and yes to J Edgar Hoover as well. If Mr Hoover's observations happen, we may be exempt from 9/11. Crimes against children and politicians with many prejudices that we have to endure since he passed.
