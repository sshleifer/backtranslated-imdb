Yes, simple movie templates But inspiring In the end, when all the crowds in the stadium got up and people raised their hands, I felt cool whenever I saw it. That is great Joseph is a lonely and sad child who has been disappointed by everyone and everything in his life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in magic and the angels are funny and cheerful. Very good family movie - I agree - the end is quite happy. But hey, it's not really important that this movie still maintains the basic qualities of good performances and inspiring themes.
