The Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack teams produced 50,000 documentaries from Bakhtiari and their animals during the summer to graze in the winter. The basic value of this movie today is the time capsule of "The forgotten person" and the way they live in the West "Twenty roars" can't imagine the more serious difference. The glowing river and the crossing of the mountain with bare feet is like a merciless truth and the animals that disappear under the surface are dead. In order to make sure that the audience at that time believed that the story had happened, a certificate of authenticity was signed at the end. The version I saw has amazing Iranian songs that can stand alone and admire without movies. Having said that, all this movie may be more valuable than anthropologists than the general audience to find good evening entertainment. The crew had enough stock to shoot the pictures they recorded and there was no fancy camera work caused by repeated shots. The name between the West deviates from the experience. But in reality it is part of the record because they show how Hollywood tries to make the life of indigenous people. Off-duty entertainment by the desert police became "The Balls of the Police", the producers conducted the commercialization of Docu (1927) and King Kong completely commercial (1933). The moving theme will be used again in People of the Wind (1976) and in Himalaya (1999). Those who know in advance what they are doing - highly recommended for them.
