I personally watched this to see the images of the 60s and 70s. It is interesting to learn how drug movements started and became a pop culture and a power that did not give up. the best Interviews of classic rock stars are shaking and have humor. You feel like being in secret and nodding at the same time ... because it feels good and familiar. I like it all from the 60s to the present. I recommend this for all aspects, including music, rock, Hipper's movement, good politics and history. I marked the box that this has spoilers just because I don't know if some people might consider spoilers or not in this regard because I talk about things that are on all 4 segments and therefore need security.
