I enjoyed watching Brigham Young and found that it was a positive and true image of the LDS faith. I think this great adventure trip would be useful because many people today are unfamiliar. With the trials and persecution of the early Mormon Church It's an incredible story of a strong and devoted person. <br /> <br /> As a member of the church, the most annoying view of this movie. (Most of the most historical inaccuracies do not bother me a lot) is Brigham Young's depiction as a member of "knowingly deceived" Church members to believe that he was called to be a successor Of Joseph as a prophet Although I understand the amazing reason for this plot line But impressed his doubts about this as a historical truth, when in reality both Brigham and many church members understood and believed that the Church of Brigham was not Deceiving the saints knowingly Rather, he brought them confidently with inspiration This issue is important for Mormons because it is important in our beliefs: The Lord spoke to prophets today and Brigham Young, like Joseph Smith, was a inspired prophet. God, <br /> <br /> Or don't you believe this word or not, just knowing that this film doesn't show precisely what Brigham believes?
