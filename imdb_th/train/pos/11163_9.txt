I like this Freekin movie! Walsh is a true teacher of the film style. Sometimes his films are overlooked. But this movie is my favorite because it feels the time when this movie was created. <br /> <br /> Every great character that exists, lifestyle, dress mode , How they say okay, they may exaggerate But it is good to know that there are times when two men try to overcome each other with crazy stunts. <br /> <br /> I just feel that it's part of history that should be. Many people admire and appreciate because of that fact. <br /> <br /> Can I put it on the DVD? I just saw it on tv But for everyone who wants a movie, life about that time is the perfect movie.
