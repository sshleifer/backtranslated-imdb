There is no revolution here; Unable and elegant cinemas <br /> <br /> The VUE Garden is almost confined to a boring and mostly police station in one question room, but director Claude Miller (the filmmaker Other wonderful things) intercalates the empty glimpse of the outside tableaux into a simple place scene. Miller's restraint, especially in the early days, was a remarkable story and his excellent background management made the audience feel impressed. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura is great. Usual On that paper, it was a boredom, a detective who killed himself bored around the world. Ventura lives in a completely convincing role, although the script allows us to access only a small amount of his internal work. The movie ends in a moment when he seems to have been forced to face his failure for the first time. <br /> <br /> Michel Serrault is equal to the job as a murderer who suspects a flic-hearted gangster. The exchange between the two is often more pregnant with the tension and the radius of the playing field that is constantly changing to fight wit. Serrault's character is a reversal of arrogance. Witty Then later .... <br /> <br /> GARDE A VUE's "message" If someone is searching, one is the punishment of the police method and the type of pressure that makes the police very eager to If necessary, close the case with the cost of justice. For most of its length, though, this film will shine as if there is nothing more than an example of changing a situation that is not as expected to become a suspicious drama of the highest movie economy. br /> <br />
