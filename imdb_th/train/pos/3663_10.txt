Perhaps the latest movie that you expected to come from Vittorio de Sica and Cesare Zavattini (the novelist whose film is based) is a fantasy of a neurologist. An old woman found a baby in her cabbage and raised him as her own son. After a few years, the baby is a young boy (named Toto) and the adoptive mother is dying. He went to the orphanage and eventually when he was 18 years old he left. Suddenly he found that he had no home. Although Toto is optimistic and will not let anything disappoint him. A man stole his bag and instead of being angry with him, Toto became his friend and went to live with him in a small hut. Toto initiated and managed to live in a homeless area and they built a better cottage. Soon the landowner tried to sell this land and the people in the slum had to protect themselves. After trying many times, the owner was a police force to get rid of the homeless. At this point, this movie became a full-fledged fantasy. (Previously it was a funny / wonderful melodrama in the style of Charlie Chaplin.) This thing is strange and shocking, so others see themselves best. It's quite amazing and funny. There is an absolute objection that you can raise the level of miracles in Milan. Fellini and Visconti are highly criticized when they start to stray from Neorealism. I think I read this, being widely criticized at the time of the launch At this point, though it is very fun - I love it very much. It may be a favorite in the movie of Vittorio de Sica, although Umberto D and The Bicycle Thieves are very close. 10/10
