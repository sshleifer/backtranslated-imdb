I will not go as far as not suggesting this movie because the only problem I have with it is due to the exposure of the planning equipment used in movies - things that are common in every child movie. That doesn't make it bad. But not what I would go far. <br /> <br /> It's a little saccharine, so I can say that for everyone who is looking for something more intelligent. Will be disappointed in this movie for children. <br /> <br /> However, the whole thing went out of the window when that squirrel (One of all examples) appears on the screen. His time is limited, but it seems that decision makers have the intelligence to tell them that 'Hey, can you stick to the squirrel a little more?' Every time it's too dull. That didn't record movies But you can let it say 'At least there is one aspect that I can't stop laughing. <br /> <br /> And of course it won't disappoint. Almost given to Pixar's flicks From all that I have, I'll put it on the bottom ... but that's not bad.
