I think James Cameron might become my favorite director because this is my second review of his movie. However, everyone remembers the RMS Titanic. It's big, fast, and "unsinkable" ... until April 1912. It was one of the biggest tragedies. Well, James Cameron decided to create a movie from it. But two stars, characters, characters that will be in the spotlight instead of the ship But let me remind you that this is an opinion and no facts and the only thing that will be presented is an event from the film. <br /> <br /> So our two main characters are Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose ( Kate Winslet) They are not very annoying. But watching this, you will find why they are annoying (http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn) The main villain that I think is, unfortunately, the fate of God's hand. (No disrespectful intent) or just Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane). Common, including all of the above and what you will get! Oh yes! We received a love story on a sinking ship. The supporting characters are as follows: Andrew, my personal favorite. (Victor Garber) (He is very cute), Lovejoy (David Warner), Murdoch, Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) and many more. Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) They add something to the story. Good things. The action here is excellent, especially in the second half of this drama as well. In the end, you can have your eyes fall, rain storms or quiet tears. The story is simple and works well. Treasure hunters seek the heart of the ocean and find the paintings of women wearing such diamonds instead. She called and told her story about RMS Titanic, two lovers separated from the social class and finally the fate of the ship. Everything about the story works and there are very few flaws. I gave the Titanic a great 86%
