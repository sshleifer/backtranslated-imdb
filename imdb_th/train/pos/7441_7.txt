Personally, I insulted The Jerry Springer Show, but I found that "Ringmaster" is the most fun movie I have seen this year. Jerry Springer's endless words, "guests" that start in the opening scene will make you laugh all the time. Despite the short scenes that Jerry Springer tried hard to prove his identity, I would recommend this movie for full enjoyment.
