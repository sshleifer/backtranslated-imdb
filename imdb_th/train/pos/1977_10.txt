I really love this movie I remember once when I was in grade 2. My teacher showed us with a 16mm movie reel. However, this film might scare the students in 2nd grade, such as the scene in which Bill killed Nancy and saw the face of Fagin is the first time on the screen. One of my relatives was sick from watching this movie because she studied this story in a music class. If I was a teacher and able to rate people who created this great movie, I would give A +
