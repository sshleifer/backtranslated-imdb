While the 'special effects' and technical features of this movie may make others laugh But I could never remove the image that this movie inscribed in the minds of children and impressive when I first saw it at about 8 years old. The story of this woman's survival and the trials she had to endure with me Over the years and I think back more than once about the way women make it out of situations far beyond what I have seen. <br /> <br /> The truth that That this is true and the fact that I am a child when I first saw this may be the reason behind the high ratings of this film. Every time this movie is aired on television in the 70s and 80s, I will be pinned on television and drink in each scene with interest. I can't explain it. I think this look is the first time as an adult. (And with a boring view of the world) some people may not enjoy I went out of my way to receive a copy, so I was able to show this movie to my son. <br /> <br /> This thing, like many other movies, is not for everyone. If you are impressed with the remarkable survival story of humans as part of Peru / Machu Picchu and / or Amazon, I believe you may enjoy this movie as much as I enjoy it. For the past 30 years
