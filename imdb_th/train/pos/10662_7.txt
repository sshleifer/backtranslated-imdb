Leonard Maltin has to watch some other movies. (Although I found his guide to be a very valuable resource, please ignore his opinions about this matter). He said, "Start well, then break." When it really reverses - the story is about. As easy as receiving Happy Mom, Happy Dad and Happy Son taking a trip to the secluded beach, Father Dad, incompetent. In the accident, Mom ran out to ask for help, found a prisoner who escaped danger. The mother tried to deceive the prisoners to help while the father waited and hung for the beloved life. <br /> <br /> A good white knuckle receives an electric shock. Ralph Meeker appears immediately. (Superintendent John Sturges, a movie in a clever way to make you gape), halfway through as criminals with wit and despair. Meeker is an idiot and unusual actor. (At least here and in the classic movie "Kiss Me Deadly") and he grabs the key to the film's storytelling happily. His character has a smiling character and says When he was particularly pleased with his misconduct There was a funny action break when they received a flat tire and he ordered his hostage Barbara Stanwyck firmly. "Don't go away." She shot back. "Where am I going?" (They are in the middle of nowhere) and he realizes "Yes, right." The friction between them is the horn. <br /> < br /> There was a flaw. There was a scene in which the police, who had been chased after Meeker for a while, stopped Stanwyck's car and avoided detection. Meeker placed his head on her shoulder like a loving husband and pretended to sleep when She was questioned. A. He didn't look. Man clearly in this position and B. I think it's safe to say that adults who seem to be sleeping during a confrontation with law enforcement will certainly raise suspicions. <br /> <br /> Still strong, thrillers. Morale that creates an exciting and edited conclusion. <br /> <br />
