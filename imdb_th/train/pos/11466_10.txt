I was lucky to see Zero Day last night. It was an amazing movie. <br /> <br /> One day, Zero Day can be compared to "The Blair Witch Project". It is complete with a mobile video camera. It's about 2 children, just your average child. Andre and Calvin They started an anti-high school campaign called "Army 2". <br /> <br /> The whole story will be told in a video diary form from two children. It shows that there is a relationship with the parents there. Other people show that this is just a normal child, like those we know or who have been hit. We found that the last mission of The Army of 2 will be entitled Zero Zero. They plan to shoot there in high school. <br /> <br /> How do you see that they have access to the gun? They plan it. How everything They emphasize that the media does not affect them at all and there is no reason to do this. As I said, this is all told in the form of a Video Diary. They then store the tape in the safe box to see after Zero Day. <br /> <br /> The real shot will be shown through the Survillence camera throughout the school. Absolutely cold This movie is very cold. Some things that they say, how they plan, you have to see by yourself. One word I remember was the only time Calvin was alone. He said, "Andre thought that he was about to leave the car, fleeing to do in many schools around the country. I don't know what he thought. But the only way I came out of school was a black plastic bag. "<br /> <br /> I'm not even giving you the right idea for this movie. You really have to see yourself. It will be held during the festival <br /> <br /> A +
