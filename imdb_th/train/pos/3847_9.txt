At that time, this movie had arguments that were written all over. (Like most of Verhoeven's projects) <br /> <br /> There are pictures showing the scene of death. Parachute that doesn't open * Pat * They are on the floor. The one who was bitten by the lion's neck And men who were speedboats * zoomed in * blood stained bodies <br /> <br /> but apart from blood, this flick also had beautiful scenes (And stunningly beautiful) filmed in the town of the gray fishermen, Vlissingen; <br /> <br /> Thousands of roses fly through the screen in areas not related to beautiful young women movies (Holy) Place the flowers in canned milk, surrounded by a bloody sheet and The steamy love scene between the two male characters in the tomb <br /> <br /> The story is concluded with excitement but takes 10 minutes that doesn't disappoint and will make you sigh with relief. br>> <br /> Of course, professionals have some disadvantages, too many special effects, and obviously Verhoeven can push Gore-factors (like many hanging eyes) from their sockets). While the two leading actors (Jero en Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk) worked exceptionally well to breathe life for their characters. Herman's character (played by Thom Hoffman, who is quite charming) makes him feel difficult. To take care of even after his tragic death. <br /> <br /> I try my best to give you a little idea of ​​what to expect from this amazing movie and as you see it. It's not easily summarized in words. If you happen to find this movie somewhere, look! And enjoy the unique style and story of this masterpiece
