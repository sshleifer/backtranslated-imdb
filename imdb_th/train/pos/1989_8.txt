I agree that I don't like Oliver! As a small child - it's long and the story is quite slow due to all musical numbers. As a teenager, I discovered that the fun of this movie is my own experience. Instead of thinking that it's a modification of Oliver Twist, think of it as a classic celebration. The adjustment is the most loose. But actually, if you watch the drama, you don't have a story. <br /> <br /> Music is the core of this movie and the most overwhelming. Is the protagonist and very catchy Most or all actors participate in the stage and it shows in their performances - and I think this is an advantage. All the performances are in the form of "stage" of the show, typical of older movies, and they are fun. The exception is the boy who plays Oliver, which looks like the job looks cute and away from the real actor. <br /> <br /> Fagen and Dodgers are the true stars of this movie. Oliver Reed also performed a great role in keeping the screen awesome. While Bill Sykes threatened, even Sykes' embarrassing bulls did a good job. <br /> <br /> Movies This story is not suitable for everyone. People who hate musicals are insulting as well as those who perform the musical too seriously. Entering false historical details or performing a stage that is beyond the guilt of bad performances will destroy everyone's fun. Just sit down and enjoy the entertainment - it's much better if you remember that as a musical, it's a fantasy that is loosely organized around the book, not a strict modification.
