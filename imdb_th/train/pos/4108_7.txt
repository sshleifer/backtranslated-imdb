Kurosawa is a fresh color, not seeing the main topic of truth and the perception of the truth and the options for feeling depressed in Tokyo's ghetto. Kurosawa has a style that is different from what I think in the opposite way - To say that I feel like Kurosawa wants to create an Ozu image. This movie is a bad nonsense and feels bad in the great work while Ikiru, while mundane and depressed Interestingly, and as well as stray dogs and pictures slums and poverty in Japan without being heavy or too boring Desu ka den has an unusual one. Content that has no redemption feature of Kurosawa's previous pictures. <br /> <br /> Be warned. This is not a movie that Kurosawa should be judged.
