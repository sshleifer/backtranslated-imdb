I just saw this movie. The opening night was very good !! I'm a big fan of sports movies and this is one of my favorites. Dennis Quaid is great. (Oh, by Mr Muudal, if you read this ... My sister lives in Austin, where you live ..... and she should buy you a drink again ... well .. . She quite stood up ... but she didn't intend!: C) [Not everyone believes ...]) However, it's a great movie. Everyone who likes good sports movies should go out and see! : C)
