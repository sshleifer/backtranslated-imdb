Remember that any movie that has the truth, whether it is creating cynicism and negativity from those who receive advice and or find the truth, has no meaning. Masters of film psychology and spiritual commanders will no doubt doubt that this movie is monotonous and you know everything you need to know. <br /> <br /> For us in my minority, I found That "The Perverts Guide To Cinmea" .... Most excellent and worthwhile to watch for those interested in modern psychology and philosophy movies. <br /> <br /> Slightly like Scott Mclouds' cartoon insight. Directed Sophie Fiennes, a philosopher Slovenian psychologist and social critic Slavoj Zizek in many films and scenes he talks about The cover is a picture from "The Birds" (Zizek takes the boat out to create a new image). <br /> <br /> Lacanian's mental analysis doesn't have to scream the evening of great fun ... but It is! If you like movies, that is .... Having knowledge of Lacanian's mental analysis helps (Symbolic, Real, and Imagery) are words that are slightly thrown at first, but the scenes that Zizek chooses and analyzes make Remarkably clear What is my abstraction? In fact, it would be better to get acquainted with the movies he debated, rather than the terminology used, which will be clearer when the film proceeds. <br /> <br /> Why don't I love this movie because it Choose a great movie to analyze or reveal the great truth about Lacan, but shown in a useful and intelligent manner, where movies and psychology (And according to the initial philosophy) converge. <br /> <br /> Why is "The Sound Of Music" quite fascist, why "Short Cuts" is more than just the level and alienation, why do birds attack in "The Birds"? To learn about the mind from "The Resurrection of the Aliens" What is the planet of "Solaris"? "Psycho" and "The Marx Brothers" are related to each other and what is David Lynch having to face in the movie after the movie ... Zizek is Some thoughts <br /> <br /> The role of the voices in "The Excorcist" and "Star Wars: Revenge Of The Sith" may be the strongest and clearest movie during his time in female sexual relations. I began to suspect that at one point, Zizek accepted his feelings that the flower was the decoration of the dentatta vagina that they were disgusting and should be hidden from the children (funny, looks like ...) <br /> <br /> Anyway, it is an interesting documentary that anyone who has watched a movie and thinks it means something more than truly stated should try to see <br /> <br /> and whoever Interested in Slavoj Zizek. This is what Must have at least as well. "The Truth of Virtual Reality" and even more than "Zizek!" Directly two other fake-docs about "Elvis's contemporary cultural criticism" as he was In the world of English speaking, <br /> <br /> "The Perverts Guide To Cinema" is not about the role of sex in the cinema. Zizek claims that cinema is the most distorted art because it teaches. "The way of desire and not desire" and is the only form of contemporary art that can allow these desires to be clear. This is not a movie about finding reality in the cinema. But about finding a cinema in reality and the importance and excitement that can be Rare and long But it is worth the problem in the movie that "motivates" the most to see the experience I had
