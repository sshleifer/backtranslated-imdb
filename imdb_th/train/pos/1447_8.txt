I read negative comments before watching this movie and undeterred, go ahead and start watching. I agree that I have to go back a few times because this movie is incredibly complicated, relevant and full of details. That's a good thing But it is quite unexpected in the culture of car chase, irrational sex explosion and general violence that is used instead of character planning and development. In fact, what a welcome departure But I'm so familiar with not paying much attention to what I see. <br /> <br /> This film is full of character development and plot lines; The way we used to analyze when I was in high school It requires real mental involvement in the audience. It's a good change. I will compare it to 'All The President's Men' in terms of general content. That is, it is a mystery about the serious misconduct of the elected officials and those who have enough influence to the authorities. <br /> <br /> Unlike the 'All The President's Men', this film takes an effort to create a true personality of a few characters. In this sense, the film is a study of characters such as 'The Negotiatior' with Samuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey. In that film, their characters are both city employees and the plot is very concentrated. However, the plot depends on the ability of their characters to collaborate, trust each other, and eventually gather together with the corrupt police department. There is more shooting in this movie and the specific plot is different. But in general there are many similarities. <br /> <br /> I will say that the pavilion needs more concentration than ever. In fact, I felt that it was a past and present political scandal, a political scandal that I had seen in my life back to Watergate. People know that there is absolutely nothing wrong! But tracking details is difficult This movie is not close to the real life complex. But actually it is true for life in complexity I think that is one of the reasons that previous posters have criticized this film: Unrealistic expectations. <br /> <br /> If someone watched this thing knowing that they were going See what I see 3 times in a row! The performance was excellent and the director was impeccable. The weakest point is John Cusak's accent.
