First of all, I don't know what will happen when I start the video. <br /> <br /> Every time someone brings a genre of cult movies and adjusts to the present This movie just started on the right path. It is part of a familiar land. But can control it as well. Crockzilla Every scene? That must be seen and just try to keep the face straight This film brings old-fashioned movies that are fun to blend with modern production. It is good to see some people are fulfilling their needs in this market. Well done. <br /> <br />
