Ben Thomas (Smith) plays the IRS agent who makes the shop surprised everyone. What kind of IRS agent is this? <br /> <br /> Most of us have heard every IRS representative. "Hello, I'm from the IRS. I'm here to help." Then our smile spread. Laughing at saying, "Yes." <br /> <br /> When you move forward and further in this matter, he goes easy with those who are examined. What is his motivation? He comes from another planet, a rich angel who wants to do good things? He helped so much that we needed him to be our examiner. If we were to be sure, hey, IRS, are you listening? (Just joking) <br /> The movie's pace is perfect, and more than that, the clues that are ignored will tell me what happened. Repeat intensely, focus on Ben and stay there. The whole movie can only be used because Ben, while we try to find him and I don't see any clues (Willis, what you say about the clue), not reading the box before watching DVD movies is a better way to Go here At the end of this movie, I gathered it together. Now it's clear. And yes it is on top But still a great story, mostly because Will Smith <br /> <br /> Will Smith should be nominated for the Best Actor Award The rest of the actors are also very good. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's on top, and despite the great performances, and when you get all the answers, you have to realize that the movie's message is totally wrong What is the message Believe me, you won't need too many clues to figure out. I can't. <br /> <br /> Violence: No Sex: Yes, but nothing to be excited. Gentle. Nude: No. Language: No.
