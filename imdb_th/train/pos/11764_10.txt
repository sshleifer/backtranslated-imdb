Saw this thing in the cinema in the year 86 and fell out of my chair, laughing more than once <br /> <br /> How do you know it will end? It's a good time to travel. The practice scene is very fun. But the best scene may be the scene where Jack and Reno try to watch the Falcons v. Vikings Monday Night Football game while trying to make a makeup dinner with his wife <br /> <br /> Williams and Russ Zell seems to be very happy with this, and it's terrible that it is seen as a top comedy.
