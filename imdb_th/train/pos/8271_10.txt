One of the biggest hits of the year 1926. Brown of Harvard is an exciting comedian / drama actor who has a boat race scene and a football scene that makes William Haines his role. want It was Haines' patent all the way: a clever aleck that didn't do anything serious until he was rejected by everyone and got up and became a man / hero and won the girl. No one works this formula like Haines. Great cartoonist (Little Annie Rooney and Mary Pickford, Show People with Marion Davies), Haines can swing from comedy to tragedy with changes in facial expressions. He was very happy in this film while he was in Tell It to the Marines (with Lon Chaney) and West Point (with Joan Crawford) where he repeated the formula. Mary Bryan is as good as a girl. Jack Pickford is a good person like a comfortable roommate. Ralph Bushman is a rival Edward Connelly, Mary Alden, David Torrence, Guinn Williams and Grady Sutton. Exhibitor This film has been recorded now due to the homoerotic relationship between Haines and Pickford and for the release of John Wayne's film as a Yale footballer. (But I never saw him) Haines was the fifth box-office star to start with this picture until 1932. It was a shame that he had been forgotten and most of his movies were gone. He is one of the most attractive and talented actors of his generation.
