Highly recommended! <br /> <br /> A well-written comedy movie that will attract everyone there with humor! Let it be a good thing to see British independent movies rather than own it compared to a large studio !! Add value to the movie collection for sure. There is a scene in this movie that I'm sure many people can relate to. You will laugh out loud in comedy shows and enjoy great music. I like the version of Jimmy, the Vietnamese cliff of Orb and The Tower of London used for Freebird. <br /> <br /> Let's go ............ You won't be disappointed.
