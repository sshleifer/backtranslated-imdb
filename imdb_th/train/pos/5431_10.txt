I've watched this movie many times and every time I watched, I couldn't help. Gunga Din is one of the classic movies created in Hollywoods Golden Years. When the actors have to pull the audience into the movie without having to use special techniques and create humanity. "Monsters" to show special talent on the screen and comedy shows by Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. are suberb and very fun to watch. The attitude of the tongue and cheeks that all three actors played in their roles, worked perfectly and flawlessly. Some people may think that it is "repetitive" but I think it is the "classic" movie and the best show. Must remember when watching this movie that Europe was involved in the war with Germany and the audience went to the movies to escape from the horrors of war and for entertainment Goodness often overcomes evil. Gunga Din succeeds perfectly by letting the audience laugh and act with actors during their pain. In brief, it is a classic movie that is not serious and does not want the audience to be interested.
