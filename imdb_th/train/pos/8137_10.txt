If you like CB4, you don't know what you're missing if you haven't watched this movie. This movie is a hilarious joke and incorporates a story about the hip hop industry rather than other parody movies ... It's unfortunate that this movie wasn't released on DVD because it was one movie that everyone I used to have look Love and need a copy If you want a really good laugh and you like hip hop and are familiar with some old actors, rent this movie. There are not many video rental locations that have copies. But if you happen to encounter this place, you won't be disappointed.
