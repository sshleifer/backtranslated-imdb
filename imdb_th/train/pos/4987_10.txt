Although I like EE "Doc" Smith's book and David A. Kyles's book, the Lensman, an anime based on a loose book, is quite fun and fair. <br /> <br /> Although the story maybe It seems familiar to Sci-Fi / Fantasy. Like some children on a separate planet inherited a mysterious power and avenging the death of his family, it is quite fun. In addition, Lensman is an animated cartoon The first story that uses hand-drawn and CG animation all at once. Of course, it may seem obsolete now. But it is still an innovation If not for the Lensman, nothing will happen. (Personally, I think the computer graphics look better in live animations.) <br /> <br /> Very bad. They released it on a few DVD / VCDs that are concerned. (Most of them are in a fairly foreign and different format) I just hope they will launch the Lensman's TV and movies on DVD / VCD in every part of the world. Not just some parts. <br /> < br /> PS The rules are getting worse! I just think he looks amazing and very neat as well.
