I never met a single person (From hundreds of people) who hate this movie Bet on whoever voted as a sabotage or victim. This movie has everything. Ask yourself, "Are you a fan of ... or not?" Then watch "Laputa". <br /> <br /> It's not my favorite movie but my favorite IS directed. By the same person (Hayao Miyazaki), no matter in this case, ranked first in my top five And I've seen many movies
