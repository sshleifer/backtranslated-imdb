This is the most confrontational documentary I've ever seen. It is a simple and breathtaking view of the beautiful ideas Edward Burtynsky, from photos of hidden industrial landscapes that are centered on China's modern industrial growth, makes us face the problems we choose to easily ignore. <br /> <br /> This film is not neutral. The animation of the fact that our western society chooses not to educate us about - byproducts of economic growth, external effects paid by citizens of communities that are less developed than the source of comfort. Ours /> <br /> Amazingly broken, can't be ignored. This is a challenging journey. But worth taking - please stop folly and at least see the photos of these truths without feeling any pressure to stand up to these problems. 10/10, of course!
