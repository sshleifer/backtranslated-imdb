Remember H.G. Wells' "The Invisible Man"? This is another movie that I like most. "Hollow Man" is unique in the story of being invisible as a weapon of choice. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Ken, a genius scientist who goes out into the invisible world and makes it useful for military purposes. At first, making serum is an easy part that makes people unable to return. Most of the first attempts ended uncertainly. Until one night when he made the formula perfect and anyone else, but Ken would be a lab rat The gorilla was first and almost died, so when he arrived it was close. So when Ken made it, he decided to use it for fun. Then, when he was tired of not being able to see the team, he tried his best to bring him back to the world of flesh. However, the visual formula is not as effective as it should be, and Ken will delve into the madness. So he became an insane killer. It will be best to leave the city instead of living the lives of people near you. I will be less interested in those who do wrong. Great movies, lots of fun, 3 out of 5 stars!
