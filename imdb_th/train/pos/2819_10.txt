This movie is fun! And I love it! "Dragon King" (Jacky Chan) and his friends "Cowboy" make this movie fun, meaningful and completely ridiculous. This movie is a rare combination of good and evil fighting and the wonders and fun that is growing. Long Shao Ye takes viewers through the daily activities of the little dragon. (This name is because he is the son of a wealthy family) and "cowboy", which includes the use of clever and delicate methods to escape education. (With the help of All households, including instructors) compete in a style that is quite interesting (and interesting) to get love from local girls, competing in "football" (you'll see what I mean) and lists Anyway, they found themselves in the midst of fighting to protect the precious antiques and lives of many people. <br /> <br /> Movies have a serious time. But they do not pressure But inspired The fun of children does not disappear from the exchange, but is actually used to resist evil. What I like very much about this movie is how it ended. Not a general confrontation (Which in itself is excellent) but you will see Let me say that it captures the spirit of the movie. <br /> <br /> Stupidly, witty, meaningful and nostalgic. Very good movie.
