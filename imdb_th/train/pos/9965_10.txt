Suitable for families with young children who are looking for lighthearted movies that are not violent and attracted to children and amusing, even though full of vitality. Not a bad movie for a low budget job. Children will be surprised by Santa's workshops and "magic" that help him get into the house through a chimney that is too small or a house without a chimney! <br /> <br /> Children will be excited about Santa's success at Interrupting the disgusting demons named Pitch (Finishing in a classic red dress with horns and tails!) They will sympathize with the poor little girl who desires the most, having a cute little doll and a poor little boy. One who wishes to spend time with parents who are not with him forever And which child does not know anyone in the school that is like a nasty boy who enlisted by Pitch. Help Santa catch and destroy Christmas In the end, everyone, including the nasty boys, received what they deserved on Christmas Day. <br /> <br /> This movie will give both Santa's children and the message of love they give. To people around the world. <br />
