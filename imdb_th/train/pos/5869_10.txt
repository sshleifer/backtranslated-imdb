After watching The Deer Hunter, which is a masterpiece, Jacknife has a large shoe to wear. It has the same theme as The Deer Hunter. A serious impact on people after the Vietnam War. Robert De Niro is in this movie. Deer Hunter and very good here, just like Kathy Baker.but, but this movie is Ed Harris's which provides powerful, emotional and impacted performances. The film is based on the stage and has From one or two scenes It feels clear to me that I just mean that for one or two scenes, it feels like I'm watching a musical. It's not a big deal and really doesn't cut the film. I really like this movie. Not an epic like The Deer Hunter. They are a similar era and have similar themes. But they are two very different movies. I think The Deer Hunter is great and I think this movie is great. In this one that makes it very good for me. Jacknife is 10/10
