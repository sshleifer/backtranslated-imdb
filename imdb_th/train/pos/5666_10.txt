I loved this program when it was broadcast on television and was crushed when it was found that some people decided that it wasn't worth it to continue! For many years I have shown this movie, the program I recorded or tape for someone. That is to date The power that finally decided to release a beautiful series on the DVD and finally I was able to grab my little hand in the complete set. Which brought me to this part The part about this show is about <br /> <br /> American Gothic is about goodness and evil. In general, the fight between Lucas Buck (That is Buck and B) He is the evil sheriff of the small town of South Carolina that operates in the way he wants to run and stop without doing anything. <br /> <br /> I feel. That the program was written and directed miraculously and Many lives that are still alive I really hate when it is canceled. But that's the way I can get when I find something that is worth watching on TV. <br /> <br /> Gary Cole works great in the role of Sheriff Lucas Buck. In the right amount to pull it out Other actors also performed well as well, so I think you can say even the casting acted to my liking.
