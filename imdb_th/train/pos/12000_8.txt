I think this movie is a study However, it failed to treat the problems that caused great controversy: plural marriage. In addition, the film does not reveal how the LDS Church is. A great opportunity to miss to let the world know what they believe. I can't clearly understand what the LDS perspective is in the main topics of religion. <br /> <br /> I have many LDS friends and are good people. It would be good to see a clear picture of how they looked at the more controversial messages of the prophets. Perhaps these messages may be too conflicting to be treated in the form of movies. But it would be good to hear all the stories about Joseph Smith's interesting life. Finally, it gives an in-depth comment on the religious ideas of Americans in the 18th century. Hopefully they will make a documentary about This interesting story is for historians to comment on Smith's life. We may have a Mormon president someday. In the end, Smith ran to the president.
