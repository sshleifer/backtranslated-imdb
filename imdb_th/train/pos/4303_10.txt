This is a great movie with a leading actor and a great actor. I never bored to watch it. I like the scenes where Danny Glover's characters and Kevin Kline's characters are Simon and Mack together. Kevin Kline is natural and looks like his attitude is simple and you have to face often <br /> <br /> One of the most powerful scenes in the movie is the beginning of the movie when Simon arrives at the scene where Mack's car is broken. A strong message and not like a stereotypical message that has a movie in which a person preaches his courage in front of an audience. Instead of showing the emotions and circumstances of the actors instead of inappropriate messages that do best without using words. And ultimately, Mary McDonnell was great as ever.
