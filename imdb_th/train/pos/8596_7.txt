I think The Sentinel will be a normal movie. When I finally saw it, I was pleasantly surprised. This movie wasn't great. But it was very fun and the action scenes were very good. This movie reminded me of TV series such as 24 or Alias. It's very similar to that series and reminds me of Wolfgang Petersen's thriller in the fire. If you would expect one of the best original movies The history of the movie will disappoint you. But if you go with little expectation, you will enjoy The Sentinel. <br /> <br /> Score: 7
