I think if you ask JW mostly that they expect that healing with miracles will happen because of their beliefs or not, you will find that they are not doing. I know i can't What you will find is that they believe that Christ promised from the resurrection. So even if the worst thing happens and we die while adhering to our integrity, Jehovah can and will fix this. <br /> <br /> It's really a simple question. : Is your God? All this is just to make it believe it or not. If he is a real person and you trust him, you will follow his advice, regardless of the short-term results. <br /> <br /> I've had a heart attack for about a year and a half. One of my family was shocked when she saw the word "no blood" written in large letters on my chart. I reasoned with her that if I was in a position where only blood transfusions would save my life, that would be a good time to be angry with only one person who can come to life again when it comes to time She does not understand - God is not true enough for her. Very bad. I hope you will be comfortable with the strong faith given.
