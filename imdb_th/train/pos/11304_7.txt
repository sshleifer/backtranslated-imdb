I'm not sure under the circumstances that director Visconti decided to shoot James Cain's novel "The Postman Always Rings Twice" (I'm not even sure that Viscounti has the rights of this book) but the movie that came out. Absolutely interesting It's not the best version of Cain's story (I like the best version of 1981), but thanks to the great direction of Visconti and the selection of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (charming couples) it is a must for fans. Nua Visconti, mixed neorealism with noir, sensitive to good results Although this film is not perfect My main complaint is that this film is too long for my own goodness. The story moves very slowly (I don't think that Visconti is good at editing his films). I think Film Noir works better for a short time. Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors that make. Interested audience However, as much as I like this film and remakes, I think that no one has made a very commendable version of Cain's book.
