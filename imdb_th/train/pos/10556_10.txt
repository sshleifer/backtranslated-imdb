I'm not sure what to expect. But I'm glad to see this A slightly distorted comedy that makes you think. I'm not sure that the director will be able to create "nothing" but leave with Natalie and the great person at To create another low budget set that looks realistic (As realistic as possible) worth your time and money if you have the opportunity to see this, please You will be glad you did.
