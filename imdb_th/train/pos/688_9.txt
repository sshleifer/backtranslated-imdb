I am happy to watch this movie at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and very impressed. Tess Nanavati is a great screenwriter and I like to watch more of her movies. If you can do what you do with this movie's budget, I am very worried to see what she can do with the big picture. Glorious for the actors for their wonderful performances. (The little girl who is gold) and anyone who composed the twisted song "Row Your Boat" makes me squeeze. A very creative movie .... I hope to see it in a video or DVD because I will buy it soon. If you get a chance, you should definitely watch this movie.
