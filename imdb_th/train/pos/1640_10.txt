"Heartland" is a wonderful picture of what it likes to be on the border. The hard work and individual strength needed to survive the difficulties of climate and the lack of medical care combined with intimacy and interdependence of settlers. This drama has a special meaning because the story is based on the diary of the real people that the descendants are still there. It is also a good thing to see people in the west as people living. No one is charming or looks as though they just spend time with the makeup or costume department. Conchatta Ferrell is great. She is an example of a strong and hardworking man who arrived in Wyoming in the early 20th century and didn't let Difficulties come to a new life in a new land.
