Poor taste, strange and bordering. But smart enough to watch Jane Hatchard (Helena Bonham Carter), a woman with a wheelchair working with Richard (Kenneth Branagh), a reluctant caretaker Richard is a daydreaming artist in human flight. He built an airplane in his garage and intended to fly. He wants to revive his troubled life, resurrected by the dying independent care of Jane, who is suffering from neurological diseases. But she left little speaking and movement skills A wheelchair that is bound and full of souls, her final death desire is to release her virginity. She offered herself to Richard, who would not help her directly. But willing to rob the bank to pay the gigolo to do the deed. I found an ambitious flick and humor. Even in this role, Carter has a certain charm and passion.
