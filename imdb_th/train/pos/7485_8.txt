I hear some things that are not too good about this movie and may see low scores at IMDb here and that is the reason I avoid it. Today they show Vanilla Sky on TV and when I have nothing better to do ... and when it comes out Vanilla Skye is a horrible, sad and impressive movie. It's actually one of the best things I've seen for a while. I was surprised by the way I was affected by watching. It's hard to explain But during the film about your feelings for your character and your perception of what happened and it was an emotional journey Vanilla Skye touches me in a very rare way for any movie or media for that matter. <br /> <br /> I would recommend everyone to watch this movie. No matter what you hear about it
