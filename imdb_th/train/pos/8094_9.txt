First of all, the adjustment is not as good as the book, especially when you contact a professional writer like Tolkien. This adaptation miraculously synthesized the universe of Tolkien with the 1970s Sedalia, aesthetics and liberal culture. Yes - sometimes animation and background images are quite "rough" in technical applications But it is beautiful no less than that and brought in terms of giving a unique feeling to each scene In addition to the uniqueness of the image, it is a truly outstanding voice acting - a better performance than acting in a new live-action movie. And while the animation of the cell may not be an animation "With the most technical expertise", but it captures the expressions of the body and the face of the performance perfectly, while not forgetting to be smart The background image is different from the original "fantasy" motif to abstract things. But the transition to abstract settings is often motivated by storytelling and has contributed greatly to movie themes. If you are a person who has to use a computer in a movie so that everything is your picture, I will see that you may not like this movie. But if you enjoy superior performances, superb photos and JRR Tolkien is a must see.
