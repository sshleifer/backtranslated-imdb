Saving Grace is a movie that feels good with the heart in the right place. Grace just widowed and realizes that her deceased husband left a lot of debt. She may lose her lovely home and not see any other ways to solve her suffering except to grow marijuana. She lives in a beautiful village where most audiences like to live and all the villagers. But is a wonderful person that most viewers like to be neighbors There is only one thing that is wrong with this image and that is how it shows that marijuana affects users. Obviously, there were no actors or writers in this movie ever smoking things. The way people do after smoking is funny and ridiculous. It is accurate in those scenes where wisdom is replaced by slapstick English and that's a shame in movies that are less fun.
