This version of the Bleak House is an adaptation of the best classic novel I know. The representation of the Supreme Court as a 'character' in this drama is beautiful. The show is fantastic from the awesome King King Horn to Dedlocks, Smallweed, Crooke, Miss Flyte and two lovers. But it is the spider web of making merit that gathers all things together and the movie is great What does the BBC do about copyright errors, which means that this version cannot be seen in the UK on video or DVD for many years? I try to search from them. But faced with a stone wall In the end, I received a DVD from Canada.
