For me, there is something interesting and nostalgic about low-budget sci-fi as a child in the 50s. That's all there. In 1957 I saw "The First Man Into Space" in the cinema with my father. It has a starring Marshall Thompson and other bad guys who have a role in the position. It is about a bad space mission in which astronauts become scary killers. Fear of goodness and abundance from me. The memory of heebie-jeebies Those are still in me. The Incredible Melting Man is almost rebuilt in a color that is full of glory ... just having to love it for what it is ...... dark scenes. Mid hour sounds disgusting and creepy music. Cheers!
