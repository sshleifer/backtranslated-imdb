"Johnny Dangerously" is a popular comedy and comedy movie that has both laughs and "huh?" But I recommend giving a chance I think it looks more superior. There are not many people that give this movie a chance. It works well. Just think it's a joke of "Goodfellas". Michael Keaton is very funny in his role. And he did well. Johnny Dangerously is a gangster who wants to have a higher life. He had just climbed from the head to the beautiful wife. And of course, it's a lot of mob movies. Some people want him to die. 90% of jokes like me say give a chance. Just bring your favorite gangster movie to mix with a funny movie. You have "Johnny Dangerously". <br /> <br /> 7/10
