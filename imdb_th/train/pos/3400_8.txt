Domini Enfilren (Marlene Dietrich) spends most of his life looking after her father. Now he dies, she is free - but doesn't know what she wants. Boris Androvsky (Charles Boyer) is a monk who has escaped from the temple to taste more life. They met accidentally in Algiers, fell in love and married. But he can't leave his past behind and you can't live without him ... <br /> <br /> The love that is too full is full of dialogue and bad situations. Trish and Boyer try their best to have a good performance. But no one can escape Still, it's a classic. It was filmed in beautiful Technicolor (trying to watch on DVD), which every frame is amazingly beautiful. Dietrich often wears in the 9s (even in the middle of the desert) and attacks the hysteria post to show off her clothes and body. Boyer just walked around looking at it, not feeling scared. Even though I never got bored. It was wonderful to watch and the stupid dialogue that didn't stop me from having to sew stitches. In the end, I almost fell out of the chair because I laughed so hard! Now I love the jolly love and give them plenty of space, but actually --- this is unbelievable! It took a very short 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> As a classic camp, I gave 8 as a serious movie - 1
