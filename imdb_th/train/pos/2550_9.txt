This is one of Hollywood's "golden age", as they no longer do. It's a fun and unique movie that helps you guess what will happen next. <br /> <br /> All the actors are perfectly selected and they are all great actors. This is the first movie I saw with Ronald Coleman in that, and I have always been his girlfriend. Reginald Gardiner is an actor who always enjoys my support and adds some quality to every movie he visits as he plays various characters here that add.
