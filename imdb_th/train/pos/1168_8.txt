Tony Arsena, a Sicilian killer or professional killer, decided to leave the business and his former employer did not agree in terms of this very fun action movie content. In terms of real fun, it is fun. It is a very engaging story. Violence, cruelty, cruelty, car chase are outstanding. "Arzenta" is an unpretentious movie. But more satisfying than the current Hollywood movie that received the same label It comes from Delon's short flirting with the Italian B theater in the 70s. It uses Delon's strong personality carefully, which is the gall of gallant galleries he made in his youth. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the fact that Delon made this movie that he had a role in the great Eurocrime flick. <br /> <br /> Very good score with introductory songs. Making sense of the gusto that the Italians have for this film, which is a synthesis of music that is important. <br /> <br /> In Tony Arzenta / Big Guns / No Way Out Erika is very attractive. Blanc (31 In the year 73) appeared as a prostitute named Sandra, Arzenta's girlfriend, while Carla Gravina played by Carla Gravina (the new star who left the movie after 75 years). <br /> <br /> "Arzenta" Are filming interesting, ambitious thoughts, some The bizarre Expressionistic The film is directed by Duccio Tessari, director Zorro (Delon Comedy). Not to mention that both of these films are Tony Arzenta (1973) and Zorro, which is very different from the first one. Action movies - The second story is more comedy, more cousins, even though it is remarkably linked and well-built. Dubio Tessari directed movies like Kiss Kiss ... Bang Bang (1966), Son of Satan, Blood Blood La Muerte ... Tua!, Tough Guys (1974), Safari Express (1976) etc.
