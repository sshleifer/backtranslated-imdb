This movie is a dangerous escape game. Some of the latest Tomb Raider movies are missing. I can't wait to get a DVD. How can people score this low and still go to see the Titanic without feeling guilty that I don't know? Anything that has with Karen Kopins in her underwear must give extra points or two points!
