This movie is absolutely fantastic !! Every show in this film is excellent, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. It seems that Gillen Hal will be a great movie actor if this is something to do. I think Joe Johnston is a strange choice as a director because he is often associated with big woeful people. He pulled every scene with a real class. My favorite scene is that Homer is going down to the mineshaft and looking at the sky down all his dreams. It's beautiful. Joe Johnston should direct the great movie that shows the film, including the great movie Big Budget Blockbuster as well. KUDOS !! To everyone involved in this masterpiece!
