I love this movie It's very good! Excellent performances and drama in the past I love the movie Romy Schneider. This rock is not as big as Sissi, but still a rock! <br /> <br /> And Scorpiolina, she commented and spoke French. Now it's a German movie, not French. Yes. Secondly, there is a plot. Maybe you are not familiar with history. Oh and her mother plays as a ruler, not her teacher. And the story isn't Cinderella, but it's Queen Victoria. Maybe you miss that detail I love everything in history Like that man who tried to deal with her mother And when she ran out and met her future husband and he showed her "New Dance" When Waling's new story is considered a scandal because couples dance very close. Yea, she is like my God! <br /> <br /> And clothes. I love clothes. The pattern is good, the hoop skirt is awesome and of course Romy looks very beautiful always.
