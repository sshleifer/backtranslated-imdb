2000 was a terrible year for Indian movies due to lack of quality and imagination from film directors. In addition to Mohabbatein and Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai, nothing was outstanding. CCCC had a lot of violations due to the financing of this film and did not know. That this film is about what has created good publicity and advanced ticket sales for movies around India and abroad The only information received is that it is a suspense thriller. The film was released in 2001 and the film is surprisingly good. The main plot is to do with surrogacy and has a good deal. Salman and Pretit give good performances that Salman didn't wear, so take off the shirt. Must be a special technique !! Rani plays Salman's wife. But it doesn't have a less demanding role compared to Pretit, who plays prostitutes who eventually become the mother of the agent The three main assertions after Har Di Jo Pyar Karega, they are strong on the screen and outside the screen. The chemistry (obviously) Salman Khan, who has a serious role in this film as a successful businessman and is It is a pity that he has been used as a comedian in his other films because he is somewhat lower than the Mumbai movie industry. Rani's character doesn't know that Preiti is a prostitute. ... to end this thing kept from her family and others in the rest ... you should know that it will ruin the movie if I told you. All songs have good pictures, especially dekhne walon and the main title song. Actors who support others try their best. But trying very well because the Salmans family loves each other. Abbas Mastan has created a great work and handled the witty story .. I said, go and see or rent what you want!
