<br /> <br /> There is a lot of STAR TREK canon from the precepts. We know the history of the future. Technological advances, events, places, first contact with new beings, names, dates, etc. <br /> <br /> The organization is not quite interested in Canon's ST. The unfortunate truth for serious fans for a long time. As one, I think the manufacturer, at least, must look at the first part of the TOS and go back from there - but not <br /> <br /> Gun phase like technology. More modern than that found in the old Starfleet laser gun. Slow moving point effects - that's what I expected to see. In addition, I did not expect to hear the sound of a beep sound similar to TNG, but far from the sound effects of the TOS. <br /> <br /> In the first view of the TOS (pilot Original: THE CAGE) We saw Starfleet with a more formal military perspective - the old world navy. With the enterprise, we will see the ignorance of the shocking ranks. There is more military code in the STAR BLAZERS cartoon than ENTERPRISE. <br /> <br /> It's good that Captain Archer isn't sure about the needs of the universe. (Which is different from churches that have never lacked confidence in the use of human justice), but within every organization it seems to be equal Professionals are not sure and far from the official military service feeling than found in the ST series - and that tells a lot. <br /> <br /> Country music opens up a casual song. Announcement of family travel The adventures of a large, large military ship <br /> <br /> The enterprise seems to show us that exploring the most fun and warm human relationships instead of taking us to explore the brave and brave history. And there is a high risk of space. <br /> <br /> I'll choose Adrian Paul to play the captain and the older man to be a doctor. Still, I like most actors. Linda Park, a distinguished ballroom dancer from Boston College, is sure to be fully developed. The characters created by the crew seem to have been created meticulously. <br /> <br /> The starship began to run stronger than the previous three TREK series. Hope to have a good future!
