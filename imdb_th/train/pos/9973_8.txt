I prefer this version of 'Vanishing Point' rather than version 1971. I found the 1971 model quite boring. If I can wake up in the middle of the movie a few times (As I did with the 1971 model) rather than for me, it's not that big. Of course, probably because of the fact that I was only nine years old while leading the 1971 version. However, I have seen many remakes that I like, the traditional and the older, the better. I found the plot of version 1997 to be easier to understand and still be true to the original without destroying the meaning of version 1971. In my opinion, I feel that the 1997 version is more exciting and not "blase "So (boring)
