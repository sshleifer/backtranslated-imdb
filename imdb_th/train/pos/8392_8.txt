This film demonstrates the art of movie shooting techniques, which instead of the scenery that attracts the attention of the camera, it has little details about how someone appears. The woman may wear a cocktail hat and wrap it in sheets. The way the husband may wear his hat, socks, shoes and underwear, and both look comfortable and completely comfortable. The excitement of the woman posed is another feature of the scene in which the director chooses to tell us that she is a sex-free spirit and aims to get the happiness she sought without having to flirt directly. The relationship between wife and husband is not the same. It was an open space where she didn't hold anything. Feeling ashamed of the way she behaved and wanted to share these truths with him because her main focus was their marriage. Nothing and no one can live between them both. The only chance of fate is to intervene. --- He was imprisoned during the war and what followed after he had returned for a long time. Very interesting movie that absorbs all.
