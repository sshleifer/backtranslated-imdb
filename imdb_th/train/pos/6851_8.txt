De Palma's technique has been highly popular during the time of this film, which is a great show of his traditional techniques, although unfortunately, as with many movies written by De Palma himself, the story serves me. Eye over the benefits of Emotional interesting story. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the CRAZY scene in which Angie Dickinson helps herself in the shower while she looks at her husband. Then she was arrested and raped while his husband stood bewildered - and all things were revealed as Angie's imagination while his husband was pumping her unconsciously on her bed. the scene briefly with her son, who is the vibration of Harry Potter, which concluded with a joke at that. "She will tell Grandma that he is playing with his co-workers." Then she went to her therapy session where she complained about her dead marriage before trying to seduce her therapist. Michael Ken He refused, and she was hurt and felt unattractive and ineffective. <br /> <br /> Then started the courage for 22 minutes, almost impossible to say, which could be the highlight of the film. Among the many things that De Palma gathered from Hitchcock was the understanding of the film as a medium of storytelling. And as typical of De Palma, he used this method to show his awesome skills. The problem for me is that in this case, we begin to feel that the scene has been prolonged without needing to just show the director's skills. <br /> <br /> The sequence starts with Angie at the art museum. She watched all strangers involved in sexual activity or family, then began to turn to men sitting next to her. De Palma tells a very complicated story without a single word about Angie's attraction, shame, retreating, and finally finding and sending to a stranger on the back of a taxi. Carrie score <br /> <br /> In the second part of the sequence, Angie slept with a man and rose to return to her husband. De Palma reiterated the story again without talking, while Angie realized that she didn't have her underwear. Her husband was already at home and no doubt where she was, she could be a venereal disease. And she lost her engagement ring somewhere in the shuffle It is a very admirable thing. But began to feel a little stressed while we were forced to do things such as sitting down an elevator down from the seventh floor and then up again almost in real time. <br /> <br /> ... Spoiler Leaving here! When Angie reached the seventh floor again, she was killed by a large woman with blonde hair. The woman snapped at her until she reached the ground floor when the door opened and Nancy Allen saw her there. There is a wonderful slow motion sequence when Nancy reaches out to the elevator. Angie reaches out to her and the killer's blade is ready to slash Nancy's hand. Then followed by a shock shot while Nancy looked up to see the killer in the mirror. Everything is fine and when we have a conversation again you think; "Wow, that's just 22 minutes of story telling!" Or maybe you can't. But I can. <br /> <br /> Dennis Franz's sister is involved as a lazy and strong New York detective who wants everyone to work for him. He interviewed Michael Caine, causing the meaning to be evil. (Although it is common) that Angie wants to be killed Angie's son was there as well, and he was steadfast with Nancy and they planned to spy on Ken's therapists and find out who the murderer is. <br /> <br /> Once again there Hitchcock movie. In this case, Psycho (as well as Obsession is the return of Vertigo again). You have a woman that we should understand as a slut who was killed in the first 30 minutes in an enclosed area This elevator is very Shower room Then the deceased's cousin made an investigation which revealed that the murderer was the one who dressed as a woman to kill Eventually, De Palma threw a doctor who described the psychology of the whole story. <br /> <br /> It's a very interesting story. But at the same time, the audience started to feel a bit confused and that was my main backup about this movie. It is important to watch and show De Palma's greatest masterpiece. But the feeling that the story is continuing in the third place behind De Palma's need for expression and his sexual imagination A loving kindness <br /> <br /> --- See other reviews on my website about bad and charming movies, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com.
