I hate reading reviews that say something like 'Don't waste time. It makes the critic for me, it may be innocent charm. If you like other 'Whistler' series movies, this movie will be able to watch. If you like the 40s noirish movie, this movie will be able to watch. <br /> <br /> In this movie, I think it's not as good as the previous movie, starring Richard Dix. And a tragic storyline You've seen the same storytelling equipment that is used in other films and is usually better. <br /> <br /> But the performance is good and it is light and conversation. Is just a lack of energy and you may know that what happened and how to come out in the end, no more than a quarter of passing <br /> <br /> the 'Whistler' series Is semi-noir and character, emotion, light, camera movement and angle are more important than their own But this movie is not noir It's too light and Hollywood is naive for that. The character of Richard Dix and the women in his previous film must not end. You never know before you finish. <br /> <br /> But I will recommend this one at least once. I've watched it at least twice and have enjoyed enough time both times.
