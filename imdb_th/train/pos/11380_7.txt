Although the word megalmania is used to describe many things with Gene Kelly, and sometimes his dance is too hard, you have to admit that men know how to act. In America, in Paris, he designed a number of outstanding choreography, some of which were laid out. But look amazing (see Gene Kelly on "Regularly out of residence" for beginners) <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly's star as a GI based on Paris, he was there to paint. Soon he was a rich woman Gigolo but he really loved someone! Of course, what is Hoary's story? But the musical numbers record the performances here! I like Georges Gu¨¦tary's work very much in this story. His 'Stairway to Paradise' and his partner with Le Gene in 'S Wonderful' are great. Oscar Levant and Leslie Caron I can go or leave. Overall, it's a good movie. But not dynamite movies
