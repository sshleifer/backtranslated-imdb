Controlling the BBC-2 that he will be with it every week They are a classic comedy team - high, handsome and witty prison, while Dudley is short, charming and talented in music. The sketch that brought the house down has them in a pub, wearing a flat hat and a fancy muffler, imagining movie stars such as Jane Russell and Greta Garbo. It is still one of the most hilarious games of all time, and even Cook will remain together well. <br /> <br /> Those characters - idols, peat and idols are great. Bigger - Discover every time Proper performances can be seen in different environments such as zoos or art galleries. In the latter, they chewed sandwiches while discussing art. "Leonardo DaVinci's cartoon ... I didn't see a joke!" Dud said. Pete pointed out that when it was first released, it might be in the state. Fit Dud almost suffocated on his repast. "You really enjoy those sandwiches!", Lib lib ad ad lib libertarians both bounced their humor in a way that was glad to see. That body creates a new standard for comedy, which is a standard that cannot be matched until 'Monty Python'. <br /> <br /> When the popularity of the program increases, the quality of the guest star too. For example, Peter Sellers and John Lennon, who presented the poem 'Deaf Ted, Danoota, &' 'One Leg Too Few' - had Dud as 'George Spigott' (later names were used in The movie 'Bedazzled') A man who jumped into the movie maker's office to test the role of 'Tarzan'. Cook tried to make him as disappointed as possible. "I didn't do anything with your right leg!" He said. "The problem is - don't have you!" <br /> <br /> Dud will have an opportunity to interview Sir Arthur Streep-Greebling. ) Which when he did not teach, the crows will fly underwater, is planning to open Another classic restaurant called 'The Frog & The Peach' is 'The Leaping Nuns' (reused in 'Bedazzled'), but my favorite thing must always be 'Superthunderstingcar' Gerry and the evil parody of Jerry and 'Thunderbirds' by Jerry and Sylvia Anderson Pete and Dud play all roles with the creation of 'Lady Penelope'. Ludwig has Ludwig van Beethoven as The star of the variety show, 'This Is Tom Jones', 'The Immortal Bargo' is a documentary film about the life of the movie star 'Emma Bargo' in a memorable moment. She drove through London, singing loudly: " I want to be alone! "<br /> <br /> Season 3 is 'Poets Cornered'. With Ronnie Barker, Spike Milligan, Barry Humphries, Willie Rushton and others. Gunge tanks are suspended. Each of them has to compose poems and everyone who can't touch the nasty things. <br /> <br / > Three seasons were created by Joe McGrath. (In each period) Dick Clement and Jimmy Gilbert. Unfortunately, very few have survived. To make matters worse, the script was also destroyed. It is a beggar belief that this situation has been allowed to happen. <br /> <br /> The performance ended in 1970. Then the Broadway cartoon made a shameful 'Derek & Clive' tape. Eight years later Makak announces that the new series is being released. But it turned out that he missed his thoughts His former partner is creating a movie in America and has no intention of working with Cook again (not at the time). <br /> <br /> The videos that will be copied together are the seasons of BBC-2. Repeatedly in the early 90's, as expected, some programs were not held as well as other programs. Prison died in 1995 and by tribute the BBC compiled a program compiled from the 'Parkinson' and 'not only But ... but still Dong suggests' it is quite reasonable to end up Pete and Dud find yourself in paradise "Bloody hell!" Exclaimed Moore passed in 2002.
