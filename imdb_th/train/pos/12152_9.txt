I just saw this movie on HBO and it was really good ... a really sad love story! I admire the fact that the person who is at the heart of the story uses his legs in an accident. It is difficult to see love stories that are related to physically disabled people. The love that develops between that character and the woman who came into his life clearly shows that I want to think that love can save someone's heart. This story ... is great because women are full of life, so she can regain this man's heart. Unfortunately, because his family is rich and she is not a "problem" developed <br /> <br /> It's been playing with HBO many times this month.
