MULHOLLAND DRIVE makes me a big fan of David Lynch. He is a modern genius because he is not only But as a filmmaker His story and style have spells that cross the screen. The story of STRAIGHT STORY is quite surprising to me because it's easy to follow the story and sunny scenes. Even though Lynch was there and while this was far from him, it was a movie that shouldn't be missed. The slow performance of Richard Farnsworth is one of the reasons <br /> <br /> 8/10
