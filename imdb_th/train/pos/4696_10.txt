Although this movie is quite old, no matter how many times I watch it, it still makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> The only words in the movie stand out <br /> <br /> When Danny (Joe Piscopo ) Pulled up to the office and park of Da in the disabled, Danny's partner said, <br /> <br /> "Can't park here disabled." <br /> <br /> Danny Replied, "I am a disabled person. I am a psychopath." <br /> <br /> That's one of the many movies in the movie. No matter how many times you watch Will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Johnny Danger stands in my comedy / top 5 jokes all the time. <br /> <br /> As an added bonus Also includes the legendary actor Peter Boyle in the cast, so watch this movie and like yourself and others who have watched you being hooked
