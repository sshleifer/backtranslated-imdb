I was born in 1982. My childhood memories are mostly in the late 80's and 90's. I watched Groove Tube for the first time in 2001 when I was 19 years old. <br /> <br /> And I found that It's hilarious. <br /> <br /> So for anyone who thinks something "old" can be quite funny in the next 30 years, think again! It's a joke, even if you don't know what the 70s are and the idea of ​​bell bottom pants makes you cringe. Who can argue with the Bozo clown type that reads adult literature? There is plenty to laugh at. The puppet show at the end is the best.
