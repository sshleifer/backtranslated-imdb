This is a very good movie. Do you want to know the real reason why so many places make this film knock? I'll tell you. In this movie, you have a black criminal who has a white professor. A black police officer who told White teachers that he was wrong to protect black criminals and black police became so accurate. Makes the white skin professor look stupid It always competes This is a great movie. Pay attention to the class If you understand that there is a character played by a black person in this film that plays a role that is superior to the white character, you shouldn't have any problems.
