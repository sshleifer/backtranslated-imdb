Excellent, true and realistic image of pioneering life in the western plains, emphasizing the role and location of women Animated movies are created with love and based on real people and their real experiences. Low budget independent movies Never make money at all Not a pioneer of the Hollywood version that is absolutely romantic and unrealistic.
