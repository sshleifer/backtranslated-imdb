I like this movie a lot. I can watch it regularly and not its tires. I think that's one of my criteria for a great movie. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting. It introduces us to 6 characters; Each person has a unique kung fu style that is secret and life-threatening. Each of these characters is trained by the same teacher. But their identity will be kept secret from each other The dying teacher sends the sixth poison, his last student, to try to do the wrong thing that he suspects his student has done. <br /> <br /> How did the last student find another poison? How can he know which ones are not good? The way to answer these questions is part of what makes this movie great. <br /> <br /> In addition, we also see the poison fighting in every combination. It's fun to see that their style. <br /> <br /> If you want to see if you like kung fu movies or not, this is a good movie to start with. It's not better than this anymore.
