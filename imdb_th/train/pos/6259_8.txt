Actually, I was angry at the comments I read, stating that this movie was "boring" and the beautiful scenery was destroyed by black and white images. It was created in 1925 !!!! I think it's an incredible time! <br /> <br /> The journey that these people have to go through is a very remarkable thing. They spent a week crossing the river. The women carried their children on a heavy wooden back plate, climbed onto a hard rock, sometimes bare feet in the snow. I want to see who do that now! <br /> <br /> I think it's a great movie with amazing shots and incredible stories.
