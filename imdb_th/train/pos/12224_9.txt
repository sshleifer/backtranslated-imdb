I saw both movies last night and I found it very exciting. It was at least not like the slap teen movie that emerged every moment and then searched for the killer and the 'alliance' relationship between the hero and The so-called bad guy is the part that I like about movies. In addition, I remember when sitting on the edge of my seat during specific scenes in the movie. I mean, it's exciting. Maybe sometimes later I might watch. Movie again ..
