Although I am grateful for the hidden gem of the Italian exploitation feature in the 70's in the box set "Grindhouse Experience" recently released, and although it is on the disc under the name Deserve to have a complete and elegant DVD in the language spoken Originally with subtitle options (The voice dubbing is truly awesome) The quality of the recovered images and the special bonus features! Heck, I don't even want the features of the restored image and the bonus if we can watch the movie in its original language. "Mean Frank and Crazy Tony" is a mafia / crime that swings fast with violence, comedy. (Which has always been unacceptable) The beauty of women and the two main characters that are witty. Tony Lo Bianco is a great person because the small thugs act as the biggest donors of the city. When the real offender Frankie Dio (Lee Van Cleef) arrives in the city, he sees the opportunity to climb up the stairs with his service. Initially, Frankie ignored the small crook, but eventually they created an unlikely team when Frankie's entire criminal empire turned against him and a new French criminal mastermind. Tony helps Frankie to escape from the prison and they head to Marseille to extract Frankie's revenge. This sadly neglected crime crime script has created a sense of humor and humor, such as cars that run through the narrow mountain roads of France. The creation of the order of operations of the common mafia (Guided by the excellent Riz Ortolani score) There is a lot of tension and the actual killing is sadistic and merciless. The film lacks a strong female lead due to the surprisingly beautiful and seductive beauty that Edwige Fenech sadly just appeared in two scenes and still in the background. Among the men behind the camera, the person responsible for the great movie, no less than Joe D'Amato, the great movie is highly recommended for fans of Italian exploitation and I hope to see it again soon in the original version.
