Anyone who says that stupid Pokémon can die This movie is superb. I'm still crying tears when Celebi dies. I'm not very CRY! This movie is a thrilling animated movie. <br /> <br /> In the fourth episode of this Pokemon, Ash and his friends have to stop the bad jerk, causing Celebei to become the final weapon. His dark ball At the time of Sam and Celeba traveling through time and being constantly hunted by game hunters. I like the fighting part twice and Sam has a pokeball apricorn (if you play Pokemon, gold, silver or crystal, you know what it is) <br /> <br /> I enjoy having a miramax instead of Warner Brothers Placing a mini movie at the end is a good idea. Pokémon in this movie are more lively than ever.
