I absolutely love this movie! I am not involved with all other comments that I have read about it. I am completely enamored every second! <br /> <br /> I found interesting stories, intense performances and directions to face. I will literally jump every time the phone rings near the end of the movie. Although there is nothing "scary" about the story itself. But I listened to the whole story throughout the movie - and throughout my evening, <br /> <br /> I found that there were a lot of perfect options to make ... casting actors, movies, a little humor sprinkled down. There are many points that this movie might make you excited about the cheap excitement. But it never did that and for me that made this movie above the normal excitement coming out soon ... year.
