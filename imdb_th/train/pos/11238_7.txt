Hidden Frontier is a program that fans made in the world of Star Trek. The story takes place after Voyager returns from the Delta. There are some characters from the official Star Trek program. But mostly the original characters in the show The show takes place on the 12th deep space base and on many spacecraft, which gives the opportunity to show off formally. The characters have a higher chance in the hierarchy in which the characters in the show have only one ship. The program has a computer animation, a good spacecraft. But the show takes place on the green screen and gives the green light around the actors. Not all actors are equally good, but most do well. When the character is driven and the character develops more than many episodes It's more like in Babylon 5 than in the official Star Trek program. Most of the Hidden Frontier uses the prohibition that even the official series has shrunk from use. All i like to watch it
