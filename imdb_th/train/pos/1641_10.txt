I saw this thing 25 years ago in PBS. It looks very difficult. Actually, seeing a small family fight in winter is the heart that affects There is no time for courting: Destiny throws us together and we take our shoulders to the secret stone and make it work. This depends on the true diary of the woman I read many years later. She said in a diary that her parents had died when she was young and that both their brothers and sisters had to work on the farm to raise themselves She learned to cut the grass, which is not like women. She was afraid that no charming prince would want a woman with a sunny brown hand. But this husband is very happy that his new wife knows how to cut the grass and she is happy to do Both were widows and worked together to build a new home. It was so sad when the baby died. Of course, if they have it today, I'm sure it will be good. That is just a tragic tragedy. I cried so hard But then they went out and pulled the new calf out. Spring is coming and life will continue. In her diary, she has two boys and they live.
