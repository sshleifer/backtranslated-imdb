I was frustrated with Jim Carrey's work. I still make this movie stuck in my head. The likes of Grinch Martha May Cindy Lou (Who is very annoying, her sweet innocence) trying to get Grinch in Grinch's childhood Christmas spirit (very funny!) And, moreover, all about gifts I must say that I felt stupid that went out of the theater, along with babies and toddlers, laughing and so on. But this movie is an adaptation of ISSuss and IS for all ages
