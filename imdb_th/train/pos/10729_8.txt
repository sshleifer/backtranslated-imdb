Space robots, some summer camps, were accidentally sent to space. And oxygen in the boat is short They have to send people to the space station to pick up gas tanks, etc. First of all, this plot is impossible in real life. But it gives a warm feeling to everything that is possible if you intend on yourself. <br /> <br /> It is an amazing story to see young actors that still look the same after many years. (I saw this movie for the first time in 2000. It was filmed in 1986.) There are a few people in this movie that still work in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> A good view from the world It doesn't look real. It's about 2 hours long. It runs so fast that you don't notice. You know it's not true But you have just been sucked to the end. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good family movie. <br /> <br />
