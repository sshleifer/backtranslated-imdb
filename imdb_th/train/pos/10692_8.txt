Good, funny and straightforward. Nicole Kidman is great. (I always like to watch movies that you are in.) This is a "vehicle" that is good for people who specialize in comedy and drama because they have both elements. Romantic comedy, a thousand stories of crime, which is a great closing Chaplin is very good here. It's also good in another story. Romantic comedy. But not popular Maybe they are too unbelievable. Ebert didn't post a review for this thing. The great "screwball" comedy is obviously unbelievable. ("Raising children", etc.) If you've watched unbelievable comedy movies, you see everything, right? Or maybe people are ready to move on from the 30s. Strange. Birthday Girl is a movie I like many times. Nicole Kidman is probably the "killer app" for home video.
