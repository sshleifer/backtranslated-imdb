I will give it to you directly ... This movie is amazing. International gay movies are superior to American gay movies in terms of performance and quality production. While many American indie gay movies look rough, bad sound, amateur shows, boring stories and lack of nudity or erotica surprises Movies are beautiful, thought out, meaningful. The story is mature and complex. (But not difficult for anyone to follow) The performance is intense and professional. Both leading actors are as good as all actors. The boy is more than good-looking and has a lot of nude pictures on his forehead. You follow the whole year of these boys from meeting to the end. All the small differences of the relationship, the details of the fall, and leaving love are performed beautifully. It makes me want more. Check it out!
