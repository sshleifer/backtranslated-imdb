Unlike other critics who commented on the ability of this film to cross the competition, I think this powerful movie has a complex and profound story that discusses racism and the impact of it Washington directs Fisher's story with careful and critical hands, carefully releasing the film's efforts to cut off the organs of women to act as unexpected maps. I think this movie might be too happy at the end. However, it is deeply embedded in the culture and discourse of Afro-American people, to the point that some white viewers may feel the view of Afro-Fisher's Afro-American life. I have a problem with the movie Naval, but when we look at America, there are many options or opportunities for blacks in the Fisher situation or in similar situations. The audience may go to this movie, expecting "Black Movie:" What is Black Movie? "<br /> <br /> Making a pattern of pimp, prostitutes, drug dealers, single houses and more is" black movies. "" I think Washington as the director admits that African Americans and others who have problems with human color, such as abuse and displaced aggression, to name a few problems. These - in the past and The Will Hunting "and other white movies, it's time for them to receive recognition and accuracy, as well as their white partners, both inside and outside the media. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sad to say that in this racist country, Denzel Washington and Derek Luke may have to wait ten years before they get an Oscar or else they both have to wait until They are directed or shown in movies that extend the age of the class. Racial discrimination and gender-based stereotypes for the Oscars, says Denzel deserves the award for "Malcolm X," "Hurricane" and others before the "day scam" Oscar that is not an objection or push. Best actress and other color actors who have been rejected due to admiration due to intelligent work But Hollywood wants to send a message that racism and gender discrimination and heterosexual differences are acceptable by continuing and rewarding those images as they appear in many movies. "And even" disappearing with the wind "<br /> <br /> Derek Luke is a young actor and I want him to be the best All other actors and actors gave a great performance even though I had trouble choosing another Denzel sistuh with straight hair and light-colored hair. Who said that everyone should watch this movie However, it may not be suitable for everyone. Much Luv 10/10
