At first I didn't think Ben Affleck could actually pull out a funny Christmas movie. My boy was wrong. My daughter invited me to watch this story with her and I was not disappointed. Christina Appelagate and Catherine O 'Hara are also good. The story is what really sold me. I mean, putting up with the family too at the table for people you rarely see But twice a year or two times and may not be compatible, you need as much alcohol as your system can handle Christmas, so I think that location is good. Families with 250000 dollars are a little far away. But it turned out that working was quite good for me because it was a riot all the way. It shows the class struggle of different families. It had a very funny time, including embarrassing things on computers for teenagers. All in all, I love this movie and will watch again on Christmas page or faster if my daughter wants as well.
