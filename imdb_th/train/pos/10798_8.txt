The first time seeing this gem from Joe Sarno back when and I have to say that after seeing it I never forget Jennifer Wells. At first I thought this movie was moving slower than I expected for the movie Sarno, but when Jennifer came in the first time I saw her everywhere, I sat down and noticed. Her presence in this film is difficult to avoid and spice up all the scenes in which she gets involved. I've seen most of Sarno's remaining movies and other movies starring Jennifer Wells and I have to say That this is both Sarno and Jennifer is the best group. The direction of Sarno in this movie for adult drama in the country is great and Jennifer shows courage in the show. (Figuratively and truly) that makes this story look like Rebecca Brook (or Mary Mendam) and Chris Jordan, who is a frequent actress of Miss Les, including the work of Sano often causes Convincing performances that are adventurous couples But as an ordinary housewife This movie is Sarno classic.
