I have to give this movie only 10 because it does what many movies that are cast for the black audience have failed incredibly. This film is a void of all videos about ancient ideas, and it crosses the gangsters, rappers and abusive languages. It examines many relationships among physicians, African-American doctors and the romantic relationship of American men / women of African descent on a new and complete level. I am very impressed with the film that blends lightly with the tough and heavy issues. This movie will make you feel happy and sad at the same time. I saw it at the Boston Film Festival as well. It premiered at AMC Loews Boston and I hope this movie will make more viewers, blacks (and everyone else) love this movie - if the industry is smart enough to take them out. out! <br /> <br /> As a special thing - if your doctor, resident, medical student, premedical student, marry a doctor, have a doctor, have a doctor in the family or know a great doctor - they will love the movie. This too It demonstrates living and performing in a way that is true to life that has been greatly appreciated by doctors, citizens and medical students who watch movies. Dennis Cooper lives in the field of medicine completely - so he brings his knowledge / experience to the film clearly.
