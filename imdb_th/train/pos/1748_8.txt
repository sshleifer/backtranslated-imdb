From the beginning, I was very excited to watch this movie. The poster is probably the most fun I've ever seen in a movie. I bought immediately for my dormitory this September. <br /> <br /> Every element comes together in this beautiful movie. It is not often that you watch movies with gay penis and many ethnic jokes that are praised by critics Carell and the rest of the actors. Karel is still sweet throughout the movie, at the end of the movie that you take root so that he can succeed in his relationship more than you let him be placed. The supporting actors are cruel. Each of them has a problem with the women. <br /> <br /> One thing about this movie is the many memorable scenes that we received. This is what makes movies easy to remember with love. This film is often brought up when the word "Chest waxing" and "condoms" are mentioned in the dialogue. <br /> <br /> Watching in the cinema, I was surprised that many seniors came to see. I saw four women in the mid-60s, although there were older audiences. But this movie is still full of laughter. The cinema <br /> <br /> I think this type of person will be a fan of The office and Steve Carell, many jokes, reminds me of the kind of joke you see in the Family Guy. The film is quite shallow for teenagers and is sweet and smart enough for middle-aged women. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend Go to see this movie if you're not a fan of rudeness or if you are a simple person who is breaking the law. However, when you're at the movie, remember that this movie has good humor. Jokes are not "gay jokes". They are just a joke. And they are funny
