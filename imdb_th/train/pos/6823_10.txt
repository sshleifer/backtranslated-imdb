I spent a week watching John Cassavetes' movie, starting with the 'woman under the influence' and ending in 'open night'. I was completely blown out and especially in these two movies. From the first minute to the end in the 'open night' I was completely absorbed and fully I have only experienced a few times. But the feeling that this film is perfect from about two-thirds to the credit Everything about this movie, from the filming of Gena Rowlands' incredible performances, credit, opening, music, plot, deep feelings, rhythm, tenderness, originality, character, agility, a little time .... For me, it's really noble. I disagree with previous comments about taking to a deserted island because the depth of this film is something to consider. If you are unlucky enough to have a house fire, I guarantee that instead of trying to leave the last time to help the money hidden under your bed, you will help you copy this movie instead.
