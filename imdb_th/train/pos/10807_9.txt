I just saw this movie and fell in love with it. There are a few things for everyone and it's free for everyone when talking about the love between Lachlan and Lil. When they are on the beach, I almost cry ... There is an awareness that was not spoken at that time as being a product The most precious and obvious when they are together This concept is taken from many perspectives, from marriage to siblings to finding love in the most ordinary places. This movie makes you curious when you know that tomorrow will be your last day. Crowe was exceptional in his role at Lachlan. I have always had weaknesses for the accent. But I almost dissolved by describing his character The method of filming this movie is beautiful with the background music of the open field and excellent performances. All of this is a great movie that draws the human emotions out.
