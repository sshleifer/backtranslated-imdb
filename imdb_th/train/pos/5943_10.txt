This movie is really cool. Everything seems to come out of comic books, scenes, series, and great stories. Clark Bartram is our favorite military officer again. He looks a little better in a stalemate. But he still pulled it away Superman is also great. The flight effect is ok. But it's a movie fan so we can't expect them to be the greatest The image with Superman holding the car is very convincing. It's cool. This is the movie I will watch if it's real. There is everything you need in the Batman / Superman movie, even if there is one exception. I will throw Joker instead of 2 pages ..... Overall, I gave this movie 10 because it is a great movie.
