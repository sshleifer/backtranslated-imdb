Once again, Jetle brings his charm on the screen of the movie Black Mask. In this film, Li plays the role of a fleeing soldier from the ultimate military program that seeks to regain humanity from the program. he To do this, Sui decided to become a librarian to live a normal and peaceful life. But fate wants him to clean the problem from the past before he can find peace. The other members of the Super Soldier program have escaped along with Tsui, but they want to be with the world more than meet. Inner peace So Sui became the only thing that could prevent his former teammates from revealing information that could cause many innocent people to die. This film screams through the screen with excitement and never let the audience reach. The martial arts are amazing. But because it uses the line, it may not be as much appreciated by American audiences If you like action movies that have interesting stories and want good performances because they deal with psychology and physical conflicts, Black Mask is right for you. I am glad to see that some of Jet Li's films have been mainstreamed in the United States and hope to see how the changes that will be launched will have an impact. This is one of Li's best movies and went out on May 14 when the movie was released in America.
