The Prix de Beauté is built from the turning point of silence to sound, which is slightly more in Europe than in Hollywood. Initially thought of as a silence, it was released with a soundtrack dubbed in French and a French actor who spoke the role of Louise Brooks but was released as silence in Italy and other parts of Europe, I was fortunate to see Cineteca di Bologna being completely refurbished in Italian silent print at the Tribeca Film Festival. I still don't see the Talkie model, but I think it's safe to assume that the silent version is more satisfying because of all the reports that copying is not good. (Louis Brooks speaks clearly English. Paired.) In addition, the film was created perfectly in a quiet, little name and requires little dialogue. Prix de Beauté tells the story of it too. Exciting pictures and imagination of the camera The launch was instantaneous with the fast-paced scenes of city life and swimmers splashing at public beaches. Throughout the film, there is a focus on details, images, clothes, decorations and symbols such as birds, cages, photos of torn pieces, diamond bracelets This is a silent movie technique at the pinnacle. Of course, Louise Brooks is responsible for recording movies from confusion. Seeing this makes it more regretful to show that this is her last act. She is directing this film with charm and also natural performance. Her role here, more than in the most well-known Pabst movie, is a woman we can fully understand and sympathize. She plays Lucienne Garnier, a typist with a fiancé who wishes to leave a lot of lives. Up and join the beauty contest secretly and successfully immediately Then she was torn between the excitement of her charming new life and the love she had for those who confirmed that she would give up or give up. All characters are drawn with a little difference. The fiancé is inspired by compassion and is not just a brute: He loves Lucia, but is a limited person who cannot cope with her life other than him or even attracts the attention of other men. " Others "In this matter, it's not a normal slime ball game that we take him, although his intentions may be the ownership of the fiancée. <br /> <br /> ********** *************** Warning: Spoiler Below ***************** <br /> <br /> Movies have many good sets. The piece, including Lucienne's victory in the "Miss Europe" contest, shows through the cartoon reactions of various audience members who wind up the heroine with flowers. Her misery as a housewife stripped the potato while the pendulum of the cuckoo clock marked the time behind her; Nightlife that is fun and fun. (In the silent version, this happened in the late part of the movie after her marriage) where Lucienne was crushed in low-level living and depressed by the husband's comedy show. She decided that she couldn't go. With her current existence; And especially the last scene in the projection room where she saw the screen testing her walkie-talkie Louis Brooks may never look more beautiful than she did here with the projector beam projected on her alabaster history. Her shoulders swathed her white fur, her face sweltering under the helmet. Black hair The double image of her beautiful corpse and her still-life image on the screen is particularly important: the image of Louise Brooks, like Lucienne, remains immortal even though she has been dismissed for a film career.
