Holes is a great movie. I love it a lot and it's one of my favorite movies. Is one of the few movies produced by Disney that is not wonderful In general, Hole is a great movie. I hope Disney will create more images. Hole is a rare breed of wonderful Disney flicker. Don't misunderstand. I don't mean Disney's bad mouth. But for the most part, it is intended for children and that is ok. Children should be entertained as well. But Disney is guilty of trying to attract young audiences and they often fail. But not with holes Is a type of movie that everyone of all ages can watch and enjoy, and never thinks that it will be repeated They can connect. <br /> <br /> The channel serves as a good mix of family entertainment. Not too wonderful and living on the edge a little. I hope Disney will have more risks and make the flicks more like this.
