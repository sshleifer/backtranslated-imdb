Robert De Niro, Cuban Gooding Jr., Hall Holbrook and the rest of the actors and actors in the "Men of Honor" gathered to create a good movie. Mark Isham Write this film to let you know that the music is really good as well. <br /> <br /> But: After noticing a fool, the vulnerability and pulling an amazing heart from the beginning. Must make a vow to ignore them and sit down to enjoy the movie If you can do that, it is good. _Really_is_ <br /> <br /> The story of Carl Brashear, the true hero in life, has inspired enough to stay alive. Looking up on the internet ... The whole story is more dramatic than this film, as the director admits in his opinion. There are only three African-American divers in World War II. However, not reaching the status of US Master Navy Diver, Carl Brashear was the first African-American Navy diver. And he is the first diver to be certified or endorsed as a US Navy diver (Rumble applause) <br /> <br /> On the negative side of the movie ledger: Should I tell you about one "vulnerability"? Yes, I will mark this comment as having a "spoiler" and doing so ... a pivotal early scene in which the helicopter crashed a radio pole and sank into the sea: they never had time to dress up Full Diver Mark V, although he is the master of Master Billy Sunday at the time, will be just "... a couple of minutes ago" help the pilot <br /> <br /> So for the vulnerability and my fault Insulting the "Men of Honor" from perfection until 7 <br /> <br /> Hollywood Ever will know that the truth that is not broadcast is better than approaching the drama? I doubt it. Very bad!
