Just watched this thing after my mother brought it back from America for me being scared of seeing negative comments after all here. But I must say yes, the performance is wonderful, some laughable results pretty good I like this model more than the Spielberg model that I saw last week. <br /> <br /> I read many books and found myself being "Ah, yes, yes. That's in the book." Almost always. Other versions have almost no books. <br /> <br /> Well done, at least trying to make a real version.
