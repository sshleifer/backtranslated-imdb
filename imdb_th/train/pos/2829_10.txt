Private Lessons II is the greatest movie I've ever seen. Imported from Japan (bad) translated into English, it is a pleasure to see Rarely But not important It is the biggest joke that has never been funny before. <br /> <br /> The film is rare and not working with videos. But I caught it a few times A copy of my tape has been viewed dozens of times, as I gradually introduced this film to the world one by one. <br /> <br /> Joanna Pacula plays as a tutor / lover of Ken Hero (Obviously she is working for her check) Ken played by Goro Inagaki from the Japanese pop band SMAP, which gave him everything and had excellent hair throughout the story. Stacy Edwards, from the famous "In the Company of Men", appeared in the movie and may have enjoyed the experience of other film work. <br /> <br /> It takes at least three times. In the search for a plot, you can enjoy elements such as unusual vases that Ken has in his house (at least 50) or Ken wears a shirt with corn-embroidered stitches at the end of the movie /> <br /> Film predictable But can find high My friends and I repeat the whole scene. Yes, it looks like we are losers and we are ... but we are the losers who have seen. "The second private lesson" is one of the ten people in the world who have watched this movie. You will thank me for it
