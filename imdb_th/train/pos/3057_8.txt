Wow, I really like this movie. William H. Macy is great as a quiet Alex killer. <br /> <br /> All the performances here are really good. Alex is married to a man. young (Like his father) and a young son are going through a middle-aged crisis and want to leave the family business, so he goes to the psychiatrist for help Sarah will be the soul of those he loves. One day, Alex didn't know what to do when he got a job to kill someone he knew. <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch if you like movies that are interesting for adults. <br /> <br 8 stars = very good
