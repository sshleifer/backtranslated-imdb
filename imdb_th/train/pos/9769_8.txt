I enjoy it. In general, I'm not a fan of comedians and comedians, but I like Whoopi. I'm also part of Sci / Fi Fantasy and the dinosaurs are crazy. I read for pleasure. But when I feel really stressed or worried, I watch TV and movies to escape. Theodore Rex enabled me to do that. That makes it successful in my eyes! I didn't even walk out to do other things while it was running. Regardless of whether it is rated "good" or not, it is not important to me. And not me, not children and youth Or I am a mentally retarded person
