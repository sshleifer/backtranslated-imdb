Re: Jury Pro <br /> <br /> Although the leading actors are beautiful. But it is less likely to be accepted because of too many interesting details to confront the audience during the story unfolding. <br /> <br /> One may believe that middle-aged schoolgirls in the year 1950 gave them innocence without thinking of marrying a 30 year old that they just knew. But I doubt it. <br /> <br /> "Easy to keep away from purity"? What is the real note about this movie? <br /> <br /> One may believe that middle school teens have high self-confidence and self-confidence when they interact with seniors in complex social situations. But my experience is usually more than teenagers Feeling very uncomfortable and clumsy while they were experimenting in the adult world. <br /> <br /> You just can't see the world apart from your own eyes? That is sad fake But I don't think <br /> <br /> and comments "Expert" is no longer drawn from the experience. <br /> <br /> One may believe that the 30-year-old problem-maker can come in and go inside the public school hall during school as a society and create problems But I think the school society Is a protected environment and parents, chaparones and school officials are around to prevent this. <br /> <br /> Now it's a good sport and let us know what you can get. Get from the institution <br /> <br /> One of the final finals all along. Hey Hey Babu Riba, five teen friends call themselves four people. There may be an explanation of why the five of them were four. But because it has never been detailed, each reference is diverted from each scene. <br /> <br /> The course may be an explanation. Good work, figure it out! Now I will be generous and will help you out of your mistakes: although it is translated as "four people" in general, the word "ƒçETVORKA" means sports anymore: it is a long-term sport. 5 people: 4 ROWERS and COXSWAIN <br /> <br /> This film doesn't ring for me. <br /> <br /> We should get attention from your friends' talents and praise.
