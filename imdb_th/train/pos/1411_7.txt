Hello again from the darkness Breathtaking photography highlighting this Disney documentary and seeing the wildness of animals living in the wilderness. For everyone who is over 40 years old, Disney and Omaha's Wild Wild Mutual gave a lot of knowledge about wildlife since our childhood ... back when there was no channel for National Geographic or Nature or Animal Planet The always impressive thing is the difficulty of the situation for these majestic creatures. Watching elephants for many days, almost raving from lack of oil, was so painful. But the night fight with the lion is exciting. <br /> <br /> Some underwater images don't have breath. The mother and humpback are beautiful and watch the great white shark attack. Every victim feels chills like "jaws". The most amazing scenery for me is the beautiful view of the Himalayas. I have never seen details about the vastness of this period. <br /> <br /> Don't think that most children today are too excited about this. But of course it is one of the most beautiful photographic documentaries ever seen
