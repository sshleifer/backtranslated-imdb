I accidentally carried this name to the edition of Grindhouse, a collection of 1 Euro 1 garbage collection, but this film has a good approval stamp and should be transferred better than what is outside. Surprisingly, it's not ... Satisfying it! Watching this movie, I can't help but wonder ... why Sergio Martino doesn't flick this? This is his signature all over and is replaced by Edwedge Fenech (not as well known as she should be But she got a good cameo in Hostel II), doubles and three crosses under and cemented the film from start to finish. Lee Van Cleef oozing the cold under pressure from the 1st second. Finally he or the studio system, let this guy miss? In addition to Lee's more well-known films, movie viewers should try this to see the size and see how Sergio Leone will reduce his epic size once upon a time in America half the time. This is what it becomes like. For freshness, it should be in the middle of the day at home and make it a sofa bed.
