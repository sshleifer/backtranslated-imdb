In fact, they were unable to choose a better variety of actors to portray Little Richard than Leon. He gathered Little Richard to be the most reliable core. A wonderful set and those who watch this movie will put a smile on their faces through all the movies. Although this movie is a bit long But it makes you interested in the personality and set of Little Richard in mind. The ending should bring the direction of Richard's little move to the present where you can see him as he grows into this new millennium. He will always be the King of Rock-N-Roll. I'm worried about what other media will say.
