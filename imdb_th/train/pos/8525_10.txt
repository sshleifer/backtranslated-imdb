In scoring this movie, you have to think about the type that should be: For children, they have additional guidelines that must be followed to make this film. (This means that it cannot escape with humor and / or language from day 1). Doing everything in this movie is fun and fun to watch. The sequel often makes me nervous. But this one is quite good for myself Knowing that it doesn't have Fraser's star power as George, they take advantage of humor and I believe Showeman did well as a leader. The plot is easy to follow and there may be times that are suitable for younger audiences if you want to watch movies and hope to receive awards for honors education. This is not it. But if you want to watch movies that are simple, fun and full of energy You will be a good choice with this one.
