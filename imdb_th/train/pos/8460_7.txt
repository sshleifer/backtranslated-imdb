Gundam Wing is a fun show. I thank you for bringing me into the Gundam and anime in general. However, after watching previous versions such as Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam and even G Gundam, I found that Wing was a Gundam Lite character. <br /> <br /> Character: The aspect that Gundam held for a long time was Have a character Stab into difficulty and grow into an adult This did not happen in Wing Heero as the top dog, and he was the ultimate dog at the end. Personality does not change, growth has never been successful. The best character is Zechs who has a purpose and is a hero in every part of the series. But suddenly the series betrayed him and transformed him into a criminal without reason. <br /> <br /> Mecha: Wing has a great suit design. The Gundams are great, with Epyon's favorite. me I also consider designing a few OZ suits to match the classic Zeon suit, but the design of the sweet suit does not help protect the series from boring characters. <br /> <br /> Chapter Conclusion: Finally, Wing has an excellent fighting scene, even though it is full of reusable animations that are fun, but not moving like the previous Gundam outing.
