One of the best comedy series ever made in England, Mark Gatiss, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton are great actors and actors who watch this drama like home with comedians Talented support by Jeremy Dyson, their writing partner. They created the series with the most memorable characters of the past year. Little Britain became a meaningless thing like imitating their ideas. It is a consistent and unconventional manuscript. I am sure there are many people who hate these series that love them. But I'm also confident that no one will have comments about LOG. I haven't watched a long feature film. But I've heard good things and bad things, so I will book a decision on the original radio series at LOG. I don't know if the TV series was made for America. But I would be amazed to see that the American audience found the strange English of humor.
