While I have a great respect for Disney animated movies But they haven't got what I would call "must see". Atlantis looks interesting from the first movie posters and trailers and thank you for following my expectations. <br /> <br /> Atlantis is a Disney movie that "Be more mature" in the sense that it lacks music Disney movies, of course) and focus on action and discovery rather than other recent Disney proposals. The world of Atlantis hides under the core of the world. It is amazingly presented as a desolate cave. The ruins then gradually evolved into an actual ecosystem, while often reminding some memories of the presentation of the landscape and environment of Atlantis. Simple, no joyful songs make the kingdom look more beautiful and interesting. The combination of Atlantean language and the effort to connect it to the myths of ancient civilizations in real life has been added and works well. /> <br /> There are also some scenes related to moles. Practical jokes do not seem to have "kids" elements that I often associate with Disney movies. But the main element is the struggle to get to Atlantis and the ongoing discovery that took place in Atlantis, while Milo, an outsider, can learn what he wants to know about the place by helping Let the surveyors discover the various parts. They don't know about Part of this story involves "armor", which is used in the action-filled climax, which is because there is no better word to say. <br /> <br /> It's not the whole story. Make it full The feeling and the film do not have a new visual effect from the computer. But apart from the Toy Story movie, this is the most entertaining Disney movie I've seen for many years.
