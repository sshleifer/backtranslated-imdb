I won't lie. This is a great movie. I saw it about 4 months ago at the local theater. I saw it a second time and I was quite bored in the slow scene. Sid (the sluggish person) was not a cringe but Diego (the mountain lion I thought) was great in the movie The animation was outstanding and the story ended up impressive. It is worthwhile to bring a child up to 10 years old, but teenagers may find it a little boring. In addition, the character's identity is also interesting. As I said, it's a good movie. But I will rate "Toy Story 2" or "Shrek" more than 8/10
