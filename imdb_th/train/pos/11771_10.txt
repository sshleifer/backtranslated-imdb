Great entertainment from beginning to end Great performances by Belushi, Beach, Dalton & Railsback. Some scenes are twisted and many action scenes. This film was created for me! Funny lines in the screenplay, good songs Dalton is a strong sheriff and Railsback named "Redneck-Villain". I have to introduce this movie to all the action adventure fans! 10/10
