What we get here is the situation. Men were found to be suffering and people wanted to help him - in the opposite way. At the end, they were forced to let it go. You can't fix people. And though in various aspects, reigning over me is Hollywood But that's not the message. <br /> <br /> This story is not about Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler), a man who lost his wife and three daughters on 9/11. PTSS, since it's about what Charlie did with Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), a dentist in New York who is his roommate in the dentist school and knows about his tragedy. Look at him on the road and connect. Renew Charlie is riding a motorcycle, a scooter, a small toy, which is a surprise for negotiating traffic in Manhattan with large headphones on a cluttered hair. I was the leader of Sandler's pole to show that he's crazy. And the use of music as an escape would have to go home to the subway riders who carry all iPod weapons. <br /> <br /> Charlie is a disaster. But Alan conflicts with Jada Pinkett Smith and soon becomes jealous of him. Charlie lives like a teenage teenager with a large trust fund. (The insurance money from the tragedy) and began to drag Alan away. "Go on a trip," eat Chinese food ", buy, record or watch the Mel Brooks marathon at home. Charlie lives in a large apartment that is protected by the landowner on an average. Repeat the kitchen. Repeatedly collecting the old vinyl of Springsteen, The Who and others and playing a video game called Shadow of the Collosus on the giant screen. The living room <br /> <br /> Charlie's husband is deeply concerned. About him Alan has a new patient who offers him. Charlie's desperation makes us see Alan. Trying to help Charlie allow Alan to escape from his own reality. But in part, he realizes them seriously. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Sandler create a strange pair, but that's not important because of it. Believe that they may need each other Charlie has a desire to be a friend of a friend who has never known his family because of fleeing from the loss. He pretends that he never has anyone. Then, then Charlie in the sleeping room then slept and walked and had a very bad musical taste. (No motor vehicles)? Alan wants to escape from his orderly life. He was under the thumb not only But his wife But as his dental partner, who is the guardian of him, even though he sets the guidelines They are white people and he is a black person. <br /> <br /> There is also a crazy patient from hell who seriously imposes things at the dental office. But began to look different when Charlie came in and noticed that she was the first child. His libido seemed to be lurking, ready to be resurrected at any time. He was also attracted to Liv Tyler's chest, a psychotherapist in the same building as the dentist who started trying to cure Charlie when he admitted that he might need help. <br /> <br /> Sandler's crazy scene is the script. Too little drama (In fact, this movie feels like playing more than one point), but he has only one person he expresses sadness in a deeply touching way. <br /> <br /> Charlie's is not only psychedelic. And sad But dangerous and violent, and all these attempts to help him start back This film is admirable in a way that expresses the feeling that people cannot do the right thing. This is an interesting movie - sometimes an impressive story - and for the first time in 9/11, it was handled in terms of survivors of suffering. But with elements of humorous humor that once seemed to be too crowded, many people were too attracted to it, and the grand interior of Hollywood was horribly decorated. There are only roads in Manhattan that look realistic. There are scenes in the courtroom that are disgusting and Donald Sutherland is a judge that is too good to be true. Alan's family problem is easily resolved with a phone call. And this is worthwhile to watch the show - the control and cleverness of Cheadle and Sandler in a role that is almost as good as he had in Anderson's Punch Punch Drugs Love in 2002, though Really better movie
