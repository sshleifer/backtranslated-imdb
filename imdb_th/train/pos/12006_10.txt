An incredible movie and the most uplifting spirit about the restoration of the gospel. Better than other movies or movies that are about revival now. If you haven't seen it yet, jump on the plane to Salt Lake and watch it. You won't regret it! He fully understood what the first Saints had faced by putting in complete and complete faith in Joseph Smith the Prophet. Finally, you will understand what the prophets have to fight and the oppression that he and his people face. If you have any questions about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and our humble beginnings, just watch this movie.
