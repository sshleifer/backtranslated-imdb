For my humanities project for schools, I chose to trade human beings. After researching on the internet, I found this DVD and ordered it. I just finished watching it and I still think. All I can say is "Wow". It is a fascinating story of a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patrick who tries to help her. The ending makes you breathless and even though it's not a happy ending. But it is very true It's great and I recommend it to everyone! You connect with Holly and Patrick and your heart crashes because of what happened to her. I love it a lot and now I want to know what will happen next!
