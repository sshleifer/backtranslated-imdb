If you appreciate the characters and dialogues and feelings of American culture history, you will find many interesting content in this film. It may be a drama and that's why the conversation is heavy. But I can't stress enough that these icons that we only have superficial understanding are made into really complex and wonderful characters. <br /> <br /> This movie is better than any college program Tell you how to create a story driven by characters. <br /> <br />
