"That '70s Show" is the most fun program on TV. I started watching it two and a half years ago, and as soon as I saw it, I could tell that it was a great performance. I like all the characters But my personal favorites are Fez and Kelso. Leo is a great character while he is there. I hope he comes back because he is hilarious. It's classic when Fez goes. "You are a puppy!" And when Kelso yelled "Burn!" They are both great characters and often have jokes to say. Jackie is hot, just another reason to watch the show. She started to look very good, but somewhere in the 5-6 season she was really hot. I've seen most episodes more than once. Some people like 10 times and still have hilarious. This is one of the few items that I can watch over and over again and still laugh as much as I do the first time I see it. Classic actor Almost everyone is funny with a lot of performances, with only a few funny characters. I will regret seeing the performance ending next year. But it will go out into the air as one of the best items ever
