Many years ago I saw this. But remember and want to see it again. It became a "therapy" for me with my own personal experience. <br /> <br /> The thirty-five year old Y. Y. in the baseball game of high school he "missed. The ball "and his team loses. He thinks about this in the next 20 years." If only I would hit the ball "and his life would improve because of it. Then he was given the opportunity to discover .... and get a little more than he bargained. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of when I was in high school. I tried our second time. Rehearsing / dancing and not doing This team is the closest thing to the club in my school. If you are in there, you are "everything". I didn't try until the last two years of HS and after the second time I was really difficult. I hit and bruised my legs badly before trying and wearing stockings to cover the bruising and that made me not do that. In 1987, <br /> <br /> Over the years, even when This sometimes I think "If I just didn't hit my legs, I would never put those stupid stockings." Now I don't sit and think that my life will be better or different. I do it. But watching this movie made me realize that we never really knew what things might change from the past in the past. Who knew that it could change the path of the event to the point that I didn't find my father? My son <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie to everyone who has a time in the past that they want. They can change Be careful what you wish!!!
