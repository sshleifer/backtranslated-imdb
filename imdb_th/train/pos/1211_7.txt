I grew up with this movie and I remember when my brother and I had played in the backyard and pretended that we were in Care-a-lot. After many years, I went to watch movies with my daughter and watched her fun. with it If you are a parent and you haven't watched this movie with your child, you should capture them in your arms. Songs, especially "Forever Young", are very sweet and memorable. Parents, I would recommend this movie for every child so they can learn how to care for fun for others! When talking about all the garbage on the TV, you can raise your child to have the correct idea about life with movies like this.
