Recently, I watched the movie '54 with Judy, and while I admired the story and music, I found that the film didn't receive attention. I expect the remake '76 to be the same, except by twisting with Barbra. I am very surprised - it looks more realistic and modern with the reputation, money, love and the price of it all. This version is more realistic than '54, either with better music, better performances, more interesting plot, and of course, more deep love. I do not understand why the previous movie was on the list of the top 100 American Film Institute, while this remarkable remake was unable to create a list of critics.
