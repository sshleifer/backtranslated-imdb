Along with Fernando Fragata, João Mário Grilo, Abi Feijó, Leonel Vieira, ... "O Lampião da Estrela" is his first film (Diamantino Costa) before he created many successful ads. This name is starring one of the best Portuguese comedians of all time. Herman José and José Pedro Gomes are great. It's a very funny movie !! (28/07/2000) <br /> <br /> BOA SORTE DIAMANTINO ...
