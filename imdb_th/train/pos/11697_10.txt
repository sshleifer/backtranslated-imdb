This film is really eye-opening. I've watched this movie many times The first time when I was four years old and I actually remembered, and when I was 12, all the messages that the director was transmitting was to let everyone wake up and not make mistakes in leaving our daily lives. Increased miles to insult him. <br /> <br /> Great movie for unbelievers and believers!
