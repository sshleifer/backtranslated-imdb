10/10 for this movie <br /> <br /> I am an Indian doctor in England. The words Beckham drove me out. 'Because I am a true Liverpool fan and think that Owen is really cool because Liverpool and Man Utd are competitors, so I die. Delhi to meet some friends and I had a morning flight so I thought "Hey, well, when watching this movie", 'because it's a late night show <br /> <br /> What is it? I should watch this movie on the day it rubbed. Released I guess using Beckham's name is attracting the attention of the audience. (Which was fired in my case !!!) But then I couldn't think of a better name for the movie. <br /> <br /> Nagra and Knightley (gracefully dead) and Rhys-Myers <br /> <br /> If you hate football, don't like Manchester United. (Or English on that matter) This is the movie that's right for you In fact, I was only 29 years old. A psychiatrist by profession. But a child with a heart This film has knocked out "Star Wars" from my 1st position. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, there is not much comment on this film by Indian English like me. I wonder why <br /> <br /> 10/10 for this movie
