Sensitive movies lack a certain level of ability and structure. But there was a great filming and acting However, the storytelling structure is controversial. While it gives the feeling of tying loose ends well in the final scene and linking ideas and things that may be described by modern audiences as "stories". I wonder if feelings * need * a "story structures "Clear and detectable Inevitably, it will be compared with SOMERSAULT, the main sponsor. (I'm not sure that this is the right word!) Is a young woman who looks very young, who finds new sexuality, confusing and empowering her - although, of course, Cate Shortland's films deal with this matter better. But while there is a possibility for an audience that is not interested in rejecting this film as a clich√©, PEACHES is more ambitious than SOMERSAULT. Maybe that's something that didn't happen. It's very different with Monahan's first feature - an interview! I'm not sure how the sex scenes between Weaving and Lung will add to the story. Who knows - maybe they will Of course, they are packed with the nature of the characters of Weaving - even though I think this is done without the need to use these scenes. <br /> <br /> ***** Just see the characters again. ****** Times *** <br /> <br /> In the second visit, I can see that some people will cancel it in the form of telemovie, but I'm not sure these 'categories'. What's the difference anymore or even if we should make that difference? In any case, I think there are enough layers in the film to distinguish Hallmark's efforts. In contrast, the structure of the movie is very formal and its content is difficult to challenge, at least in the way that SOMERSAULT, TOM WHITE, DOLLARS three people, family doctor who looks bad, both physically and mentally All performances are good. But I realized that the main reason I enjoy this movie is because it is suitable for the "Australia" category without needing to add anything ... and I can understand that it's quite good. Reasons others don't like Actually, it wasn't until Uncle entered the room in her Vietnamese dress that the film started to punch. But that leads us to debate again - should we expect movies to challenge us all the time? Of course I enjoy being challenged by movies. (Or books or others) but there is no longer room for a good story. <br /> <br /> I didn't delete my initial post in this story. The movie, because I am all well aware of such actions of Orwell But I will lower my first rank from 8 to 6.5. <br /> <br /> For the nomination for AFI Best Film, my vote goes to TOUCH HUMAN TOUCH three dollars and see both ways - and I think LOOK both ways should win
