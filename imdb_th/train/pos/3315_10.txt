Bette Midler showcased her talents and beauty in "Las Vegas Diva". I am thrilled that I taped and I can watch whenever I want. She has qualities that will make the audience incarcerated. Her voice is beautiful and really impressed you. The highlight of the show is singing "Stay With Me" from her "Rose" movie in 1979. You can feel the emotions in the song and end up with a goose bump. The list will give you the desire to go out and rent a movie, Bette Midler or go to the nearest music store and buy Bette Midler's album.
