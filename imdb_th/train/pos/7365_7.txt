I found it very impressive because Spike and Heatton were together all the way through this film, not saying that there would be some betrayal. I think the chase is left. The relationship between the two is ahead of me. I guess there are gay intentions in the Heaton section. My favorite scene must be a bit at Heaton and Spike is stuck in the depression and Spike runs out. I always think that Spike doesn't come back. I have to say that if not because the instructor. Our movies make us look at this thing. I probably never saw it before. Overall, I think this movie is quite good and I would like to recommend to everyone who is a favorite British movie fan.
