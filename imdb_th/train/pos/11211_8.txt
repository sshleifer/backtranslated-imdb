I enjoy the innocence of this movie and the characters have to deal with the truth of having powerful animals among them. The gorilla looks great and the eyes are especially realistic. Sometimes it is a little scary and should let the children scare slightly without going up. Rene Russo plays a very wonderful woman. Usually this type of Hollywood movie that happened in the past will feel the need to create a straw villain. But the only enemy is the gorilla It is interesting that how many animals are close to humans. They feel the same emotions as we do and how we cannot treat them like others. There are a few movies that come in. This land and it is worthwhile to see if you want to consider the similarities between humans and animals or not.
