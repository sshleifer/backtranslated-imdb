I was intrigued by this series since when Tom Long went into filming - the 'bad boy' thing. It's all addiction. <br /> <br /> What was the story that you were addicted to? Next up - Joey will finally pick up the girl after 5 years of prison and all the time thinking of his lost love across the path with her again. Found that he has a son ... even though he is a bad person But you still need him To find happiness, <br /> <br /> Two really cute gangster - please bring it out in the video!
