I watched them all. <br /> <br /> It's not better than the amazing stuff (_ Strictly Ballroom_, _ We dance _ _ (Japanese version) but it's respectable and different. In each section, <br /> <br /> I am an English teacher and I find that there is no knowledge of the language. In some of these criticisms, it is quite annoying. For example: "The name should be screaming. "How did you move?" When will you move the movie name? "<br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with the English grammar of the Caribbean. It's not a standard English grammar of Canada. Up to me, I put a subtitle because I am a standard English Canadian. So I assumed that I would have trouble understanding all automatically. It wasn't that difficult and gave a distinctly different flavor when the other stage movies I had seen were American. <br /> <br / > I like this movie that is located in Toronto and in fact, I hope this movie will be more clear. The love that the heroine has been cast handsomely I enjoy doing the steps. I like the character Mum that is driven. I feel that many problems in the movie have been resolved more thoroughly than the appearance of the dance film. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you tend to like to watch a dance movie If you have a superior problem about the grammar of the English language standard that you grow up, your narrow mind may have trouble enjoying this movie.
