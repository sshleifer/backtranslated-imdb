Despite the title of The Sword Bearer and the DVD cover (action / successor of The Sword Bearer), this is not a superhero movie. <br /> <br /> (A little spoiler) according to Sasha's story, The Sword Bearer, who is cursed with a retractable sword on his arm, is cool. You say, but not. This is real life. If you have this power as a child, you can control when speaking by facing the madman or when your mother's girlfriend is hitting her. And if you don't control it, how do you deal with being a killer twice at the age of 12. <br /> <br /> This is where Sasha is when we meet him. Lost aimlessly after the next murder (like A Bout de Souffl√©), then he met Katya and the couple fell in love immediately, causing Sasha to have a real reason for living and trying to change his way of life However, his past continues to chase him in the form of two police officers. <br /> <br /> That's important and there's almost no action on the screen, even though there are many suggestions. <br /> <br /> I like this movie a lot. Unlike Hollywood's 'super hero' film, we get very little past stories, no one is bad. (Unless you count the Sword Bearer yourself) next to the heart and development of a good character <br /> <br /> should check that you can find it
