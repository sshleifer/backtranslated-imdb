The planning process is quite boring. But when they reached the desert, it was fun to watch The reason I call it the most realistic reality show is because Charlie dropped out of the competition quite quickly. When his hand hurts, I expect normal stress to fix wonders. But actually he left the competition The most worrying moment of acting must be when Max is stuck in the desert with almost no water or food! The ending was great and I was very happy to see at least one team doing it. Overall, it's not as big as the Long Way Round, but it's definitely an interesting watch because it's the world's most challenging game
