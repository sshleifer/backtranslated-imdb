This game is a bomb game and this is the 007 game of the year and probably the best game when I got Agent Under Fire. I think it's a good game, but Nightfire is back and it's better. But now there is a new James Bond game. This is a 3rd person shooter and has more than 12 missions. Graphics of the game are out of the house. It also has all the great actors and actors in this game, such as Pierce Bronsan being James Bond again. William Dafoe is a villain Nikolai Diavolo and Judi Dench is M (forgive me all if I'm misspelled). Yourself as the greatest James Bond game. <br /> <br /> I gave this game to 10/10.
