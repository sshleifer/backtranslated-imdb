This movie rate is one of the top 10 movies I like forever. Many people see it for the first time and know very little about the theme in the movie. May not understand why I found it so enamored that I will try to explain ... <br /> <br /> This movie is Very rich in historical details and cultural insights and while it has a little unusual, they will be completely forgotten. This story tells the famous battle between Benkei monk and Prince Yoshitsune on the Gojo bridge. During the battle, according to legendary Yoshitsune, the best of Benke and the monk became loyal to the prince. This film is a revision of the story and involves wars, gloomy prophecies and political planning. <br /> <br /> One of the main points in this film is "Mappo", which is the prophecy of the Buddha. After 1000 His teaching years will fail and the world will fall into chaos. Believed in Heian, Japan after the eruption of Mount Fuji and the civil war between Taira (Heike) and Minamoto (Genji) that the world will fall into anarchy and everything will collapse. It's the time of the devil. <br /> <br /> Next, you have the way in which the movie will fix Yoshitsune's sword training by Tenku (Raven Goblins) of Karuma. The defeated group often flee into the mountains. And disguised as a demon to scare villagers This is the source of tribal tribes in the past. The description of Yoshitsune in Gojo supports all of this. <br /> <br /> Then there was Benke and various species of Buddhism that appeared, including the mysterious Buddhism of the Shin Kong sect. All of these are accurately explained and to add a little extra. The film manages to convey the power of meditation and Ki energy in a way that makes it part of the story, that is, use the magic of magic to add dimension. Special for movies, but done in a way that will make it tactical and scary. <br /> <br /> Everything in it is filled with interesting tips. And the real surprise ring for life over time Scenery and costing cannot be canceled and very complete. Great soundtrack, thoughtful and ominous. I still think that the actual performance is surprisingly good. Benke is a great anti-war hero. Shanao (Yoshisune) is a picture of a young man who is testing his limits and is increasingly drunk with his own power. The lesser of the comments, the cringe of the killer who thought of himself as a social gambler, <br /> <br /> In the plot story, to see why it's so good, I suggest you dig. Old books in Japanese history and see This storytelling changed the story of Robin Hood and John Little John, almost as if it were a pathetic story of violence and karma of hell.
