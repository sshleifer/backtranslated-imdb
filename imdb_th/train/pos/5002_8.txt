I am honored to see some examples from Aardman's original performance in this program in the United Kingdom. It's always fun and funny. There is no charm lost in translation - it's fresh like the interviewer - whether it's a partial script or not, as rumored by the side. It's always entertaining. <br /> <br /> Animation Aardman shows the wonderful imagination of the characters used for each sound in the only aspect that I might love the most about the show and its concept. (Enemies between the pandas of the needle, ape, painting) The animal identification also grows, such as horses and teen donkeys from Maryland. Most of all married couples. (Parrots, insects and cats to name a few) and the voiced child character and I really come digging ferret! Finally, Monday became the day to look forward.
