One gets a clear example of personal media as a formidable force for deception and propaganda. We see poor people in Caracas fighting the harsh reality of "American politics". Who can get a clear sense of punishment if people fail to deal with the obvious dictatorship which is immediate and illegal, pushing them by the conspirators. In addition, we see the pride and fascism of the CIA that has supported private media, Plutacus and the conspiracy generals to bring Venezuela back under Washington's rule.
