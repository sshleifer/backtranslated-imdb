Mary Pickford ("Born on the Fourth of July" while Angela Moore) is "The Little American" (from French heritage); She fell in love with Jack Holt (as Karl Von Austreim), who moved to America with a German father and an American mother, French-American Raymond Hutton. (Counting Jules de Destin's "Fighting Destins") Falling in love with Piccie The love that has three triangles eventually ends in France with the Great War. (The First World War in understanding the back problems) makes their lives more complicated. <br /> <br /> The movies that are mostly fun if the movies are flawed. The torpedo shooting and the sinking of the ship that carried Picford was like a Titanic. The intrigue occurred when Picford became a French spy, while the Germans occupied her ancestral home. Of course, Holt, a German couple has arrived. It is hard to believe that they took a long time to memorize each other as he moved in to rape, but it was dark, and before this there was an event that they believed was dead This film has a high probability of its symbol. Pickford used to be a Canadian - although there are few who deny that she is not "Little American" for all intentions and purposes. <br /> <br /> The fun to see "The Special", which later became a major star, includes Wallace Beery, Colleen Moore and Ramon Novarro - especially watching Mr. Novarro. With a quality "star" during one of the more memorable scenes of the film: Pickford and the wounded soldiers greet each other while he was taken to the cradle. Novarro also made Mary Pickford write a letter to him. Obviously he has pictures in the future. The future is Ben Alexander, who plays the boy "Bobby"; He became a reliable child actor and grew up as a partner for Jack Webb's "Dragnet". <br /> <br /> ******* The Little American (7/12/17) Cecil B. DeMille ~ Mary Pickford, Jack Holt, Raymond Hatton
