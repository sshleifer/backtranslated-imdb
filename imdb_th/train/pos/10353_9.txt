This app has a spoiler for those who do not know the details of the true story that this movie is based. <br /> <br /> The right to be presumed "Pure until proven guilty" is the basic right of everyone in a civilized society, but according to the Fred Schepisi's followers, but the tragic story of Australia's famous murder trial is not allowed. Let Lindy Chamberlain be accused of killing her child The story that tells of her innocence is unlikely. (There have been allegations that Dingko has taken it) but those things indicate her guilt more than that, and there is no clear evidence for her. But the Australian people were stuck with her guilt and the creepy religious servants appeared creepy when they appeared in the media. (And of course the media itself is But naive in this process), so even if it is cleared by preliminary investigation But they were prosecuted and later convicted Although Wang eventually was released But this is very shameful after discovering new evidence "proving" their innocence. What the defendant should not do is 'Cry in the Dark' <br /> <br /> 'A Cry in the Dark' by Meryl Streep, an Australian accent speaker (At least with this ear) and let Lindy sympathize (with us) while still conveying how she can be a national hatred. The scene in which she was imprisoned was easy. Unfortunately, because we believe in the characters as well. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the authenticity of this story. (What I can't comment on) The broader theme of this film will be horribly real for everyone who has knowledge through popular British media and It is a ruthless habit of attracting directly to the reader's least charitable instinct. There is no perfect legal system. But the current cry for the refugees in the British tabloid today is from the pit of evil that is like the sound that makes Lindy Chamberlain disappear. I'm not a religious person. But the Bible still has some killer lines. (If you excuse Pun) "Judge, don't be afraid that you must be judged."
