The very strange setting of Wagner's last opera has definitely grown up with me. When I first saw, I was quite annoyed with many surreal images and felt that the story was too much to be true. However, if you can deal with the "trick" in a fairly fair amount, I think you will find that this film can handle the strange and fascinating atmosphere of the opera and have a special time. <br /> <br /> Personally, I never understood the role of Kundry until I saw how Edith Clever portrayed her. Her performance (The applause that evoked Yvonne Minton's voice) was nothing dazzling from the beginning to the end and the only one showing the time spent absorbing the film. <br /> <br /> Another reason The joy in this film is that it captures the beautiful interpretation of Robert Lloyd in the important role of Gurnemanz, which Lloyd has shown to the opera theater around the world I was privileged to enjoy him in the role of Gurnemanz on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera many times, and the generosity of his voice and the warmth, the fatherhood of this noble character's interpretation needed to be Been preserved like him. The efficiency of the two main collection of characters, the Karfreitag scene and the storytelling of the prophecy in Act 1 <br /> <br /> The version I saw was a videotape made in America and has a narrative that alas Can't do too This is especially unfortunate because the translation used is not very accurate and forced to have a lot of Christian interpretations in the movie which forced the interpretation of the layer on the opera anyway. This story seems to me to be contrary to both Wagner's clear Christianity and his deliberate attempts to "conclude" the Christian elements of this intent. (See footnotes with spoilers at the end of this review) I think it's almost impossible to watch movies with subtitles to not absorb them and strongly suggest that if on your DVDs Have the ability to change subtitles Off you do that But if the opera is not familiar to you, you must read the previous chapter carefully. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that there are a lot of movies that I don't like and will recently see different actions. .. but it has continued to increase in my assessment over the years since I saw it for the first time and I found myself wanting to enjoy it over and over again. <br /> <br /> __________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> FOOTNOTE There is a spoiler: A good example is Kundry's famous line. "I saw him ... He ... He ... and laughed." This thing has been translated in the narrative for reasons that prevented me from escaping. That "I saw the face of the Savior." It was especially annoying for me because throughout the song, Wagner deliberately and meant an invisible character that didn't have to be Jesus as "der Heiland" which was German for "Keeper" - a reference to the wounds of Amfortas and all wounds and ailments and the need for treatment
