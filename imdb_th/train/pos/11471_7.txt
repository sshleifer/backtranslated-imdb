I am a big fan of the cinema and watch this movie because I hear how interesting it is. I can tell that it's really interesting. The two leading actors are excellent. This film is not boring and the idea behind it. (Although inspired by the killing of Columbine and the film at the murderer's home) Really interesting. There are some weaknesses, such as the last 20 minutes that deviate from the realism seen in the first hour or so and the episode There is no reason at the end. Shaky camera sometimes can be a distraction. But in the verite cinema that has been received, but I still think that this movie did very well and director Beck Colechi deserves credit.
