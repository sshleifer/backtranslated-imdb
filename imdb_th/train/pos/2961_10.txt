This movie is David Zucker's only film that doesn't parody the first movie. The funniest movie of 98 with Night at the Roxbury in the back, but I don't think Theres about mary is a joke, so it doesn't count except the straightforward stories and nuts that he Don't listen to critics, especially Roger Ebert. He doesn't know of stable entertainment. Just watch his comments. However, you won't be disappointed.
