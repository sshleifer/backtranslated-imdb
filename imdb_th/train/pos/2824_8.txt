The opening of the American film of Greta Garbo is a comparison of how our lives can be eliminated by our destiny and actions, such as heavy rain, causing us to lose a part of ourselves all the way /> <br /> Greta Leonora's play, the poor farmer girl who falls in love with Ricardo Cortez's landlord Don Rafael Ricardo loves her too. But influenced by his overwhelming mother is too easy Leonora became a homeless and traveled to Paris where she became a famous opera singer and developed a reputation for being a loose woman. In fact, part of her attitude is the bitterness of Raphael's neglect. <br /> <br /> She came home to visit the family and eventually confront Rafael. Surprisingly, no one knew that she was a famous La Brunna and Garbo served her as a true singer and was rewarded with coolness in drawing later. <br /> <br /> In this part of Valentino, and he was cared for as Valentino clone by MGM, although he never thought he would be true and he was right. He believed in the sympathy of Mama's weak children and allowed himself to be realistic. But funny at the end of the movie He failed to defeat Leonora when she got home and after that, when he followed her, his courage was destroyed. <br /> <br /> The film was beautifully filmed with beautiful storm scenes and The scene in Spain at that time was genuine. In addition, there were also great performances of old timers Lucien Littlefield, Tully Marshall and Mack Swain, although the story of lost love and missed opportunities. But I do not think Leonora and Rafael will be happy together as he wants a more traditional wife and she is a very professional woman and I do not think to be happy in a small village. <br /> <br /> Look, now, when Garbo's first movie was released in American movies and was the leader of things to follow.
