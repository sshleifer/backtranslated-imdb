One of the most appealing elements of the movie Gilliam is a well-decorated picture, an unstable backdrop and a character that is irritated by humans as evidence of the creator's involvement. Instead of most movies (The filmmaker is the rental director who pays to the actor or two) You can feel the presence of Terry Gilliam through the experience of "12 Monkeys" as evidence of Giki's vision and style. When compared to creating unusual films for their own sake, "12 Monkeys" is a change in a similar theme of Gilliam's music: a society that is oppressed / retreating to the solitude of Each of the major frustration of not being believed. In this film, Gilliam has done an excellent job of blurring the lines between the two kingdoms by using ambiguity to force the audience to believe more than they know. The tendency that Gilliam would neglect to fill certain gaps led to criticisms of claims in the arts house. The difference between Gilliam and the art illustrator is that Gilliam's choices are clearly intended and all his images are meaningful. The nearly identical shower scene in Cole's first episode was intended to be a comparison, which made the audience feel insecure. His bald head is a symbol of consistency in the future of the disease. But also made him known in the world in 1996. The name is a symbol of Gilliam's creativity because it requires most of the story to understand its meaning. In summary, Gilliam's dedication to creating creative films that are interesting to watch also requires ideas and interpretations from the audience. This movie has a lot of repetitive viewing values ​​because there are details and recommendations that should not be missed when first viewing. Certainly one of my favorites
