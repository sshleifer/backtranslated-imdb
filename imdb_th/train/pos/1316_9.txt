I just finished watching this film, elaborate and beautifully displayed / directed. It tucked and tucked away whether I was wasting my time watching movies on the movie network for the rest of my life, because of the horrible distracting ads. Reading previous comments persuaded me to read. After the worst that could happen is that I might fall asleep in a boring ad. And why do I see it Mostly because when IMDB gave the movie "WEIGHTED AVERAGE" of 5.8 WHO'S STATISTICAL AVERAGE is 7.3, it must be popular. <br /> <br /> I am very pleased to spend the time watching this movie and all. Helen Hunt continues to amaze me with her ability to play a difficult role, adjusting her main character to suit each role. <br /> <br /> The paintings she painted in the movie This story of the police officer The strong When the scene calls for quick flair, having oral sex in time, she can stand to any actor's feet. Even though she was good at emotional response without having to say anything, only by facial expressions and body language. If there are no ads designed by killing any good movie continuation, this will be the nail to the actual seat. I give 9.0.
