It's a shame that because the title of this film is avoided by people who hate football. Bend like Beckham is more than a magic sport flick. The story is touching and clever, without being a clown. The comedian laughs out loud and the character acts well. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are great as teenagers. Jess and Jules make excellent performances both in And outside of the field, Anupam Kher is excellent as Jess's worrying father and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who is astonishing in the 'Ride with the Devil'. Meet and be a good person once using a beautiful Irish accent. Send him! Even if you don't like football, watch this movie. If there is anything, it will make you smile.
