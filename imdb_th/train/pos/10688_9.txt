I do not really know what to expect when going out to watch a movie, in addition to a little basic storyline that a lonely man ordered a Russian bride on the internet. It has Nicole Kidman in there. I absolutely like this movie and come out thinking 'Wow'. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the world. This movie moves along the way well. The relationship in this film is believed by Nicole and Chaplin to work together beautifully. The humor is subtle, with the 'Office' scenes that are great at the bank and the exciting elements add to the tension without being Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Combining this film is about With real people It's about courage and less delicate relationships. Best shooting ... <br /> <br /> (9/10)
