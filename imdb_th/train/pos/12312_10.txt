Unbelievable, movies that can create good works in 1987 and not known in the West Not to repeat other reviews here. Very good score and can move. Literally means "Arun, please don't come" - when it comes to beautiful ghosts and lovers will be separated forever After 24 years, Joel and Leslie still look good. I enjoy Joel in the God of Gamblers and Leslie's many movies, including Better Tomorrow.
