Comic 90's comedy genre, similar to the era "My family" Thatcher is the most funny part in the political circles. (Belinda Lang) blames Thatcher for doing everything "Bloody Thatcher" may share with most of us. David is a typical teenager, cutting his brain with a bread knife, Jenny, a teenager with an irritable mood, more interested in boys and boys. Bill and Ben worked as much as they could to make their families struggling in the midst of the economic conditions of the early 1990s. The first two series were not as successful as the latter, but the third series onwards was at it All kicks off with more laughter that I'm interested to count. Overall, this program doesn't get the best viewing time and they should be a bit more organized. Obviously they could not continue after Gary Olsen died, but I think they should get rid of "catherine Tate" "the office" "Little Britain" and bring the classics back!
