I agree that I only saw three Shakespeare plays (Romeo & Juliet, Macbeth, and of course Hamlet), one of my favorite stories and another story that I found ( Scotland) and Hamlet, I am happy to tell you that this adjustment is as good as the intense and amazing play. The performance is very strong. (With actors with Kenneth Branagh, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal, how do you lose) and change over time (It seems that between 17 and 1800) plays beautifully when the characters move. And talking about their embarrassing script directly from the script that any fan who plays Shakespeare's plays will feel chills If you are in this popular drama, I suggest you watch the powerful adaptations of 1996 from enthusiasts. Shakespearean Kenneth Branagh
