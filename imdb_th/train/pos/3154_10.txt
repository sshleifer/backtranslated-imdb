This show is a hilarious joke! Jokes are original, God and I love Eric and Kelso! Yes, I know what they say after the 8th season. It's not funny anymore because Eric and Kelso are no longer on the list and Randy is really stupid. Randy is compared. With Eric and Kelso <br /> <br /> You can't get the most funny characters and switch em with "I'm a cool guy" type person (Randy). It's not his fault. But the writer tried to make the 8th season a joke. But still not as much as the previous season But that's fine. <br /> <br /> 360 is great. The red circle is a true mind-stricken father :) and Kitty is always half-high. Hyde tries to be cool all the time. He has his time as well. The least favorite character is Jackie and Donna. They are cool, but not without Kelso and Eric. <br /> <br /> Great performances, stupid!
