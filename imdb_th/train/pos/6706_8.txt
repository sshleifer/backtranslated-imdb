I remember this program when it became a regular show on Saturday night. <br /> Sabrina is a girl who moves in with her aunt who turns into a witch. So Sabrina must learn how to control the power of HR and use it effectively. She had to deal with a fierce rival like Libby in her best friend's school and boyfriend Harvey Kinkle. <br /> <br /> The performance is funny and fun. It makes Saturday evening fun for boys aged 10 years and makes him laugh out loud ... and flirt with 'Libby' ....
