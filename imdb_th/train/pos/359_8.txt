I couldn't believe that I was watching this movie - I thought maybe I thought it was another movie about a slave who was attacked and I avoided Ruths for the same reason - while I haven't seen Schind's list. Do not want to be "Entertainment" from the pain of other people, whether it is real or information Black that was attacked by white people Blacks have the ability to completely rape their own daughters - or let them be treated like slaves by "husband". It's painful to watch. But everyone redeemed themselves at the end and the performance was great! I do not want to believe that the Oprah character plays at the age of 35! And I admire the Whoopi to begin with - she's great I'm glad I felt lousy yesterday and Showtime started using The Color Purple.
