This is my first comment! This is a great movie! I watched everything with luck one night on the TV. During the first 5 minutes I thought it was a movie B but after that I understood that it was an amazing product. <br /> <br /> I recommend to some friends People watching this movie, B movie wrong, criticized superficial. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is almost a work of genius! A well-known director has done a great job here and it's a shame to say that he has left the game all the time.
