I saw this movie for the first time on a local station on Sunday afternoons that showed horror around 1969 or 1970. Uncut. At that time I was a little kid, but I really loved it and didn't really fear that. I think it has a very cool and original story. When thinking back, I was still amazed that it appeared during the day that T.V. had not uncovered over the years. I've searched this movie since seeing it over and over again and always loved it. Who would think that John Waters would have to respect this film not only as a horrible movie? But still one of the most disgusting movies ever created at that time And the surprise that you didn't hear about this is that there was a cult following that movies such as "Blood Feast" or "The Hills Have Eyes" have been for many years It has a cult track. But it should really become a classic cult in my opinion As far as I know this thing, before Blood Feast came out, this movie could be one of the first real "gore" movies. In fact, this movie has elements of Hershell Gordon Lewis and the little Russ Meyer throwing well. <br /> <br /> Next, I recommend this to everyone who likes black horror movies. And white, early 60 (I think the date at the end of it will read 1960)
