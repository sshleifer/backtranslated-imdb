Guy Kibbee gave the audience a lot of laughs. Like most candidates, he almost doesn't know anything. Warren Williams is an actor with excellent scores, excellent for giving advice to Kibby. That is, he taught him to say things that were not meaningful to the public in voting Campaign without comment "I will act under the guidance" and "maybe yes, but then again, maybe not" is the perfect way to win elections Plainly, the more stupid candidates the more chance he or she will win. Finally, people can identify with such people. For this movie, it makes a lot of jokes.
