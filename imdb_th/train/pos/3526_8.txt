Phantom Lady (1944) Dir: Robert Siodmak <br /> <br /> Production: Universal Pictures <br /> <br /> Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) After a disgusting and isolated fight with his wife, it seems. Causing him to drown Sadness at the local watering hole There, he spied on a woman in a similar emotional state and was looking for some friends, asking her to go to the club to let both of their minds out of their problems. She agreed, but only in their condition. Keep their names on their own Of course, when Scott returned home, he found the police there waiting for him. His wife was killed. Where are you? 8 o'clock this evening, ask the inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez) to ask, but Scott has an excuse, right? Only he did not know the name of that woman. And the bartender remembers Scott But not women There is no taxi driver or drummer (Elisha Cook Jr.) at the club, even the dancers in the club that Scott clearly sees women. (Both wearing the same hat) did not accept that someone was with him Something happened But there was nothing that Scott defended himself in the trial and was sentenced to death for the murder of his wife (in the 'most delicate' evidence in Hollywood judicial history) it was left to the faithful secretary 'Kansas' (Ella Raines), who was later joined by a sympathetic inspector to find the real killer before Scott was executed. <br /> <br /> Phantom Lady was created based on the theme. At Almost exacerbated in the work of Woolrich. For example, schizophrenia is seen in the Black Angel and The Leopard Man. There are also characters that become warped by the death of a lover or spouse found in Rendezvous in Black dress and bridal dress, wearing a black dress It can make the viewer feel like he is walking on a dilapidated area. But in the right hand, a feverish plan, the conversation apologizes. The inconsistency of the narrative is beside that point. Luckily, Phantom Lady receives advice from the voice of <br /> <br /> This is Siodmak's first noir. Will separate himself as one of the distinguished trainers of the style (The Killers, Criss Cross). Here he coincides with the film director Woody Bradyell. (They will gather together on Christmas holidays and The Killers) with great storytelling on the camera. In one shot, the deteriorating mental state of the character appears as he sits in front of three mirrors to introduce various personalities. The same character, which is an artist, has Van Gogh's own image, with a bandaged ear on his wall in his apartment, but what Siodmak and Bredell are doing in Phantom Lady is creating Noir's look. Published in early 1944, everything is here. Wet sidewalks, atmospheric bags and fear, clear clarity, b & w. The reality is wildly expressed. (When Kansas visited Scott in prison) images of inconsistent beams, etc. It was a great image to look at. <br /> <br /> The actors, including the content and the unrelated experience of the director I think the hammam sounds a little, Alan Curtis (Siena) is not very much and actually is quite weak in some scenes. Ella Raines is mostly good (and quite beautiful) 'sex scene' of She and Elisha Cook Jr. are very fascinating to believe. Another notable scene was when Kansas followed the bartender to ask him. It was a chase scene as she pushed the dog to the streets unceasingly, stopping at the subway station. There is a great tension in it. <br /> <br /> *** From 4
