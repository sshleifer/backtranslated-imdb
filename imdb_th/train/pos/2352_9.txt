I must say that when "Daisy pushing" came out. I was victorious from a fairy tale like the setting of such horror. The narrator made the cake out of all the tests by causing death to seem like a routine, as well as Pyeb Ned (Lee Pace) and bringing them back to life on a regular basis. <br /> <br /> Three people of Ned, Emerson Cod (Kai McBride) and Charlotte "Anna Friel" Chenoweth, the creator of evil plays, was delighted to create a wonderful conversation and idiot. It deserves to be nicknamed as a joke (romance) / drama. <br /> <br /> Ned and Chuck create a shy lover and are not ready for love that still explores their feelings. They will not be able to touch - obstacles that seem to have no obstacles with help, such as cellophane gloves and strange tables around the apartment. But even though he presented his embarrassment while working around a strange secret that only a few people knew But they can still show the chemistry on their screen in a scene that can be touched like when Ned However, the presence of Olive makes the music break time in the pie shop and unexpected complications for couples. <br /> <br /> The second season drops quickly. True potential At some point, the plot line was hurried and uncomfortable, causing you to ask that "What happened?" Both in the overall plot of the week's death and in the plot line that was overcome. Adding Chuck's father, two siblings for Ned, didn't help, and at least one of the plot lines felt that it was almost recyclable (not the "delicious food" episode). It felt like the "bitter dessert" in the fact that Dead people of the week died in food?) A moment that touched a few (bees) happened to help develop the relationship between Chuck and Ned. But every time they come close, the writer decides to throw another monkey wrench instead of allowing the relationship to develop. (Oliver returned from the temple The dead father comes back to life again and does not return to you. Images) <br /> <br /> The shame is not effective. But the concept is good and looks surreal in a good way Pleasantvillesque color / happy-smiley that happened and an unbelievable situation to remind you that it's not "Dead Like Me" then again it's in "Pushing Daisy Time" according to creator Brian Fuller, therefore making it possible again. <br /> <br /> It should be longer than this. Kudos for what new items try to replace this short-lived gem.
