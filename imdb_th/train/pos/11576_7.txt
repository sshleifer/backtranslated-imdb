It tries to be a great adventure of the century. And with actors like Sh√¥ Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies, it's a perfect adventure forever In fact, it is a fun and fun adventure that, despite the shortcomings, still attracts your attention. It must be felt that it is the greatest movie ever for someone who created it. Although it was built in the 90s, it does not have a modern feel. It has the same feeling that the old Errol Flynn movie has a great adventure movie, another great story in Hollywood. But I'm afraid that the feeling in this movie is not the same as these old movies. On the other hand, just having a real feeling. You can't hate it. I think it's an adventure movie that's okay. And i really love music Damn I need a song
