This strong two-hour pilot works great in setting characters and backgrounds for "Enterprise" "prequel" to the original "Star Trek" series. It stumbles a few times in the "Trek" and clich√©-makers meetings. Dancing in the candy-colored area seems to have no style, and I can guess the reference to T'pol while "Seven of Vulcan" - but the dress looks strong. The character is well drawn and anyone can see the word. Dumb This ship must have more expertise in the previous series (later?). Scott Bakula got the right note as captain with the brutality and courage of Kirk but without shame and His swagger and I look forward to the way in which this series will have weapons engineers and communication officers!) Is a player that supports It seems that the writer will raise a big mistake in "Star Trek: The Next Generation," "Deep Space 9" and "Voyager": instead of starting with a large actor and giving the character a short start. Beginning with The smaller main character, which can add variety later - which I hope will happen because after about half a dozen, must be more diverse.
