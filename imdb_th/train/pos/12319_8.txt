The first thing, first, the leadership of a woman is too beautiful to miss. Now, actress Wang Zu Xian, who plays Xiao Qian in a 42-year-old and old movie, is always good to review these glorious times when seeing production in Hong Kong like this old school. <br /> <br / > The movie is one of the most influential films in 1980. The decoration, art sets and other aesthetic aspects are all fascinating. The film has a deep black humor. Feels like a horror movie But in the end it was not scary But only fun. <br /> <br /> I have experience in translating the second chapter of "A Chinese Ghotst Story" and I think the script is a good chapter. However, when I watched the first movie, I was disappointed. Seeing movies that are different from scripts, such as in smaller sizes and related to more cartoon roles. However, it turns out that it works better in terms of entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you have seen Lord of the Rings, you will notice the similarities in this film with LOTR. The important point is like a mirror. Miranda Otto's fight with the witch witch Of course it's a loud laugh out loud. Cheers!
