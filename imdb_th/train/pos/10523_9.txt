Emma is a true lover. If you love the dilapidated things that are witty and stupidity, you'll love this movie! It is true for a novel which is very important. Gwen is not one of my favorite actors. But she acts as a justice to everything she has to do in spades She shone in a role that I thought that no other actor would be able to do the right thing. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam is a hero. How shocked are you? I never saw him as a handsome person. But too revealing! What can the right role do for you! He looks very good as Mr. K, with reason and reason, which I am looking at him in a new perspective. He made and brought a wonderful romance. The charm and character that he played in his role was excellent. <br /> <br /> Ewan McGregor, Greta Sacchi brought the rest of the good actors, good movies. This story, along with pride and injustice - and most importantly, buy books It helps to raise the movie to extra height.
