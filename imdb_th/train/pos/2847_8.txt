As is generally known that the movie of poetry is not very good with American audiences. (I guess they like one standard plot) New York, I Love You is the second phase of the film about poetry related to the city and the people who live and love them. The first is' Paris, J'Taime 'which I really like Films are created from many parts, each written and / or directed by different directors. (Mostly French But there is a very funny section directed by Joel & Ethan Coen) as well as' Paris'. This chapter is also an anthology directed by many directors (Fatih Akin, Mira Nair, Natalie Portman, Shakher Kapur, etc.) and also likes' Paris 'deals with New Yorkers and why they love They live in the city. There are top performers with the likes of Natalie Portman, Shia LaBeouf, Christina Ricci, Orlando Bloom, Ethan Hawki and also qualified veterans such as James Caan, Cloris Leachman, Eli Wallach and Julie Christie. The story can actually fly and some things can't (Although I think it will depend on the taste of each person --- I will not destroy it for others by revealing what is right for me and the person who doesn't). The series will be Shanghai, China. (Ie Rome, Italy, Berlin, Germany or Athens, Greece from this question?) Mainly speaking in English. But with a bit of Yiddish & Russian language with English subtitles scoring 'R'by MPAA for strong language and sexual content
