I can't believe that they put this thing in the air. Especially when they only have a few remaining time A few of my daughters, sisters and friends like to watch this program. We were very upset when they stopped showing this because of a rating called It's not fair to people who watch this program from the beginning. We have the right to see the end. I hope they will make a total vote from everyone with 3 voting systems per year. They can send documents by mail and we, as viewers, can give an overall rating to all the programs we watch or have heard of. This may help promote a new item. People will see it and wonder what it is. Not only will you see what viewers are watching, you can also use this as a free advertising tool for TV and cable channels. We want to watch other episodes. Bring it back !!
