A wonderful, funny and sweet movie with Morgan Freeman (self-made player) and meet a Spanish woman named Scarlet (Paz Vega) at a small shop while researching independent films with potential I was quite skeptical about the movie during the first ten minutes. But as soon as he was in the store, I really started enjoying this movie. It shows what a positive attitude can change. It doesn't have a complex plot and is easy to follow. But will lift the sad mood and make you smile all the way without needing a little romance There are many scenes that make you laugh beside. Very rare masterpieces!
