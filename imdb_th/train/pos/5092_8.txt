I think King Solomon's mine is doing very well. My only booking is Alison Dudy. Her performance is excellent. But her makeup and hair were not at that time and seemed to make her look off-site next to other actors. I think Patrick Swayze is a great choice for Alan Quatermain. It's a good story. Saw the experienced and strong performer in this role after watching the movie after the movie with the actors with silky hair like Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt etc. He was a great choice This model cannot compare to the 1950 model with Stewart Grainger. It is a big screen movie and is not created for TV movies. I think Quatermains both believe. But must separate the two media from each other I am looking forward to seeing this again and I hope Patrick Swayze will see this role again.
