Must see Garde à Vue many times to understand the sub-plans that are contained. If you are not familiar with movies with French vocabulary based on conversation and intellectual struggle rather than acting, don't even try to watch it. You will be bored to death and confident that the French film is not right for you. <br /> <br /> Garde à Vue is a movie that uses words as the main dialogue (written by Audiard). <br /> <br /> Why do Ma Whytre Martineau (Serrault) like being accused of being a murderer rather than telling the truth improperly? Because at the time of the murder he was with an 18-year-old girl whom he had sex for 8 years. His wife knew very well. Pure and innocent corners of the poor life
