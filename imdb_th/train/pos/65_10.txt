This film is not about shooting in schools. But actually it has never been seen before But that adds power to this movie It's about people and how to deal with tragedy. I know that it shows to the students who survived the Columbine shooting and it gives a lot of feelings for them. The performance was excellent. The three main actors (Busy Phillips, Erika Christensen and Victor Garber) are great actors in their roles ... I would like to recommend this movie to everyone. It's one of the movies that makes you talk about it after you see it. It encourages not only discussion But filming in school only But also including human emotions and reactions to all kinds of tragedies It's a jerk job. But it's worth it and I will see time and time again
