This is a very strange movie by Richard Williams, the film director. Everyone who knows about William's work knows that it's boring. But if anyone is wise, he needs to eat a cake. <br /> <br /> There are two ragdolls that help the owner of a new French doll from desire. Pirate toys and find themselves at the mercy of many strange characters along the way. The strength of this film is mainly in the quality of beauty. Strange character design, powerful animations and awesome and scary clarity Williams's excellent animation represents Raggedy Ann and Andy as a real rag doll, floppy and curse instead of a simple cartoon doll that makes it more believable. (At least in terms of images) this animation is presented Camel-with-the-Wrinkled-Knees Which our bodies walked along with two different personalities that control each side of the silent movie chase with Sir Leonard Looney. And of course, Greedy <br /> <br /> Greedy animations may be ani The most beautiful psychedelic animation I've ever seen. There is something about this animation that causes your jaw to decrease and every second is something new. Living in what is seen as a "Taffy hole" is greedy, a giant man who lives and eats mercilessly sweets. He sings that I can't help but feel the sexual feelings. Then try to kill Raggedy Ann for her sweet heart. <br /> <br /> The only thing I have about this movie is that there are lots. Too music. It's the constant disruption of the movie because there are six of them. There are about six good songs. (Which should be a single song) including "I look and I'll see anything", "No girl toys", "Blue" (although they don't need to make him sing twice), "I don't have enough" , "Because I love you" and may be "I'm at home". Others seem unnecessary and not surprising to hear. <br /> <br /> This is a strange movie with strange undertones. That's what you are looking for
