"Braveheart" was overshadowed by the release of the same year. I admit my bias towards Mel Gibson, but I still like the reason "Rob Roy", both "Braveheart" and "Rob Roy", showing the Scottish history in a bloody fashion style "Braveheart" is great. The epic that has received honor and courage from people It is also about the melodic era and Maudlin observing the cornball use of slow-motion filming. Its violence is both ugly and glorious. It is the quality behind which makes it interesting to the idea of ​​a teenager, while "Braveheart" is beyond "Rob Roy" in the true killing level. (Not to mention the relaxed work time) The latter film is more mature and satisfying. Their actions are more complex. But it's surprising and smarter Its sex is less flashy. But more erotic "Rob Roy" still has a romantic interest in better Its dialogue attempts to approximate the poetry of the era. Its cavities are in the mouth of the actors trying to be close to the dentistry of the era. Tim Roth is a great villain, also recommended: "The Last of the Mohicans" and "The Patriot". You may find that "Braveheart" later is more similar, focusing on blood needs, where the past is similar to "Rob Roy" is very much. All such films are rated R for violence.
