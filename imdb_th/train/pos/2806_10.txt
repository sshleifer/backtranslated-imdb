Okay, first of all, I hate to comment on this. But I felt that I had to stand up to watch this movie. There are many people who bash it and I feel like someone who might want to see it should get a second opinion. <br /> <br /> First of all, Bend It Like Beckham doesn't mean the most profound movie of the century. If that's what you're looking for elsewhere Just because it is an independent film does not mean that it must have art. It should make you feel good and you should enjoy watching it, and both of these things can be done. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the performance, although not "Halle Berry in Monster's Ball", is still good. No need to act like that in good faith, so don't look for it. It's a family movie If that's what you want, you won't do or shouldn't watch this movie in truth. <br /> <br /> Finally, it has a very cute story. I think it's good and fun. To see It is also true to most lives for that culture, so if you want to watch a movie that you can enjoy and feel good when you're done. If you are looking for something that has deep thoughts and amazing scenes, it is not for you. <br /> <br /> - Lindsay
