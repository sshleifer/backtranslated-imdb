Oscar-Excalibur by Peter Falk in the role of Oscar-Excalibur I like the reasoning and balance of marriage for a long time - how often do we get that in the movie? This is an adult movie, a complex perspective through the eyes of all parties - husband, wife, son - each person has adapted to each other in the past and grows during the story It makes me laugh about 10 times, and I am one of those who are often unaware when the rest of the audience laughs. This is one of the few funny stories I have ever seen. Top original jokes
