I accidentally watched this movie by buying it as the B side. Well, the Mega Man video The Omega Man is a bit disappointing - except for the beginning, which was clearly inspired in the next 28 days. Of television movies, but Soylent Green is in all other leagues I bet this is one of Tarantino's favorites. In the movie, there are at least 3 scenes that I have never seen before. Heston slept on the bed as well. "Furniture" while discussing other matters that are completely irrelevant! A large number of crowds were brought up by the herd to dig with mechanical equipment! The priest confessed and was shot by the confessor. Okay, maybe it's been doing since - but there are a few that are continuously traditional. And what happened between Heston and Edward G. Robinson? Is this a gay couple that is most unlikely? Fortunately, I saw this film without knowing the ending - which was obviously rare. Then I watched again and enjoyed all the little clues that made the first scene long worth it. The script is great - and some scenes are great too. When you think you will see everything.
