This is not 'Bonnie and Clyde' or 'Thelma and Louise' but it's a romantic movie. It set two main characters, soft and easy. The audience quickly learned the tension, which praised the director. Has a young son who speaks French (And English) who want to do well in France, have French girlfriends and alcoholic individuals as well as young men do And also has a Moroccan Arabic speaking father (And France) who believe in his religion with the kindness and wisdom of the elderly and those who reject the new culture around him The film is able to explore a very powerful political-partner, drive past the former Yugoslavia through Turkey and through the Middle East to Mecca. These are areas in which Muslim populations participate in the war against genocide. In which the dictatorship had tortured and concluded executions in order to seize power and the religious community was fiercely fighting But this film moves through those places and possibilities, with only the guidance of that agenda The relationship between the two is the key to this film and the political beliefs in the background. It seems that all of us are human and need to understand and care about each other in order to manage well in this world. Of course, it's not 'Natural Born Killers' and it's better for it.
