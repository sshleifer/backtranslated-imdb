Finally having to watch this classic TV movie in an unofficial sheet recorded from the old VHS. It's a classic horror movie. It's more regrettable in the horror corner that was abandoned in terms of official release on the DVD and VHS ... horror movies on TV. Recommended for all fans of television movies in the 1970s, like the ending of terror. Those interested should receive a book about it by David Deal - Television Fright Films of 70. Email me for the opportunity to see it ..... It's great to see it again. <br /> <br /> It has problems like many television movies that they have to be quite creative in depth effects and even at 70 minutes seems to be dragging. We are all familiar with cutting-edge editing. But there are still good things and still better than performing many terrifying plays that are released today
