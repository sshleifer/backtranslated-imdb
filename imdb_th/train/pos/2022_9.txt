The only complaint I have about this adjustment is about sex. Things that are mentioned in the novel only appear on the screen for strange reasons. They think the audience is too stupid to understand or not. If they don't show everything out, right? In addition, the quality is very good. All actors do great work, making their characters lively. For shallow women there, it is worth watching at least because Toby Stephens, because Gilbert is the sexiest woman ever. If I was Helen, I would easily forget. I still married in the minute I watched him ... <br /> <br /> The type of spoiler - the ending scene is the opposite of the book
