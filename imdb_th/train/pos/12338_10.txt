Joan Fontaine plays the villain in the Victorian era film. She persuaded her to play with a married woman who had a lover on her side and put her picture on a wealthy man Miles Rushworth, played by Herbert Marshall. Mr Marshall is quite good like a mile. Miss Fontaine performed her duties perfectly - at the same time, she had a witty, calculating look, naive, fearful and charming. It takes a talented actress to pull that out. Joan Fontaine looks gorgeous in a luxurious dress by Travis Banton. In this film is Joan's mother, Lillian Fontaine plays as Lady Flora. I would like to recommend this movie.
