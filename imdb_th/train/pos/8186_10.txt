I love Satan holes !!! David Tennant is a great actor and Billie Piper is like that !!! Anyone who loves Will Thorp anymore. He's so cute, right? I hate what he is possessed by demons and places where he was ordered to "go to hell" while the roses were placed there. In your heart he was quite funny when he said "Rose, do you like it? Will you shut up!" Jefferson was very brave, right? Dying to save others I really regretted Toby (Will Thorp) when he left his possession for the second time because he was very scared. I'm like "Oh my God, if I was a rose, I would be scared of him so much" and when she hugged him, I was like "grrrrrr. He is mine! But I think it's really cute and the doctor .... Okay, I think he will talk to Ida. "Tell Rose I love you" but he can't. Oh well
