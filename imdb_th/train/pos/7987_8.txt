Man on Fire is hot. I love the classic story of good revenge and what is better for revenge than kidnapping the innocent little girl. <br /> <br /> The writer works great in the movie. This is to create a relationship between Creasy (Denzel Washington) and Pita (Dakota Fanning) to make viewers understand and feel that Creasy drives have to help Pita. Also, it is good that Creasy is not a child type. The choir Pita trying to help through the "proper", but used torture and Smart Street instead. Some people may say "Torture is wrong regardless of" and you may be right But when you see the pain that Creasy caused due to the loss of Pita and his true passion that brought her back, you can't help with Creasy and pull him to have more mercy. There will be no progress if Creasy uses negotiation to deal with the evil gangsters and different criminals, and he knows Creasy's mission ends with the return of Pita and her mother and Creasy is dying. In the vehicles of the bad guys, but the death of Creasy did not reduce the performance of the movie But in reality, it was improved by showing that Creasy was willing to die to bring Pita back. His death was really fantastic. <br /> <br /> Denzel did a great job as well. Write This film deserves a good score because it is definitely a good movie.
