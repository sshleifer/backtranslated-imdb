The stunned code with Stanwyck plays the best actress who sleeps to the top. These advance code flicks allow everything to be left in the imagination. Stanwyck stands out as the owner's daughter Lily / the barbarian father who sells more than drinking (John) after the old man dies (well !) Baird head for a big city for something better. She uses her female qualities. Lie on her way to the top. John Wayne makes a "hijack" that is poor and proves that the actor is getting better at an older age and is a coaching coach. I like teasing and strong connections between actors. I would like to recommend this movie to all movie lovers and watch Stanwyck as wonderful and beautiful as Lily.
