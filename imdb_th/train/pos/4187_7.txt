This is a good example of Film Noir. This setting was in the early 50's, with communist groups trying to steal weapons secrets from the US government. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark is a gentle pickpocket He gave the performance quite well. But there are no items about him The interesting thing is that he not only But is an anti-hero, but through movies, most are different anti-heroes. That is not very normal Jean Petersburg gave the show so poorly that it was slow with a heart of gold. The best actress, the character of Telmarter, shines like a pigeon. <br /> <br /> The plot has a fair share of twists and turns. There is a fight scene near the end of the movie. (In the subway station) that is quite scary and exciting. <br /> <br /> I think Fan Noir (Like myself) will enjoy this movie For non-noir audiences, it may look a bit old and all Commie things are a little too much.
