Of course, it was shot and done very well. Shoot and do! But the story was so weak And Lincoln's depiction is even weaker. Not that Henry Fonda is not good. But the character he plays is not worthless Do you mean to tell me that Lincoln is a wise, intelligent and not lawful person or a court? I mean, who should he be? Cousin Winnie? I mean "I'll call a fool" ???? I understand that Ford is going to be a great funny hero. But I don't like this guy at all. He cheats in sports, speaks like a simple, cute person, and doesn't seem to know that he is sitting in the courtroom. I should do this seriously. <br /> <br /> The twists are weak. I mean come! That was silly. The whole story seems to be the idea of ​​a 5 year old boy of his dreams. Saying that I like it enough, it's fun and makes me laugh many times, so I can't say it's a bad movie. In fact, I must say that I have to say that it's good enough, nothing that makes me laugh and makes me laugh badly But this bright and ridiculous story is so ridiculous that I cannot understand who will think it is great.> <br /> I do not know how this film is right in the past. But if one thing is true, I have to shake my head.
