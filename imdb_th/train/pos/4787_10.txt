David Lynch often creates movies that resemble puzzles that are wrongly combined. They are interesting to watch and think. But they don't have a gel in your mind Perhaps the art may have the most meaning to the creator. <br /> <br /> The opposite story is not a typical David Lynch movie. No matter what is normal about them It is an Odyssey through rural America. Traveling in real life Alvin Straight took a mower to go to his brothers' house. He rode 300 miles from Laurens, Iowa to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin, to make amends for his sick brother. <br /> <br /> The heart of this movie is Richard Farnsworth, who speaks sweetly. He brought Alvin Strait to us simply and honestly. The fact that this movie is a slow-moving movie that is compatible with Alvin's slow journey to awareness. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Alvin meets a confused and frightened girl. She was pregnant and decided to escape from her situation. After listening to Alvin talking about her family, she thought again. <br /> <br /> Later, Alvin saw a woman who had hoped to kill the deer with her car. She complained that she had killed many people. Alvin feels bad But smart enough to cook the beloved meat that night. <br /> <br /> Later, Alvin's mower lost his brakes and almost killed him. The good man and his wife let him stay in their home while he was fixed. They let him call a sweet daughter. But his slowness was played well by Sissy Spacek, who had a terrible tragedy in her past. Alvin insists on paying phone bills. The man offered to drive Alvin to the brothers with joy. Alvin denies thanks. <br /> <br /> While Alvin waits, he goes out to the bar with a kind old man while they talk about the violence of the war and the price at the soul. Of them talking Alvin confesses to a serious mistake. He acts like a gunman who haunts him forever. <br /> <br /> Alvin also finds two brothers who quarrel at repairing his mower. He talks about them at a price wise, calling them about high wages and repair costs. He also helps them to appreciate each other's learning from their own mistakes with their brothers. <br /> <br /> The night before Alvin left his house, he took off his hat. he The man told him that it was his honor and asked Alvin to write to him. This scene is perfect with simplicity. It's heartfelt because it's straightforward. <br /> <br /> The journey continues and we can't help to be more involved. We want Alvin to find his brothers. We want him to pay. We want to know that this world is full of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> This is Richard Farnsworth, his best. It was his last film and his performance was great. You can't help but understand his pride, listen to his wisdom and eventually feel pain. One person will take him as a person who offers him in the backyard. <br /> <br /> If there is justice in the afterlife, Alvin Straight, his brother. I can imagine them talking about life, regret, hope and happiness. As Alvin spoke in the film "My brother and I used to look at the stars." I know that they all have the best view in the house.
