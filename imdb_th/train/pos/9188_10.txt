It's terrible that many people don't understand this and the next episode. <br /> <br /> But don't worry! Should not explain as well :) <br /> <br /> Now divided into 2 parts. <br /> <br /> Tony's first episode is "Dream" in a coma. The second part is what happens in real life. <br /> <br /> Now, what people don't understand is that Tony's dream is more than just a dream. Now it's about his preparation for his death. He lost his identity and eventually forgot himself, so he removed all his commitments to this world. You will notice what I was saying at the scene where Tony said that he had lost his briefcase. "His life" The creator interpreted his own thoughts of what happened when you died. <br /> <br /> If you understand the whole plot, you will find that now and the next episode is something. The unique meaning has good spiritual meaning. <br /> <br /> Just like when the soprano singer <br /> <br /> The only thing I didn't understand was the role of the monks. I'll watch it until I get this. <br /> <br /> Anyway, now it really impressed me and I don't think anyone will see a better picture of what happened in almost the experience. Dead <br /> <br /> No doubt.
