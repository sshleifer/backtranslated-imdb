Importing in the country is a great movie. I laugh all the time. It's funny at many levels, from crazy costumes to hilarious situations. Great performances, Alla Korot, Larry Dorf, Howard Hesseman and others all worked great. Since it is an independent film written by the first writer, there is no ancient idea to expect from other comedies. I heard that it's true. If so, that's a joke. (And amazing!) I recommend this movie
