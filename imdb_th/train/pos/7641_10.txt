Everyone plays their role well in "Little movie" Belushi received a different opportunity to participate in his life. But ultimately realized that what he had to be good or might be better The film shows us that we should take advantage of the opportunities we have, not what we can't or can't do. If you can get this movie in the video for about $ 10, that's an investment!
