The influence of Hal Hartley in Adrienne Shelly's movie "I'll Take You There" is not clear, but has a clear connection to his work (Shelly has starred in Hartley's two films). Only strong But too many stylish and extreme characters make human emotions in a truly realistic manner. Although this film is not a ridiculous story in all matters (Thank God) The mocker who is small and delicate that pepper the parts that speak of the bitter truth in love and loss. With beautiful movies and soundtrack delivered straight from the seventies "I'll see you there" is a great indie film that doesn't look like modern kiddies when dealing with the love and reality of human emotions. <br /> The movie begins with Bill's life. That fell into pieces, he not only sold Ray as a friend in the beautiful countryside But his wife's race left him to join Ray in the retreat. Bill immersed himself in his grief until his sister Lucy. (Played by director Adrian Shelley) surprised him all: self-help books and "dates" for her painful brother <br /> <br /> <br /> Bill Who are not willing to try to refuse But Bernie's presence at his door gave him no choice. There is no doubt that the first behavior and Bernice's ridiculous hairstyle diverted his ability to "respond" to her. However, her hippie tricky qualities disturbed him so much that he hit her in the first match. And Bernis was very painful with her derogatory words, which she attached to him, forcing himself to enter him. Until now, we didn't know ... except the fact that she was a psychopath. (And who better to play psychosis than Ally Sheedy?) <br /> <br /> Knowing that Bill wanted to see Rose, Bernice offered her car, but in a state where he took her somewhere. On the way, she collected the gun bill with his own gun. (Detective Pinkerton, no less) anger, resentment, redemption, passion and violence that occurred while Bill and Bernis entered the path to Ray's hometown and Rose ... Of course, there are a few stops.
