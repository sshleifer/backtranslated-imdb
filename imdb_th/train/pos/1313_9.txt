Other TV movies should do this. I saw it back in the year '93 when it was the first time on TV. Helen Hunt and Steven Weber are excellent for both strong and realistic performances. Weber is a good person, especially the reversal of an eerie and extraordinary performance as a child abuse / killer. The film adds respect to Hunt as my actor. Director also directed "Erzier", which is both a recipe and an excitement But the direction in these two works is realistic, simple and attractive If you like TV movies that are unpredictable and too full of excitement, see if you can. The side story about Hunt and Fahey's story is also appealing without deviating from the main story.
