Personally, I cannot enter "This is not a love song." It's a great movie and has a wonderful story. I just found myself checking the time on my phone every two minuets to see how much is left. <br /> <br /> I love the relationship between Spike and Heaton. There they are close together to join in life. At the same time, I hope that the relationship is more than what it is. Heaton falls in love but interrupts Ibs, not in love with Heaton, or he doesn't know how to love him. Both acts of betrayal have a great effect on two men. They both regretted the fact that another person ran away and left them at the time they needed each other to survive.
