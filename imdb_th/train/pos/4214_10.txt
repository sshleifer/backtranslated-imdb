The seven best Sam Fuller movies I've ever seen (including Park Row, Run of the Arrow, Verboten !, Shock Corridor, The Naked Kiss, Big Red One and this movie) Pickup on South Street is the only one of the best movie noirs It means his most fuller control. I like him when he can't control But almost everything in the pickup truck is perfect The film is absolutely beautiful. Richard Widmark is a pickpocket star who stole a small film that was intended to go to communist spies. Jean Peters plays the woman who holds the movie for her boyfriend, played by Richard Keighley. Peters was forced to search Widmark and bring it back. She found him through the feces of pigeons played by Telmar, Widmark and Peters, attracted to each other, which changed Peters's loyalty. (Which and the fact that she knew that she worked for Communism; The Cold War story is really interesting.) Love stories run fast and totally unbelievable. But it is not too bad to harm the film (Unlike Park Row's previous film) Richard Widmark is great. This will be one of his best roles. But I'm not familiar with his career so much that I can say for sure. Thelma Ritter delivers the most memorable performance. Her role in the film's emotional resonance is unexpected, and her final scene in this film is just like you would in a movie theater. I will never forget 10/10
