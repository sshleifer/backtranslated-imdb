Be careful with this. Once you have received it, it will change the way you see the kung fu flicks. You will be longing for a plot from all kung fu movies. Now you will need the depth of character and development. You will want mystery and unpredictability. You will want dynamic camera work and incredible backgrounds. Sadly, you won't find all of these aspects together in one kung fu movie, except for the five deadly toxins. <br /> <br /> The best kung fu movie of all time easily. Venoms combines a variety of plot. Full of twists and turns with colorful characters (And being developed) with the best camerawork to come out in the 70s. The success of someone who likes this movie depends on the ability of the audience to decode who the character is and Who specializes in poisoning? One is the centipede, the second is the third snake, the fourth is the scorpion, the lizard and the fifth is the toad. Each character has different characteristics, strengths and weaknesses. There is a hook. We learn with the character of the students. Find out who these different men are. We are in his shoes (so speak) and we have to choose the people we trust and we are not the same as him. We learn with him. <br /> <br /> Not only the plot, the characters and the great cameraman, it's fun to watch, which in my book makes it more valuable than most other types of movies. It is quite worthwhile with a few watches to get everything going on. Venoms is a lesson about what Kung Fu really can do ... Don't expect other kung fu movies to live until the gloves.
