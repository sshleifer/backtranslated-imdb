One thing is for sure ... You shouldn't watch this movie if you have a bad day. The story was caused by a tragic event and followed the character that had to live with the sin he couldn't handle. The story is entered into your drip instead of the usual stupid explanation, so it makes you wonder what happened. Finally, the connection point and the show is reasonable. All the characters are ok and Wil Smith is doing well on the day. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that many moral questions to be asked. To accept what he chose to do Whether you agree or disagree, it is not relevant. The journey that takes you is interesting enough. If not overwhelming I would recommend this film if you like the genre you have to think and not just But watch the explosion and fight
