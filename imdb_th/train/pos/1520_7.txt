Four stories written by Robert Bloch about many people living in beautiful and ancient mansions and what happened to them. The first one was Denholm Elliott as a writer who saw the killer he wrote about life. Some horrible moments and twists at the end are good. The second is Peter Kuching, who is obsessed with the wax figure that looks like his dead wife. The third has Christopher Lee (Chloe Franks) and is afraid of her. (Though the end of the story is getting worse There is also a cute theme about Christopher Lee who plays Dracula. <br /> <br /> This is a very scary poem. Nothing scary. The fourth one is very funny and Pitt creates a very sexy vampire! The house itself looks beautiful ... and very creepy. It can be controlled well with a good atmosphere. Very good and unusual movie scores as well. Summarizing a little horror poetry that should be worth searching. Try watching from DVDs - Lions Gate door looks great with dark colors and great sound.
