Although the time to reveal that some effects have made this story of love and adventure still a special matter, <br /> <br /> If you have never seen this movie before Film makers later I was watching this with a friend who was amazed by Disney's Aladdin that pulled out of the movie. They love movies and like it is a standard for many other film and film makers. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 8 out of 10 out of 10 instead of 10 out of ten. The good part of this movie lived because in the last 15 minutes, this movie was separated from each other in the walk. Everything was hurried, as if they had to go to the end. From the beginning of the journey of djinn to the end, it seems to be more sketchy and finished painting. It didn't kill this movie. But it makes it weak. <br /> <br /> It still needs to look further for those who love good fairy tales or even great movies.
