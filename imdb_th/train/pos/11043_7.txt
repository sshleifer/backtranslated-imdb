Malefique is quite an audience from the beginning to the end with an irritating atmosphere. Almost the entire movie is set in a cell that revolves around four characters, which Marcus Homo and his little retarded boy are about to become strangers. Soon the prisoners found a notebook of former prisoners behind the brick, which involved a passion for superstition and superstition that led to the escape from the cell. From here on everything related to the disclosure of the secrets of books and spells that will escape from the prison. That leads to an accident between the exit from the cell to the unknown light. <br /> Honestly, I think this story is quite bad and the last twist is good. But for me However, I am excited until the last moment because the atmosphere of the movie is unique with minimal settings and performances. The killing is raw and creepy ... it's not used to make your spine cool and the mysterious theme is very good and reminds me of the Hellraiser Malefique theme. It is dirty and uncomfortable with a green tone Sometimes you wonder if the real world or the mysterious world that appears here is a stranger ... When a child with disabilities, his finger disappears and feels sleepy to suck milk from Marcus, it seems strange. With the budget of the movie, it creates an atmosphere that is unique and makes the audience feel chills in a way that is different from what most viewers do. I just hope that the story will lead to a more consistent ending. Many elements, such as visitors with cameras, other inmates intoxicated with books and stuffed toys pointing to the end, not suitable for the story. However, I will open my eyes to another film from director Valette, although it will be closed to see if he is creating a Hollywood movie "One miss call" which is missing and useless in the Miike version.
