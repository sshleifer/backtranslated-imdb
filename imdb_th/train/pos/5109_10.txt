I grew up in Houston and was nine years old when this movie was released. As a result, I can't remember anything about the movie. But I remember the feelings of Gilley's and mechanical bulls for Johnny Lee's Lookin 'for Love ", which still brings back childhood memories whenever I hear <br /> <br /> Previously, I saw this movie for the first time as an adult and everything I could say was I blown away. Some movies make me harder. This movie is raw and is the true story that you will get. From Uncle Bob's cattle ranch, a chemical plant in Texas City, Gilley and Bad and Sissy's dance halls And may be because of this, so there is no wider attraction But no matter how you feel about country music (For those who can't bear even being the root of Houston) Urban Cowboy is a unique American pie. For this reason, I love it!
