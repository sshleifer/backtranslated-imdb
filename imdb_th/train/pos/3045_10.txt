This is one of the funniest movies that has never been seen before. Amitabh, as the country coordinator, Arjun Singh is hilarious. The best thing is laughter that never stops. The story is also old, with the child being separated from the mother who sacrificed everything to do her duty - by meeting happily in the end. There was a villain (Ranjit) and a brother (Sashi Kapoor) and there vixens (Parveen Babhi) and a lover (Smita Patil) and a blind brother and grandfather were thrown into a good temple But this movie is about Amitabh and that's all you remember at the end. <br /> <br /> Amitabh came to town to make a good living and sending his conversations and gestures was hilarious. Later in this film, he became an angry young man with his reputation. But with humor The memorable part includes walking, speaking and speaking English, songs (gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with his dadoo. <br /> <br /> All in all, everything I rolled with. Laughter throughout the story If you want 3 hours of entertainment with the best Amitabh, of course - it will make it easily 10/10.
