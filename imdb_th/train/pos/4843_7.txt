Actually, this is one of those movies that you have to give 7.5. The truth is; As stated, it was fun. The atmosphere is fantastic. Askey really approached the top, but it was a great vehicle for him. Like Oh, Mr. Porter is for Will Hayes. If you like movies and trains in a dark house then this is definitely for you. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, it's the kind of movie you want to see again. It is friendly and charming in a way that is pleasing, with reference to all nostalgia that makes the fare during the war very good. The group of characters 'Odi' played together as they did in many British movies during the war. It would be wonderful if I watched this movie if it was recorded by Ealing studios. Unfortunately, the original 1931 manuscript didn't survive the same.
