I can say anything. This movie really came to me. It's not as bad as many people say that I really love it, although the idea is easy and boring, but not before. I enjoy the soundtrack. (Brian Adams) It really fits the movie. The second story is easy, and the drama about Spirit gets your attention. One of the things that I like most is that they do not give the horse's voice to interact with other horses. It makes the movie more realistic. There are not many animations that seem real. Now they do but ... I don't know. To make animals speak only lame ... <br /> <br /> One of the most beautiful animations of the year 2002. In my opinion, I advise everyone, not just children :) because it is Very good story. Relax.
