My only minor and the movie I grew up knowing that as STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN is the fact that RAYMOND MASSEY was relegated to the last twenty minutes in the experimental scene. And experimenting by yourself. IMO is the least interesting part of this interesting fantasy. <br /> <br /> David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are great actors as young lovers. MARIUS GORING that emphasizes sound. French is a pleasure (He has also been mentioned in Technicolor) while the messenger from heaven sent to restore Niven when his death during the war was not reported due to oversight. The blood has the thinnest lines and enjoyment. <br /> <br /> See tonight in TCM for the first time in twenty years or so. I think it is the best example of 1946, excellent for Technicolor filming movies are quite quiet and not flashy, and the way to change to B&W for a heavenly sequence is done with great imagination and performance. <br /> <br /> The opening scene is That truly attracts attention The audience in the fantasy aspect of the story - and Niven's tense talk with Hunter Radio while his plane crashed to the ground unexpectedly led to a memorable romantic encounter. Is a truly great movie from the beginning to the end and is another victory for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger
