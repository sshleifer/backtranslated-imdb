I like this series when I was a child. In 1952, I was 5 years old and my family always watched this program. My favorite character is Marion Lorn, played by a person who is quite stuttering, bad-spoken and very cute. I still remember her "ubba bubba um um". Type the comments as she will try. And say something important And when she returned to play with Aunt Clara in magic, it was an excellent casting! <br /> <br /> It was the first time I remember seeing Walter Matthau, my career, I was a fan for many years. <br /> <br /> I have a question if everyone can confirm. Title or credit of the song "Swedish Rhapsody" by Hugo Alfven? Every time I hear it playing in my classic radio station here in Southern California, it will bring memories back from the image of Mr. Piper walking back to the camera. I'm not sure if this picture in my mind is correct.
