I love this movie. At first, the smooth graphics look strange with grained images. But I hurried to go Must have photographed for thousands of hours and I appreciate the work done. If you're shocked by drugs or simple violence, it may not be the movie for you. But there are great characters here Technically, I like it a lot too. They have to use algorithms. de-interlacing New, or maybe it's just a picture that looks very dark. But I didn't feel annoyed with the usual artifacts seen in the video to transfer movies. (Open Water makes me crazy because most of them have cheap cameras and can use it now and I don't see any excuse for not peeling if you intend to screen in the cinema.) Sorry for my little rant Own I definitely recommend this movie if you have been involved in the music industry. It has a sad time. But for the most part, it's hilarious. I may be accused of laughing at the misfortunes of others. But is a classic piece
