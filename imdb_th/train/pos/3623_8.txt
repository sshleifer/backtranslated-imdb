Disney may go to something here. First of all, they have "Remember the Titans" and Denzel, a story based on truth about sports and small cities in Central America, now with Quaid and The Rookie ... There is another sports story based on truth. <br /> <br /> Both films will make you tears many times and both make you smile and feel warm after seeing. My wife and I participated in The Rookie and we expect it to be a great movie. We were not disappointed when asked whether we would buy this DVD or not. When it came out, it wasn't the easiest game.
