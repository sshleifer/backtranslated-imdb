"The Straight Story" is a truly beautiful movie about an old man named Alvin Strait, who rides the grass across the country to visit a brother who died. But that's just a basic conclusion ... This movie has more than that. This is the last role of Richard's Farnworth before he dies, and of course he must remember. He is a stubborn old man, unlike the old man you and I may know. <br /> <br /> "Straight story" is a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lives. It will reach down and touch your part, at least if you have a heart.
