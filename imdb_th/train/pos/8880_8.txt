Of life in (some) college, but there are things you see in this movie in some colleges. <br /> <br /> I went to a college in Southern California with my own race. It's funny because these schools need racial harmony, equality and others, and I can honestly say that it's there. But what happens is that when the class breaks up or when they just go out to study, they (students) seem to just go on a trip with people of their own race or ethnicity. Isn't it bad? Not really. Ownership feeling But like a paper in a school in a school that I attended, wrote about this "We should all try to travel with other ethnic students and try to get to know them." Otherwise, you will create your own discrimination. <br /> <br /> Racism exists in the schools I attend. join There was a time when people put leaflets around the university to talk about the elegance of the Aryan race and the symbolism of those racist organizations. Fortunately, there was nothing like the movie's event in which a white man went out and started filming in a multi-cultural gathering. <br /> <br /> I could only hope and pray that nothing. Will happen. <br /> "Higher learning" is too exciting or not. Exaggerated? Maybe. It is a way of "closing the mark" depending on whether you go to or go to school. What is a race in which ethnic minorities live on their own? Remove Hollywood exaggeration. The thing that crashed near me a lot.
