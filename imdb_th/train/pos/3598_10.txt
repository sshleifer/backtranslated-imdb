As a person who often doesn't like to watch movies, boxing feels that they only pay attention to boxing, not the characters themselves. This movie really impressed me. I like to see the main character Diana. (Michel Rodriguez) passed many things in a short time. It was wonderful for me. Michelle (Rodriguez) did an excellent job playing Diana, especially since this was a performance experience. At first, she showed her true emotions and miraculously displayed Diana. All actors have chemistry on the screen and make this film even more amazing. I would like to recommend this movie even to those who do not watch boxing movies 10/10.
