When I sat in the cinema, I had a cold mood and didn't plan to change. But this movie is an amazing power plant I am tired and want to take a shower after that. Then what do we have Theoretically, the story of the age of the origin of the Turkish teenage girl who lives in Copenhagen, Denmark. It was in my mind soon that the plot seemed to be borrowed from. "Bend it like Beckham" that we have an Indian girl playing football and destroying her sister's wedding. Here we have transferred to a Turkish girl, causing the wedding of her brother by doing kung fu. And we also have a love story and competition After I accepted this thing, this became a fascinating and exciting drama and it showed beautiful kung fu. (I'm not an expert) Female lead actor Semra Turan is not only a Danish female champion. But she also has great work, so it is safe to think that we are impressed by the autobiography here, taking into account that this is her first movie. Education as an actor The rest of the actors are ok. Intense kung fu cameras Sidenotes: - The male audience of Turkey shows respect for them to do the right thing. - The audience shouts when our heroine fights and attacks the children. The man who attacked her brother violently for revenge - Xian Gao, the Chinese martial arts instructor / actor (Hidden Tiger, Crouching Dragon) plays as the leader of the team. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see this thing In the cinema YOU may have It's a good and intense experience and I don't know if it works on a small screen as well.
