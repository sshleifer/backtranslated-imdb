I am not a fan of Steve Carell, but I like this movie about Dan. The writer of the recommended column went to his parents' house to rest with his children and fell in love with his brother's girlfriend. It is a story that has been told before. But this is not the case. There are a few bits that make this movie better than it should be. The actor is great and although Carell is not my cup of tea, he is quite good as a widower who thinks of everything. But found that knowledge is different from feelings and sometimes life makes you surprised Sometimes witty and clever in the way that Hallmark cards are annoying. The film also has a way to grow with you and be more than just a theater show.
