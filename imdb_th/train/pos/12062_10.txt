This movie scared me from the first day I saw <br /> <br /> My mother watched it when it came back to the TV in '92. I remember waking up in the middle of the night with a voice. Shouting for her tears because my father helped her up the stairs. <br /> <br /> She said something like. I asked what caused her to be upset and she told me that she was watching The Woman in Black. <br /> <br /> So I have to see it clearly. Even though I was only eleven years old, she gave it to me. It makes me very scared. I have escaped from horror movies since watching!
