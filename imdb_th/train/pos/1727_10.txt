The Wooden Horse is a very smart movie about the clever and successful escape plan that was carried out by British POW during World War II. It acts great with a sense of humor, especially the lines shown by Leo Genn, Anthony Steel and David Tomlinson. (Later, George Banks in Mary Poppin) has a miracle as both heroes. Tight direction and fast movement throughout Highly recommended
