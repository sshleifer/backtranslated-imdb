I must say that this movie is really amazing and warm. Reese Witherspoon is very charming and Jason London is not bad too! It looks so sweet that Dani fell in love and it broke my heart and also warmed my heart at the same time. However, it is even more interesting to see how interested he is. I have to admit that I ultimately want him to fall in love with Dani. It was so cute to see her falling in love with him. I didn't want her to be heartbroken. But the biggest tragedy I have ever seen in this movie Watching him die makes me cry all day. I can't believe it. However, there has never been a lovely relationship anymore in the movie Maureen and Dani. They can make it through anything. I give 9 stories because I don't want the court to die. But it is also one of the most amazing movies I've seen
