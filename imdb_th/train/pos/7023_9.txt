I like that the film remembers the ingenuity of the audience, causing the layer to peel off the characters through interactions about the unspoken losses that affect each person. <br /> <br /> The movie has The beauty and inspiration in reflecting the vision of the people I believe are very talented filmmakers with maturity and artistic understanding to tell. Story others to achieve. I see a bright future for writers / producers / directors with the ability to focus on goals and achieve honesty. <br /> <br /> Glory for this success.
