I have seen this important film tonight. Richard Gere and Claire's Dane are important and best work. Gere deserves an Oscar for his good portrayal of a man who was forced to retire as an administrator. Sex offender registration system Claire Danes is sensational as the woman takes the Handpicks to replace him - the woman he tries to teach everything he can while investigating the case. At the end of Gere's character is believed to be one of the things he was accused of being an administrator. The content is shocking, the sex offender and those who follow them. But this movie will not be forgotten soon I know that I will be possessed by Gere's image for a very long time. Not since Anthony Hopkins showed the serial killer with screen drawings that scared me. The movie was released with shocking statistics, so don't miss the open credits. Intense and memorable Richard Gere's best role proves that men can perform. Denmark is able to do well and both do very well in this challenging movie. <br /> <br /> This is a brave movie and Gere gives a performance that is multi-layered. Just give him an Academy Award now ... He deserves it!
