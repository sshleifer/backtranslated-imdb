I should admit. First of all, I'm a big fan of The Dandy Warhols. And that's why I came to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The outstandingness of this movie compared to Other modern rockumentaries are not just about one page of the band's history (such as "I try to destroy your heart", about Wilco), but it covers a long period of the history of the band. In this film, director / producer Ondi Timoner closely followed his friends / competitors The Brian Jonestown Massacre (BJM) and The Dandy Warhols (DW) for over 8 years (1995 - 2003) and filmed a long raw video. 1500 hours, cut more than 1:45 hours (future DVD release will have more content than the original movie). The results are surprising - no fillers - this movie is pure and 100% genuine. Know While the movie that you continue with the band for several years <br /> <br /> In the beginning the band's career, they promised. "Make a revolution" in making music and not selling spirits to the demons of "The Recording Industry" However, their routes were quickly separated - The Dandy Warhols signed with Capitol Records and became popular. (Especially in Europe) after only one album, while Brian Jonestown Massacre (which has destroyed himself, leader Anton Newcombe) (at least it was shown in the movie) and the following movie descended from The Brian Jonestown Massacre Compared to the way of The Dandy Warhols <br /> <br /> First of all, I am very pleased with the movie and how to tell the story of Anton Newcombe (for example Courtney Taylor - the leader of The Dandy Warhols - lecture) But after I thought I knew something was wrong with this movie, <br /> <br /> At first it was considered Anton Newcombe. Is the person who disappeared The project began in the year. Prof. 1995, as a documentary about a promising emerging group whose Anton Newcombe and Ondi Timoner are equal partners. (That's why every year Ondi Timoner can't reach both bands). It is Anton Newcombe, who brings The Dandy Warhols to the project. He is eventually ignored as if he was fired from the project. Everyone talked about BJM, but he didn't participate in the discussion. I guess he will not be notified even when the group starts the final editing process. There are always stories on both sides, and here we have only one story ... Of course, as Anton will not approve the final result and see that the film is a betrayal of his old friend <br /> <br >> Second, this movie is very Dandy Warhols-biased. Of course, the winner will get everything. But the fact that Courtney Taylor (the head of the DW) described (although it was a good choice - it gave the feeling of closer involvement) and the band's late history. That music Covering until 1997, and DW - until 2003) did not add neutrality to the movie. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, this film is quite shallow. Want to teach us One critic said: "... the movie examines the old question: where genius enters the world of trading? Can it grow and be determined or have to destroy yourself to maintain its integrity? "No, it doesn't test these questions! It shows the story of a great musician. But without success, lectured by great musicians But without success, those who soak up the self-confidence and the eternal coldness of the higher mountains <br /> <br /> fun movies - it's raw, fresh, it's stylish ... just a god Interested at least for DW or BJM fans for the rest of the people - I don't know ...
