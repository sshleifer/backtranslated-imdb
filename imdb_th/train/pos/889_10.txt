This is one of Hong Kong's best movies (action) and has exciting and exciting stories, including great fighting scenes. This Sammo movie has everything, romance, drama, excitement and superheroes. Excellent as well It's the only martial arts movie that made me interested in this story, rather than just waiting to fight Sammo fans - this is something to watch (see Eastern Condors, Shanghai Express (Yuen Biao is Ace!), The dragon forever and into the dragon. fat
