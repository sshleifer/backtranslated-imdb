After watching "Guinea Pig", there are two questions in my heart (other than 'Are I really a psychopath?'): 'Is it a smell?' The answer is no; Although it is the closest thing to the film, the smell that I have seen. Then they found where the woman was Because she had been tortured for 45 minutes without any reason (in fact, nothing in this movie!): Fingernails torn off, beaten by hands, feet, tools and infested worms and many more until the final scene (I haven't Sure they do that) because it is 'The underground scene of Japan' is so obvious that she doesn't get a lot of money. What is your inspiration? <br /> <br /> I saw it in Japanese without subtitles. But it is not a problem (There is no real conversation. The boys are insulting her in some scenes.) I haven't seen the whole series yet. The first "Guinea Pig" is not yet known. I still give 8 points because if the purpose of making people believe that this is a bad smell, the problem is quite good (ask Charlie Sheen, the actor), but I think they should go far more than they did in the next story.
