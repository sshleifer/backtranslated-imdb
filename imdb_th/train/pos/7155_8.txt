More than "movies for children", "holes" see how past events will affect us today, whether we know about them or not. When the teenage Stanley Yelnat III (Chie Bu Bubo) was sent to a concentration camp where he was forced to dig all day, he discovered things about the camp and his personal relationship with it. Through the incident, we know that there are many things that are closer than we perceive. (You will understand this better when you watch movies.) LeBoeuf works quite well, just like other actors: Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson, Henry Winkler, Patricia Arquette and Eartha Kitt. Very interesting movie.
