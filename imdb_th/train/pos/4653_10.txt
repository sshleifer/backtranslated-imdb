This movie is an interesting English comedy and is a story that I can watch over and over again without being tired. Peter Ustinov never played a bad role and this is an exception, especially with his drought master plan But very smart, Karl Malden has always been an admirer of my mine since he performed in 'Streets of San Francisco'. I believe Maggie Smith is the true star of this film. But it seems that he is not good at everything she is trying to do But in reality it was opened, especially at the end when she told everyone that she had invested so much money on her. Discovered while washing his clothes One thing that worries me is that there are people who can tell me why I can't buy this in DVD or VHS format in the UK.
