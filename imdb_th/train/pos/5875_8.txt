These are one movie that doesn't require brain or thought. It's a very funny moment that you forget in the next hour or so. I was really surprised with the performance of John Abraham. He often played as a gangster like a character with an emotionless face. So, from then on, the complete opposite play and success by manipulating the shining among Comic geniuses such as Paresh Rawal and Akshaye Kumar. I was quite surprised by Akshaye's three girls because they had a role that didn't require much talent. But most lament about Akshaye's disapproval (with other women). I was surprised when they managed to create and real people. It's good. Most songs are good, colorful and fun. So, on a boring Sunday, which will make your mood lighter.
