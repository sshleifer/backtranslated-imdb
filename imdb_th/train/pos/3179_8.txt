Who created this movie? Do I love this movie? Someone has a strange sense of humor ... <br /> <br /> Attractive Zany movie style. But it is difficult to create - or easily forgotten - the content and characters that have real spirits is what gives the depth of the film Without a joke, it is just an idea. It might laugh. But it makes you like a good half hamburger ... anyway ... <br /> <br /> Crosseyed may not intend to change anyone's life. But I appreciate the depth and content They secretly come to you. I started this movie by thinking that "Oh, I understand - indie comedy - outside the wall - Gonzo ... yup" and it is like that - but if you pay attention, there will be sub-messages and moments when the characters fill In this sense, breathing movies It makes the offer paused - if you are ready to see them - and of course it will go in a frantic way. <br /> <br /> You will miss the point if you don't sign. Promised to suppress faith in the time of the movie Moving between reality and exaggeration is one of the key points of this film. <br /> <br /> Crosseyed is not perfect. I want more. <br /> <br /> The dining room scene is perfect. <br /> <br /> Put on your seat belt.
