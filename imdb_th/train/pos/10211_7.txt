Narrative ?? Whether it's an epic, a painting or a poem? In general, try to avoid characters that may be too Ultimately, readers and audiences may all be too overwhelmed by trying to track who is who. I think this is especially true because we cannot easily go back to restore our memories in the cinema. However, viewers like me don't have that problem because we watch all of our movies on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> Last year I got to know Audrey Tautou, the first French actor I saw. The great fate of Amelie Poulain (2001) and later in a very long battle (2004), both of which were elaborately created and complicated stories with large characters. Previous proposals have more than both other things: more and more complicated characters. <br /> <br /> Now, other directors have used those techniques before: Robert Altman and The Player (1992 ), Short Cuts (1993), Gosford Park (2001) and others; Paul Thomas Anderson did the same as Magnolia (1999). Stanley Kramer teamed up with A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World in 1963. Which is a funny movie about a great proportion The difference of this film is that first of all, the director allowed us to 'see' in the head of some characters and two scenes, some scenes were repeated to refresh the memories of the audience when the story fluctuated at different times. Together /> <br /> basic? The main thing to say ?? A story about a young woman, Irene (Tautou), who told a fellow traveler on the train that she would meet her true love that day. This happened in the first few minutes of the movie. The wise irony point at this time is that Irene doesn't know that the young man is opposite. (Gilbert Robin) may be 'true love' and he doesn't ... <br /> <br /> They go in a different way without realizing the importance that may arise from Their close encounters However, chaos resulted in the whole day not only But for two young people only But for the rest of the characters that appear in the series that are cleverly created and interlinked with vignettes that seem to be nowhere and ... <br /> <br /> If the story is easy, it may be It's quite boring and predictable. Otherwise, the script and the director create our expectations with a scene of innovation that is common. But became an extraordinary and convincing event that made both lovers meet again For example, the next time some birds from the sky fall into your book or paper, consider your options. Two characters create a clear choice that must happen before Irene and the fateful men meet again. Or rock fragments floating on your windshield? Considering again what will happen ... <br /> <br /> All of that is interesting enough. The more interesting thing for me was to evaluate each new man who came and tried to decide whether this man was THE ONE for Irene or not. In fact, the young man on the train That makes me guess for a moment. <br /> <br /> I'll let you think about that if you see this fun play. <br /> <br /> Recommended for everyone.
