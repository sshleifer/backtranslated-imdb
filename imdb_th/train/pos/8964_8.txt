With the same joy that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak make Alfred Hitchcock his masterpiece, "Vertigo", they do this joke. Maybe both actors need to do it. After passing the Hitchcock movie, whatever the matter, the great partner of "Vertigo" because it explores the unbelievable but powerful love in reality, the movie can be viewed as a flip side of "Vertigo " with Happy ending Nova here has been changed again in Vertigo. She plays as two women and here she turns from witches to humans. Stewart was once again bewitched and tortured because of her love for her. Unlike Vertigo, both come together in the "Bell Book and Candle", the perfect antidote for Hitcock movies. Once again, the dynamics of love and gravity are examined. But in a completely different vein The actors were excellent. Lemmon, hilarious as Novak and Elsa Lancaster's older brother, gave a classic performance as Aunt Ernie Kovacs as an alcoholic writer, and of course Hermin Gold played as a competitor. Novak's is great. The scene with Stewart drinking medicine is the best joke. Anyone who has seen Vertigo or even if you shouldn't see this memorable comedy
