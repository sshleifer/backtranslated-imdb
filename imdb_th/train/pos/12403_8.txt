You should forgive to think that the Finnish director from Helsinki would not be good at directing American horror movies. (Especially movies in the US prison) - see this to prove you're wrong! It was produced in the 1980s, after all, and the movie was created on a budget that is suitable for modern TV advertising. A modern DIY company (something I think everyone will really notice today, actually everyone Familiar with the $ 100m budget + industry mind!) Is Harlin's first major producer and at least what today will become the protagonist. I still think that the majority of European participation in the film industry is related to Stellan Stargaard's on-screen appearance (not to mention the exaggerated Bergman director's efforts). For every female audience - proving that there is a suitable movie talent outside the US and Hollywood so we can watch movies with suspicion. Try watching this movie, even if you're not a horror puff. IMO is definitely worth it!
