I like Top Gun. It holds my interest. Predictable plot, proper character development and story It is quite similar to High Noon, where people in the city look weak and afraid to stand up for the villains. This film has some quality actors who do not have the opportunity to share all their abilities. Some actors do not receive credit for their role. Denver Pyle is a good person. At a young age, John Dehner, Rod Taylor stands out in their roles. Sterling Hayden does the best he can with bad material Hard to imagine that he was a sharpshooter Laura, played by Karen Booth, is an abominable character. It seems that she is proud that two men might fight with her. Ugh. In the end, how can people travel without baggage? Especially women
