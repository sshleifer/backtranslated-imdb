"Cube" (1997), Vincenzo's first film, is one of the most interesting and complex ideas I have ever seen when talking about movies. They have only one scene, actors and plot. So what makes it so special is the direction that is effective, the wonderful dialogue and the strange conditions that the characters have to deal with like mice in the maze His second movie "Cypher" (2002) is a story about its story. But it is not as good as "Cube", but this is a character that has been tested like I am again He locked the character again in a very different area without having to play with the character again, like playing with a rat in the experience room. But instead of a sci-fi movie (Even some advertisers and trailers seem like that) "Nothing" is a light and light comedy that can definitely be called a modern word about society. We are living again at Vicenzo. We were surprised by the wonderful ideas of the little things, the two actors and the extreme white situation. That's all you have most of the time and you don't want more While the "Cube" is an awkward experience and "Cypher" causes confusion. "Nothing" is entirely opposite. But at the same time, desperate. <br /> <br /> This film proves once again that Just a millionaire budget Of course, movies sometimes fail. But its main idea is very meaningful There is nothing to say about this movie anymore because everything is surprising and the completely different experience I have in the movie since "Cube".
