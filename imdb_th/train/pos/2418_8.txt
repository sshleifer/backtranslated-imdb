One of John's Funniest, Eugene Levy is great in this regard. Just hope that the studio will figure out that this movie needs to be on the DVD. I have it in a videotape. But felt that this film deserves a great DVD Never appeared on TV But it is the most waste It's a matter of hilarity when editing for TV broadcast. If you can find a video that I would like to recommend you buy (EBay is a good place to search for a copy.) I will keep my VHS until one day. There are many great movies that have not been released on DVD and this is one of them.
