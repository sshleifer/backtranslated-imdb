This is one of the best crime drama movies in the late 1990s. It is full of great actors, powerful stories and many of the players involved. Pachino is great. What should he be nominated for? John Cusack is also good, as long as the audience is not interested in the Louuu-siana accent. He may come off annoying if you can't stand it with this language. The way in which Pacino's characters interact with the characters of Cusack is incredible, incredible, and slightly funny. Sometimes Danny Aiello is great. As always, David Paymer is a great person in the supporting role. Bridget Fonda is good but not memorable There are times when this image speaks of many characters, probably too much. It may take two seconds to remember "which Zapatti is?" After having many references, we have to stop and think about the conclusion. The ending is not many punches. It was built for a long time and then slightly decreased. This is one of the few problems of the movie. Since the film was not being billed as a popular and popular movie, some people forgot that this movie actually existed. Pacino and Aiello are great. But the movie "splash" that was missing in the cinema may not be nominated It was very successful in the home market and the audience still learned that this name was there. Created in 1996, it still stands out today and will remain popular over the years. <br /> <br /> Try to make lemon pudding yourself.
