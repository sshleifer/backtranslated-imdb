I saw this movie in the first second. T.R's voice took me to travel - well, I didn't like the big glued thumb at first. But its ridiculous humor and the arrogant look of both actors, sisters - I do not know who plays her young - but she is excellent and is uma !!! - <br /> <br /> the other two The people in the cinema went out after about half an hour. I was with a friend - and it was always a test to watch a movie that I liked well with one of my friends - and both of us were both fun - Hilarious - Kwai Grief about "real police - normal" We both are fans of T.Robbins books ... I think it works well - think that Robbins will approve as well, even though I don't have an idea if he likes movies or not. ... <br /> <br /> I like to see things cut off - I heard that gus v. sand has to use a lot of scenes because the first audience (or the producer ???) still It's an art movie, too short, but ... it's one of my forever favorites. - and I realize that most people cannot stand to watch that kind of movie and think that those who like this movie are what they think ... .... unfortunately Hopefully there will be a day with DVDs with full materials - hopefully to see a sharper frame keanu - expecting to see your children and <br /> <br /> all if you have the opportunity. Saw it Think first and then enjoy it. If you choose to watch ...
