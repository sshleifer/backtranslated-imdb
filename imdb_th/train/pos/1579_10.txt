I saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival which received a applause! This film tells the story of my knowledge that had never been seen before - about Rosenstrasse (the road in Berlin), the riots of German women who married Jews at the end of World War II. As such, it is a unique story, and more than that is the only film about the catastrophe that I have ever seen that shows that there is a GOOD Germanans (an assistant family in "Anne Frank" like the Dutch) that does not support. The Nazis and in fact have the patience to stand against the immorality and cruelty of their country during the Nazi regime that is at risk of being alive. The performance is excellent throughout the storyboard in New York, interesting and complex, the direction from Von Trotta, who specializes in every scene and production values, including outstanding movies. Of course, families in New York can speak German. Many immigrants in this country choose to speak their mother tongue with their families - commonly occurring. Therefore, the criticism is unreasonable. Speaking more than this will impair your experience. This film has a length But i didn't watch my watch again I hope this film will be some distribution in North America. But this movie is a masterpiece only But it can help heal the hatred that people have for the Germans because of Hitler's support If this movie plays in your area, I wish you to watch! You will be glad you did!
