Page 3 **** from 4 stars <br /> <br /> Madhvi (Konkona Sen) enters her boyfriend's house and it is empty. She looks here and goes to his bedroom and you get the picture - 'Ah! another girl ?? That was a baddie, two strokes, and yes, of course. He had both of her strokes, but it was GUY at this time and I said, 'Great!' <br /> <br /> The end of the spoiler. (The top scene is not really a spoiler ... but for me it is so I don't want to have a chance) <br /> <br /> When asked what the movie was, my friend replied that 'Oh, it's just the revelation of the P3 people', which makes me believe that I will watch stupid movies if nothing more. When I went to the theater, I thought to myself, '' Should I bring a pen and paper to write bad things about this movie? ' And some people because I can only collect products This film is excellent. Excellent, not because it's an unusual and non-commercial movie, like the story. But because of the ingenuity of the screenplay and the way this movie tells you how to handle the movie wisely, which should be a silly and absurd movie if in the wrong hands. <br /> <br /> Konkona Sen Sharma is grace. She was so beautiful that she completely emphasized her role as if she were born to play this role. One of the most charming actresses I've ever seen But this is not a good solo performance in the movie. There are Sandhya Mridul, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni, especially Sandhya Mridul, who just shot up the screen. (And guessing what even the unusual Tara Sharma emphasizes as usual) <br /> <br /> The movie stars go out with the stupid old party of celebrities in the film and al industry. The movie is about And about half an hour through the movie, you will feel the same But then the movie caught the pace that entered the story well and would not let it go. Even Boman Irani agreed with that statement ?? 'It's a good story, Madhvi' (Thank you). The great thing is that it handles the problem that these people have stupid styles and don't do it and fix social problems and don't make them boring. In the end, the roller coaster ride and Madhvi let us know that just smiling at everyone. Just the reason I like watching movies. Creating a happy movie The screenplay is beautiful, intelligent and witty.
