We have high expectations for this... Because Zombi 3 is the sequel to Zombi 2, directed by Lucio Fulci .. However .. directed by Bruno Mattei (from Night of the Zombies) and not written by Dardino Sachetti But by Claudio Fagrasso (Night of the Zombies) and filming in Phillimines such as Night of the Zombies and similar to the Night of the Zombies (Hell of Zombies) The Living Dead. the Living Dead More than Zombi 2 Fabrazio DeAngelis Producer Zombi 2 and Tomassi (?) Editors and efx gianetto De Rossi Let Zombi's Magic 2. Zombi 3 is not a magic .. It's like peanut butter and a sandwich that doesn't have peanut butter. But over the years, I grew up to receive Zombi 3. I swear that I saw the military version bitten in the arm and went to the hotel room .. with the unconscious Fulci-cut and Mattei / Fulci-cut. Is one of the DVDs
