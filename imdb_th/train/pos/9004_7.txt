I have doubts about other love stories that people with disabilities find meaning and redemption through honest communication. And it's still not in my top rankings, but performances from Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh and are almost amazing examples and help these things from being an actor Carter's picture about the ALS victim is strong, perhaps for too long. (Occasionally, her conversation breaks down into muttering words that cannot be distinguished) but the overall impact is commendable and rewarding. Branagh may be the perfect compliment for her performance. <br /> <br />
