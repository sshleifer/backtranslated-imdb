Back in the days of a large studio system, the decision to make a serious actor Very talented American James Stewart, all appearing as Hungarians in The Shop Around the Corner. If I were to be cast, Kralik's part would probably fit Charles Boyer. His accent was mixed with all other European accents. Happened. Stewart had the same problem in Mortal Storm as well. Margaret Sullavan <br /> <br /> Margaret Sullavan is his most common leading woman on the screen. He made four movies with her. But was the only one who didn't die. Sullavan and Leland Heyward, her husband, knew Stewart on the day he was a struggling player in New York. In fact, Salavan's husband is a good friend of Stewart Henry Fonda. <br /> <br /> I think only Clark Gable can be an American. Stewart in The Mortal Storm in German But all the other players are Americans as well, so there is nothing outstanding. <br /> <br /> But if you accept Stewart better than you can see the good movie from Ernest Lubitsch, the plot Quite simply, men and women who work in department stores in Budapest do not go on their own. But it seems that they have contact with some anonymous people who become each other Frank Morgan also wondered if Stewart was wrong with kanoodling with his wife. <br /> <br /> Although the prospect of good and Frank Morgan left his usual messy character, the player The two most well-known ones are Felix Brescart and Joseph Shield Great. Bressart has a moment that I like in the movie when he starts after Morgan starts asking opinions from people. He makes himself very rare. <br /> <br /> And Joseph Shield Great, who is always a good person, is like a nasty little worm that keeps kissing Frank Morgan. You hate. I really know Schildkraut too much in real life, working in the office 24 hours a day. Sadly, it pays a lot of time.
