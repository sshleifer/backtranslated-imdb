9/11 is a classic example of a verite movie which is a documentary about the truth in the case of a New York firefighter as they fight with one of the most special events in world history. It is a small handheld video camera that is not annoying and is often cleared by the poor quality of most filming. (And by the hands of director Naudet frequently wiping the screen) <br /> <br /> In this movie you Get to know most firefighters - Tony Benatatos, rookie (or 'probie', in NY's original firemen), fire chief Joseph Pfeiffer (who found that he lost his brother later) and a few more person There are interviews in the studio with most of these people throughout the story to emphasize the privacy of the incident. The collection is quite amazing and especially well done. The award ceremony at the fire department, along with the useful pan and the revision of the movie's deeds, is quite limited (just like Rob Reiner's A Few Good Men). <br /> <br /> The views and angles of the camera are usually from firefighters, which are interesting and have great pictures from within the WTC1 lobby while Pfeiffer and the team plan what to do next - this is the factory. The film classic course. There is also a terrifying, haunting sound of the human body, occasionally colliding with the outside terrace. After that, the great Fife Pfeiffer became aware that his work was desperate and hopeless - and this was before WTC2 collapsed. You must give credit to Naudet for knowing what movie to face and At what time <br /> <br /> The sound of the nearby collapse of WTC2 is sad, scary and scary until you realize what this test is. Fireman From the lobby, it seems like feeling and sounding like the end of the world, and the poor firefighters look confused and scared. You hear a huge monster that vibrates like a huge giant animal, a stone pillar falling slowly to the ground after a serious injury - the nearby tower collapsed. But the remaining fire team in WTC1 is not interested in this event Where is the communication? <br /> <br /> This movie is charming. But the narrative is not expert and should be avoided - cues like 'This is a unique day' or the repeated pronunciation of Naudet that you see fear in everyone's eyes 'and' I know Tony is falling. love '! This movie is a really long video diary. There is no image from the building up to the fireman, some people go. Imagine this film that combines images from CCTV from some higher rooms or parts of news reports from the date The result will be even greater. You can also combine this with Mayor Giuliani, and perhaps the famous Cornish Manicris Corla, which has many layers acting as heroes. <br /> <br /> I don't see the propaganda elements. In this matter Movies as some reviewers recommend This film is not a Triumph of the Will by Riefenstahl. Soon after, a firefighter decorated the American flag near a surviving building that could see what became Ground Zero. <br /> <br / > There are also some suspicious camerawork moments, such as who is holding the camera when two Naudet brothers gather at the fire station. Is it a scene? <br /> <br /> There are many wonderful decorations in the traditional style of Alain Resnais, the great French director (Hiroshima mon amour) with two lights reflected in the water.
