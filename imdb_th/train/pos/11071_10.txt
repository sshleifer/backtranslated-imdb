I gave ten out of ten, one of the best movies ever. Amazing and amazing with Jason Statham's superb play, Ray Liotta and all the staff. Amazing plot ... just look into yourself. But there are all the answers you have ever looked for ... the best answer mr Ritchie! Best ever Those who are looking for simple thinking and groaning will shout that they are disappointed. But there are many shallow movies in Hollywood. Today you can't remember what it was about the next day you saw. On the other hand, Revolver is unique. I almost never thought of it. It is possible to convey a clear and intelligent image of yourself to everyone who has to watch it. There is no place to compare surprisingly, amazingly ... Anyone can fully understand this view. I do not doubt it. In fact, there is no word that can show my appreciation ... I still wonder how it was possible to shoot this movie after many years of Hollywood garbage that we watched. Thank you from all my heart. It is the best.
