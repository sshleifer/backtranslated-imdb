This movie is so complicated that it can give any explanation and still spin. You have an unstable, happy, and fascinating main character (played by Jean-Pierre Léaud) that is stuck between two women (not three). We listen to his social, philosophical and moral thoughts in the collection. Alone, endlessly, we saw that he used his magic around the three women he loved This may be evidence for a chicken movie that is full of cold, cold comments, but director Jean Eustache tries to make it fresh, ridiculous and witty. Is a movie that is very long, no one laughs But when laughing after 2 hours of politically speaking, Jean-Pierre Léaud suddenly screams on the phone as he remembers the magical line from the movie. This type of situation is all movies and cannot be fully recovered in the opinion. No one can restore the sadness and beauty of Francois Lebrun at the end of the movie 3 and 1/2 hours and worth every minute.
