Soylent Green I found it a great movie. <br /> <br /> If you like Logan Run, you will like this. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is old and has no special effects and some. at The show can be best described as "wonderful", but the story is excellent. <br /> <br /> The story of the world that can be and the social impact is very strong. <br /> <br /> In the episode The end of the mystery is not a mystery. But it is a story that can be easily achieved in the right rhythm. <br /> <br /> It's close to the present day, the closest is Is the third world
