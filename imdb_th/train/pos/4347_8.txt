I will not talk too much about the story of this movie because other reviewers have said the same thing. <br /> <br /> Just want to say that I really like this movie. Peter's performance Falk alone is reasonable for watching movies. <br /> <br /> A small 'road trip' movie with Falk & Paul Reiser in northern New York during the fall is a scene for most actions in Movies. <br /> <br /> Write well, taking into account the target group that is mature. A lot of truthful humor and some good plays give you the feeling that it may be your own family. <br /> <br /> Can't say enough about this movie, except that it's amazing. Shame at the cute movie This will not be revealed more while others leave the garbage there. <br /> <br /> It's great to see Falk and the great leader again and he does. It gives the most benefit. It proved that John Casavettes, his famous friend and writer, was right in selecting Falk in his 60s and 70s movies.
