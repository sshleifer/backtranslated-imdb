Some men that you have to chill out This movie is an art genius. Instead of searching for a reason or message to reason your reality, why don't you understand it is a work of fiction? Stories. Entertainment for the benefit of God (Not pun intended) for me. It seems that many people here try to be movie critics - and they don't do well. I was impressed by the movie and the work of Bill Paxton's director that I would personally contact him to tell him. Yes, if you didn't try to analyze the heck from the possibility of the story, you might enjoy the movie. Me and all my friends do!
