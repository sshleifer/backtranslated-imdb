Losing holds something interesting for everyone. You can say a lot about this series and have a lot to say about it, so I'm not going to spell you again. Just read the loved ones and you'll know why you want to see them. The good thing about this series is that it's all new. There are not many movies - and even less - the series based on the theme of suspense only, but Lost Life to the theme with pride. It's a matter of unexplained and if you combine it with a new place, a good map twist, a great actor and a good style (Current and past, combined in one episode) You will have a series that every episode is a story of it's own but is part of a bigger storytelling You want to have all the insights of the characters, you want to see the whole picture and you want to know where the writer is taking you. The result is that it's a series that doesn't let you go. When knowing more, the series went under slightly in season 2, probably because of their own success. It is known that Lost was written only once in the first season and when overwhelming success, the author was also overwhelmed.

Season 3 delivers a thorough understanding to replace some with new questions. And that is how they should write; You want to confuse the plot from one scene to another, not getting the secret from the tsunami scattered around you. Then pick up a few to explain to the audience. They received us in Season 3 and brought us a series that has a future for Season 4. It's good to see that the different styles of the series are very popular.
