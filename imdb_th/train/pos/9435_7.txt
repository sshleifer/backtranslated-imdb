Liberation is the horror / thriller of John Borman about four Atlanta businessmen. (Bert Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Betty and Ronnie Cox) who travel on a canoe During the raft, there are unpleasant things that happen to men. Despite the nasty events in this picture But Borman still captures the natural beauty of the river as well. The location is very good. In fact, this story is still a very interesting movie. Lush forests and gentle landscapes make the horror even more frightening, not only a beautiful place. But still shooting beautiful pictures with the camera of Vilmos Zsigmond. It is said that Bert Reynolds' acting as a Lewis actor is an actor in this film. However, I think Jon Woy steals acting with his role as a family in the suburban Ed, which is forced to quickly change his behavior in order to survive. In fact, the scene that climbs is not an actor. Daredevil. It is the Voight itself. The soundtrack is especially noteworthy. The performances of Eric Weissberg and Steve Mendel about guitars and banjo as part of the sequence Dueling Banjos are still one of the best soundtracks in film history for The intensity of the show At a few points in the movie, we are treated more softly, banjo songs that give a very pleasant journey to travel down the river. For all the good points of this movie, I find it lacking a little purpose. It doesn't create much doubt and it's not as scary as we believe. The story is quite bad and doesn't go anywhere. However, this movie has a good enough score to get my advice. I like it, but for fans of blood, there isn't much. In fact, in fact. It is not a horror movie as a slightly altered adventure. Think like Rambo: The first blood found three men in the boat looking for the very young Charley Boorman as the son of Ed. I like this movie, the movie soundtrack and the performances that have earned it deserve 7 out of 10.
