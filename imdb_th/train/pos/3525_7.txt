Man, this is a DVD that is hard to follow. I can only find in Part 2, which is imported from Spain and is expensive. <br /> <br /> Is it worth it? Yes, not so much because it is a masterpiece of filmmaking but directed by Curt Siodmak (credit On IMDb.com, read "Robert" but the list of DVDs, Curt credits) or because there are a few numbers familiar from other murder puzzles - Elisha Cook, Jr. and Thomas Gomez - but because of my curiosity about the movie This story has been for decades. Finally, I am satisfied. <br /> <br /> Essentially, engineers with respect. By his separate wife and found himself in a New York bar with two tickets in his pocket A woman with a strange hat on the bench next to him, and he invites her to participate in a polite music review. She accepts a little grief. The bartender mopey to both eyes while they are away. <br /> <br /> To show a star full of chaos, notice that women in the audience wear hats. The same leaves and erupted in anger The drummer in the prison, the prison, looks quietly but doesn't get answers Curtis took the woman to her house and asked her name. But she won't give it to her and she doesn't want to know him If she is a devotee, Longfellow, she will say something about the ship that passed by at night. <br /> <br /> Okay Curtis went home to find that his wife was killed in the place. That he does not exist Gomez, the police chief, turned to Da. His only excuse is that he is with a ghost woman that no one can remember - not a bartender, not an actor. Latina is not a taxi driver ("Alp Alp"), not a drummer - and because women Own Has disappeared, it is impossible to dig her up. <br /> <br /> Curtis was convicted and sentenced to death. But Inspector Gomez thinks about things and decides that she is innocent because no one has a brain to think about. He joins Ella Raines, Curtis's beloved secretary, in an informal investigation. br /> <br /> They again visited the supposed witnesses. The barman is a bad omen running through the car, perhaps not accidentally, so he comes out of the picture. Hot temperament Latina has left the show because she is closed and she doesn't cooperate with people who don't know the hat. Elijah Cook Jr. is strangled by a real killer. But not before he acted in the scene in which he drilled in a modified jazz group His sweaty face is considered an expression that does not point to intense focus. But is a terrifying insanity His eyes swung to the mouth of the mouth, open his mouth, his hammering became mad. I laughed out loud. <br /> <br /> Who's acting is not outstanding? But there is enough professionalism Thomas Gomez always trusted However, the best performance may come from Franchot Tone. He is a real killer and he forged excuses. He reserved and art Even when he was faint, he had manners. I do not know how to use this precisely, but Tone seems to think the same as his acting. Alan Curtis, as an innocent engineer, is near zero at the Kelvin level and is in the picture B <br /> < br /> I don't know why it's classic. It is your basic murder mystery by Cornell Woolrich, which is not as good as everyone else, but the direction of Siodmak is sensitive. A man runs in and his hat is blown into the pipe with water flowing around. His performance is quiet. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I received.
