This film is close to my favorite celluloid. There is not much I want or want to say here, except maybe "watch this movie" and "enjoy the great work of Daniel and Pascal" who takes you through stories that are funny and heartbreaking. > <br /> Seeing this movie made me think seriously about the way I spent my eight days = my life! It seems that some of us are wasting valuable time doing things that we think we have to do. Whether it's a favorite career or just watching TV and ballgames, what we often miss is the satisfaction of being something for others - making a difference. About taking time and time to be natural and alive - now! (On the eighth day) ... At least that's what I received from 'eight days'.
