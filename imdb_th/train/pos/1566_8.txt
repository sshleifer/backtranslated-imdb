Sanders It is a prudent choice - Saunders will often play a bad role with the "good role" from time to time (ffoliott abroad Montgomery in RAGE IN HEAVEN) Here, he has the intention to bend the rules and violate the law briefly as "heavy people" while he looks good and behaves to make the warrior a shady hero like Chester Moe Norris "Boston Blackie" and (as far as) Peter Lorre's "Mr. Moto" <br /> <br /> The movie is not the best mystery movie series - but it's useful. Like the series of Rathbone's Holmes or Olan Chan's series, the actors often have actors repeatedly or play a new role (anti-heroine in the film, played by Wendy Barry, which will appear in The second film in the series) This movie and a little familiar makes this series a comfortable experience for audiences who hear the voice of the conversation.

Jerome Cowan) will receive Barry and her gang The only detective who seems to have a chance to solve the problem is Jonathan Hale, who is the shadow of Xander. <br /> <br /> Actors have a good time in the script - Hell (now a special food) being tempted to eat lobsters, many dinners made for Sanders. By Willie Best, he felt a severe stomach ache, causing Sanders and Barry to escape Sanders' apartment The best must remind him. (When he feels better) to head to the place where Sanders told him to go for a period of time. <br /> <br /> There is also an interesting role for Gilbert Emery to always play as a good person. (Such as a husband who has been defeated in two worlds), he plays a weak, dominant social character here - death that is reminiscent of the characters in the Bogart movie. <br /> <br /> By combining the movies that were made out Come well in the second half of the cinema bill in 1939. It will entertain you even if not in your memory.
