<br /> <br /> "Burning Paradise" is a combination of Neo Shaw Brothers action and the cynicism of Ringo Lam. When people watch movies, they may feel that the fight scenes are But moderate nature But it doesn't matter if it's a matter of attitude and atmosphere that is important This great movie has both !! Always trying to make it different from his version. Lam gave us a traditional hero (Fong Sai-Yuk and Hung Shi-Kwan) and put them in the setting of "Raiders of the Lost Ark". The light that you might see in Jet Li movies But these people fight for death with brutal results What makes this movie better is that anyone can die anywhere, anytime, without stopping. Unfortunately they didn't make this movie more often.
