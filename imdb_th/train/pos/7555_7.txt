Negligent sex has a little more sex for the x-files. Now there is interesting evidence, a good story. But the desired ending Of Bender is an x-debut file for actor Nicholas Lea, better known as Alex Krycek. He now plays Michael, a man who was attacked by "The Kindred". The starting point is less than Nic Lea's. Interesting things about "The power of temptation" of kinship. When Marty makes his victim, they turn to him. However, when Andrew tempts Scully, she only gets confused and drunk and doesn't attract Andrew. It may be because Marty has more experience than Andrew. Now reminds me of why sometimes it is miserable to be filmed in British Columbia. During that time, it was so wet and muddy. Despite ending up disappointed, negligent sex remains an appropriate episode for watching.
