This crime thriller is similar to the Noir movie, although the context from post-war is cold and there is something quite good to say about humanity in "Pickup on South Street". Police are good people, criminals are genuine and enemies. The only one is "The Commies", which will ultimately be different from the good people in the story that they have a good mood with care. The value of himself as shown in the close-up close-up that makes the movie a blemish. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the characters. The personality of this film is quite unique and detailed: across the bag that can stare at danger and sometimes while having to go through their personal possessions. Nepenthes, who tried to keep the body remarkably But who will catch and respect almost all other characters (and viewers); The innocent, innocent Kandy girl who thinks she only works for the government and doesn't understand the conspiracy plans she is fully involved with. And Joey, an ex-boyfriend of Commie baddie who tries to hide everything from everyone and ironically the worst person to do that Throw characters that support bright colors. (Such as a guy with chopsticks and police) and "Pickup on South Street" let you experience a great personality while they find the mysterious and stolen microfilm accidentally> <br /> --PolarisDiB
