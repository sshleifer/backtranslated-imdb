Critics do not like this movie. It exploded in the United States and as a result has been limited in the UK. Which is a great shame because it is more representative of England than American humor and should be shown in the United Kingdom for the first time. <br /> <br /> Nicole Kidman looks amazing and is Russian. Totally reliable Ben Chaplin is the character of Dustin Hoffman from 'Graduation' and 'Girl's Birthday'. There are at least 4 scenes that remind the classic audience in 1960 (even if it was broken. Completely different!) <br /> <br /> Of course, it has changed many times since the comedies are black comedies to thriller until adventure - but it's memorable, moving and inhaling. Fresh air compared to large blockbuster /> <br /> With an average open mind <br!
