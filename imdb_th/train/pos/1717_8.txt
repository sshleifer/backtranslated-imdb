This story is about Ankush (Abhay Deol) - who is a witness of a marriage career. In the short term, he acts as a witness to couples in the marriage registration office - and Megha (Soha Ali Khan), who fled the house at Nainital for marriage Interested in the love of Dhiraj (Shayan Munshi). The story begins from Mekha, waiting for the marriage registration office of Theer to appear. But for some reason he did not appear, so Ankush came into the picture here, who approached Mega with the intention of receiving RS 200 for his witness work and he helped her by finding a place Covering her, Ankush grew up working in a bank as an agent ... Ankush fell in love with Meg and she fell in love with him. (Or love) both agree with the marriage and Dhiraj comes back in the form of an unexpected situation. I should say that the expected situation and unexpected reaction and then ... <br /> <br /> Actually, movies are a little different from the movies we see and I don't think it's acceptable. But if you are a movie fanatic like me and like to see something different, you will definitely like this movie. This movie is just an innocent love story that is very well-received by the characters of Abhay Deol and Soha Ali Khan. The characters look so natural that you feel as though what is happening to the people beside them. The soundtrack of this film has a very good role. It's too good. The way in which New Delhi is shown is very good and refreshing. <br /> <br /> So, we cut it out and combined it. <br /> <br /> Story: A typical story that is going well. And <br /> <br /> Song: Because it's the creation of Himesh Reshammiya, so I don't expect much. But I still like the music of this film, including Qawwali. <br /> <br >> Acting: Abhay Deol is the most impressive, natural and innocent actor. But he should stay away from singing Soha Ali Khan. She is a very cute doll doll that I have to say. The acting is naive and natural again, and both of these actors fit well with their characters. In addition to these two things, Shayan Munshi needs some acting lessons and may have a few fat layers to cover the bones. Other actors do well. <br /> <br /> Stars: I'll give you 3.5 stars out of 5. You will enjoy the movie. If watching in the theater, I would recommend watching it in the cinema if you are. Strange movie and accepting unusual stories Otherwise, waiting for the DVD to arrive, the movie will not be popular with the general public and the business that can be done is from word-of-mouth publicity.
