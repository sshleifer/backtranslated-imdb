I just read the comments that led to this movie in front of the voting results and ended. <br /> <br /> Why do some people not be able to use the film for what it should be? <br /> < br /> This movie should be a gentle, tonge in the cheeks, family jokes, things that make kids laugh and things for adults, and that's what this film does. I'm in the movie I think Carey has a great performance and the whole movie. (If looking at Christmas) makes you feel more festive. <br /> <br /> So every movie critic stops trying to listen to students like movies and makes everything fail because it's not "Taxi Driver" or "The Godfather "and bring movies for what they should be entertainment !!
