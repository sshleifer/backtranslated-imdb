Not only is this movie better than every last season of H: LOTS, but it's better than movies created for TV I've seen. <br /> <br /> See "Top 250". Small, only one movie created I think it's time to add that group 2. <br /> <br /> I'll accept that the original series has a lot better than this. But I do not care I love being able to enter the world of the Baltimore assassin team again!
