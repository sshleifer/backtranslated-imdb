I may be biased. I am a novelist, The Hungry Bachelors Club. I published myself in 1994. The screenplay was written by a good friend and Fred Dresch, who inspired the Marlon character in the movie. I am not satisfied with more examples. I hope to see all the movies and I will comment further. But Jorja Fox, who plays Delmar Youngblood, is my protagonist. She holds many emotional vehicles in good form. I can't do better than myself! It seems that people who really formulated hardly driven and thanked my orders with the racial and sincere racial prejudice.
