I just watched this story in Turner's classic movie last night for the first time ever seeing it and I like it. I like a lot of old movies, especially because there is no pornography and violence, nudity and excessive sex in most movies today. I think they are much better in many cases (but not all). Jimmy Stewart is my favorite. I just thought that this movie was so fun to watch and I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you feel the same as the old movie, I don't think you are wrong with this. I believe "You Got Got Mail" is a newly created movie. (Although slightly different and is a very fun movie) of this movie For an evening that is relaxing with movies, you don't have to be ashamed if kids or anyone walking in to watch or catch it in the classic movie channel.
