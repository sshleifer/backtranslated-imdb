This film captures the word "Spring Breakumentary". Hans, one of the fat people, shows his ability as the next generation of Chris Farley. Johnny Kansas, "The King of $ 1 Bet", shows that he is no longer in Kansas by increasing his stakes regularly. Kyle's laughter is truly infected and offers a small eye candy to the ladies as well. (Like Matt) The dwarves, while having their time, do not give justice to the Mexican hat dance as they deserve. And finally we have our protagonist Ed He gave hope to all of us who made a mistake, stumbling upon those who were heeded by the villagers who were still searching for that special person. And that hope is a small place called Cabo San Lucas. While this blockbuster just missed a movie theater, this is a must-rent since we can all relate to one of these Spring Breakumentarions.
