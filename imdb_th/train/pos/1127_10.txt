I just saw IPHIGENIA once, almost 30 years ago, but it haunted me since <br /> <br /> one particular sequence, especially in my heart and probably directed by a great director like Michael Cacoyanis <br /> <br /> Context: The weight of history and the great army and the entire fleet lie on the shoulders of King Agamemnon. The immoral action has caused the sea and is dangerous to Troy's big journey. He said that he had to sacrifice his daughter, Fiji, to Apollo in order to receive the wind for the ship's thousands. At first he resisted But came back and tricked his wife Clytemenstra to bring their daughters to the Greek camp to marry Achilles the greatest warrior. <br /> <br /> Clytemnestra and Iphigenia to sacrifice and angry God for protection and avenge At the same time, the proud Achilles discovered that his name was used in this deceptive and untrustworthy way. He climbed up to tell Efijia that he would protect her. <br /> <br /> Pictured: Two young people without a face. They lament their fate and the weakness of men who deceive the people they love and want to war. Suddenly they stared at each other and for a moment we felt their power and beauty and things that were not excluded - by the camera - irony that again, elsewhere they might love each other and marry. The sharp and sad epiphany that lasted for a while. <br /> Which direction? What camera! What a story!
