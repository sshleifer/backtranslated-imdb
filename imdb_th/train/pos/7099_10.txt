Terry Gilliam's astounding story of all destructive viruses. But a handful of people around the world and forcing them to move underground and the man returns in time to gather information about it. It's a great movie, dizzy and very chic that Bruce Willis's best performance forever. <Br /> <br /> The thing that makes 12 Monkeys different from sci-fi movies. Most time travel is Bruce Willis's character, which is related to the psychological impact of time travel. know The real thing is the actual truth: the place where time travelers come from or go. In addition, the film also recognizes that things that have not been changed can be changed and the prevention of catastrophic events. In this case, the virus can not be stopped or changed. While Willis claims "It happened." While he was in a mental hospital, a major problem that caused the film to not be repeated too much to save the world. Instead of struggling within Willis to survive It is a new concept that works beautifully with scripts written by people and unique brands of Pement and Gilliam. <br /> <br /> In addition, the 12 stories of Monkey's story are not linear. And bend the way to tell the story expertly, combined with different times: past events, dreams, memories, present, past, future, and even the scenes that were lifted from Hitchcock's Vertigo, all to cover the audience In the crap of madness and uselessness <br /> <br /> Gilliam's eyesight is an expert on anger and shadows at Tim Burton in his tragic scenes and images. By filming a vast and impressive movie, Gilliam leapt into the colorless and dark environment of his character. The scene is usually bathed with a deadly white disinfectant and helps to distinguish it from the characters that are often crazy. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt steals the best work. Attractive patented performances that have been nominated for an Oscar nomination As mentioned above, Bruce Willis gave the best performance in his career, not returning to his old ideas and his cardboard hero instead of showing that Cole was a simple, painful and sad man. Equally good is Madeline Stowe. As Willis's psychologist, she captures herself, injecting her character with energy and strength as she collapses under the weight of what she believes is false. /> <br /> Gilliam's experts are overwhelming and complex management. What may be a regular action / sci-fi movie makes 12 Monkeys a compelling vision of a nightmarish landscape. The rich and complex story of the complex storyline, along with the Bravura performance from all the actors and the melancholy of the film, makes it a masterpiece of madness, ranked in my top 10 forever. With the darkness of a movie full of brightness <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
