SPOILERS, like other posters, I feel that the ending is quite sudden. I want to see the crew adjust to life on this planet after coming back. I think the author expects this problem by "Front loading" some Voyager in the sequential earth at the beginning of the episode (Of course, the time line was eradicated, so it was all the suspicion.) I like that Admiral Janeway died for the Voyager crew As a fan, we got the cake and ate it by giving Janeway both sacrifice and living the highest life. I agree that Janeway's scenes and her old conversations are so strange and easy to cross the line easily. Luckily, Mulgrew (s) pulled it out.
