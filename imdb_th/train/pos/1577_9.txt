Inside the spoiler <br /> <br /> It seems that von Trotta is more comfortable with the balance of personal stories and the history of the events that happened in her previous films. Versprechen, Das (1995) /> <br /> The direction seems to be carefully controlled and my eyes feel that it is very attractive - especially when there is a visual narrative. (The combination of the title and the light of the new candle in the present day is a reminder of the deaths of different characters in the past) <br /> <br /> To clarify the two points that many people are confused by: <br / > <br /> Firstly, Lena doesn't sleep with Goebbels, although this may seem implied. But didn't have the intention. Von Trotta told himself! (And she is a very cute girl by the way!) <br /> <br /> Second, the time frame of the event is the truth in the past that is correct according to history. (The actual date will be displayed in the near term of the memorial) and the prisoner is immediately released in the movie. There is evidence to show that Goebbels was irritated about doing this and planned to take it back. Eventually, they were free. <br /> <br /> Overall, what impressed me Most likely, the 'above-angry' era seems to be a shameful thing that takes a long time. (For many reasons) for this film to reach our screen <br /> <br /> More than ever, please Margarethe!
