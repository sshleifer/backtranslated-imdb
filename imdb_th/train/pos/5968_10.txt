When you find the gems of this kind of movie, you will know why the 80s are the greatest decade of living. Rock music can dominate movies ... especially horror movies The filmmaker knows how to entertain us. "The trick or cure" is clear when Sammi Curr, which is most likely written after the WASP singer Blacklaw Les, died in the fire. Of the hotel, his # 1 girlfriend, Eddie, is distraught He went to find a friend and DJ Nuke (Gene Simmons) to get support. Nuke gave a copy of the latest record that Sammi did to him. This is the only copy that has. It was given to a radio station to play a live Halloween night. When Eddie plays it, it will bring Sammy back. He helped Eddie and the school bully. But cannot control It's definitely a great movie. The bad thing is that this movie doesn't have a printout. I paid $ 25.00 to remove it from eBay. Finally, you should ... too ... $$ Spend!
