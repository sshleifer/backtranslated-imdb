Using Buster Keaton at dusk during his career is an interesting option. He may be the most talented comedian in the era of silence. This gave him the opportunity to show those abilities in time travel. He's stuck with people in the modern era, and obviously we are the best people of our generation. Keaton can see him well. I've heard his voice before I believe he made some beach party movies, playing as ridiculous characters, just to earn a few dollars. Sirling seems to respect him and show him that way. It's not a bad thing It shows how the reaction is when we need what we don't have and get that desire.
