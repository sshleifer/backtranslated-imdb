In fact, my vote is 7.5. However, this movie has a funny part that makes it appropriate to see, not understand. I'm not the most fun movie in the world and not the original because it's a concept we've seen before in Other movies But this story has its own taste. One of my friends told me that this is a movie for fans ... I think that's not certain. But who will be interested? There is also another movie that shows us almost the same. Chris Rock appears there. The name is Down to Earth. The guy, which is a very funny movie, looks both if you want. Rock won with his movie I like that the protagonist male character has been Ashton Kutcher, but this movie is good.
