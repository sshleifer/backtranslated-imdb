Enjoying Joyce's complex novels, so I was ready to be disappointed with the screenplay of Joseph Strick and Fred Haines due to the incredible complexity of the original text. However, the movie turned out to be very well done, and the translation of the tone, nature and simplicity of the book. <br /> <br /> It helps to read the original text for sure. I thought of the latter's seemingly uninterrupted scene with a strange scene that seemed to harmonize together without having to read the text to help understand this. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see that "dirty. "What is this movie? Since it was shot in Dublin in 1967, the only Irish film censorship was eventually forbidden to be viewed by general audiences in Ireland in the late 2000s (it showed a limited audience in a private theater at an Irish cinema in In the late 1970s, Joyce's sexual feelings were not only natural and obscene. It is okay that many of these amulets are unacceptable when this book was published in 1922 - they are still fully banned when the movie was created in 1967. <br /> <br /> It's amazing. Heart and welcome to see the cream of Irish acting career in 1960. Every respected player dared to say and publish Joyce's profoundly aggressive message with such gusto. <br /> <br /> Cheers!
