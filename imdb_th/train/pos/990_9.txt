I really like this movie Of course, there is an idea there ... The government has a device implanted into the jaws of robbers, stealing small time to lure hackers / hackers into dangerous computers. But Alvin Sanders, a man who is fed with "volunteers" to cultivate this device, is a very cute person and becomes very fun to be in his head with him for a while. Alvin eventually proved himself to be more than a humorous character. But concealed or is one dimension when he showed that he was not easily adjusted as he saw Definitely worth watching
