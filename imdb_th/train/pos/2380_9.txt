I didn't mind every walk. People went to various places. At that time, it borrowed genuine air to this period and some views on the Martian technology I was disappointed with the effect, especially the scene. "Thunderchild", which I think is one of the most exciting things in the book But I can't watch this movie enough because of the confidence in the story of Wales! It depends on the time. The actors are a favorite and the show is charming. In addition, this film is very valuable to see just by receiving the truly excellent musical score of Jamie Hall. It's interesting to see the same actor playing both his writer and brother in London.
