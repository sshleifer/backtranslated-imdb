Yes, this is a horror-themed poetry movie and a lot of fun! That's because although this movie is a horror movie But some stories have a light spirit - and sometimes there is a little laugh. This is not a bad thing because sometimes horror movies are quite boring and serious. For this reason, and because the four stories are quite good, it is one of the better movies in this style that I have seen. <br /> <br /> The combined themes that link each story are houses. Four different stories relate to people who rent a house or check what happens to the tenant. <br /> <br /> The first part that starred Denholm Elliott is a horror writer with a writer's blog. So for changing the scenery, they rent this house. Elliot's blog almost immediately disappeared and he continued to work on the serial killer. Surprisingly, after his blog disappeared, he began to see his character! Once again, the psychotic killer appears and disappears, making him seem to be losing his mind. This may be the best story, because the end of the twist makes the story lively. <br /> <br /> The second story, while not bad, may be the weakest point. Peter Cushing plays as a bachelor who is friends with a girl Who died recently (Although her image looks amazingly contemporary) When he entered the scary wax museum in the city, he saw a wax figure that reminded him of his lost woman and he was amazed and afraid of this. A friend (Joss Ackland) visited and he saw the numbers and stunned it. All this leads to a straightforward ending, a bit of a decline. Christopher Lee then stars as an incredibly violent and incredibly strict father with a poor little girl. During this segment, Lee looked like an idiot. But in the end, you can understand his behavior even though it is slow, but this one ends well. <br /> <br /> The fourth part is the most stupid and intends to mock Jon Pertwee ("Doctor" who Three of the dramas of DR. WHO) are well-known actors in Dracula's drawing. However, there is nothing right about this movie as he speaks and is very baffled, so he stopped this set to find better props for this vampire movie. It's quite interesting that he played this role because it seems like it is common for Christopher Lee, a billionaire Dracula player or other vampire. I like Pertwee's genre when he says Lee and the branch. The latest Dracula is ridiculous compared to Bela Lugosi! Perhaps this is the reason why Lee didn't have a part in this section! Even though there were silly moments But it's fun and fun - maybe better or better than the first segment. <br /> <br /> Considering that this movie started and ended well, there were great performances and writing. Don't like this movie
