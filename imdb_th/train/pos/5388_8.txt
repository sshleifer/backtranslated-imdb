I saw this movie yesterday at Turner and I can't stop watching until the end, even if I can guess what will happen. Farrell is good at her role and everyone works very well. Some people seem to stretch the limit, but all I like it a lot !! If you have the opportunity to see, please do! Actually, I cried a few scenes. But I guess if you are a mother, you will be beautiful and Loretta is surprised by the idea that mothers who are not married there. I say watch it if you can and don't listen to criticism. As they say, I laugh, I cry! I like it very much!
