Noll's comfortable way of presenting blunt comments, which are often swearing to explain what he has more knowledge than most people, rather refreshing. There is one more character in this movie that tries to use complex words to use the language more than necessary. This man should not have received Thesaurus. Cut to Noll and you know that you are in treatment! <br /> <br /> The way that the pioneers of the big wave were conveyed was what caused the lost era. It doesn't matter. The fact that no one knows how many of these people are alive, takes care of medical care. Using old movie clips can be done completely.
