When winter came, our ABC state broadcaster decided for some reason to arrange some Jane Austen festivals on Sunday night. This started with a twelve-year-old Emma movie on Sunday. The latest version of the three novels is "Persuasion", "Northanger Abbey" and "Mansfield Park" are coming. <br /> <br /> Things that are curious about this production by A&E Television Networks by scripts from The reliable Andrew Davies is appearing together with two larger budget films, starring Gwyneth Paltrow and "Clueless", which is a "modern" version starring Alicia. Silverstone As a result, even with Kate Beckinsale in the lead, this production collapsed without a trace. <br /> <br /> In general, it will disappear a lot when the novel is shortened to fit the length. Of movies Modifications that one tends to enjoy and remember are things that have enough space to develop both stories and characters. A striking example is "Brideshead Revisited", which has 13 episodes, 50 minutes. Back in 1982, you have to compare the "Pride and Prejudice", a regular version of a regular movie in 2005, with a six-part mini-TV series Visited 1995. Not that the novel should be taken one by one and some novels (Often not so good) adapted to movies ("Atonement" is the latest example), but Jane Austen's novel requires time and space to exert <br /> <br /> From the shortcomings of this type of modification, this production is ok. Kate Beckinsale makes Emma have a mixture of confidence and the right vulnerability and Mark Strong is straight. Come straight to Mr Knightly (he reminded me that Jane tends to recycle the character? Knightly is a clearer version of Mr Darcy's temperament of P&P.) Samantha Morton is a Harriet that is quite limp but Prunella Scales can blabbermouth Miss Bates perfectly? Sybil Fawlty and Bernard Hepton's speed as Emma's weak father is also great. We see the muddy countryside and poverty, as well as the luxurious interior, in the event that everyone thinks this is a beautiful era, especially for everyone. <br /> <br /> Although it's a short adaptation In some places, the conversation is quite exaggerated, even when allowing to perform the ceremony on time. I have to watch this movie again to make sure But it may be because of the use of retaliation shots. <br /> <br /> If you like the shooting time, this is a very good example. And compare well with the Paltrow version. How much more to come!
