I was lucky enough to attend the screening in Stockholm for a fun, entertaining and thought-provoking movie. With love as the heaviest weapon in the Paris je t'aime arsenal, inspiring love in Paris, navigating different styles in eighteen "quartiers" separately, but without mocking the Parisiennes and its saccharine gold formula. Doubt caused by the difficulty of the directors? More frustration with only 5-10 minutes of screen time ?? So you will be presented with the best direction and most confidence from each party. <br /> <br /> Debate whether I should review all 18 groups or not. I concluded that it will be redundant and protracted. Just trust that each director will love the movie with the style and strange skills, and of course you will find your favorite thing. Even though Gus Van Sant will not be able to resist the temptation to contemplate LES MARAIS's He was one of the better participants, even in reference to Kurt Cobain. The Coen brothers created another group that was easier to reach in Paris. The scene with Steve Buscemi was quiet but Transparent mood, humor, cheeky and clever camera angles that create laughter in the theater /> <br /> my way, featuring <br all unique. Filter through the ideas of different directors or not? But the thing that deviates from the rest is the QUARTIER DE LA MADELEINE of Vincenzo Natali, a dark Gothic horror love starring Elijah Wood as a tourist who wandered in Paris' backstreets at night with vampires. With a black and white pattern But the sharpness of the red blood that seems to be bleeding off the screen unceasingly almost becomes the pastor of Sin City? The creepiness and lively visibility in other rational movies. <br /> <br /> But my favorite part is FAUBOURG SAINT-DENIS by Tom Tykwer, but I think I have conditions to think like. Because I went to the theater with him as I liked and poked my friend beside me, saying, "Finally, that's my favorite director here." However, it can't be denied that Tykwer gave the segment. The cute boy who picked up the phone and heard the voice from his girlfriend (Portman - not annoying once) that she broke up with him and he reflected their relationship according to Tywker's style. Causing rapid movement, dizziness and repetition with screams and runs (Lola Rennt), making it the most exciting part in Paris and the most possible when Tywker shook hands The most powerful tool? <br /> <br /> To fill the negative account, all the directors should not manage like Tywker, Van Sant, Cohens, Coixet and DÃ©pardieu Sylvain Chomet scrapes the bottom of the pile by carving the disposable parts like Indeed, the little boy tells the story of how his parents met. They are two lonely dumb people. This part is in French in front of you and is very quirky to insult foreign viewers. Suwa is also a poor and gentle group leader with Juliette Binoche, an unusual formidable person who is sad about losing her son. Nothing happened In the end, the blockade and the combination of all 18 stories at the end felt quite hustle and intolerance. <br /> <br /> But Paris je t'aime makes you lose quality, because other stories are good - the art of Show and write fun Of course, it's one of the highlights of 2006 (not to say much, I think) and personal movies in the sense that it is inevitable to choose favorites and be the least favorite. Highly recommended for viewers who "pretend" (heh) <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
