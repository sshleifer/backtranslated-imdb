For me, this review may contain spoilers. But I like watching movies that have no idea what will happen, so I think other reviews here in this movie have spoilers. <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie again. And I have to repeat again that this movie will end up being the best ever, the true translation of 'The Beating of the Butterfly's Wings' is not used as a strange translation I think they think that most Americans do not know what the chaos theory is. (Except those who see or read "Jurassic Park") This film is based on the theory of chaos and small events that affect the results of unrelated events that seem to lead to a single event. This film is about the cause and the magical effects as we follow the chaos as it connects between many characters (about 20 characters) in some way. The ending seems inevitable. Can be even like this But if you think about it, it's a perfect ending. Think to yourself that "To say something else" at the same time is a very brave ending. Unfortunately, we have to travel abroad to get this kind of gem. But this end will not come out of Hollywood. <br /> <br />
