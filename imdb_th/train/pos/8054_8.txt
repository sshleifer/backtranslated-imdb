"Enter the Fat Dragon" is one of the most fun martial arts movies that I have the opportunity to watch. Sammo Hung plays as a Chinese farm boy who comes to visit friends in the city as well as Tang Lung of "The Way of the Dragon" whenever. As Sammo started the problem, he had to rely on martial arts skills to solve the differences. Fortunately, the characters of Sammo learn martial arts by mimicking and mimicking his idols. Bruce Lee beat him with his thumb like Bruce Lee did and yelled at him. He also used the baton at the scene as well. It's like looking fat. Bruce Lee has a big showdown at the end of the movie, which consists of foreign fighters. Sammo must face each other individually. The type of "The Game of Death" that each fighter has Discipline of martial arts is different from others. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies that I really like to watch. I've seen great fighting scenes and lots of laughter. The rare classic Sammo Hung movie I highly recommend. Am For all the fans in the martial arts of 8.5 / 10!
