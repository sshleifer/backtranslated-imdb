"SÃ¥ som in himmelen" may be one of the three most beautiful movies I've seen in my life. That it didn't win the Oscar, I wouldn't shed tears This film is in the category of its own class that winning an Academy Award may be diverted from this story !!! My dear friend Anders (Nyberg) You've done something gorgeous with your pen here! Kay Pollak With your creation and everyone who participates, you all give a gift of love to our world. Between the point of entering our world, then leaving - you can say that you make it better! Special personal, thank you from my soul to all of you that you bring precious memories back from the second decade of my life. I grew up in Sweden and my youthful heart and well-being was founded and molded by beautiful Swedish influences. People, traditions, culture, music and nature My blessing with all thanks With love and light George-Gabriel Berkovits Soulhealer Johannesburg South Africa
