The fascinating memories of David Tomlinson (1917-2000) <br /> <br /> When I watched this movie for the first time, I was 4 years old and fascinated by the witch's story in World War II. 2 scenes that impressed me the most is the fight between Nazi soldiers and medieval armies. It's great to see this army without walking the body to fight their singing in March. This movie is great since traveling to Portobello Road. (Which became my most wonderful place in London) to travel to Nabumu, Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson are really wonderful couples She is always a wonderful person. It seems like the good aunt of the family and David, who has his surprise face, is a good supporter of her. We will miss him a lot.
