While most people watch this movie, it will be a little interesting. But from hundreds of films related to magic and occult in one form or another, this movie is probably the best in many ways. <br /> <br> From The Golem to The Craft, the title seems to be interested in the film industry like Endlessly Most of the movies that touch it in any way do like children (such as "Witchboard", the real piece of garbage in every way), both using great elements as excuses for special magic magic techniques ") often. At times this happened in a hysterical religious context. (In many revealing films, the anti-God group is inevitably a supporter of some new forms of practice.) Rarely does the movie seem to show at least some of the past experience with magic practiced in real life. But the mysterious presentation in the movie can best be described as metaphorical and not literally or symbolically or ... just incorrect. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie again after passing. For many years I've seen it before on VHS; It was a dark piece and after watching on the DVD, I would say that if you have the intention to watch this movie, watch it on a DVD. VHS, but on DVD movies use very different tones. I think Weir pushed the dark side in style. But when the movie is converted to a lower color media than the VHS, this will cross the edge The DVD brings the movie back to life again and I see it differently. <br /> <br /> However, when I saw for the first time, I realized that healing magic was great in this movie. It's hard to go for all the reasons why I'm not interested in doing it. <br /> <br /> For anyone who is curious if you want to see how it is in real life. This film has countless levels of accuracy. <br /> <br /> And for those who aren't, you waste a lot of time reading this point.
