This movie is a classic story that should be It's definitely not perfect. Walking in the perfect moment for the stage is in the form of a movie. Slowly, like a turtle and an inflamed knee, Jean Seberg mistakenly thought that was too sweet and too gentle She demonstrates the ability to show enough skill and skill to demonstrate Joan, cleverness and confidence. Unfortunately, the director missed the point of the character George Bernard Shaw, a playwright I liked. In his plays, there is no clearer dialogue. However, processing this movie requires you to see it as a lawyer. This movie is the case and the audience is the judge. That is the way to enjoy this picture. 7/10
