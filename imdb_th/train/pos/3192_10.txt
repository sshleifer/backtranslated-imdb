Yes, this will get ten stars full. It is clear that this day is a genius. The universe sent Trent Harris to a surprisingly strange young man, one day, and Harris caught him on the tape in every true elegance that you couldn't fake. Unfortunately, it ended with a tragedy for a young man, if only writing alternately that could write the story of that friend. In the next two steps in the trilogy, the story is repeated with Sean Penn and Crispin Glover in the role of a young man, respectively. The world is expanding and weirdness is the context, according to the storytelling, making us look wider and brighter in the strange growth in vanilla America Recommended for everyone and everyone!
