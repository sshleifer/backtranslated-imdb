Those who have been involved with movie cameras since the beginning of the century must understand their potential first. This is a good story of a playboy who wants money and sells his soul to Satan unintentionally for a lot of money. Unfortunately, the spirit is his partner and he must face him often, causing his life to fail. There are some wonderful scenes that people are fading away and of course the scenes that both are on stage at the same time The middle is quite boring. But the story of Faustian is always in the hearts of the audience. One thing I have to say is the general interest of people in the movie. In addition, they are quite shifting away from many actions which at least give life to that. The first time I realized about this movie 25 years ago and finally can see it. I'm not disappointed
