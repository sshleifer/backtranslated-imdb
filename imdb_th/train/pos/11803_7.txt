"Sasquatch's Hunters" Actually, it's not as bad as I thought. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** <br /> <br /> Getting into the park ranger tea forest. Landon (Kevin O'Connor) Roger Gordon, (Matt Latimore) Brian Stratton (David Zelina) Spencer Combs, (Rick Holland) and his sister Janet, (Stacey Branscombe) take Dr. Helen Gilbert, (Amy Shelton-White) boss Her doctor, Ethan Edwards, (Gary Sturm) and assistant Louise Keaton (Juliana Dever) to find the location of the famous bone found in the area. When they built the camp, the team discovered a giant burial site and strange bones that dumped the garbage in that area. When the members of the group began to disappear, they started walking through the forest for safety. Found that Sasquatch was behind the killing and the team gathered to survive. <br /> <br /> Good news: It's not as bad as I am. Think This film begins to receive steam at the midpoint when the creature attacks. That is the scene that is expert, while the entire group is attacked by creatures and all the suspicion of playing is very high. The most suitable milking area between these parts helps increase tension and wonder when one person walks in the forest will be added. The spread is rather independent through the film, ie using roaring and roaring outside the screen effectively. They add more to make this part creepy, just like any other time that screams roar. It is quite effective and works well. It is quite good that the next part of the film has been well received. One particular scene, I felt to point out that it was a special scene when I first watched. While men are running through the forest from living creatures, he sees a journey that looks for it. Raise his hand to shout for help. The second time he announces that he is attacking from far away and killing him urgently. It caught me by surprise and actually I jumped on the first viewing. <br /> <br /> Bad news: There are only a few things to complain about here and one is a complaint. Usual Most of the creatures here are shown by the terrible CGI which makes him completely ridiculous and destroy any credibility that may have the danger of the air threatened by the film's launch, almost being shot outside. Windows when creatures appear on the screen It was very distracting because it was a shame that a little more work was not used. I complain about this very much and it is really something to do because it looks unrealistic and is fake. Another great thing is killing outside the screen here. Often in this film is the person who is arrested and pulled away and then find the corpse that is blood after that. It is quite intense when killing, looks good and juicy after that. Otherwise, I don't have a lot of problems with this because everything that is often criticized about this doesn't really bother me. But it was called for others apart from this. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: I like this movie. But it's not the best Sasquatch movie ever. It should not be overlooked, and if looking like that, actually it is fun. Fans of these movies should pay attention and those who like sci-fi creatures may find good things here. <br /> <br /> Rated R: Graphic language, violence and graphic remains
