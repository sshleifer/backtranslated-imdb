The Wooden Horse is one of the first "great" escape stories from World War II telling the true story of Eric Williams and others in the escape from Stalag-Lufft III in October 1943. I like the movie. This is a lot. It is in the Amazon VHS in England and transferred from PAL format in the United States. I read the book when I was in high school after seeing part of this film in the early decades. 60 in the TV drama Peter and John's joke trying Escape from Germany during the war is more realistic than exploring the escape routes shown in the big escape. This film is a lost treasure that should be available to more American audiences.
