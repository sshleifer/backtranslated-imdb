All the movies I rented, I picked up the Freebird. I tried to pass one of the three movies that suspected that the rest would be rubbish to watch. Fortunately it warmed up and I loved the movie a lot. The second half of the movie made me smile and laugh all the time. Luckily, there was a little CGI but not too much or widespread. <br /> <br /> I must say - all actors have a heavy European accent Their voice or cultural humor <br /> <br /> I love this movie very much and will have to order a copy for myself for my own collection.
