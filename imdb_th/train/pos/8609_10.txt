I think this is one of the best movies I've seen for a long time. It is a great story and shows that people are complex in all sorts of styles. I recommend to all my friends !! I always enjoy great stories and this film has one of the best things I've seen for a long time. I saw myself having a daughter and doing the same thing Natalie did to find out more about her life and love. It shows that we are not only living with our family. But there are still some parts in our lives that we do not share with them - because it may not be the most useful that they will know all the details of what we do not do for us. This movie is another story and will keep an eye on.
