Fortunately, knowing nothing about this movie, I was curious enough to tape from the TV. And then the tape was exhausted only five minutes before the end! <br /> <br /> But I'm glad that I get the most benefit because this is a really great spy movie. There are regular toy submarines and thick fogs, but there are cold and brave moments. Considering the year of production in 1969, some minor lesbians have raised a few eyebrows. Of course, now it's not surprising that everyone and those scenes in reality seem to be able to do beautifully. And not just because George's two actresses <br /> <br /> Gas attacks seem to hit all of the audiences. Surprisingly, it certainly hit me. Very effective In addition, the views from both sides of the opponents also make the whole story more depth based on suspicions and normal actions. This is not just a brave war story of one of the victories. But showing what is behind the victory in good and bad It's a matter of most wars. <br /> <br /> For fans of the composer Ennio Morricone, this is also a must. His work is excellent. But never touched And I think I have to try to catch more movies with Suzy Kendall talking about Fr√§ulein! Hopefully they will put it on the DVD soon, so I can have all the movies in my collection and many people will be familiar with the little known gems.
