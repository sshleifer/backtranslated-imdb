This story is about Shin Ee, who has moved to Milleang from Seoul and his younger son, Jun, to start a new life after the accidental death of the husband Her husband was born here and she opened a piano school. But there was an ambition to be the owner of the land with the insurance she received from death If that is what this film is about, it may be like a Hollywood movie. She falls in love with some local people and is happy with her son in their new home. But this is not Hollywood Her son was apparently kidnapped and murdered because it was known that she had cash from the settlement. The grieving process of trying to move forward, trying to clear all the guilty conscience, is an admirable thing and a great actress. The only condition and must be said is that this is a movie that is down. You have to know that you want Shin-ae to go through her grief and find happiness. Again, this is not Hollywood. It is Korean and in Korean cinema, especially the drama. They have never punched. Life is what happens to you. Great performance But sometimes it is a difficult movie to watch because it goes well If you are, you will receive a reward. Do that.
