'The origin of the Beatles' gives us a simple story that we know without being magnificent. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler here in *** <br /> <br /> Be warned that it is not everything that is right as Beatles graduates may expect The Beatles to see a song that is barely composed even at that time. The Beatles Show "Ask me why", "PS I love you" and even "Don't bother me" The Beatles graduates should see that if the Beatles in the movie do the songs they do at Hamburg only, the younger audience may Do not recognize the Beatles that they learn to know them anymore Hamburg's original songs are only "Johnny B. Goode" and Stu Sutcliffe's "Love Me Tender" will be kept. <br /> <br /> Those who play The Beatles In this production, it almost looks like the original. This movie still looks good because the film is fairly accurate. Men who play Lennon do well and the rest of the band is not bad too.
