Once upon a time X-Files' wrote episodes like "Of Bender" and "Fearful Symmetry" that aliens or goop who control the mind But it might really surprise you "Walk" - and ended with a local kidnapped gorilla And it was a wonderful time Sub-plan is annoying The only thing that aliens are interested in. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's not a classic immediately.
