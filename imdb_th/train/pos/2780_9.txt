Great movie - I like it a lot. Editing and using a great soundtrack Capture the true feelings of Indian life. But we can all relate A well-selected actor with a great character The movie develops all the characters so you pay attention to them all and you feel like you know them. The use of Indian music and drums in some scenes of football is great and the direction of work is really good when everyone falls out of reality. You can't help to root Jesse in this movie! The performance was very good, even walking the tomboy and the body of a leading woman. Both people believed that they were many football players.
