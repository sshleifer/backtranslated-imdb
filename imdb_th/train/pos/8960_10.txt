This may not be War & Peace, but both Academy noms will not be prepared if they are not James Wong's genius. Howe ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the few movies that I Fell in love like a child and returned without being satisfied Whether you are interested in what it offers or not, BB&C is a feast of sight. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it's his best work. But the look of this film is excellent I love everything about it. Elsa Lanchester, cat, hoo-doo, retro-downtown-ness crazy; But the method put on the film is amazing. <br /> <br /> I also like the inconsistencies that appear on this page above and "Special effects" that look back now It creates a world that is really consistent.
