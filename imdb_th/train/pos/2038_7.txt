This movie exceeded my expectations. I thought and had heard that it would be rubbish, so I didn't expect much. However, I was surprised. At first I didn't understand the woman who was the leader and didn't care whether she was living or dying. Soon after, she grew up with me and became a cute character. It's not just a slasher movie that people die without reason. There is a story behind that takes only a few seconds in the movie. But can explain a lot I would like to recommend this movie to everyone. If you're not sure, just watch it, it's just one and a half hours of your life. You will live 80 years.
