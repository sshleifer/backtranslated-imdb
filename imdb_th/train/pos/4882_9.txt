It is a comedic business that examines movies. Today when "Inner emotions" and "sentimental emotions" are more favored than straightforward sympathy. It would be hard to be honest with your true feelings. <br /> <br /> Not long after serving the jury at Berlinale 58 to catch Kabei of Yoji Yamada <br /> <br /> After screening, I watched people walking around in a dream come out of the theater, big eyes, men, women and critics alike. Even the director of Berlinale became clear that the hardened movie audience confessed to being unconsciously arrested and found himself crying for three-quarters of a grateful experience. <br /> <br /> But What really surprised me was the comments that came after, despite the inevitable movement by the film, many critics chose not to be enthusiastic and not tied. In writing Apparently the crying post they had put "Their hat of ideas" and made me miss what I felt was genius about Kabei. <br /> <br /> Allow me to explain. <br /> <br /> Set in Japan before the war. The story of Kabei. Revolves around a writer's family and their fate thereafter after he is imprisoned in prison for what is described as "Crimes of thought" towards the empire through a prolonged emotional scene, Yamada made us familiar with men, faithful wives and his two daughters, including the three characters - a lovely sister, a former student who fell. Liquid and uncle's uncle? Everyone came to help the family cope with their fate, in the event that there are no people in the house. <br /> <br /> The story progresses slowly, even if there is a stable pace and heartbroken. Can do to predict, of course, that this is an impossible thing for everyone in the audience to receive a feeling of emotion from an amazing event. <br /> <br /> In other words, even if you Learn to love your family and their assistants. The situation you get a lot of confidence from the plot that you find yourself expecting the ending to end. <br /> <br /> However, two hours in this movie (Don't worry Yamada for the audience to get enough. The moment of attraction and attraction that will make you ready) He slaps you with what I can only describe as "punching". Everything you think is the story of an innocent man captured from a wife and a daughter. His faithfulness Now point to one of the family assistants. Now, there are people you have been right now thrown into an unexpected fate. <br /> <br /> At this point, there is something curious in every theater I come in. People began to whine with little or no restraint. <br /> "My words!" I mumbled under my breath. It shocked me that "Kabei" in the final analysis is more than a film about a family torn by an imminent empire. In fact, a cunning examination of an ordinary human being foible: We have a lot of concern for the secret feelings of people who are close to us. <br /> <br /> Now, the criticism at The most common about this film is It has technical strength. But lack innovation That's what happened when the investigator put on their proverbial hat. I guess with Kabei. I believe Yoji Yamada knows exactly what tricks he will use to experience the unified aspects of humanity. The evil old trick that he continued to use in the Tora-san series and later in Tasogare Sebei <br /> <br /> After tricking the audience into the comfort zone of the story The story he threw us into the kingdom of emotions There is rarely a movie theater survey. <br /> <br /> This thing for me is the most powerful movie tool of all. One thing to avoid detection But affect you deeply And the proof of its effectiveness is Kleenex, a thousand pieces of wet, thrown into the trash that is outside of the theater with thousands of seats. <br /> <br /> Now, if only some reviewers Against being wise That they forgot what the film was about Human emotions Pure and simple
