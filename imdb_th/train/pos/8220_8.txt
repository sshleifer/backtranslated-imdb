The fourth film in the "Dirty Harry" series. This film is one of the most disgusting, ugly, disrespectful, insulting, insulting, women I have seen in the movie: "Ray Perkins", played by Ode Rene Nine She is the character of "Detour", a low-life, nasty version in 1945. "Ann Savage" <br /> <br /> Her foul mouth and bad attitude makes me shut down so much that I never watched the movie. This again until I got The vulgar filter that closes her .... and at least she! Then I was able to enjoy the movie /> <br /> The rest anywhere <br "Harry Callahan" (Clint Eastwood) to the violence immediately followed within a few minutes .. ...! It happens often. It's almost a joke. But it makes this movie a fast and fun movement, with a satisfying ending, because the evil villain is eliminated one by one. <br /> <br /> This is a very complex movie. Attract attention to our basic instincts ..... and connect sad to say Most of us like to see dirt in the end, who can do better than Dirty Harry?
