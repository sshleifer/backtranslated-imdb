I don't understand why many IMDb users don't like this movie. Why do they think it's so bad, etc. It's not worse than anything else. Personally, I think "Soldier" is a great movie better than other movies of the same type. <br /> <br /> The reason I like "Soldier": Kurt Russel, Connie Nielsen, Jason Scott Lee, script (David Webb Peoples) Great visual effects and governance (Paul Anderson) <br /> <br /> I even thought that this is the best work I have ever seen from director Paul Anderson "Mortal Kombat" and " Event Horizon "that is not fun
