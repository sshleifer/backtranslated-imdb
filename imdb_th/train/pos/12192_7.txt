This movie star in 1947 and was directed and written by Orson Welles (with a cowardly Irish accent) and also shows the beautiful Rita Hayworth with short blonde hair that attracts. So I went to travel with Orson before in the Touch of Evil and Citizen Kane and the Third Man etc. But this is my first interaction with Rita Hayworth. Our first meeting was going well. She worked great in Playing with a terrifying Elsa / Married with a millionaire lawyer Mike (Welles) and Elsa falls in love with each other. Elsa and her husband at his opponent like a shark bite and attack each other, and Mike explains his prediction proved to be true, too. Twisted many times and followed in this murder mystery when we reached the climax in the fun house. (Think of the end of the Golden Gun, which was borrowed from this scene) I'm not sure who the murderer is until <br /> <br /> This movie is like shrimp in garlic and lemon. The dish in the middle of the sea is subtle, sour and pungent, all for good results. These may not be the best fresh shrimp. But a good quality frozen shrimp from Costco, a flavorful sauce, enhances the naturalness of the pink shrimp as you add good health. But adding alternatives to common foods that are more common than 7/10. Http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
