The first time I saw this movie 40 years ago on N.Yay and thought it was a depressing story in the future. Wales sees that limiting personal freedom is a good thing. ("Private plane does not exist" 30 years plus the war in this film is the reason that the film did not show the British film audience who waged a future concept and the concept of Korda an joined the machines of The future is the true star of this film. The best performance is Ralph Richardson. Plays the role of Boss. The combination of Winston Churchill and Edina from the incredibly funny series is interesting to know that Boss's negative personality is quite similar to Churchill War Time
