Since the first time I saw this in the cinema, it was my favorite thing. Since then I have seen it countless times and I have never been bored. The settings are very relevant to it. (Colorado that I know will be jealous) but the story is original and I like that it uses the mountains, mountains, small towns as heroes. There are no movies that I can compare. John Lickow plays the wise villain. But I like that he is the perfect person in his composition - he must follow Tucker and that is what makes it interesting. This is the best action movie. I don't think I will see other people who are very entertaining. <br /> <br /> You don't need 50,000 rounds to qualify like action movies. It just makes you fall in love, not just shock.
