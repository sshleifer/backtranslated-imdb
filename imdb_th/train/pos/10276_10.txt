The movie debut with Bach Toccata is a hint about what will unfold in this intense drama. All Bach music devices are perfectly designed to allow his listeners (and actors) to be amazed and entertained with this movie. There is no mutual tenderness between the two leading characters and the female protagonist in the final scene that I felt was right that she was raped, even though her victims felt she was warned in advance that he was a Mamet. Emotional and interesting gender differences But I feel that he is merciless about how they compliment each other with healthy humor. If Mamet develops a healthy humor for sexual interactions, I wonder how this event will end. It's real. It's sad and frightening.
