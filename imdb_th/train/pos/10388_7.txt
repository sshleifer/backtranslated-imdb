I'm a big fan of Dukes of Hazzard and I really like this flick. I enjoy myself here more than I do with other summer blockbuster. <br /> <br /> It's a joke that people listen to this movie with an excuse like Does everyone remember the roughness of humor in the pilot episode? Daisy made a comedy between her brothers and Bo said that Luke might give birth to half of the children in an orphanage. The only reason for cleaning is because it is changed and the previous time <br /> <br /> and as far as the plot is implemented It's the perfect dukes plot. In fact, the new creation may be more true to the source of information than the TV programs that move to the big screen. <br /> <br /> While Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville are not like a small screen version. their They work great and work together very well. I am not very enthusiastic with Burt's Hawk Boss and I will have a little more talent from the Roscoe Sheriff. In the movie Roscoe is a little bit ... scary. <br /> <br /> And who doesn't have a smile on the face as General Lee is running down the streets of Atlanta and the streets behind Hazzard? <br /> <br /> People give themselves to enjoy movies that are just excuses for nostalgic bikinis and car chases. You won't regret. It's a great dumb movie!
