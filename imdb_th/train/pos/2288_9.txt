It is very difficult to find sufficient literary work on the screen that I may have rated this film higher than it is, but not so much. As a long-time student of Vonnegut's work, I do not hesitate to recommend movies. This story for his readers, at least for those who love him as I do. The selection of the actors was inspired: Nolte was victorious in defeat. Confused in the decision to decide. Sheryl Lee has always been generous. But the betrayal of the treacherous and her tragic leap almost makes you forget your beauty. Alan Arkin gives an equally cute and treacherous Soviet spy. <br /> <br /> Don't feel like you. Must read Mother Night to appreciate the movie. Although if you haven't read Mother Night, you may want to watch it after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Notice the change from color to black and white and come back again and don't miss out. The last symbol of Campbell's loop See also for the pendant of Kurt Vonnegut near the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby's "White Christmas" will not listen as before. And it makes me feel bad)
