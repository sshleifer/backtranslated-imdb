I watched this movie 11 years ago in the company with my best female friend. I was judged. My teeth were pulled out so I didn't feel very good. <br /> <br /> I ended up with a big favor. It is difficult if you consider that it involves friendship, betrayal that does not require power, money, traffic, drug addiction and the most difficult situation associated with being in a foreign prison. At the highest level The two women that I want the most, and that is good. Claire Danes is cute and charming as always, while Kate Beckinsale is very hot and gives good performance. Bill Pullman is also excellent and shows his historical qualities. <br /> <br /> There are plans to dig out a lot and make it an interesting visual experience. It also shows a difficult time in Thailand. <br /> <br /> This is a low-value movie. There are a few movies that have happened in recent history. It should make you think of many things ...
