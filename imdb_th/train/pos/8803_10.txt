I just watched this on the Sundance channel. The idea for this film is to bring many famous filmmakers in their own country, creating eleven short films, all in one film, focusing on one story: 11 September <br /> <br /> from wacthing movies This story, I can tell why these filmmakers are excellent in their country because it has all the elements of a great movie. <br /> <br /> Film begins with films from Iran, teachers struggle to teach students about. What happened to September 11, which they failed to realize until later? <br /> <br /> The second film from France involves a deaf woman writing a letter to her lover in anger. As she doesn't know what will happen, the drama <br /> <br /> The next film from Egypt deals with filmmakers talking to dead soldiers about the latest events. Users only But about 9/11 terrorists, but there are also bombs elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Next comes from Bolivia, where girls learn about the events on September 11 and believe that they will <br /> <br /> Next from the African country where the boys follow the man whom they believe is Bin Ladin. <br /> <br /> Continue to come from Mexico where nothing is shown. Besides the sound of that day <br /> <br /> The next person from Israel related to the reporter at the scene trying to report But is often told about the attack. <br /> <br /> There are other movies that I can do. 'Can't remember now. But everyone has power It will bring your emotions back from that day. <br /> <br /> 10/10
