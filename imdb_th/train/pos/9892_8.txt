This movie is a wonderful magic. <br /> <br /> A lot of people are stuck in a deserted school. They start to be killed. They know that they are being stalked. What do they do? A girl decides to take a shower and another person decides to cheat on her husband. (That is there) with the ex boyfriend so they find the bed (In an old abandoned school?) Then go to it. <br /> <br /> And it passed with blood and T&A. <br /> <br /> And it's interesting from the historical / sociological point of view. Where the vibrations of the 80s are a reflection of how we look at ourselves or how adults look at young people or while Hollywood looks at other countries. This has a unique perspective. This is Brit's movie made for Americans. It is a joke to see that British actors who try to say "American" tend to sneak into their English accent unintentionally. <br /> <br /> If you like the 80s slashers (like pieces) You will like this.
