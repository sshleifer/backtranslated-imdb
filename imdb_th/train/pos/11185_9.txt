When this happened to be one of my favorite novels, I was very excited to see the movement. I'm not disappointed! Yes, of course. There are some things I can choose. But I think this movie is attached to the book and it's a really good movie. It seems that most of Stephen King's movies received bad reviews. But this is a good thing. It's a dark story, which I think why I like .. and what is better than death that comes to life .. and something about animals coming back from the grave is creepy If you've seen this movie, you like it a lot and now read the book !! It's a good screen writing. The actors should do better. (I just talked about this with Rachel and Ellie .. She's very white.) I like other people .. actually with novels.
