Living in Ontario for the rest of my life in the same town as Marlene Moore, I heard her story from my parents, grandparents and family members. So when I found out that they were going to film a movie about her and the beginning would be shot on my street and her house was close to me, I'm excited. <br /> <br /> If you read the book Rock a Bye Baby, which is about Marlene Moore. You have a different image of you as a person. She is considered beautiful and awkward by people who have the opportunity to really know her, except her family. Children except one of her brothers In addition, if you live in my area and are smart enough to listen to those around you who know you from school, you will find that she was truly injured before she stepped into the institution. Such an unwillingness to learn in the school environment is really difficult that she can't do. <br /> <br /> Marlene doesn't deserve the life she received. Is the government and the people around you that help her die without trying to understand her needs and why she does what she does I also found myself angry that she was imprisoned because of self-defense from men who tried to rape her. As her brother once said "They don't know what to do with her, so they locked her and killed her." I believe that with all my heart. <br /> <br /> Relax in Marlene. You deserve it.
