"Moonstruck" is a cute little movie directed by a great storyteller Norman Jewison (in The Heat of the Night, Fiddler on the Roof, The Hurricane). This film is excellent on many levels. The culture of Italy is good, romantic and (Most of all) is a hilarious comedy. <br /> <br /> One of the things I like most about this movie is the exotic look of the actor Nicolas Cage. Looks strange, positive for most movies. And Cher ... suddenly looks strange. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a fun and easy movie to recommend <br /> <br />7.4 from 10
