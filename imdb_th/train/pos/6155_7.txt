"Bedknobs and Broomsticks" is a charming, adventurous movie, even though it's not one of the best Disney works. It has good stories in general, good music, great characters, great actors, amazing special effects and delightful, good settings and lovely English landscapes. <br /> <br /> Also incorporating live action and animation Of course, the animation is quite good. The animation is similar to the 1973 animated movie "Robin Hood" and can talk about cartoon characters: there are many wild animals such as bears, elephants, hippos, lions, crocodiles and others like "Robin Hood" ". This seems that the king (lion) is a mixture of Prince John and Raja Richard, not to mention that the bear looks like Little John. <br /> <br /> This movie is often compared to "Mary Poppins". For both reasons, including live action and Ann Animation with similar artwork Both have similar settings in London. Both have their own magic and magical women. Children (Carrie, Charlie and the cute little Paul) are like the children of Banks. Both films are directed by Robert Stevenson and both are starring David Tomlinson. A very serious person like George Banks, Tom Tomlinson, plays the influential and magical person - Professor Emilius Brown This film has a little similarity. But it is important to the story of Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> Most of the songs are good. "The Age of Unbelief" and "Beautiful Sea" are the best. "Portobello Road" is also good. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson is great in this movie again. Angela Lansbury is great as Miss Price and every 3 child actors. People are fine too: Cindy O'Callaghan while Carrie, Ian Weighill is Charlie (the boy in the «unbelieving age») and Roy Snart as a little brother. Br /> <br /> I like black cats. It is cool. It looks like Salem, a black cat from the series "Sabrina, a teenage witch". I find it cute every time. The movie theater was transformed into a white rabbit. Rabbits are really cute, soft and cute animals. I just love them! Even the fun is that whenever Professor Emelius Sobling turns into a white rabbit because when he transforms into a human again, he shakes his nose like a rabbit. It's a hilarious joke plus his funny shapes and that mustache. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is an ok movie. But the ending is quite bad The first minute of this movie is nothing special. But then it developed a lot. However, the end is weak. That was my important criticism about this issue, in good part because the things that the Knights moved were too much for me and because of the war feeling.
