I turned on the TV to hear the white roommate's voice and heard "$ 400 for a fully furnished apartment", so I ran into the TV room, expecting to flick for another 70 years, and more. Fortunately, I can go back to the beginning (DVR buffer) and press the record button to see all (Cinemax is not uncut and in no less HD!), In addition to some holes in the story and dialogue / events that are unlikely to happen. Periodically shaking, worthy of your time to watch Beautiful, creepy and sometimes progressive: Beverly Dee's character, Angelo, masturbates in front of Alison Parker, played by Christina Raines Parker, stabbed with blood filled. With her father's father's blood watching) this film is full of bad clothes, all 70 pieces (polyester and astro suit is tacky) and decoration, I'm not good, beyond the bloated music score and watching. Movie that you ever The great actor took a moment on the first page of the film to examine it. It was surprising to see Christopher Walken, Jerry Orbach and Jeff Goldblum still astonishing Sylvia Miles- amazingly young! Enjoy!
