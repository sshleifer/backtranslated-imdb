Hello, Your TheaterX now actually found this while watching a video in the flea market in almost new conditions and in the back of the box it saw that it was quite "cult". So, of course, it's home too. I <br /> <br /> a strange movie Former First Lady Aunt and cousin Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis lives in a 28-room house on Long Island (Suffolk Co.) and shares a house with raccoons, fleas cats (eyow!) And who knows what other Suffolk Co. is. Above them, at one point, for living in the old dirt and Jackie came to determine the right thing. However, this is a strange pair of pairs, big and small Edie ... Ed (daughter) often wears something on the head and dance, singing and giving little help to a camera that doesn't have a reason. Big Edie (mother, age 79) apparently likes to run around naked and while we get advice from what might seem lucky that this thing has been done tastefully (?) To the point that we survived. May From mercy These women talk and talk mostly about the past and it doesn't make all the feelings except them. They live in complete dirt. Cats do business everywhere. ("Look, that cat is going to the bathroom after my picture!") And one bedroom seems to be the center of operations. If I close my eyes and listen to Big Edie's voice, it reminds me of my very own aunt who came from that area of ​​the country and has a Lawn Accent. Scratch all the time, so the place must be disturbed. This box refers to these two women as "unorthodox" and I have to say that in this case, it is just an euphemism for "Their lack of gourds" But this movie doesn't have time for you to feel something for them. This is a creepy, sad and disgusting part. But I can't stop watching when I start This is not a flick of my "normal" type, but I find it quite interesting. It will not be for everyone, even if guaranteed.
