Wow ... I don't know what to say. I just watched Seven Pounds. No one made me cry like Will Smith. This guy is in line with the emotions of various human beings. This film is made with skill and beauty. It's hard to find such a fiercely human race in Hollywood today. I will compare it to "Pay it Forward" and "Crash" as far as the display of both light and dark in the raw way. Of course, stick to you for a long time and give you a lot of thought. I have love and passion for movies like this. Usually not one for "Bad ending" but is a true quest that gathers emotions, life, raw things, and something more than many shallow shores in the surrounding area. So I don't mind a little pain at the end. It's true that life never ends with happiness. Sometimes it's not the end of happiness that you think it should be. Many people can live a happy life, even if the love and life of one person will disappear. If you are a person who looks a little deeper than the rest, you will love this movie!
