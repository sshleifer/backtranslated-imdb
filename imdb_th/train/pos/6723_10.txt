Riding Giants is an amazing movie. It shows that these people are living back and forth just by surfing. In general, their lives are surfing, living, breathing and fun. They don't care about money, work, women or whatever. For them, the waves are their girls. I have never surfed before and it looks very difficult. I do not understand how they can be with them. This is a great movie and if you love surfing the web, you should really see this movie. If you are a surfer and you want to find out who started surfing, how did he come to life? It may be a documentary. But it's really good - Tara F -
