FORBIDDEN PLANET is the best SF movie from the golden age of SF cinemas and what makes it a great movie is a wonderful feeling. As soon as the spaceship lands the audience - through the human crew, the ship - travels through an intelligent and sometimes scary adventure. We met Robbie, who could not forget. Morbuis, the mysterious Altair, his beautiful and innocent daughter, and we learned about the planet's past - The Krell, who died overnight or did they? <br /> <br /> You can nitpick and say that this world was filmed clearly in a movie studio with a backdrop as a drawing. But it increases the sense of horror of claustraphobia I feel and Bebe and Louis Barron electronic music add to the atmosphere <br /> <br /> I'm shocked that this film is not in the top 250 movies of IMDB.
