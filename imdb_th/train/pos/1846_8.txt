When I first read the story of this drama, I thought it would be like Sex and the City, but this drama was not the same. The story of the character looks more realistic and you pay more attention to the situation. The concept of the drama is similar to the four women. 30 things that lead us through friendships and relationships and problems and conflicts between Katie the GP is a dark and lamentable character that you find difficult to relate to as well and be a good friend. Trudi's widow. Trudi's character is a heart-warming condition because you can relate to the difficulties she has with the fact that she is a mother. One in four people Jessica is a loving party girl and knows what she wants and how to get it. She is a cute character and close to Siobhan, who is married, who loves her husband completely. Can not help her eyes to find her colleagues. Above all the drama is interesting, and if the BBC continues to produce the drama, it will do well. It is different from other actresses such as Sex and the city or Desperate Housewives. If played right, it may be the next cold feet. Plus the male characters are not as bad as well.
