I just watched this movie when previewing and everything I can say is ... "What I just watched ????" and I mean in a good and bad way. <br /> <br / > The plot is very easy. Stiller and Black play with friends / neighbors. Stiller is a hard-working and focused person, while Black is a dreamer. Black invented this concept to create a spray that removes crabs. The idea became very popular and the blacks were very rich. The lavish lifestyle that Black has received and the fact that he is still trying to be the best friend with Stiller, makes Stiller mad with envy. <br /> <br /> As I Said Everything else is strange. The direction was strange by opening strange images that swirled around the dialouge and the acting was very strange. Strange in the type of tourism And the audio track is the most strange thing in the movie from the strange "Envy" song that reappears in the scene that you think you will hear 80s classical music, but it's Japanese. <br /> <br > The real question is ... funny? That depends entirely on the individual. I'm breaking the uncertainty of this movie. After the screening, I heard people call it not scary and glad that it was free. I understand their issues strangely. There are no jokes, so if you are not stuck with the uniqueness of it all, you will hate this movie. Absolutely hate this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is set to pay a lot of money at the box office and become a classic DVD cult. If you can laugh in a movie that doesn't really have a joke. Like Cable Guy or Punch Drunk Love, I suggest you watch If you don't escape from this movie It will make you angry
