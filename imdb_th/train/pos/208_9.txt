The Sunshine Boys is a great joke about two former rhetoric singers who are reluctant to reunite on a special TV program, even if they insult each other. <br /> <br /> The comic genius of two professors. In the office is the protagonist! Some of the best scenes are when the two are fighting the most foolish things! The material is quick and witty, attracting attention of all ages. <br /> <br /> SPOILER MILD NOTIFICATIONS: There are some slightly sad moments at the end of the movie that are related to the impact of that age. Make this movie Soft, sincere and gentle that shows this reviewer that what they both want most for success is one thing. <br /> <br /> If anyone loves The Odd Couple, you will love this movie. Great movie!
