I just saw this recently. But has been aware of it for many years and has always been attracted by its name Now it is mine as one of my favorite movies. It's hard to explain the incredible story that Maysles discovered, but everything in it works great. It has many pictures and memorable moments that you feel you are encroaching on in the private world. I fell in love with this movie and with the characters in it. As if the creator had cast the spectacle of the audience and attracted us into the strange world of strange beings, true noble family families It has a tangible atmosphere and I think myself wanting to stay away from it all. Make my corn on the cob at my bedside table. It has the air of grief that penetrates all over. The collapse of greatness for this popular family, money has disappeared, but their weather and elegance remain the same as their beauty. It drew me from the first frame and long after the movie ended, I found myself wondering about their fate. Wondering if I walked along East Hampton Beach, I might still hear Old Edie's voice at night and see the Little Edie's shadow dancing in the window behind the thick ivy hanging.
