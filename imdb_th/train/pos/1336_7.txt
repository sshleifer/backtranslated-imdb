This is a generally good movie with good stories, great actors and great music. The movie is a bad pity. One of the weakest points of this film is the annoying scene that is copied from Pretty Woman. Why? Trying new things. Abbas hurt? Mustan? <br /> <br /> This movie is about the new married couple of Raja and Priya (Salman-Rani). Priya cannot conceive after an accident during the previous pregnancy. And finally they decided to use the mother instead of carrying their children. They chose Madhubala. The rude servant by Preity Zinta. And even if they choose a woman, does that mean that the man must sleep with her? Have you ever heard of insemination? However, I guess the writer had heard all of this or not, the film will not be created, so the concept is intentionally intended. <br /> <br /> Salman works very well. It's good to see him play as a serious character. But his character suffers from unnecessary and cheap conversations about his great love for his wife and the difficulty of sleeping with other women. It's amazing and unrealistic. Rani doesn't matter. She's always effective and trying to do something with the role. But was completely overshadowed by Preity Zinta. <br /> <br /> This film is a great thing that stole big performances with her impeccable performances. She changed from a loud prostitute to a sensitive and natural woman. She lives a vocal film and makes you love her and admire her at the same time, partly because her role is partly due to her magnetic and positive personality. This is one of the best performances of her career. There is no doubt that she is more talented than contemporary in her industry. She should do more. <br /> <br /> The ending of the movie focuses only on what I said above. It is a great thrill and action. Watch Preity. <br /> <br /> 7/10 for this movie! 10/10 - For Preity!
