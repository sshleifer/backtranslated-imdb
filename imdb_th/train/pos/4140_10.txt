Is an amazingly funny and original item The actor who started with Julie Brown (Gotback Gun's Homecoming Queen's) is perfect. Add Amy Hill (American Kim - American girl) who plays lesbian who often argues with her partners and business partners. (Asian restaurant - WOK - Don "T RUN) I laugh harder than other shows I've seen (including Newhart - one of my favorites all the time). If you like movies like Naked Gun and Airplane- you will Love this series. One of the best moments of the show is Cindy Williams playing by herself when she looks at Tammy that is dry. Cleaned, Tammy found the image of Cindy Williams in her coat. The image of Cindy Williams acted unreasonably with the bowling pin upside down - it's great to see actors like Zim. Andy Williams Opera with many surprises in a short period of time. I hope today will be released on DVD with special features, special bonuses, the most fun series I've ever seen !!!!
