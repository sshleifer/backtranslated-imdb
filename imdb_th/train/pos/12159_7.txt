- After their son was sentenced to life imprisonment, Adele (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shirley Winter) begin to receive threatening calls because people are easily knocking down their sons. The couple decided to move to California to avoid the disclosure of the trial and to start a new life. They started a successful dance school shortly. One student had a wealthy unmarried father who quickly fell in love with Adelle. In the meantime, Helen is busy with raising rabbits and becoming too passionate about religion. It's just a moment before everything is broken and women enter the world of madness and murder. <br /> <br /> - Can I not help comparing things that are important to Helen? To Whoever Slew Auntie Roo, also starring Shelly Winters when the movie seems to be suspended in the presentation of Aunt Anu's madness It may take a lot of time in this movie. But when she enters the scene, Helen is one of the Bad Mad Mutha. You don't want to mess with her. Winter is so mad that it is impossible for me not to enjoy her performance. I will not make the movie broken. But what Helen can do above all else. <br /> <br /> - And as far as Winter Reynolds is ridiculous in her role as a gold-digging dancer. I received the impression that she thought she was in the movie to nominate her to receive the award. This is not Citizen Kane! Seriously showing up Hey Debbie, don't you know that you have the main purpose of being a victim of winter insanity? <br /> <br /> - I love the ex-actress in the evening. Horror movies of career What is the matter with Helen? As much fun
