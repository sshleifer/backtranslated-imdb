I'm always a fan of James Bond! I watched almost all movies except Die Another Day and The World is Not Enough. Graphics for everything or nothing. Amazing! Voice talent ......... Wow! I love BROSNAN ribs! He finally has a bond in the video game! he is a good guy! I enjoy Bond games in the past: Goldeneye, The World is Not Enough, Agent Under Fire and Nightfire. This one is definitely the best! In the end, Mr. Brennan (I would like to call him Mr. Brosnan as a sign of respect. Yes, I can!) He is very excited to hear in video games ....... Finally! DUH! I've seen him perform with Robin Williams, and then let me tell them they created a great team. Pierce Brosnan is a funny and handsome guy. (I mean talking badly in a good way) and being one of the actors that you want to walk up to and embrace arms. Embrace, say: "Pierce Brosnan. Thank you for being a James Bond." I don't know who James Bond is. "He's a great actor! I am a big fan of Willem Dafoe, although I can see him in a few movies. His role as Nikolai Diavalo is excellent. (I miss the character's name, right?) LOL !!!! He works great with accents. Sometimes I don't hear the accent. I have seen Willem. I mean, Mr. Dapho is shown in two films: Finding Nemo and Spider-Man and my favorite actress: KIRSTEN DUNST! SHE ROCKS! However, he never stopped to be surprised. And Richard Kiel. Wow, he's part of the fix. I've seen him in this movie and he's great! In fact, my grandparents met Mr. Kiel and I was jealous when they told me, but Kirsten Dunst was in the top of my Celebritie list that I wanted to meet. John Cleese was amazing. Seeing better people, playing smart and creating Q gadgets! Mr. Kleise hilarious! I've seen him work with Pierce Brosnan in Goldeneye and Tommorow Never Dies. He's great! John Cleese's latest project is Shrek 2, starring Mike Myer's, Cameron Diaz, Julie Andrew's and Eddie Murphy (now Shrek 2 is in the theater!) Good LUCK 007! Oh yes, and as Q said: "Growing up 007!"
