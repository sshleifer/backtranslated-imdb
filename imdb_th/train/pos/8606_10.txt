Looks like there is no middle ground in this movie! Most happen in dreams and like dreams, most often stupid and irrational. There is also a spectacular production with great music and good performances, especially our angels. <br /> <br /> Jeanette's uninspired, insulting, unknown reasons and other trends. Surprising and happy At one point, she would sing a sample song from Carmen followed by Faust's last three (holding a lapdog for strange reasons). Then "Aloha Oe" on the beach! <br /> <br /> It's a surreal movie - very fun if you can get into the groove.
