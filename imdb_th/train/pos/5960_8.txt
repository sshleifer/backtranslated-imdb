It's good to see Jorja Fox in the role that she can smile a lot. Like to listen to her singing A great change that saw her leave her CSI / West Wing / ER role. The movie itself was entertaining. But seemed to skip some explanations Many characters seem to be happy in one minute and happy next time and it is up to your imagination to find the cause. Each character is quirky and in some cases I can't wait to see what they will do next or hear what they will say next. This film is not full of clean people. But people with complex reasons that may make mistakes feel bad about them and find a way to fix them.
