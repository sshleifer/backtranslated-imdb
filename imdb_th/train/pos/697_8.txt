This is one of the first independent movies I've ever seen. For a very low budget, it can do well. As an insomnia, I can sympathize with the main character, even if my sleep problems are never severe or disturbing. <br /> <br /> Focus on Good actions in the story that I didn't see in the movie theater and made both of them suitable for movie settings. There are a few noticeable errors. But may have a purpose You will see after you watch the movie. This film is very private and worth watching twice. No perfect movie But the Hollywood version can't do anything better than all 8/10.
