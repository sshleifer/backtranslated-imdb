It helps if you understand the Czech language and can see this in the original language and understand Czech's obsession as well. 'Expert' but if not 'Jedna ruka netlaska', it is another great Czech movie. It's funny, dark and very fun. The highest compliment I can pay is that you never know what will happen next and make that feeling good for the second and third viewing. <br /> <br /> For a small country That the Czech Republic has produced Amazing world-class movies and literature, from Hrabal, Hasek and Kundera to Menzel, Sverak and many more. Czech humor is naturally dark and uncompromising. But often have a feeling of innocence and warmth behind This film is just that it is inhumane and involves a cute little side of man. But under it all, there is a beautiful story full of promises, good intentions and optimism. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this. And other projects related to Trojan and Machacek. Enjoy it. It's a movie that was created for that reason - however, it is close to the Czech people to write a truly happy ending ...
