I found this movie very good in all aspects. The performance was excellent from all the characters, especially Ms.Stone and Morissey. Tramell's characters were just more intelligent and more distracted by the mind in a matter of minutes. Interesting story, although this film will be very important for the mind that plays between the main characters and the way Catherine continues to write with new methods and twists for her novel. The setting is still excellent and the whole atmosphere of the movie is a mystery that is thrilling like a masterpiece. Going to watch this movie now, it deserves better than what has been received by the audience, which is misunderstood by some horrible comments about the movie. (Before it starts) ..... You will not regret if you watch it ...
