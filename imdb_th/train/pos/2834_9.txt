I didn't watch many German comedy movies. But if this movie is a must do, I have to go and see! Simple story But effectively bringing two very different people to travel from Germany to Italy after Eva, an unemployed mother, found that her husband's husband was having a relationship with the wife of a rich lawyer I will not reveal anything more. But the result is a very funny activity set with complete conclusions The interest in my foreign movies has increased since I watched this movie for the first time. I recommend to everyone (any adult ... don't let the integration of small children fool you into thinking that it's a family movie) that is funny - even those who are not familiar with the language
