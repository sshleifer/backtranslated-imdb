This is a documentary collection that takes 11 minutes, 9 seconds, and 1 frame from artists around the world. Various documentaries and deal with all types of concepts. ) Some weak segements while others are very strong Some people have some politics, not others; Some have only 9/11. Some people use 9/11 as a theme to experience universal feelings, emotions and tragedies. Some are mainstream while others are abstract and artistic.) This film has never been censored in any way, so the idea you see is raw and powerful. <br /> <br /> Film This is a very controversial matter. I think the two parts may tick the right wing. (One from Egypt that American soldiers died and the Palestinian bomber returned to the spirit again from England, which described the Chilean overthrow of Chile on September 11, 1973 in 50,000 deaths and terrible cruelty) From Mexico is the most effective, counting the collapse of the tower and the death that occurs in bright fashion (You must see to believe it) <br /> <br /> Even though the final product is not uniform as well. Some groups are almost "pointless". I still recommend this. It is very difficult to rank the movie because the different parts are all over the place. (Some people are weak, some have great power;) I score 9 out of 10 just because some segments are excellent and cover issues that are often censored. (Mexico, the United Kingdom, Japan, Egypt)
