Gypo Nolan (Victor McLaglen) is as bad as everyone else in the world. Living in Ireland in 1920, Gypo and his Irish friends are part of an underground rebellion against an oppressive Brits who want to be killed by the rebels. England returned to the city secretly He thinks he can trust his friend Gypo, but the 20-pound reward proves to be too tempting. Gypo causes his friends to be killed and sink into the pit of despair and intoxication. At the same time, another Irish rebel was searching for a newsreader. Gypo, whose money burned in his pocket, was their main suspect. But they, who are his friends, do not want to believe the story of The Informer is simple in the story. But complicated in moral and emotional issues It's one of John Ford's most emotional films. The thing that Gypo does is wrong, but we can understand his motives for sure. We also understand his poor personality and have many sympathy for him. The script is very suspicious as well. It is a suspicion that we are quite sure that we know how everything will end so we have to grit and endure it. The performance is outstanding. Victor McLaglen, the actor in many of Ford's films, should give his best work here. (And received an Academy Award from this story) All the actors in the movie deserve admiration. In addition to scripts and great performances, The Informer is also one of John Ford's most popular movies. I love the dark side of Ford. In its mood, including in its form, The Informer reminds me of two of my favorite Ford movies: The Long Voyage Home (1940) and The Fugitive (1948). It is similar to The Grapes of Wrath (1940 ) On these issues 10/10
