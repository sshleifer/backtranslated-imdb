This film is an economical movie with foreign objects and has a minimum filming location. The Philippines came to replace Thailand and no one really went to Hong Kong. The stock image of Cathay Pacific's Jumbo Jet at the old airport makes the transition perfect. This film proves that you don't have to spend a lot of budget or star-studded stars to create a great movie. There are no gaffes and gluttons that new filmmakers often stumble upon Excellent work from people who know every aspect of filmmaking and who understand the compromise between art and the box office. Great work!
