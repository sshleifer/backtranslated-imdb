This is what I'm talking about. Finally, a horror outing with a low budget, which uses the limitations of the advantages WENDIGO. While there are flaws, sometimes it is a victory of imagination. It is true that it is evident with the EVIL DEAD style camera, but still looks 99% better than direct filming. <br /> <br /> The story is very simple. At the remote cabin and threatened by a hunter without special abilities, but director Larry Fessenden knows how to create suspense and add an insecure layer of insecurity through the legendary Wendigo. Is it really? Is it in the imagination of the boys? Is it something that causes the emotions of the child? <br /> <br /> Some people say that this movie is not satisfying because it is something you have to decide. Do not be fired from the nonsense. A movie that makes you think that is not something to avoid. It is one of rejoicing.
