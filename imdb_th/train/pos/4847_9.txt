This movie is one of the things that missed me and I never expected anyone to "get" but I was glad I suggested and others didn't like it. My deceased father HATED Arthur Askey, but this film is a story that he is very happy with and his constant enthusiasm for "The Ghost Train" and "Old Ted 'Olmes" transferred to me since I was a child Many years later I watched it every time. Enjoy the familiarity. I always wonder if it will never be the same. But I never disappointed with it Have lots of fun The order on the train was truly inspiring when Askey and Murdoch proceeded to disturb the arrogant male passenger. Then all the parts in the station are amazing that you have to follow. Yes, it is a day and full of English during the war in accents and plot. (Based on the original play by Arnold Ridley of Dad's Army Fame!) But full of great character performances - including Kathleen Harrison. The atmosphere is horrible, close to Arthur Asyarn's craft. This is cheap as a chip in the UK on DVDs to treat yourself. It's the perfect Saturday / Sunday morning or any day of the afternoon entertainment that is light. I thank you .... <br /> <br /> Old movies can be a good movie!
