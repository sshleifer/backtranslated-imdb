Late one night on an empty street in an empty room, Martin Sheen spun a yarn for Robert Carradine of Hopalong Cassidy and friends to follow a group of cowboys that killed a few people and kidnapped Cassidy's daughter. <br /> <br> Writer / Director Christopher Coppola may have been angry with Prince William Boyd with the courage to create a modern, cost-effective movie with a story of a beloved Hopi. There should not be a character tied to an actor who is not allowed to play with him or her again. <br /> <br /> I think it's fun and interesting updates of the classic programmers of the era. Thirty and forty, though guilty of bad performances But it was difficult and unpretentious, causing me to not like it. <br /> <br /> The whole production is quite strange. But I enjoy the scene between Sheen and Carradine. The fact that we are watching the story in the story makes it more strange and exaggerated.
