Sometimes it takes a specialist to create a movie like Kubrick that will bring that little thing into a special ingredient that is unpredictable and difficult to convert to a great movie or a great script as a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> <br /> It's not just Stephen King's story. There is enough meat and potatoes to make it difficult for even the most skilled people to be arbitrary. Set Heck, even the King himself is not bad. It is the way that Kubrick perceives King's universe that he has changed his face. Time, however, is how the screen makes THE SHINING have both a visual feast and a master class that has the compression to direct. <br /> <br /> Missing scenes Kubrick is usually a lot of movies moving fast, sharp, lively, though it's not fast, not edited and heavy, and it takes at least 160 minutes. The camera walks along the elegant path of Overlook hold overnight, as if a mysterious maze for exploration explore follow a linear image showing the interiors, impeccable in their greatness.

What Just that The Red River flows through the hotel elevator slowly. Jack slammed the door with an ax. The camera moved along with him, following the movement when it happened instead of remaining static as if it were a camera piercing through the door, not an ax. The ultra-fast zoom in the boy's face pushed us into his head before we saw the two women who died from his POV and of course the scene in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> People talk about Jack. Too much Nicholson His madness was unsuccessful because he was Jack Nicholson. That man looks half crazy. Playing like crazy makes him a self-exaggerated caricature. Shelley Duvall is one of the most inspiring choices in the selection. Kubrick comes from an excellent performance for Robert Altman in the seventies (3 women stealing like the United States NASHVILLE). She brought it. Which the vulnerability and emotional distress in her character Excellent and very underrated actress
