I love this movie It is difficult to see the picture of postpartum Vietnam and the film's fight scenes and exciting explosions. I don't know if I will be affected by it. What is amazing in the sense of an alien veterinarian? It's hard to see quite frankly. We all understand the battle and the Apocalypse Now type of drama. But it's very different What happens when they return and try to live? They can not It made me realize that a lot of people are busy in America. Can not create a relationship, can not sleep, can not have love, can not handle "normal society" can. They feel completely different. This is a big tragedy and that is not enough. Yes, we have changed our attitude about Vietnamese veterinarians. Now we like them, but what does it seem like it doesn't make any difference to them? So it's a great movie. But i cry a lot I have no other reviews
