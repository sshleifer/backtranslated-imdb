Very Slight Spoiler <br /> <br /> This movie (Even on TV only) Very good. I didn't pay attention to the difference in appearance or accent so I couldn't comment. The performance in this story is great. I have to flirt myself and say that "Remember, it's just this movie that doesn't really happen." As I sat and listened to Harris and Quinn talking, I knew it was something John and Paul would say if they He has this meeting. John's opinion and burning immediately immediately matched his character. (Especially in restaurants!) As well as his depression while Paul is easy Both actors performed very well and I was excited to see this movie. It's a wicked experience for the Beatles fans and prepare for some surprises!
