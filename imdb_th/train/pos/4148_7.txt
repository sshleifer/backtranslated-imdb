Try setting one thing straight: this movie doesn't try to define a new genre, not Dr. Strangelove o Young Frankenstein It's a stupid flick with three great female actors. (Can't remember the other similar comedy), Rachel Dracht and Amy Poehler from SNL and Indie Queen Parker Posey. This story is basic: three gals are "losers" in the college and still in protection. Poehler is a dog trainer. (Those who are unable to date with a blind person), Posey is a Senator's assistant (who "doesn't get exposure from men since Clinton is in the office." And OK, and Dracht has a gay fiance (Seth Meyers from SNL Comedy). They must prevent the "uncool" daughter of the senator. (Amber Tamblin, cute from the TV series "Joan of Arcadia") must shame her during the spring. Of course, they had to go see her and the fun happened. Overall, it's a short, funny and fun comedy.
