I have to be 100% honest with a friend who is an IMDb user. I want to watch this movie for a very long time only because of the poster. Charlotte Gensburg isn't so sexy and charming, smiling? I love this girl! I got what i expected But only half This film should create expectations for those who love movies, romantic love or stories that are related to intelligent humor and dramatic situations, as I disagree with other IMDb users who state that ; I have to admit that "Pr√©te-moi ta main" has many flaws. <br /> <br /> My main problem with this film is the lack of screen chemistry between the main characters. There is no single previous scene, the highest point showing the main characters sharing moments. "Love" or even a clue to suggest that they are interested in each other. <br /> <br /> In reality There is only one scene in which both share a very awkward moment. (When both are in the sofa) and does not help the audience understand about the love that may occur I didn't buy dinner sets. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie still delivers very funny moments and strong conversations that support such a smart place. I mean, with intelligence, it's very difficult to execute a 43 year old man in this era. <br /> <br /> I understand it's a movie and that's why I admit it's a funny situation. In addition, humor is also useful. There are moments that relate to S&M, comedy with Chabat's best friends, references to lesbians, funny situations related to women in the family, and so on. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Gaionsbourg's performances are top Great and she is the reason for watching movies. She is funny, sexy, slim and good and shows that she is a versatile actress and has the ability to draw comedy and drama in the true sense. <br /> <br /> Alain Chabat is a very good actor and Optimum performance I think the support team does what they can. <br /> <br /> The scores, directions, art and other technical aspects are very good and give a dynamic perspective to movies. <br /> <br /> Those who enjoy With this type of cinema should be welcomed after the credit ends It is a good example of the feeling in the cinema.
