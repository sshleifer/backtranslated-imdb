I watched this program, saying that it was reminiscent of David Lynch's Twin Peaks, which is my favorite program. The fast-acting show introduces us to the main characters and the special episode of the pilot is the best thing for me. It's amazing and getting all the evil side of the show ready to continue. Season One of my biggest criticisms is that I was a little disappointed by the show - probably not wrong because it was canceled after only 1 season. It seems to show that it has a lot of potential and deserves better treatment. Much The performance is excellent and this show has some of the best characters (good and evil) in that I've seen great development in a short time. There is a magical effect for the first 5 or ten performances, which is quite amazing. But this is a correction when the season progresses. Worth the watch. Of course there is something wrong!
