I bought the Dark Angel Season 1 and 2 two weeks ago after pairing Season 1, episode 5, and nothing prepared for me for a great performance. I didn't have much fun from the fireflies. (And an amazing performance) I will accept Season 2, which is not very good. But there are also some amazing episodes (see this set, Bag 'Em, Berrisford Agenda, Fire Harbor, Freak Nation, etc.) and Alec. Great. I heard some plans for Season 3 and I must say that I can't believe it was canceled - I won't destroy it for you - but it will vibrate! I think it has a lot of potential as a movie. (Although at this time it seems to be highly unlikely) to prove my enchantment, the barcode number of Max is 332960073452 and in the past two weeks I have been there. The season is too good.
