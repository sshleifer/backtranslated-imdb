"Bye Bye Birdie" is not one of the best musicals of all time But it's fun and accessible for a large audience The original movie may be a great story by Dick Van Dyke showing his unique Broadway role. But they made a new plot, so the movie was not very satisfied. The new creation, which aired on ABC in 1995, is more honest than the original script and includes some original songs used in the national tour, which was starring Tommy June and New Think. <br /> <br /> Jason Alexander is a type of person who is different from Dick Van Dyke. But he is a good actor like Albert Is a perfect fit for Rose They are also great works from Tyne Daly as Mae and Mark Kudisch as Conrad Birdie (the role that he played on the national tour). <br /> <br /> This film is not a problem at all. The main responsibility is Chynna Phillips, who looks attractive and looks too old to be a teenager. And George Wendett is quite gentle like her father, leaving the "kids" number (many of the original members, Paul Lindsey, steal the program) <br /> <br /> But all this is Delightful story A well-made movie that is a material that deserves
