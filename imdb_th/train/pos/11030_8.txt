Watching Cliffhanger made me think about the early 90s, which was the time when every new action movie could be described as "Die Hard in a / on" It's <br /> <br /> but different from passenger 57 and under Siege, which is a good Clones Die Hard according to his own condition. Cliffhanger distribute with the attached feeling of many action movies and landscapes. Which is amazing which in the end Their big threats threatened and caused a minor conflict of people who fought and died among the peaks. <br /> <br /> Last year, other movies such as A Simple Plan and Director Cliffhanger Renny Harlin realized. The visual impact of the use of brutal violence and the struggle to survive from the cold and uninteresting natural environment. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence has been highly praised. All it deserves: Its intensity allows us to forget the camera and the actors and believe that what we see is happening. Not even the images of Harlin that were stuffed with efficiency But still threatening to become too funny (Which he repeated in the deep blue sea) or the ridiculous expression on Ralph White's face can make the power of the scene darker. <br /> <br /> The next impressive scene is the gunfight. And rob the plane As written by Stallone and Michael France and directed by Harlin, audiences will plunge into action without knowing which agents are involved in theft and not: unexpected cross-bloodings, as Roger Ebert Have noticed the stuntman who transferred mid-air between the planes, deserves special recognition. <br /> <br /> Later, during the avalanche sequence, one of the terrorists / robbers who watched Select the fall The snow wall carries him down the mountain. As far as I know, no one was killed in the creation of this film. (A small miracle considering the extreme characteristics of acrobatics) Obviously, using a model But the self-portraits are still impressive because we wonder if Harlin (or more than one of the second director) knows where to place the camera. <br /> <br /> I'll use Sly Stallone as I am an action hero every day of the week because he is one of the few movie stars that I have ever seen that is believed to be a person who can withstand extreme physical and emotional pain at the same time. Feel Gabe Walker's role helped fill the strength of Stallone's performance: he played older and more risky action heroes, giving an impressive low performance as an assistant. Life on the mountain that has to be redeemed by myself <br /> <br /> Post Matrix, an action hero inspired by many comic books. Today, Stallone's Walker is a normal person who becomes a hero. Without being able Cliffhanger computer or supernatural hero in almost freezing to death, and his clothes began to show large tears as he barely survived the dangerous situation. He wins when he is hit and shed when he is cut, especially in the cave scene, when he picks up a rock style from a villain. <br /> <br /> You should notice that the most nasty villain. Really helped in the performance of the movie: When I first saw this movie as a teenager, I was deeply rooted for good people every step and predicted that another bad guy would bite the dust. (Or more than ice); At one point I was regarded as one of the most cold-hearted characters in the movie that deserves death. <br /> <br /> Lithgow's English accent is unbelievable to be a plane or helicopter. Replica of this movie, but he basically is a good actor and one of the few people who can perfectly recite ridiculous dialogue: in one scene, looking at Significant character Stallone and Ruger trying to decide who to give them to him, the fact that "you are! "Even better actors like Anthony Hopkins may have problems with that chapter. <br /> <br /> Although Cliffhanger will throw away credibility from time to time. But for more entertainment only> <br /> For example, at the beginning of the movie, Lithgow spoke to one of his men, "Retire [Stallone] when he came down." There is no real criminal offender. Unaware of this mistake: his carelessness caused Rooker to sound a warning to Sly on the rock, and this caused a war of tugs between Stallone and the bad guy trying to pull him down. The rope tied to his leg <br /> <br /> Lithgow can give his command in a more delicate way. But the sequence may not be as fun as it seems if it does not give Rooker the opportunity to openly challenge the arrogance of his captors. <br /> <br /> Do a lot in the form of a Saturday morning movie script or (in some Times) Westerners Cliffhanger was built on a strong foundation in which it lives with some weak elements that will <br /> <br /> In addition to the model of the plane that is said to be painful, the weak moments and the two scenes taken in the cheap indoor scenes with really fake snow, as well as the two scenes Related to bats and Wolves that do not seem necessary to tell stories that are packed with action. Finally, Harlin's decision to shoot a slow-motion death scene seems useless because the technique is not related to the scene. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Alone is too old to be an action movie. In this movie, it looks very reliable until I wonder what he will be like many years later. But perhaps it's the best time Cliffhanger can stand at any time without a sequel: an outdated and outdated movie franchise There is an informal sequel that calls itself Vertical Limit: when compared to clinker, Cliffhanger is listed in the top 250 list of IMDb. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8 (very good, especially when Considering other Stallone movies)
