First of all, I would say that somehow I remember having watched this movie since I was a child. I couldn't read the subtitles and I thought Sonny Chiba was Sean Connery. If you are unable to suppress the suspicion of at least some adults and accept your seven year olds, you may want to avoid this film. Who said that after watching the 137 minute version of the DVD, I have to say that I enjoy it even though it's not as much as when I was seven years old. (I can remember the ending) <br /> <br /> There are various aspects of the movie that are worth criticizing. The first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes both have funny moments. I really like the difference. Between the scenes shown in the last 10 minutes and The curious choice of backing up music (Listen to the lyrics) <br /> <br /> For action movies, there is a lot of emphasis on the military and personal social dynamics of the team due to the stress of time travel. At the end of this movie, I decided that this was a good thing when I was seven, even though the guff 'relationship' was a bad thing. <br /> <br /> For action movies Especially the great battle scenes between the division and the legion of the Shogun era warriors The filmmaker ensures that as many people as possible die and make it funny. I think this is a great aspect of the movie when I was a child and I am not ashamed to say that I still do. <br /> <br /> I also like the fact that modern soldiers generally wear. 'Do not take time to watch movies on the egg shell to avoid continuous time changes in space. They have large machine guns, mortars, rocket launchers, tanks and helicopters. Which is what I want to think that the powerful IMDb users will do in their boots. <br /> <br /> In the short term, the movie looks amazing, it makes the audience regret that there is no movie. Others, and at the same time have strong advice on why movies like GI Samurai are special
