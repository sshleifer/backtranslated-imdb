This movie surprised me. It has a slightly non-centered touch method that doesn't make you interested. This is a movie I have never heard before. But if you want "sleeper", this is it. Writing, production and acting are excellent. I highly recommend for viewers who want something prudent. Nick Nolte, Sheryl Lee and Alan Arkin are great. Why didn't this film create more than this?
