Christopher Lloyd is really funny and convinced that "Al-Angel Hua" is better than the first movie. But it has many special effects that initially didn't come with a better plot and writing. <br /> <br /> OK - it was written for children but adults have Fun as a child. Tony Danza works really well in his role - but this is not a taxi combination. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover is a good person and seems to be human in his emotions. For a change of gratifying change <br /> <br /> Look at least once - it's worth the effort to catch it.
