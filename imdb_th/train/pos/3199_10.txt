OK, I don't think Trailer Park Boys has a bad story because they kick their ass ... just conflicting. <br /> <br /> Example: Near the end of the movie, it shows Ricky and Ju. Lien said "Patrick Lewis" to put the dog down and walk away Then, at the end, it shows that Ricky and Julian said that they were in prison for 2 years in the TV series. The first pilot clip they performed was Ricky and Julian's same clip. But in the TV series, they should be in prison for only 18 months. <br /> <br /> They also gave us the impression that the story of the film and the story of the TV series are connected. The scene shouted between men), but some actors portray a completely different character The person who paid Ricky for removal and then played Sam Losco in the series <br /> <br /> (again ... I know I have many things to say) in the movie. They inhale coke instead of marijuana. They have never confirmed that the two stories are interconnected, apart from the shouting scene. <br /> <br /> Sorry to continue.
