It may not be the best movie of 2006, but it is just an exciting movie and thinking about Sentinel is a good political thriller that seems like or lends some elements from other political thriller movies. Such as In the Line of Fire and Manchu Candidates The basic plot of this movie is similar to other movies like this: the plot to kill the President of the United States. Michael Douglas is shown as a secret service. Pete Garrison, who pioneered the process to search later That he was surrounded by Kiefer Sutherland, who joined the rival David Breckinridge and Eva Longoria as a rookie Jill Marin. A representative under the guidance of Agent Breckinridge and the Academy Award winner Kim Basinger as First Lady Sarah Ballentine. One improvement for this movie may be more action because there are some sources that consider the same as the action movie. As with Thriller, the good thing about this movie is instead of just an assassination plan to kill the US president. With mole (Judas), the intelligence, the president's leadership in the wrong direction.
