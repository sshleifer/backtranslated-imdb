This movie keeps me constantly entertained. To compare this to the Serial Mom, Mr. Water has returned to a more frightening side. This is not nearly contrary. <br /> <br /> There is a dark side here. A message about success and a reputation that changes people - but more importantly is changing the people around you. <br /> <br /> There are no mistakes in this movie. <br /> <br /> The characters are quite cartoons ... but I want to believe that that's what Waters tried to achieve. <br /> <br /> It's interesting to see that Mr. Waters has evolved ... This is the best of his work.
