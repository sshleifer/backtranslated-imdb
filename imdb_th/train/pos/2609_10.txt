I wrote this episode 9 years after the last episode, and I still get lost from the effects that Wildside has on me. <br /> <br /> It has disappeared effectively as other police dramas have gone and experienced. Succeed But it makes it farther away and does not stray from the realism of the streets, often drawing life events and characters down to T. <br /> <br /> I lost a lot in the series. Instead, we have been ignorant of "Underbelly", which is beyond the truth and creates garbage that is filled with many Americans. <br /> <br /> The width is in the uniqueness of Sydney and I feel indebted. Thank you for this wonderful series. The performance is A grade and it's a shame to see a few actors who have promoted their careers while others fade into confusion. <br /> <br /> I don't. Want Australia to forget this history So I ask ABC to release the complete series on DVD, not the first three. Let this series finish the episode that deserves
