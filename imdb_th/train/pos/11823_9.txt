I truly enjoyed this thing in creating Dick Tracy's identity. This is a well-made product that uses modern technology to create a story in a cartoon age filled with images. If you are a fan of or watching some old movies of Dick Tracy b & w then you are sure to be kicked out of this action. Pastel colors and characters that are larger than life that are expressed in a genuine way in the past, are entertaining as they should be. I personally find that Madonna's musical elements are an important part of this film - CDs that contain her songs from this movie are the things that I listened to frequently over the years. In my mind, Madonna's best moments on both the screen But especially music This is definitely something that will bring "children" out of you.
