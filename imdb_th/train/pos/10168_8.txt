See how Eva Longoria and Paul Rudd in the movie about the dead girlfriend haunting a new girlfriend. It's Gabrielle from the Housewife Desperate and the guy wearing "Sex Panther cologne" in Anchorman. Compete for world-class movies, you have to rethink how you watch movies However, if you are willing to suspend reality for 90 minutes and want to watch a comedy, you come to the right place. All the characters are funny. They work together very well. The real competition is Paul Rudd and Lake Bell. He is funny like he is with friends and she is funny and looks good at the same time. I went with my wife. She enjoyed it and I too.
