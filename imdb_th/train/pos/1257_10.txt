I have read a lot of reviews about this film and I have to say that "How are you!?!" This is a great movie! I think this movie is excellent from beginning to end and the story is very good. I believe that people who don't like this movie don't pay much attention to movies. There are many scenes that are very important. If you don't care, you will be confused and the following scenes may not make sense. I want everyone who doesn't like this movie to watch it again and see it alone so that you can truly be interested. This story is very suitable for me and as I said Every scene in the movie has a perfect point and everything. At the end of the movie, <br /> <br /> Every actor works great! Sean Connery was very good in his role. Laurence Fishburn is excellent as Tanny Brown, who plays a very interesting character. Kate Capshaw is also impressive and looks very good. Blair Underwood was amazing. I didn't expect anything from him at all. But he pulled out a great performance Ed Harris is a real gem in the movie. He plays a seriously ill person and makes you see how his character is disturbed. Watching his eyes in his scene is great !!! In addition, Scarlett Johansson (Kate) is very young in her first role ... not a bad start. The best actor in this movie <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie to anyone who likes members, actors, or likes excitement. This is a great movie and should be watched. Do not listen to all other people's opinions. Go to the movies and come to your own conclusion. I hope you watch the movie and I hope you enjoy it as much as I can. Thank you for reading <br /> <br /> -Chris
