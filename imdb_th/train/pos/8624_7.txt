The best way to start a movie review, such as the Der Todesking, is to let me start by saying that I just came to see this movie directly and the image still burned in my brain - and I don't think they will Move anytime soon. <br /> <br /> It's fair to say that if you are on this page, you have a good idea that this type of movie, even if you don't see it. If not, I would like to remind you that this is not a medium-level gem that has disappeared for a few years from la "Near Dark" and is not a low budget schlocky "fun" B-movie. What is it? It is a low budget art put forward in a way. Simple but irritated. This concept is a simple story, one of the seven stories that revolve around and end with suicide, interspersed with images of rotting corpses. Sounds easy, bored? It's not a word, can't explain how powerful this movie is when you're halfway through. It draws you in whether you want to go. <br /> <br /> I can go for a walk here about the pros and cons of the technical direction. May point out that the various scenes were taken on the super-8 camera and sometimes shaky I can point out that some sound effects are not synced in any way to fight Fulci movies, but at the end of this day, all seems to be a little haggard. <br /> <br / > As far as possible When the extreme movie went, I saw their most difficult thing, but the Der Todesking made me move in a way that others managed, although not particularly scary and there was a scene that I thought "naked" that Actually the most annoying scene I found was the last one. I will not destroy it just to say that the emotional pain of that character drops from the screen and makes you feel empathy if you do not want to despair. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's not the best movie. And that in many places seems to be rough and may have a little skill But despite these shortcomings, the Der Todesking is an experience that I would recommend to everyone. Like to watch challenging movies If you are a person who likes to watch casual or "good" movies or want to do something cruel and pointless, this is not what you are looking for. <br /> <br /> Whether you enjoy it or not. No, it is something you will not forget urgently.
