Ernst Marischka, one of the most respected Austrian directors at that time, created a movie full of beautiful scenes, delicate love, and with respect to all things precious in life. <br /> < br /> Today, if people should hear him, they link Marischka's name to the SISSI trilogy (1955,1956,1957). However, he has created other great films such as DAS DREIMADERLHAUS (1958), EMBEZZLED HEAVEN (1958) and Of course. This MADCHENJAHRE EINER KONIGIN shows the young age of Queen Victoria, although it involves a slightly different theme than SISSI movies, but I don't see many differences between this film and SISSI. They are similar. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost the same. Music style photography In fact, the crew is almost the same. Anton Profes, Bruno Mondi! <br /> <br /> Actors ... Romy Schneider is one of the first major roles. It was an interesting introduction to the role of Sissi since the film was created one year before the first episode of the trilogy about the Empress of Austria. It was a movie that Romy played with her mother Magda Schneider, but Ernst Marischka was not the first director to let Romy play with her mother. The opening of Romen, WENN DER WEISSE FLIEDER WIEDER BLUHN (1953) is her performance with her mother as well. So there are some voices that Romy started her Austrian career based on the reputation of her mother. Of course, there are some truths. <br /> <br /> Again, as in SISSI, this movie shows gentle love. Victoria meets Prince Albert in a small hotel in Dover. Their sympathy depends on pure exaltation in dancing and a gentle smile. and now...? What will it show? Sex only ... but it is the only thing that love is based on. <br /> <br /> I am grateful to Ernst Marischka for these movies. They have spirit and news. Some people may call them worthless. But I will not give up watching these movies They are impressive !!! Not receiving huge wages. UNDERRATED!
