All I can say is that if you don't fall in love with Big and Little Edie after watching this movie, you're not a human! Even after watching it for the first time, I was still stuck. It's a fascinating experience that is hard to explain because I'm sure other fans will confirm after watching. You will cry to think that these two wonderful women are no longer with us. At least we have the Gray Garden. Remember! I think that all of us are fiercely independent. These two women are honored. Although I always admire Jackie Onassis Kennedy, but she's not in your heart like Big and Little Edie. It's hard to get to know these people. I just wish I had!
