Since this is a black historical month and I am investigating the success of many African-Americans in the respective movies, I received this movie from VHS from the library because Duke Ellington and his orchestra are in that Their jazz song, "The Rhapsody" of Franz Liszt, is a highlight of the mix between a mysterious comedian and mysterious music. Other numbers that I like are Kitty Carlisle, especially "Sweet Marijuana ", Carl Brisson's" Cocktails for Two ", including his partner Carlisle But they grew up with you and Toby Wing is a sexy playful person as Nancy tries to say something to Oakie but gets "not now" from him every time. While many characters have motives for the murder that occurred But I was not surprised by the revelation of who did it. And see how much the women here are naked (Although her breasts are covered by hands, either by hand or with some delicate parts) This is a very clear advance code. Good value for any movie that is interested in this kind of thing. PS As a resident of the state of Louisiana for a long time, I like to observe that when someone is born here, because Carlisle is a New Yorker Orleans
