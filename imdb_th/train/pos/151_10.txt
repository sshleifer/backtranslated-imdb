The film is designed to affect the audience and this movie makes me unable to speak. Take beautiful pictures and perform well with conversations that approach poetry, which is related to lust, hate, murder, rape, theft and deception. It weave a serious web site that made me unable to take my eyes off the screen until the credit was closed. The story is sweeping. It took viewers from the brutality of the Spanish Civil War to the human ruins left behind. Roger Casamajor and Bruno Bertanzoni are two young actors who control the screen The players who provide the support are excellent and give real authentic feelings. Scenes, scenes and movies are great. I love taking pictures
