I saw it last night on TV and was very happy. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that makes you feel good and warm around the heart and believe that it's still good in the world. (All neighbors pretended not to see what grace did for Help you and protect you - the old police are my favorite) even if you know that this is not true. <br /> <br /> I love acting (They all look like ordinary people But the greatest thing in the film is intelligence and humor! Just remember the scene in the shop with two women after they have their "tea" !! <br /> <br /> Maybe the ending may be a little confusing. But it didn't stop me from really enjoying The whole story!
