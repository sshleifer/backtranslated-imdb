I do not understand why this movie review is terrible at the international level, unless I am a rocker. I found it sick, brilliant, distorted and complex psychologically. You will not go deeper into the minds of criminal actors in Hollywood movies than this. It has layers within the layer, appropriate performances by Stone and a plot that will make you guess even after finishing. People must understand that Sharon Stone is 48 years old and Michael Douglas is not here. I predict that this movie will be very popular on DVD when people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to professional critics. Try shooting. You might be glad you did!
