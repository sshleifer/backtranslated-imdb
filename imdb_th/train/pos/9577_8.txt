Finally, we have the movie category III for the summer of 2006, first for us, made from the brutal part of crime and equally passionate. Dog Bite Dog not only benefits from the proper name only But also has a flexible direction, great movies and respectable performances from the most relevant people Of course, there must be a capture here in the form of various inconsistencies. But all said that DBD shows an adult spirit that we like to see more and more in the mainstream of Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> It also marks the return of Edison Chen. That was a long time since the first flood of the year. Chen's reserved Machismo did wonders for the movie. But there will be no rudeness, as opposed to Sam Lee, who has a special ability to switch between physical jokes (Crazy 'N' the City, No Problem 2) and insane threats Seeing from him since Made in Hong Kong <br /> <br /> Both of them make Dog Bite Dog and hope that Edison will take a break more easily from now on: touch him, change the project from Princess D to fairy tale, Infernal Affairs and He is still a rare event. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, DBD shows some fascinating images, plays beautiful techniques with shadows and views. The soundtrack enhances the effect. This atmosphere increases the overall mood of movie exploration. The combination of most results may be related to the writer Matt Chow, who had previously worked in three gruesome extremes as well. Dog Bite Dog still has many traits that are recalled from the horror project. The background and the prevalent weather of some creepy things lurking around the corner. <br /> <br /> Be assured that this is not a horror movie instead. The path that is trampled on by the classic One Nite in Mongkok, even though it is a mile away from the corner Instead of Daniel Wu's reluctant mainland killer character, we have Edison playing an unnamed murderer from the hell of Cambodia. Sent to Hong Kong to carry out a single goal, the silent killer almost takes care of the business as soon as it comes to the process of showing the unruly politeness of the beautiful image of the movie. <br /> <br /> Although weaned from childhood until Professional Edison's famous wild dog killer still has human weaknesses and leaves the path by the CID team sent to investigate. This assembly has a good cameo by the movie director Kamal and received good support from the TV star Lai. However, Sam Lee's betrayal staff brought charges that revealed himself to be a disturbed person. very much But the police are excellent. We gradually learned of the internal conflicts of Wai that arose from the police corruption background. His father awakened the devil in the pursuit of unceasing pursuits. <br /> <br /> Little body It is a lot because Edison seems to consider that there is a lot of brutality in the shop, even though the blood per se feels firmer in places and languages ​​for adults only. Rule Once again, no nude pictures led to the conclusion of the Cat III's being sent today hastily. However, DBD is a relatively mature stage and we applaud their arrival. <br /> <br /> During the fight, pierce, hack and shoot, even a professional killer needs love and Daniel. Woo has Cecilia Cheung in One Nite. The courage that Mr. Chen gets is sweetly done by the newcomer Pei Pei, a character without her name. (Unnamed in this story) Meet Edison at an astonishingly abandoned grave that was attacked by her father until the point of insanity and desires to escape. When the killer left HK, he agreed to take her with him and they ran together with love, blossoming on the way. While this film is not in the lovely things But our heart went out to Pei Pei's tragic character and her endless suffering. She performed the shy protagonist. But astonishingly brave, by creating that there are no good people or villains here appearing in a high-end ending. <br /> <br /> Director Cheang Soi's work includes the horror movie Hot Home Sweet Home and Love. The battlefield with Eason Chan, two numbers that are in excess of most accounts by the terrifying behavior of Dog Bite Dog Cheang, try to keep DBD constantly flowing, and considering many parts of playing here, it is Depends on An important base built by people like Johnny Two in the missionary basin at night. There are a few shortcomings that will happen to Edison astonishingly, shrugging off the shot to the chest. But these things are very forgiving. <br /> <br /> Marking the victory back again for the two talented young actors of Hong Kong. We want the movie of the city to flourish again. Dog Bite Dog doesn't stand out in the story. Its right hand is set in a strong style and style with the strength of the muscles and the sharp eyes for seeing and listening. <br /> <br /> Hong Kong has a long tradition and is honored by the story.
