In one way, this movie reminds me of "Jumping Jack Flash". Remember Whoopi Goldberg at the shredder? Whoopi zonked out sedatives? Whoopi is a blind lemon and mimics Mick Jagger? The perfect moment was definitely captured on film. But the movie is still bad, right? That's what I feel about "Rich in love". Men hear the wife sing for the first time. After marriage, teenagers talk about the nature of love. Albert Finney eats ice cream out of the tank, and in another scene there is a lovely time for an absent wife. But only the whisper of the story here and you can't wait for it to move Only when the past of The Graces of Charlotte Caffey, which has the image of a great pop song, makes the image wake up ... and it ends. <br /> This picture is a lazy summer South south america
