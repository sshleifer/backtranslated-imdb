Why on earth should you explore the fascinating "world" documentary? How much time do you have in the world so that I can explain this to you? OK, I won't extend my survey on "Earth" until infinite. But I have to stand on the ground because of this, so it is a "must see" documentary. It takes travelers around the nature on the three-animal migration path, including the female polar bear and her child, along with the real life plan of Father Bear. Go hunting for food on his separate route, the mother of the whale Her baby whale is bringing a whale to an immigrant tour to find the victim and the elephant mother with her small child. (Probably not too small, they are elephants), descendants from Africa. Director Alastair Forthegill & Mark Linfield acted "outside the world" to capture the survival skills of many other species of animals. From the magnetic image of our three animal family assistants The team with movie filming skills of Richard Brooks Burton, Mike Holding, Adam Ravetch and Andrew Shillabeer is an animation for shooting images in amazing natural photography cameras and animal instinctive behavior. Not to mention the animals that capture the animals. The Lomo is a U shape, as in v a b l e "the world" is also a lesson for learners about the effects of global warming on animals. The polar bear father in the doctor is a boy animal poster in that story. So fellow human beings, so it's time to travel the documentary to visit the "world" today! **** good
