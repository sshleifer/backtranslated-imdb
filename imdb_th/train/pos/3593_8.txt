Michelle Rodriguez played the role of Diana, a high school girl with a cocky face and 2 x 4 on her shoulders. Diana decided that boxing would be a good way to emphasize her anger. <br /> <br /> I like the relationship between Diana and Adrian. Santiago Douglas, Adrian is excellent. See how their feelings for each other are created by the quadratic circle.
