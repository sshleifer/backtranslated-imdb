When considering that these movies are monotonous, you must think that they must enjoy creating it. The movie focuses on a house that supports strange people who live there. Residents are: Author Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott (with hair!)) Who is haunted by one of his own works; Philip Grayson (Peter Cushing) approaching too many wax statues, John Reid (Christopher Lee), whose daughter's cuteness looks like a building And actor Paul Henderson (Jon Perawethi) is going to get a lot of characters. <br /> <br /> "The house where the blood drops" is worth watching.) Apart from being completed, there may be something hidden. May: It may be a problem with the real horror movie and horror. Like in "The Shining", we may ask if the house / hotel has memories of past events or not. And if nothing else, Ingrid Pitt (As Paul's co-star) hot, hot! At the time of this incident, she also starred in "Countess Dracula" and "The Vampire Lovers" (as well as Peter Cushing). But mark my words: she is a hot queen! I want to see Ingrid Pitt and Barbara Steel star in some stories. <br /> <br /> I guess the strange scene (to say) is where Denholm Elliott wears a pink coat and thick coat You read correctly and what is the name "Denholm"? Oh well, the movie is really cool.
