Like all eco-friendly films in the 1970s, SOYLENT GREEN has a wonderful view of ecological collapse. Excessive population means that there are too many people to give food? I felt that famine was caused by a war or a failed economic policy. Stalin's policies in the Soviet Union in the 1930s have killed millions of people due to starvation and to this day the greatest people who have tragedy are Mao's rural policies in China which lead to And do not forget the great famine in the Horn of Africa in the 1980s and 90s, which is related to conflict, not overpopulation You may want to consider that the two most densely populated areas in the world are Hong Kong and Macau, never experiencing starvation in modern times. Similarly, the expansion of the cottage town around the city, as seen here, is not too strict with populations - it is based on economic factors that people flock to different cities to find work. Who received better wages in the countryside So the image of the streets of New York City that is too crowded to walk through and having people lying on the stairs is quite ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But don't be fooled into thinking of fresh green. A pile of trees with curved corners embracing the shit, because I think this is the best ecological film of the 70s. <br /> <br /> It plays with the knowledge of the audience that is a party about the world at Sol and He was happily beside himself in finding fruit, brandy and fresh meat. Thorns gaping with surprise with ice in his whiskey, smoking and sending classic lines. "If I can afford it, I will smoke for two days, maybe three days." But it is a memorable face of an euthanasia room like Thorn staring at pictures of wildlife, flowers, rivers and snow-capped mountains. It is the world of Thorn that has never been known before. This is a very haunted scene, which makes SOYLENT GREEN a very memorable movie, plus the fact that it has the final screen of Edward G Robinson as a Jew Sol Roth, the oldest, smartest.
