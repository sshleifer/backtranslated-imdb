I can't find anyone to watch DiG! With me because no one knows that I am a fan of both bands Everyone thinks you can enjoy this movie if you like the songs of The Dandy Warhols or Brian Jonestown Massacre. But this is far from the truth. The only requirement is that you are generally interested in music and / or pop culture. The way in which the occupations of both groups are parallel, is the perfect representation of the path that the band can use and watch the people eat and spit out of Dandy Warhols. I agree with other reviews that mention it. It would be good to get the last word from Anton himself, since he is clearly the worst enemy of his own. For me is the respect of Dandys for the BJM (even lacking or retaliation) and for Anton (despite his unpredictable behavior) The Dandy Warhols respects the art that the group created, although the group hated everything that Dandy Warhols now stands. for (Although it is an argument) The best line is when Dandy's drummer says, "I won't take them anywhere I am new again" and the guitarists are blurred unconsciously. For me, this is just to show that powerful music is capable. <br /> <br /> Certainly watch this movie, even if you don't know any bands. It's about the core of rock music and the way they develop, which makes this movie very interesting. It's hard to keep up with the group for a long time.
