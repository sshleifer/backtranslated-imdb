Chuck Jones 'Hare Conditioned' is a comical comic Pitting Bugs Bunny with a white-skinned yellow apartment manager who wants to stuffed him. 'Hare Conditioned' takes full advantage of the multi-purpose setting. The chase uses Bugs and his followers through various departments that lead to the inspiring gag, which they quickly emerge from various departments that wear whatever clothes that relate to that part of the store. This great gag is by raising the order associated with the elevator, which disguises himself as an elevator boy, tricking the shop manager up or down the elevator at the wrong time. It's a great scene, a great set, which, unfortunately, makes the final rule, not very funny. However, at that time, 'Hare Conditioned' marked as one of the great chase films that were full of fierce energy. When Bugs gets more refined in other cartoons during this time, 'Hare Conditioned' shows that he is still more interesting as an anarchist character.
