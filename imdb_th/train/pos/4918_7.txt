When the movie opens, two gangsters kill another gangster. When the body was discovered and was about to be examined, the doctor realized that although the man had been shot dead But he suffered from pneumonia, which is a nasty and more serious epidemic of Bubonic! Therefore, it is a race against time to find those who are dealing with the dead and treat them immediately. Otherwise, the disaster will erupt. <br /> <br /> Unusually, I actually know about pneumonia. As I teach a series of lectures about this subject for my history class This film does not work well in getting the right facts about the disease that seems to be in the movie. The biggest problem is that this illness is unbelievably bizarre in the 1950s. They are not allowed to show. Of course, there is high fever and cough. (They get this right) but still have bleeding and vomiting that can explode of venous blood - along with enormous swollen lymph nodes, like you will get with the Bubonic plague - all and initially! I can certainly understand why they didn't go so far. In addition, I'm sure the government will be more involved in the control and treatment of disease - here in the film is managed at a very local level and everyone seems not ready and dumb. Looks like nobody is willing to believe the doctor !! For the movie show, there are great actors here. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas, respectively, doctors, public health and police chiefs, good performers, but also known in 1950. However, in his first film was a scary Jack Palance. (Still following his original nickname, 'Walter Jack Palance'), including Zero Mostel, the unknown Palance, excellent - very scary and talented in his own body. Mostel plays The weight of his early days - greasy and cowardly evil. <br /> <br /> Overall, though actually not getting the right details and making everything look neat too. And have excellent performances - and worth watching
