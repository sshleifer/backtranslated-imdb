It's not the worst movie that has ever been. The actors are not terrifying and the script and the director are incomplete. <br /> <br /> It's not the best movie ever created. The script and director are not excellent. <br /> <br /> It's in the middle. Fun somewhere Fun and well built somewhere <br /> <br /> No need to say that "Don't be serious" or "Terrible" or "It's not scary". There are no comments. <br /> <br /> Cut the atmosphere. It's a really unique atmosphere and a traditional aspect of the movie. Then is what makes this movie for me
