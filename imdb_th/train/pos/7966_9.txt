As a child, I think this movie is great. It has animals with beautiful music and with my favorite stars: Michael J. Fox. Now I still love this movie for different reasons. It has well-trained animals that have to go through scenes and scenes that look good on the camera. It has beautiful and well-written music that perfectly fits the scene with fast-paced melodies and the heart of the heart that still makes me cry. Even when people groan And it has a favorite actor, Michael J. Fox. <br /> <br /> From this book is the story of three domestic pets, a wise and reliable father's lab, too, using the name Shadow. Witty and ridiculous - but still intelligent - a cat that has a fear of water. The name Sassy and Smart Street are cowardly, curious, and have a slightly nervous bulldog opportunity. The three were taken to a friend's farm when their family left. Causing the pet to break and plan to travel across the Sierra Sierra, frightening and worried for the journey in their lives A truly incredible journey. So maybe the house may be above that mountain But if not, <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend Homeward Bound for those who like three actors who give voice for the leading animal characters and for others ... Yes, everyone goes to see it.
