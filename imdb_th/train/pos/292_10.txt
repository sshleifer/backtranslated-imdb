Okay, first of all, I received this movie as a Christmas present, so it's free! FIRST - This movie is meant to be a three-dimensional 3D. It is mostly But whenever the main character is in her car, the movie will be flattened into 2D! What!!?!?! It's not difficult to shoot in the car !!! Second - the story is not very good. There are many things wrong with it. <br /> <br /> Third - why are they showing all death at the beginning of the movie? It makes the movie suck every time someone is killed !!! Look good laugh, but don't waste time buying. Just download or something cheap
