Interesting images of Japan before opening in the west John Wayne was the first consul in Japan to arrive in Japan following an agreement arising from the bargaining of the Perry gunboat. He was not welcomed. Finally, Wayne won the meeting with the Shogun after the cholera outbreak, which was introduced to America's ships under control. There is a colorful parade to give Shogun presents, including a bottle of Old Tanglefoot. The meeting with Shogun, the debate between the Japanese nobility and the assassination during the archery show presents interesting images about the politics of the era. that Overall, the movie is quite fun and in addition you can see the Duke losing the fight with only half the men.
