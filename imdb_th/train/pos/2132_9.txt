The actors help make this a surprise and an undeniable thing for men and women who have been quarreling over time But this movie looks refreshing, fun and charming. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sal, the other day is good and makes the couple very handsome. The supporting actors stand out - from the favorite Felix Bresett to the villain Joseph Shield Gratts. <br /> <br /> Frank Morgan also plays as one. The most interesting character I have ever seen in his career. He brought the movie to a different mood for a while, when something happened to him, "twisting" is another reason to make this movie higher than others. <br /> <br / > Once again, when the movie has a good mix, the category will always be successful. This is a good example of that. In this movie is a romantic, funny and drama story and very well done. I will use this instead. "You have a letter" every day. No comparison.
