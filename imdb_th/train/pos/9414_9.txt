Although most Americans have little knowledge of his work other than Star Wars But Alex Guinness created remarkable work, especially during the years 1940-1950, from the drama to the quirky comedies. I love his comedies, especially when they do very well and look natural and very realistic on the screen - different from the usual fare from Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This thing is said here. Is a movie Sparked my interest in these movies The plot is so strange and cute that it shouldn't happen anywhere except Ealing Studios - which has a special preference for "little" movies. <br /> <br /> Guinness is a scientist. Little that worked for a textile company. He wanted to experiment to create synthetic fabrics that could not be destroyed even though he didn't work for the company as a researcher. But working for cleaning! So he tends to sneak into the lab. (Eg during the day, if no one suspects or at night) and try his hand He was repeatedly arrested. (Eg after he blew the lab) and gave the shoes until one day he would succeed! Then, despite the importance of discovery, he created a chain of unexpected events and then the fun began. <br /> <br /> This film is a wonderful word that stimulates fun. In the industry, trade unions, governments and the general public
