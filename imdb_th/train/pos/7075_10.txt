Sort of way Film makers and authors have dealt with this time and again in a host of movies and television, including 'Star Trek: First Contact', 'Back to the Future' ending, 'Bill and Ted's Adventure Adventure, Groundhog Day. 'And showing respect SG1' Window of Opportunity 'Heinlein' All You Zombies' was written decades ago and it will also make people read the short stories for the first time. <br /> <br /> In the case of movies Terry Gilliam's fantastic '12 Monkeys' It's hard to create something that might be a problem.

It interferes with these things too. <br /> <br /> If you can change future events that will bring the actions of those who have the power to send people back in time as we see on Board The plane at the end of the movie means that the future can be changed by dealing with past events ... or not?
