The Masters of Horror: Right to Die Starts late one night while Abby (Julia Anderson) and Ciff Addison (Martin Donovan) are driving home. But while talking about a distracted cliff Cliff's airbag worked well and he walked out with a minor injury. Unfortunately, Abby didn't. & She ended up being a toast when she was thrown out of the car and doused with gasoline. Abby's salvation She was taken to the hospital where she was rescued for a life that was seriously injured and disfigured by a fire. Cliff decided that she should die. His selfish lawyer Ira (Corbin Bersen) thought they should let Abby die, suing the car maker and rich, while Abby Pam's mother (Linda Sorenson) wanted to blame Cliff for being rich & Abby notes, however, Abby has other plans of her own ... <br /> <br /> This American production in Canada is directed by Rob Schmidt (who had only one horror movie before. This is Wrong Turn (2003). He doesn't have the qualifications to direct the Masters of Horror episode & is the 9th episode of Season 2 of the TV show Masters of Horror. While I don't think Right to Die is the best Masters of Horror episode I've ever seen me. Thought it was a good effort All the same things and are not close to the terrible things like The Screwfly Solution (2006). The script by John Esposito has a neutral concept that doesn't have anything new But use it effectively enough, even though I say it is not a bit consistent. The first 15 minutes of this story focus on the horror elements of the story. Became a lull for 20 minutes while it became a play while the legal battle with the life of Abby & Cliff. The story was standing in the middle before it returned to track it as a climax. That is filled with blood and twists But they all have a good purpose. The conversation is ok. The story is moving together. Good pace & overall I like Right to Die apart from here for a few minutes & where it lost a little bit of focus. A vague ending. <br /> <br /> Schmidt's director works well. There are some powerful scenes that will try to switch between the scary and low-blooded atmosphere and gore. There is a special special makeup effect, as usual, with Abby's picture that she has all the skin burned, her body & her bandage-shaped head that shows her teeth because she doesn't have The lips are quite beautiful & the makeup effect that reminds me of a similar scene in the Hellraiser (1987) and its sequel). Then there is the main course at the end that Cliff Skin, someone with Of Sata and his knife open peel it off & put muscle into the evening! Very busy. There are also various body parts. There are some nudity here with at least two beautiful girls who are naked ... <br /> <br /> Technically Right to Die is great. The special effects are excellent. While Masters of Horror when it was No It looks like a cheap, self-made TV program that is generally, if truthfully told. Performances are good, but there is no 'big name' in this story. <br /> <br /> Right to Die is another fun and funny episode of Masters of Horror that most horror fans should check. That it's not just a great story Interesting scenes! Worth watching ... for those who have stomachs
