Let Braik perform well. Finally, he and Zorak live outside the Spac Ghost Coast To Coast. I must say I love both of these programs a lot. They are the perfect thing to start swimming for adults. Brak makes it even bigger with an album released in 2000. It may not be platinum. But his performances are very popular with many people. I must say that from all adult swimming programs that do not have a plot, this must be a list that doesn't have any plot ever made. That's why I like it so much. It's just a classic in adult swimming history. I believe this is just a great show if you don't like it. Hey, there are many people who hate and tons who love it.
