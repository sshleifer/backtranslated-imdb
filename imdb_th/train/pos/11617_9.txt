The evidence is easy. This movie begins, looks like your average weak chick flick about two attractive young people meet at the airport. Then things turn 180 degrees ... <br /> <br / > I don't like one kind of Nonsense, mind, trance, love story that causes the average movie theater pollution And it is my humble opinion that Wes Craven, based on his previous horror meta-movie (Sceam), did as well ... <br /> <br /> follow this logic It is not surprising to find that Craven created a disgusting 'sweet love story' just to have a terrifying Cillian Murphy wreck until all the Dream World coated sugar ... <br /> <br /> The boundaries of his character, Jackson Ripner (Jack the Ripper), is it?) In the film This impressive, he changed from being fully charismatic to a scoundrous sickle, which is an advantage in my book. While he sought out his victims (Jennifer Garner, Assertive Rachel McAdams, which I find very annoying) You can't help but be sympathetic to men ... <br /> <br /> This is Wes Craven embodied in Jackson Ripner through Cillian Murphy beat all the silly chicks ... <br /> <br /> Mr. Craven I greet you <br /> <br /> The best quote: <br /> <br /> Jackson Ripper (After hitting the water out of Rachel McAdams in the airplane bathroom): "Thank you for the quickie !!!"
