This film and Barry Mckenzie's sequels are considered to be their own, the two greatest comedians ever produced. A wonderful story of an Aussie boy. The doctor travels to England to receive his heritage and meet his friends who are cute and innocent like him. <br /> <br /> It's a building full of words. Where else will you find someone who wants a bad drink until he dries like a dead dingo? Great characters, great performances, and it is a great drama and foster consumption that is so much more. Three other movies, top marks, <br /> <br /> and the most fun songs. That you have heard and filled with great celebrities Of course, my two favorite movies forever. I watched them at least once in a week.
