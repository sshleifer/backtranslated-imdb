In terms of extraordinary words, <br /> <br /> This film is one of my favorites as a child and I just remembered it recently and thought of looking at it. While many details are not clear in my mind anymore, the overall feeling that this movie made me stuck with me over the years. <br /> <br /> If parents feel that their children Can handle adults So I recommend this movie. It taught me a lot about life and death and gave me a lot of emotions. To this day, it is still one of my favorite movies.
