This film is better than most refugee versions of the world war. Tripod looks cool But walking and death should be better The action scenes are really great. Walking ... walking ... walking ... walking !!! Oh my God, stop walking, please, or I'll kill myself. The thunder boy scene is the order I like most, because the ship hits the tripod. Good movie. I recommend people who read books. The song is great and the director looks cool. <br /> <br /> 99% good soundtrack advantages for interesting violence books. Some people perform wonderful duties, looking at London.
