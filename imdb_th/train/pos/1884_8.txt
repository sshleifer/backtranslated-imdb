This is one of my favorite comedies. Do not want to condone the hero's unimaginable lifestyle But take it for something that is worth it and not a little alcoholism. Movies are very fun It tells an unlikely story of a drunken man who never runs out. 40 Single man named Arthur, who is determined to receive an enormous legacy. But if he is married, Susan is chosen because the family thinks that she might create something for him. Arthur offers, but then falls in love with Linda, the jailer and merciless robber. <br /> <br / > Dudley Moore is the perfect person when Arthur, who is drunk, is the most beloved in the world. Accepted, Moore IS Arthur and I agree with those who cannot imagine other actors in the role. The woman of that piece was a good picture. Liza Minnelli sparkled while Linda and her on screen chemistry and Moore were great. Jill Clayberg plays Susan, a wealthy and more suitable woman who has been chosen by Arthur. <br /> <br /> However, this movie was created by Sir John Gielgud, which represents Arthur's ambitions. Hobson, but a faithful butler It is clear that both have a good love during Hobson's long hiring. Hobson is Arthur's best friend and is an undesirable explanation and advice. The most interesting relationship in this film is not Arthur's love. But it is his extraordinary relationship with this flair and of course he disagrees with his servants forever Is the butler that you will remember best long after the credit rolled off
