In terms of visual beauty, this film is outstanding! I don't know that Technicolor came out so soon. Even though I don't like the ending But this film is great and makes me want me to live in North Africa Best actor and Marlene Dietrich is a great advantage, and of course she is very charming and I love her in this movie. I couldn't get through the scenery and scenes ... The desert palm tree hotel was there ... The troops brought the "Beau Geste" feeling to the movie. They don't make movies like this again. Don't miss this classic!
