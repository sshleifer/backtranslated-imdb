Rain or shine outside, you enter the cinema. It makes you happy (If not coming out immediately) The power goes off. You settle down with the ice cream bar. The animation starts to vibrate on the screen. You feel satisfied In the dark, you will return to the beginning of the time of sitting around the fire ... looking at the flames of the new flickers 24 times per second and sharing the joy of discovering unknown things and twisting the situation. The rest of your race / audience who are not happy with themselves should not write comments. (Long romantic comedies ...)
