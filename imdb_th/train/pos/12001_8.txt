I don't know what other people watch movies. But they have to see "Joseph Smith: The Prophet of Restoration" that is different from what I saw. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is both. Well done and inspiring I think it's worth watching. It was clear from the beginning that there was a lot of caution in creating this film. The background is a beautiful scene. <br /> <br /> I think this film serves well to convey Joseph Smith as a man and as a prophet. Joseph's spiritual experience shows his taste and respect. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend watching this movie.
