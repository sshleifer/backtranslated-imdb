Full House came to me when I was about 9 years old. I remember seeing America's most fun home video with Bob Saget again, and one day my mother told me that he also performed Full House. One day I was lucky. Good enough to see when visiting the family. It doesn't look too interesting at first. But when I watch more and more at night, at 9:00 am, I'll join <br /> <br /> This list makes you really want to be there. Hang out with them and may join their small family. "Cry along." <br /> <br /> The thing I like the most about Full House is a great show for Children and adults of all ages There will be some parts that are more than for adults, then the parts that are for children, so that everyone in the family can enjoy it. No matter how wonderful it is, it is still a great show and I will definitely recommend it to everyone. <br /> <br /> 10/10
