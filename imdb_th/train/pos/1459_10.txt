Wow! Wow! Wow! I have never seen a documentary about globalization that was not preached until I saw MARDI GRAS: MADE IN CHINA. This film has a narrative center and includes certain images with delicate interviews with four teen workers in China. Living in the factory area They play with toys, jump rope and dance. But most of their days and nights consist of work, work and work - but their work image is bright and pleasant. The owner of the factory in China opened surprisingly so much that he found the effects of globalization as he "punished" the workers. The film shows that local people connect with the world through humor and interesting and interesting images. Interested in both cultures One of the most interesting parts of this film is the cross-cultural introduction of factory workers and Mardi Gras enthusiasts through pictures here. The movie comes full circle and shows that the image can be a point of communication and change This film never preached, was not wrongly driven, and made everyone see it at the end. We - the audience - made our own conclusions about the complexity of movies and globalization.
