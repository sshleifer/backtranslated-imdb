Alive <br /> <br /> Alive is a very fun SCI-FI movie from Japan. I noticed from the movie that caused many disappointments that loved Versus, the first film of the director or Azumi, his third story. I heard that they are blood movies with swords and zombies and all kinds of all kinds. Frankly, I went to the video store to get Versus, but I'm fine with Alive. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a starting point to end the Wall-Wall movement, Alive isn't your choice. There are many actions. But it was a one hour payment of the character collection Personally, I think it's good and worthwhile. Of course, some scenes are stupid like many SCI-Fi action movies and I think the subtitles that use foreign words may replace parasites. For better results This film is cruel when it is not necessary to have the heart, so it is not necessary. <br /> <br /> They keep the budget, most of which will limit all actions in an underground building. (Received a queue from the cube) But this film was not affected any more. Another bonus for this film is the intense Gothic imagination made with excellent artistic flair during many events and scenes in Dream <br /> <br /> Rent this!
