For a long time, Red Sox fans, I just have to go to see the movie. It's great! Although there is no live image from the season, the Red Sox wonders as much. But there is a great shot of my favorite Red Sox player While this film is a movie about flick chick But there are enough baseball videos from the return of the Red Sox 2004, amazing to be one of my top 10 movies of all time I like Red Sox fans, especially those that are part of Ben's baseball family. The scene that Ben met with his friends on the day of the sketch to decide who would get some hilarious seats in that game! Must see if you are looking for a movie that looks good to watch with dating, important dates, or more ... especially if you are a baseball fan ... and even more, especially if you are a Red Nook !!!
