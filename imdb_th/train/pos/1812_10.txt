This is one of the greatest movies ever, perhaps the greatest movie ever. I forgot about this for about 12 years until I saw an increase in TV for ADGTH and it brought back my favorite memories. Watch it when I was a kid. And when I watched it a few nights ago, I became a movie addict. Normally I do not like lively family movies. But this one is special. It is a perfect family movie. <br /> <br /> The ending of this movie often touches my heart and makes me very sorry. Better than all the garbage that came out for children's movies today. I mean, this movie is ranked G and is about 2 dogs related to gambling, smoking, drinking, murder, death and hell are a lot of movies. Which I believe makes movies from very good I mean, today's movies don't bring reality to children and in this movie they do <br /> <br /> RIP Judith Barsi & Dom DeLuise
