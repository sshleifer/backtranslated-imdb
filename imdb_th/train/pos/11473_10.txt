Zero Day is a movie that few people have seen and is a shame. <br /> <br /> When I saw the end of the two main characters coming down to the room and killing people mercilessly. And it made me catch my stomach I'm shaking. That is the strength of this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is amazing. It's too incredible to not get the perfect ten. It is sad that there are few people who understand the true beauty of this movie. Not a budget that makes good movies. But it is the feeling of the creator that makes it good. <br /> <br /> It makes you permanently impressed that you can't go out. It makes you realize the true horror of filming - especially if you know that person and this movie makes you feel like you know these people. <br /> <br /> I would like to introduce the old Zero Hour. Those who feel that they are mature enough to watch me are fourteen and I feel that this movie is too amazing to say. Feel like you are watching something that actually happened.
