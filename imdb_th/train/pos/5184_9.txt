Comedy movies that show honesty about a bunch of adults (Bill Paxton, Julie Warner, Kevin Pollak, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Matt Spven, Matt Craven and Diane Lane). Invited to return to Tomawka camp in ( Ontario, Canada, by former Consul (Alan Arkin) Mike Binder, writer / producer, experiences at the same camp as the main source of gentle yarn creation and proper understanding In addition, the movie has many funny moments, some of which are strange as I like Newton Thomas Sigel ("The Usual Suspects", "Three Kings"), presenting movies with impressive images of Canadian forests. Among the actors Sam Raimi, the director of "THE EVIL DEAD" and "The Gift" appeared here as Arkin's right hand. Another movie made me confident that the camp was not necessarily the location of the murder. gory
