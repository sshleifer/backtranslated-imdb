This will get comments all over the map because it doesn't fit in horror - but it's not the most fun splash. It is an equal part of the suspense and horror - but without the screams of Hollywood and the camera jerking. <br /> <br /> The feeling of this movie is free and not attached to special effects because of me. Think you should listen and see the character's face. <br /> <br /> Forget that Brendan is Graduated from Buffy Universe That is the red herring He performed here. 'Camp' is a misunderstanding of this story. Adrian Barbau is performing music so hard - so she must believe that the script has something to say. We all know the excuse, sorry that the actors do not care anymore and are waiting for the director to snap "cut" and receive their salary. This is not the case here. <br /> <br /> Forgive the fact that the body begins to fail with a mess that is almost funny. I do not think that the intent is amusing - but to maintain balance for you <br /> <br /> Think about the horror movie 'little' and 'play' the horror on the stage - which makes the house opaque. Then you may see it as a matter of paranoia, fear and madness that arose in one place that separates the United States. <br /> <br /> And it's a twist. Time travel, mind control, secret experiments and Nazis that may not die .. Yes. <br /> <br /> I say rent it and see if you're in the mood to have something in the brain. This will be a good choice for sitting midnight on Saturday.
