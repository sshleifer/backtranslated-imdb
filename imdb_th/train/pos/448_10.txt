I think this movie is absolutely beautiful. And I don't mean only the breathtaking scenery It's about two unhappy British housewives who decided to rent an Italian castle to take a break from unhappy home life. In the end, four women, including the rental of places, all have different personalities and different reasons for staying there. In an amazingly beautiful place, they all find the peace they desire and interesting that the peace comes from reflection and internal solutions. I find it wonderful because the relationship developed from compassion and understanding. The performances are happy to see on their own. I love the characters of Lottie (Josie Lawrence) and Lady Caroline (Polly Walker).
