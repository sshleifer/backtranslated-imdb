It surpasses my understanding that rubbish from Norway has been remastered for DVD release and is still a jewel like this, not getting shot to snap their former glory. I give this to 7, not because it's very good. But because it is one of the few sciFi movies created for Norwegian television This film is nothing less than a gem in movie history that, in many ways, the first foreign movie perspective. And my words Blindpassasjer Be the first! Ridley Scott or anyone on the team sees the mini-series? However, it is unlikely that the truth remains that the scenes are very similar. Ok, the lower budget is _much_ in Norwegian movies. But since it was a great work since the deserted era of Norwegian film making which happened to last until the 90s
