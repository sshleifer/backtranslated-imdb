Absolutely excellent drama and Ros is the best ... I would like to recommend this movie. In my opinion, her performance is the content of the Oscars! The only sad truth here is that Universal does not see that this movie is available in any video format, whether it is tape or DVD. They don't care about movies that are very good. But Universal is not interested in the library on DVD which is sad If you have the opportunity to see this somewhere (Not sure why it's not running on the cable). Try it! I won't go into this story because I think most people would rather have comments about movies and a lot of "investigators" spend time writing about stories that are everywhere. <br /> <br />!
