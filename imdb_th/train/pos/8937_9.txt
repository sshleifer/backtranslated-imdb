This is a good example of how to make interesting movies without using big stars and large effects. Tell us the true story of the struggle of two African-American women during the busy century. <br /> <br /> This movie challenges us all to see our own personal prejudices and see who People are people, not black and white people. <br /> <br /> Good movies with good messages.
