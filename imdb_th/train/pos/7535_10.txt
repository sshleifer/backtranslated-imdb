The 700 Club provides a great view of world events. Some people describe it as impolite or wonderful. I searched for an informational and inspiring program. It is common for many people to throw mud on programs that prove successful. There are very few items that can point to 40 years of success history in the world of television and The 700 Club is one of them. While Mr. Robertson might be wrong to say that some people should be assassinated, I find that people are curious to see that many people will travel across themselves to jump on the band I certainly spoke nonsense in my life. Of course, I am happy to forgive Mr. Robertson because he expressed his greatness.
