Terry Gilliam travels to the future again. (He has already done in "Brazil") to tell this story about the virus that destroyed the human race. <br /> <br /> The script is crazy. But it is quite fun and Gilliam proves that he has imagination (The future scene is great) for the beautiful actress Bruce Willis and Madeleine Stowe. (No matter what happens to you ??) is ok, but Brad Pitt is very annoying whenever he plays a role that is not in all his hands. Good looks <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
