No, this should not be a high budget definition. But it is great in their own right You have to see that it is a low-budget masterpiece that involves a rapist, a zombie that uses 12-inch love weapons that he uses to walk Those who come to this movie with a few reviews may look for the next classic cult or "hidden gem" because they say and don't go there. I like that everyone points out clear observations, such as "5 percent of children attached to fish poles" Hahaha. I don't think movies that have this kind of budget will make actors or "good" effects, so they work with what they have. Courage and internal organs are actually very reliable. This film has changed a bit from sequence to sequence. But overall, this is one of the better movies I've seen recently that doesn't follow trends or forecasts. Very good for laughing
