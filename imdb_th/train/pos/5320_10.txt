I started watching this movie without expecting anything. But another movie that needs to be watched But the first twenty minutes ago, the art and the main character, which was a mystery, didn't say much. I like this movie so much. It's quite slow But the infusion is complete The governance is great, letting us know the stories that lead to Joey's confidence and his life behind bars. The song is great and combined with the scene very well. The ending is an unexpected story when I don't see how to come. It's not the type of movie that we see often.
