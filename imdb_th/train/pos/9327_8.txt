I'm writing this after just seeing the perfect son at the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras gay film festival in Sydney, Australia. <br /> <br /> When their father died, two brothers Met at the funeral From the brothers who are dying from AIDS, they travel to reconcile The two leading actors performed a great role in creating a gradual warmth and respect that was created between them. When the movie went, I had one qualm about the movie, though - while the dying brother Acting sick, he does not see people with cells 0 T4 will not look good - even if it is a make-up job for the actors to look bad. Small handle But the ones that make it slightly less realistic Although there is a small handle, but The Perfect Son is a great movie and you should have the opportunity to see it. I hope to launch a DVD in the near future!
