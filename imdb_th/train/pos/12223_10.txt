I saw the real crime when it was first released in the mid-nineties and I watched it many times since It's a great mystery about Mary. (Played by Alicia Silverstone), a high school in California where her classmate's sister was tortured and murdered by an unknown killer. Mary met Tony (played by Kevin Dillon), a student. Hundreds of policemen who saw how bright she was and they decided to work together to find the murderer. <br /> <br /> Many suspects in this True Crime feel "real" or true for me. I read reviews of newsgroups that people wrote that suppressing unbelief is here and it's true. Alicia Silverstone is perfect in this chapter, and Kevin Dillon and Bill Nunn work as well as other actors. The location is on and the writer / director Pat Verducci captures the reality of teenage life and the loneliness of Mary. (See the scene in which Mary woke up from a sequence of dreams after watching Tony's photos). I hope Verducci will make more movies. <br /> <br /> I have never seen other movies before. True Crime 10/10
