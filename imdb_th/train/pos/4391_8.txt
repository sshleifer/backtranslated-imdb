You are waiting to see if the remake is better or worse. I rated the Audi Murphy movie as 3 (I'm more strict), which is the second-lowest number I've ever given to Audi. (The worst thing is I rate this movie as "8" (and I am more strict). It is a story of a civil war, a "military" betrayal. If you want to call them to the North, people like Quantrell and those who ride with Outlaws <br /> <br /> The original character is a version that is full of water, very clean wounds while still describing the horror of these things. In fact, movies such as older versions are best viewed by mature audiences who can distinguish it. I would be smarter than scoring the original "R" and this movie with a natural GP because the new movie gives a very honest version, a message that is easier to decode than older generations.> <br /> Filmmakers from the age of sixty. Initially spoke of "realism" but only a handful of people delivered They just give boring scenery, boring costumes and boring activities. But with the cardboard character of the comic book, the weakness of the spaghetti era Apparently in the style that is superior to the west that we often see today. This movie is an example. It provides realistic settings. But it gives us the character that we believe is in that era. <br /> <br /> There are a few lullabies that make the ride completely difficult. But the situation that cannot be explained is ok, as long as the whole movie ends and the character is interesting enough. <br /> <br /> It started to be a little more lively. The main character is what we can identify and at least have compassion. The Audi Murphy character of the first film is not too sympathetic and self-righteous without inspiration. <br /> <br /> The characters in this film follow the true anti-hero line. His motives and methods are madness. We never really felt that he was "right", but we can understand where he came from. <br /> <br /> There are many actions in the movie. There is also humor. One good scene was when the heroine told the hero that she would not lie to him and he thought about it. <br /> <br /> This film has been successful in doing what filmmakers have tried for decades. This director and writer understand correctly. <br /> <br /> Complete advice.
