The family (mother - Patricia Clarkson, father - Jake Weber, son - Eric, Sullivan) went out for the family to gather in a remote house in the middle of winter. They accidentally hit the deer while driving there. This anger causes some villagers - especially Otis (John Speredakos) and things to be slow (very slow). <br /> <br /> I expect the worst when I start to watch things. this A lot of comments for this thing on this site are bad things ... I disagree. First of all, it's not a horror movie. Horror doesn't start until 30 minutes. It plays like a family drama with horror elements thrown at that level. It's quite good. <br /> <br /> First of all - bad things: step Too soon, Jake Weber is an awesome actor. How to fear dreams, too many mistakes; The numbers of wendigo rarely appear in the movie and the clear view we get from the wendigo at the end is a laughing story. <br /> <br /> Good things: cute plays; Clarkson is great like a mother. Great direction with creepy sound effects that are a little scary. A clear hot sex sequence between Clarkson and Weber (which is necessary for the integrity of the plot!); A good performance by Sullivan (only 10 people!) And Speredakos and an unexpected tragic ending. <br /> <br /> I think many people would bother with this movie because it was pushed into horror. Morale - which is not so if you can ignore it, I think you should like me for 7
