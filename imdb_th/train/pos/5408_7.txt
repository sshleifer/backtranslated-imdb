From these pokemon movies (In the best order, least for me): Pokemon The First Movie, Pokemon 4Ever, Pokemon Heroes, Pokemon 200 and Pokemon: Entei and the Unknown, this may be the most about the environment The most beautiful and the most quiet Whether it's a good score for you or not, "Pokemon 4Ever" still provides a lot of entertainment. <br /> <br /> As with the three issues mentioned above, this Pokemon movie has good humor and CGI. Good (like anime) The travel time of this movie is a good representation and the Team Rocket (comic relief / junk baddies) ends with good jokes and ends with a character. More than the main sidekicks <br /> <br /> The shortcomings are, as always, violence and unnecessary actions, and the Baddie is less interesting than a few Pokémon movies. <br /> <br /> Weird Pokémon are being hunted by Pokémon hunters in the forest. The little boy tries to help the Pokémon and takes him somewhere ... <br /> <br /> At the same time, Ash, Brock and Misty are entering the big forest ... <br /> <br /> Want to Want to know? See the rest ... <br /> <br /> Good for Pokemon fans and anime fans. "American" Enjoy "Pokemon 4Ever"! :-)
