Overall, I agree with all of Ebert's reviews in a sense. I feel that I should not comment because it is a movie of a veterinarian and I am not a veterinarian. The defect is that Martha is underdeveloped and does not act regularly. I guess Stephen Metcalfe is a veterinarian and takes too little time to plan her character.
