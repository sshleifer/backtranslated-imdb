Everyone who has never seen anything like the battle scenes in The Matrix has never seen this movie at all. The fighting scene was designed by psychopathic actor Yuen Woo Ping, who fought in The Matrix as well, and the fight scene was something else. <br /> <br /> Li plays the superceller who doesn't feel hurt I now live as a peaceful librarian. (You understand me) When other evil Super Souls start killing drug lords in the area for drug trafficking, Li collaborates with police friends to help stop them. <br /> <br /> There's something crazy. The fanatic takes place in this movie. Badguy pulls out his arm with a glass door and is barely noticeable. The fight scene is filled with kicks and punches. The number of bodies is there. Li is not better, and he surrounds himself with many beautiful women (Yip kicks a serious ass as a better friend). Anthony Wong also made a cameo as a drug mogul. (No strange story. He made a cameo in all Hong Kong movies.) Unfortunately, they didn't do this action movie in the United States. I do not have to sit and watch these horrible events to see the actions that I would like to recommend.
