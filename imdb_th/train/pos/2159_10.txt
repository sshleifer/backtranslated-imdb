First, there is no way to remake well because Japanese society is quite different from us and plays an important role in this film as explained in the opening lecture It adds humor and the warmth of this movie. There are different characters / supporting characters. Each person is involved in making this movie great. This movie is full of humor that is not as rude as today. "The gross comedian" but still makes you laugh out loud Shows that natural goodness in people can overcome a small difference Not to mention it is a great plot and a lot of humor. This is a story about a dance that has a real story and a good story. There are some stories that are not out of place, but actually support the main story. The movie is really well written. Dance is also great. I am a fan of every movie that has all kinds of dance. However, this film is in addition to dancing in the fact that it is the first story and just happened to write about dancing in Japanese society. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
