The spectacular Techicolor production tells the strange story of love between a woman with strong religious beliefs and a Trappist monk who leaves his temple to destroy his oath. This film was launched in a convent in Europe, where former students chanted the lonely beauty in a black dress called Domini (Marlene Dietrich). She received instructions from the superiors to go to the desert and "Find yourself" and make her regret about her father who just died In the train on the way to the Sahara, she sat across from a very troubled man (Charles Boyer) - our past monk. She soon arrived at the hotel near the oasis in the palm of which she saw our mysterious man Again, as he was stunned by what he had to do when confronted with a very attractive dancing woman, Domini became friends with him, even though he knew nothing about his past - love soon. The /> <br /> will follow the film with <br sentimental melodies and different. Found that it was quite fun and enjoyable Photography in this story is really interesting - it is full of close-up photography and beautiful color images of horse caravans across the desert, silhouette compared to the sunset sky. Marlene Dietrich did very well, although it was limited to performance here and looked gorgeous. Usually Charles Boyer is not one of my favorites, which is actually quite good. In this regard, I think the part that fits him and he looks young and handsome, too. Alright here except to do very little Another excellent orchestral score by Max Steiner helped make this drama a very fun movie.
