I expect this film to be appropriate and boring. But I'm completely wrong! Charlie Cox (I never heard him until now) played an incredibly good leader. He is a serious and romantic person, both me and my friend who has seen this movie with me completely falling in love with him. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes I didn't like before. (Love you in Romeo and Juliet) I enjoy you more. Her performance is excellent. I can't tell if you are an American. The chemistry between her and Charlie Cox is great. The casting is perfect. <br /> <br /> Robert DeNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer are equally well-selected. DeNiro is a gay pirate. have I laughed so hard in one scene that Septimus came on board ... Oh my God. Wow. Phifers play as a good villain. I like you as a sniper mother in a spray. But she has a sensational story and appropriate comments throughout the story. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's funny. (But not so hard!), Romantic, special techniques do not occur very often But when they are great, the pendant from Ricky Gervais and Peter O'Toole is in a good position as well. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone who likes fantasy movies like Princess Bride. Or even the Lord of the Rings It keeps me interested all the time and I will buy a DVD when it comes out!
