Foley's noir quality in films projected in this saturated and intense pulp seems to fit together. Filmed by a modified shot by editing this film, spread out around the disturbed boxer, discover his own purpose (or lack thereof). Other comments around may indicate a lack of interest in the pulp But personally, I think this is an excellent movie!
