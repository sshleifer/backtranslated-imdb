When I learned about the death of Sir Alec Guinness, this is the first time in many of his films that I think will be seen again. It is a very funny explanation that this movie gave even after many years. And Guinness helps to charm every frame His eyes and face shone as white as he wore. Both he and the movie must be considered a lifelong favorite.
