Sardo Numspa is a demon. The product of the time or not, which I mean, the popularity of Eddie Murphy and The Golden Child are only the audience in the late 1980s, right? For I can clearly remember that this movie entertained villagers in the last decade. It passed the box office at $ 79,817,937, making it the 8th largest earner of 1986, but because the 80s faded away from memory. The acclaimed joke that they used to have The Golden Child does not depend on the more accepted 80s Murphy image, such as Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop. But when watching this movie recently This time, I found that it has Murphy in witty carvings.> <br /> Join in the action-fantasy formula that has been revived and controlled by the Raiders Of The Lost Ark in 1981. The Golden Child gets all the popular buttons Pretty brave and brave little girl with a quote in his weapon, the villain, the villain {Charles Dance, so English. I can kiss him myself}. Great colors and cute children with mysterious powers. You participate in fun Not dissecting and provoking the value of it as a fantasy skull. Yes, the CGI demon looks unbelievable at the moment, and yes, the image has a better image than in the 80s or 90s. The infamous score 5 here on this website Seriously serious 7/10
