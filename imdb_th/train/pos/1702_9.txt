If you have trouble dreaming, you may rate this movie low. But you just have to realize that this movie doesn't make everyone satisfied. <br /> <br /> Just someone who has humor. <br /> <br /> For those people It plays in science fiction movies and long lost radio programs. Most witches who score themselves along the lines of Spaceballs and Airplane 2. You may have to stretch your imagination a little to get fun. But it's worth it
