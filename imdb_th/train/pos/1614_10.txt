There is nothing that doesn't like about Moonstruck. I come from an Italian family in New York and I always miss homes when I watch. Actors and actors, plot, sub stories, humor .. They are all excellent. It started a bit slow. But there are many things that happened in those two days! I fell in love with LaBoheme because of this movie. In my favorite movie program, Moonstruck is the number 3 movie. It is a "feel good" movie that you leave the theater, humming "cute" or repeating your favorite line: "Old man if you give those dogs another My Food, I will kick you until you die. ";" Chrissy brought me a big knife "," Who died "," You love him Loretta ..... Well, when you do, they will make you crazy because They know that they can do it. "I always put the Moonstruck when there's nothing to look good because it makes me happy.
