"Red Rock West" is one of the best and most thrilling films of the 1990s with great screenplay. (By John and Rick Dahl) that makes you predictable throughout and on your seat for most movies It was best directed by John Dahl and starring great actors including Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and especially JT Walsh (in a memorable performance) making this film a thrilling movie. Morale This film has never been published much. (In fact, I was the first person to watch TV.) Therefore, it is one of the special little gems that you must find. But the unique movie now gets the following cult. Slowly> <br /> Nicolas Cage is Michael Williams who breaks and breaks when he finds himself in the small town of Red Rock mistaken for a killer. The contract, named Lyle from Dallas, was shocked to receive $ 10,000 to kill the wife of the owner of Bowen Wayne Brown (JT T. Walsh, an excellent). He played along with the plan and decided that He should go and warn Brown's wife. Uzan (Lara Flynn Boyle) But then the plan became thicker and there was a lot of surprises and surprises - and two contact - and found himself stuck in a bad situation. He couldn't drag himself. Can go out! Then will make matters more difficult. The real Lyle turns to killing the contract. (Performed by everyone's favorite heavy Dennis Hop) When Hopper discovers what happened, he follows Chase. But no one can see the surprising events that follow. <br /> <br /> Favorite songs from this movie: <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage (to Lara Flynn Boyle) : "I hate to see innocent women injured. But it's a great amount of money. "<br /> <br /> JT. Walsh (to Cage):" Michael Williams, Michael. You have to spend time with us until we Will reach the lowest point of this story. "<br /> <br /> Boyle (with Cage):" Are you not a killer? "Cage:" Right, not the one I should ride into. The city so you have to leave here. <br /> <br /> Boyle (to Cage): "OK, how are you? Will explain the disguise as a hired killer and receive $ 10,000 from my husband? "<br /> <br /> A special little thriller (only 98 minutes) with a story that never gave up. All movies with J. T. Walsh are O.K in my book and "Red Rock West" is one of his best. So sad that this great actor's career was tragically troubled by a heart attack in 1998. The most prolific time for "Film Noir" was without a doubt the age for the fourth. Ten, but "Red Rock West" is a modern example. Has jumped into the "Top Ten" list of the most popular movies of all time I hope this will be more from director John Dahl 10/10 Clive Roberts. <br /> <br />
