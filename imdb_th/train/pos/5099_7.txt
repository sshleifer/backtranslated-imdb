The only reason I found this movie is that it is on the LITTLE MISS MARKER DVD and I recommend watching it even if you don't like it and it's a well known movie. <br /> <br /> We have Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard as a male prisoner and his companions This film started to show off quite lightly. But it was more dramatic when Coop planned to use his daughter to extort money from his sister-in-law. But when meeting a young woman and seeing discipline, she must be with his brother. In law, choose to make her However, he has problems with being on a straight and narrow path, so the drama is developed. <br /> <br /> Cooper and Lombard are good and Shirley can still steal the scene that she entered. Only one song However, this is entertainment and worth watching along with LITTLE MISS MARKER.
