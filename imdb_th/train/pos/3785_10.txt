This movie is very underrated. It is creative, creative and intelligent. It was just fun and in my opinion, this movie was ranked one. But this film was forgotten when it first screened and looked more and more over the years. "Bill & Ted's fraudulent journey" also exploded at the box office, while the first movie was a popular and very popular song. <br /> <br /> I think the problem might be That the film had just been released a few years later in 1991. Bill and Ted seem to be "80 years old". Although the 80s were only a few years ago, the landscape of music and style for children changed. Go Such as rap rascal, hip hop, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, grunge and sound. Seattle Bill and Ted with Ozzy Osbourne songs, Van Halen and Guns N 'Roses along with their 80s style seem to be out of place. Which is very old and outdated in '91 and I think that's one reason why the film exploded at the box office. Nobody but the surfers said "great!" And "fake!" Fri 1991 "Gremlins 2" which came out in the early 1990s As well as being a good movie that exploded at the box office because it was too much involved in the 80s. The transition from '80s to' 90s was a much faster change now with '90s and' 00s 1991 Nothing like 1988 or 1989 at the moment. 2002 and last year 2001 still looks like / looks like 1995 or 1996 <br /> <br /> If only "great adventure" happened in the year 1988 was released that year. Instead of 1989 and "fraudulent travel" was quickly created and launched in 1989. Then, it might have been as intense as it had been for the first time.
