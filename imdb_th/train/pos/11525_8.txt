This film is excellent for three reasons. It's very beautiful. I love that. There are bold color themes throughout the movie, along with special costumes and gorgeous outfits. Photography that looks very expensive I often enjoy those stories about a group of fitness / lonely people who come together and become a family. Sometimes they fall into ancient thinking. But this person can't This group of actors shows the true flaws. But the character that is very fond of Alan Larkin is the best person. (Between him and van and the movie theme Road, I can't help. But remembering Little Miss Sunshine's favorite film last year) Very funny There is a mix of humor and emotions throughout the movie. I really like the ending, and of course it's about the magician theme. A good magician is making the audience look at him as he wants them to create an illusion. Which happened to what the film director did and that is why they called it movie magic
