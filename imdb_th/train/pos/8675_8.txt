Without being one of my favorites, this is a good thing for a change of pace ... even if only a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Everything starts with a big fight between Tom, Jerry and Spike (who was renamed "Butch" here), they all dance each other But suddenly Spike made a brave and admirable decision. He stopped the fight and suggested that they should be friends. So they all signed a peace treaty and became friends ... which would not last long. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the three had love, patience and kindness to each other. They also help each other when one of them is in danger of life. Relationships are nothing but wonderful, until a big big steak appears and they are greedy. The trio are guilty of returning to fight and compete as usual. <br /> <br /> Yet ... seeing Tom, Jerry and Spike as friends is a delightful experience. Thank you. <br /> <br /> Oh, actually. There are two songs from "The Wizard of Oz" played here. In the instrumental version: "We went out to see the wizard" and "Somewhere over the rainbow.
