The film begins with a hilarious about 15 seconds and continues in the movie. I can't remember which scene I didn't look at who laughed at me. He is the perfect actor for this film because of the way he looks and the way he is dressed. <br /> <br /> The funny part is great to see from the actors. As you can see, this movie is ranked 7.9 on IMDb. I think it should be in 250. Help it be like this. I haven't seen the comedy of this film since American Pie or the original holiday. See if you want to laugh, I lifted my thumb to 2 of this story as much as I have ever received since I discovered about IMDb.
