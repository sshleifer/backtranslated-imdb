TCM keeps me awake all the time ... They come up with a movie that I have never heard before ... Senso .... Now Ossessione ... Visconti's first movie !! ... Wow .. The Postman Italian version, double ring ... cool !! Performed and supervised beautifully ... never heard the leader, both the great class, the price, the Lamai, while Giovanni and especially Massimo Chioti, while Gino ... muscle and More attractive than anyone on the screen in 1943 !!! His previous look ... Many male stars in the 1950s may be inspired by him ... He should be a world-class star !! This film is better than Jack Nicholson / Jessica Lange and glossier than the MGM version (which I like a lot) with John Garfield and Lana Turner. Remember the white dress? Who will forget .... This version of the Italian version is different .. It has realism and has a very different end ... Watch it look ... I'll buy it !!
