Oh man, why "Six Degrees" is a show about the theory that we all associate with someone. If focusing on the lives of a group of people and the consequences of their actions, <br /> <br /> When I first heard this story, it didn't attract my attention. It seems too plain. From then on, I saw various episodes ... and liked it a lot! First of all, the character They are all well written and different from each other. There are people addicted to alcohol. She is a woman who betrothed her to a woman who has just lost her husband, a driver with a brother who has a problem, and so on ... unlike what we are familiar with. In casualties, such as in our good daily routine! My favorite person is mom, Carlos and Whitney. <br /> <br /> Then the actor They are great. Jay Hernandez from "Hostel" shows his ability to perform in 3D characters more than his previous works as Paxton, another great performance as well, especially Campbell. Scott Player Steven and Bridget Moynahan, Whitney Players <br /> <br /> When I came to IMDb after watching the episodes, I couldn't believe it was seriously canceled. I couldn't understand the low ratings. <br /> <br /> It's terrible that it doesn't have much. One season It will be a good show to follow!
