It seems that it should be a biography of Claude Monet, but actually it is a story that focuses on the relationship between three teenage girls on the French synchronized swimming team. There is no parent or teacher to talk about. There are no schools and boys shown by Francois hunky peripheral cycle that enters the occasional and confusing story. <br /> <br /> Pauline Aquart is the youngest. All three want to join the team that she admires very much. She looks strange. She has not yet erupted in the growth of teenagers and has long arms, legs, bones, feet and does not have to mention. She is stubborn and plays these plump sports following her lips. After her appearance grew up with you and from a certain point of view she was able to appear remarkably. <br /> <br /> Adele Haenel is older - more developed. It was so fascinating that she cut her swimsuit, walking around, teasing boys. But she's not what she looks like or she? I can't understand it. The French people are long about conflict and short about security. It is not surprising that Francois is always smelling her. <br /> <br /> Louse Blachere's characters are not very ambiguous. She is on the team as well. But she was inert and innocent and sensitive about it and was very interested in Francois Blachere as a good actress and increased the boredom of the characters through her performance. <br /> <br /> Related movies And the relationship between these three, which means interesting things, deception, hidden feelings and all that is left of us Association with young women who spend a lot of time together Of course, it's a difficult topic. It becomes more difficult during the development of a homosexual relationship between Pauline and Adele. Regardless of whether you should expect this to be a soft porn movie, the only nudity we see is less than the little turn and sex that is under the blanket. Sometimes, the characters <br /> <br /> I do not think I want to enter the plot or analyze Too much, partly because there is more guidance than acting through action, partly because it's complicated and partly because I'm not sure that I have received all. <br /> <br /> Let's give an example. Another jealous She is quite far away and self-satisfied. Above all, she clearly sees that every boy and man is in the eye if they can apply to her since the handsome Francois. But innocent to the bus driver that she needs help She bragged about her expertise in the licking job. When Pauline approached her about joining the swim team, Adele used her as a viewpoint while being assigned to men. Do you know that narcissism is narcissistic? But then the little body took Pauline thinly under her wing and revealed to her that Pauline was still a virgin. Yes. Actually, Pauline became close to Adele and Adele finally confessed that she wanted to get rid of her hymen and wanted Pauline to do it for her. Pauline, who is sex with Adele, has a mission with fun. Now Adele wants to take it with a man that is older and more experienced. So she took Pauline to the place where she danced charmingly with some men until she followed Pauline to the powder room. Both girls stood there, staring at each other, not expressing interest in sex openly. But Adele stood near until Pauline slowly loosened her bridle, reached up and kissed Adele on the lips. Adele stepped back and smiled and said "Isn't it bad now?" Then went back into the club. <br /> <br /> That's a pretty good explanation of what happened between Pauline and Adele - but what happened? Initially, Adele treats Pauline as a child that is not related, like a close friend. Finally, like a potential lover - and the minute Pauline responds, Adele is satisfied. She uses Pauline in a way that Does it seem to be used for men? Was satisfied that Adele knew that she now had another person who was serving involuntarily? I don't know. <br /> <br /> I used to think of Louise Blachere as the third member of the trio. The wallflower is plain and overripe. The expression often indicates foolishness. Third, to rid yourself of the terrible purity But I crossed her to consider the area. <br /> <br /> Will you see? All this means.
