Castle of Blood is a good example of quality work in the horror genre that appeared in Italy in the 60s. The film has all the appropriate elements - the old dark house, the good story atmosphere and Barbara Steele Steele created the movie Worth having to see. <br /> <br /> The story is related to the haunted castle. There are people visiting but no one comes back. Our hero makes a bet that he can spend the night in the castle and return to receive his prize. But the night he visited was a special night It's the night each year when the dead come to life again. <br /> <br /> The only flaw I saw in the movie was the time of work. It almost felt the cushion. There is a large part of the first show that nothing happens. Our heroes stumble in the dark without finding anything interesting. But when he found something, the movie picked up and became fun. <br /> <br /> Castle of Blood is a taboo for Steele fans and fans of horror movies. Italy
