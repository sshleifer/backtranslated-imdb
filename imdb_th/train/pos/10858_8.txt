Enjoy the movie and drama of the powerful Confucian crime, the original order that survived the threat caused by a greedy man, a radical young man, no doubt representing the modern society. I think that the final scene is strange and not understandable if we believe that the big D is punished for greed or part of a long plan. I love this scene and in one Chinese film, violence is not a choreographed martial arts festival. What surprised me about the Hong Kong movie is the main influence that the British people seem to have: introducing 'Yes, you' and 'Sorry' to the local language, and it's funny that after we disappeared, they were still there.
