My brother brought this movie home from the rental shop and I remember that it was boring. I think the title in particular makes me out. I can't remember starting a movie with low expectations and being a complete winner. I watched the movie twice before letting the brother take it back to the store. It is not often that the movie speaks to me the way he does. I was fully immersed in Ruby's situation as she tried to make her through her life. The bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end quickly. I can continue to watch for many hours. Another downside is that I am not satisfied with everything Ashley Judd has done since then. She is perfect in this movie. This film is easily in my top ten favorites forever.
