I like this very thing - I'm a big fan of movies that bothers your mind and gives you many questions and ideas to discuss, and this is a stellar example. But then Terry Gilliam was always doing well. (Well, almost every time we forget about Jabberwocky and The Brothers Grimm?) <br /> <br /> I like how to manage time travel themes. And avoiding conflicts - events that happened in the past and the future that are intertwined and receiving food to each other. <br /> <br /> It is very well done in aesthetics. me Can see it on the big screen Future scenes have feelings like Brazil. In many ways, and even the current scene will always attract the eye really Two regular actors Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt didn't like it very much, and they both performed great performances here. Especially Pitt - I've seen one or two movies before that made me realize that he really did (in contrast to what I thought at first), but this movie really made them better. I found myself asking my friend at one point. "Are you sure Brad Pitt" is probably the most memorable performance of his career (Although it is acceptable that you may not talk too much)
