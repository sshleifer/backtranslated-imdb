It's quite easy That is all about that. <br /> <br /> The graphics are clean and realistic, except for the fact that some parts of the fence are 2d, but forgive the remaining graphics that are cleaner than GoldenEye and many other N64 games. Important Everything from talking about SFX is satisfying and realistic. <br /> <br /> The camera angle is quite frustrating all the time. <br /> <br /> I received this game as a Christmas present in 1997 and since then I have Receive 120 stars on more than 10 times
