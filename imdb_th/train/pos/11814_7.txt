(Dustin Hoffman), 88 key music (Mandy Patinkin), and children (Charlie Korsmo) Charles Durning, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, Estelle Parsons, Catherine O'Hara, Seymour Cassel, Paul Sorvino And Kathy Bates as a star. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait a minute. I haven't explained the plot! Plot about Tracy's attempt - and failure until now - to find a way to catch Big Boy. At the same time, some strange events occur in the city.
