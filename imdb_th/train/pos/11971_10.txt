I think the comments about the show are a bit wonderful. When people come to watch TV programs, what are they wary of? Enjoy that he watched the show unless he / she was a critic or a person who analyzed the story. But most of us do not like that and watch the show for rest and enjoyment. FULL HOUSE is the perfect show for watching after working in the office / school. It makes you laugh and it's not just a joke /> <br /> Yes, the Tanner family is the perfect family. If there is such a family in the real world, it will be a good example for us to follow. But this is a TV program, not a real family, and there's nothing wrong with drawing a fictional family on television. The fact that the show can run for a long time shows us that people enjoy watching, whether it's a comment later. <br /> <br /> Another good point about acting is watching it. But will return the message But as a child at the message If anyone doesn't think it is nonsense, <br /> <br /> Overall, I will say that after watching Full House performances every time, there is no satisfaction in your heart. Presented after many other performances
