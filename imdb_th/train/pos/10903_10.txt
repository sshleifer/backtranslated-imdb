This guy has no wonder. You feel as though you have spent his life with him throughout these tragedies and finally wept with his family. He is passionate about his causes, not just But for myself But to ensure that others who survive, they do not have to go through this painful pain I watch this video every time I have a bad day or "down" and it makes me see the big and bright side of life like Jonny had done. My only regret is not knowing about Jonny earlier because I have traveled to England twice during his life and can tell that I have found him. Feeling comfortable knowing that Jonny sits on his painful cloud for free! Resting peacefully, loved Jonny You deserve it!
