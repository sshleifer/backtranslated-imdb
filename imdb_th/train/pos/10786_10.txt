Me and my sister use this rental every time we get a movie and our parents are very angry. (But they give us anyway) and I love it ... I can't find someone who lives near me who knows what I am. I'm talking ... I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who loves this movie ... I hope I can find this from DVD somewhere !! I like to watch now, just bc. I love it very much like a little boy ... and now I'm 15 !!! I remember a lot about it ... That was where I received a little bunny song and my friends all knew the song. But not a movie !! I thought that the little girl arrived there by sliding the slide onto the things on her little playground.
