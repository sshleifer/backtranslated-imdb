If you are a fan of Peter O'Donnell's excellent Modesty Blaise book, from the age of sixty, you will enjoy this movie. If you've watched the movie "Modesty Blaise" in 1966, forget it! That is the camp. This is the true Modesty Blaise. Stories and characters are both truthful and polite that fans of books know and love. It was a far way from the imitation of Joseph C. in 1966 and it had to be very polite. Alexandra Staden was quite good and believed in the part and yes we could see her butt kicking gently. <br /> <br /> This is probably the first movie of the series, and it will introduce Modesty, her childhood and days with Lob. <br /> <br /> From Peter O 'O'Donnell is the giver. Consult every creative idea about movies. The real story is even O'Donnell said he felt the character was just as he said. When reading all the books, I enjoy more movies. <br /> <br /> Now that Miramax still keeps their choices in the real estate, Quentin Tarrentino makes this movie. The matter soon Especially when Willie Garvin's great character makes Modesty's character come true. I hope this movie will do well in Europe. I don't know if Miramax intends to sell DVDs in the United States or not. I wonder if it may not be as good as in the United States. In general, I wonder how Miramax decided to choose the location and how to distribute the movie. <br /> <br /> In this regard, modesty was in her early 20s working. At Louche's casino in Tangier, the sequence is done artfully and politely from about 9 years of age through adolescence to her current age in movies - about 21-22. The projector has to be "Perfect actress" for Modesty. For us, Modesty's fans are more powerful than we can imagine. Alexandra Staden is reliable. She is slim and stable. She has many close-ups. She has a wonderful face that is stuck in your heart after the movie has finished. According to the cartoonist of O 'Donnell, Romero, Modesty has a rather perfect shape than Staden, but I am happy to overlook that. If Staden continues to act, I think she will grow up - like Modestly increasing power and expertise When she grew up, Staden showed a great sense of humor and Modesty's confidence. Go ahead and rent this movie. It's not like you used to be. See, and although it was directed by Scott Spiegel, it was full of Tarrentino's touch, excellent camera movement, light and good action sequences.
