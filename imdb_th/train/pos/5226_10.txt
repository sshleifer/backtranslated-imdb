What is all the reviews of Europe (Especially English) is here. All I have to say is when I watch this movie for the first time when I am 13 years old. You have to watch this movie, Dr. Strangelove and Men in Black to get the gags behind this movie But come to others, what do you expect? I can think of many movies that are worse than this and they are expensive Hollwood movies with real actors. For what it's worth, Men in White is a funny joke. And with all the stupid things that England built in the last half century, I was shocked by all negative comments We are stupid Americans who like stupid humor. PS See 'America's Team: World Police' with real laughter that Europeans will like specially HA!
