I used to watch this movie at the premiere at the Imagina Festival in Monaco. <br /> <br /> I saw the first example four years ago and from this period I waited to see the final result. I'm not disappointed. <br /> <br /> It's a full 3D movie with a black and white rendering. Clearly inspired by some comic books, such as from F. Miller in this optic, it goes beyond the great "Sin City" adaptation from R. Rodriguez. This time (almost) there is no gray or neutral color. But the graphic style that was never seen before in animated movies (Can't wait for a dark scanner) <br /> <br /> Using large motion capture makes Many lives and credibility for the characters and we soon forget, in fact, the technique of emphasizing more classic elements such as direction or plot. The direction is still quiet and controlled, despite the unlimited possibilities of the media and it is really surprising. <br /> <br /> The story of the future (Paris 2053) makes it a science fiction movie. Traditional until the end. Despite the classic base plot (Investigations beyond initial expectations) Repetitive atmosphere and themes that are interesting (genetics, absolute power of some companies ...) make this film interesting. It's a cartoon movie, this story is not created for children. You won't find funny pets or stupid family morals, just a cold reality. It's very close to the film noir. <br /> <br /> I found the setting to be one of the best aspects of this film: We still feel Paris, well known. br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm sorry to make a slight mistake. Editing sometimes is quite flat, one or two effects that are slow, boring and a bad conversation. Although the technique is excellent But showing the limits of it in some romantic scenes (such as "Final Fantasy"). Those little things make it 7/10. <br /> <br /> Totally. A successful artistic challenge that you must see if you can. Director Christian Volckman knows how to not fall into the trap that may occur. (Fortunately, they didn't ask John Woo to work!) <br /> <br /> In conclusion, it's a movie with explosive images. Intelligent stories and great artistic directions See if you can! <br /> <br /> Please apologize for spelling mistakes.
