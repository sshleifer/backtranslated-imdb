Starfucker (which read Starstruck on my box) is the most amazing movie I've ever seen. I think it's one of the best movies I've seen. Why is it not 10 that nothing is perfect. Jamie Kennedy proves why he is one of my favorite actors in an interesting look in Hollywood. I forced other people to watch movies and they agreed that it was a great movie.
