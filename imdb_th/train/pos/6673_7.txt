Many user comments that I have seen in IMDB for this movie do not do justice. First of all, let me say that this movie should not be taken seriously. It should be a fun and silly movie that doesn't want anyone to think. But enjoy it If you watch this movie with the intention of seeing a masterpiece, whether it is making movies or jokes, you will be very disappointed But if you want to watch stupid movies with talented actors / actors and good phrases, you will enjoy it.
