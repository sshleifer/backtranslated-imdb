Flick another powerful chicken. This time it revolves around Diana Gusman, who often fought at school. Instead of taking her from school, she took her anger to the boxing ring. She trained as a boxer and met Adrian, a featherweight model and began to fall in love with him. This film has a powerful message that will bring your dreams and go with them, even if some people don't believe in you. (In this case, her father doesn't believe in her). Only that makes the movie worth the fun price.
