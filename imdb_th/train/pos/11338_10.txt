I see this in "Dancing with the movie" and it was wonderful. I felt Jake really talking about adding insult to injury! Not only will your parents get divorced But there are still monsters after you. <br /> <br /> It's both sincere and scary - there are many moments when the audience screams with real shock. It reminds me of Japanese horror movies, except that this story is really good. <br /> <br /> And that is what separates "Jake's Closet" from the normal indie film pabulum - a great script with amazing characters. interested In addition, by incorporating elements of horror movies and family drama, this film received both genres and avoided both ancient ideas. <br /> <br /> If it doesn't come out in the cinema.
