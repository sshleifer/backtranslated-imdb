cheer! Morgan Freeman is an actor who researched the characters he chose to play before he was dedicated. Freeman is a good model for this movie. (Like he used to be "Driving Miss Daisy") and he not only believes, but he also has the opportunity to change the image of playing characters with dignity and suitability. Although there is no guarantee of life for anyone, it gives the actor a great opportunity to play different or unique characters that are unique to avoid creating an image. And it must be said that the pattern has hindered or destroyed many acting careers. <br /> <br /> This is a low-budget movie that is amazingly created in just two weeks. Written by Brad Silberling The location manager selects Carson, CA for movie and location settings, helps determine the sound and time for this movie. The correction is quite good. But rather rough. <br /> <br /> Silberling is a 'subcontractor' in allowing Freeman to make this movie while the actor is in the movie project. <br /> There's a good chemistry between Freeman and Paz Vega, a Spanish actress who will open effective conversations between individual actors who are diverse and come from different cultures. This film also promotes understanding between people not only But speak bilingual (English and Spanish) but from two different worlds of race, ethnicity, gender, norms, traditions, beliefs, ways of life, principles and values This film is committed to honesty and truth in order to preserve the integrity of the film. <br /> <br /> Part of the comedy is Freeman playing the unemployed actor who has not worked for four years. In fact, Freeman wanted to be an actor he worked all the time. <br /> <br /> This film presents the adventures of bonding, caring, sharing, change and exchange. And the scene in which this film shows the audience to see examples of some of the things that the actors have to go through to prepare for the role. <br /> <br /> If necessary, tell your boss that you are 'Mental Health Day' and went to see this movie If you can, take important people or family with you. I rated movies as 10 out of 10. It's fun, interesting, painful and rewarding.
