As a disclaimer, I watched 5-6 movies in the last 15 years and I just saw the musical this week only. This allowed me to judge the movie without losing from what is or is not in the musical. (But it wasted me when I watched the drama :)) <br /> <br /> I believe Michael Douglas works quite well. In that role, along with Kasey, I think she 'let me dance for your scene' is one of the best parts of this movie. The dancers and singing in the film have superior music, including the performers that are at least 10 times larger (easier to do than in movies), lighting, dance and singing. The movie that should be expected and delivered for sure. <br /> <br /> The music that is the same as the musical is better than in the new movie, the song is quite good and the picture Both deliver a more musicals in my opinion, especially when compared with. Musical theater with little decoration One of the worst points of this movie is the clear cut between the actors who talk and the singer dubbed between singing some parts of the character. But their dance is flawless
