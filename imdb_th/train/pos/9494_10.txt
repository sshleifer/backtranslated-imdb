The white light was introduced to me by someone who owned it on two separate DVD versions and in the VHS. He claimed that it was one of the lowest and coolest budget actors ever created. In general, I do not watch movies that know that they are not good. But I made an exception for this ... and I am very glad that I do. <br /> <br /> It's full of wings with action (most of the graphics are full of horror). (Lonely with nude pictures with important female characters But there is a lot in one scene where it becomes hilarious) and the awkward dialogue is outrageous The sound of the movie <br /> <br /> Ginty, the EXTERMINATOR's unusual actor (and countless other low-budget action fortresses) is creating comedy in the lead. Williamson is better than usual, apparently it's obscured by unparalleled joy. (And he didn't come in the middle of the way) The rest of the actors enjoyed watching, especially the villains, one of which was the sexpot. She is an invaluable person. <br /> <br /> Again, I can't stress enough. It's full of blood. It's not annoying blood. But it was unusually violent in some parts that had been drained out of the fire and there was a brutal torture sequence that no one would have forgotten soon In addition, when Ginty is hit by a gang of villains, he will get frantic and the moment that the subsequent splashing of water will cause all action fans to cheer and drink their beer. <br /> <br /> Don't miss White light It is a story-turnaround, if foolish-classic action.
