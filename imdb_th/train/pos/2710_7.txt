This is not my favorite WIP ("Women in Prison"), but it is one of the most famous movies in the subcategory. It was produced by Roger Corman, which at this point produced a few work in progress. Obviously, the movie tries to play with established formulas. This film takes place in the United States prison, not in "Banana Republic", like most WIP movies. I'm not sure if it's a wise move or not. But it is an acceptable change. Writer Director Demme has actually worked and tried to find new ways to present familiar situations. In fact, he had a little ambition for his own goodness. The filmmakers create a supernatural dream sequence that simulates the border line. But it was fun to see that he tried hard to bring this film above the chicks in your chain. But don't worry, Demme still works under the sub-category parameters. There are many nudity and violence that will make the hard-core fans dissatisfied. Movie is a bit slow But it is very entertaining Casting is good
