This is my favorite movie forever. That is because most are not afraid to delve into the wrong political topics. (Such as butt and surrender of women) that other mainstream movies are too shy to touch It seems that nothing is limited in this film as an independent director, developing a story without worrying that it might offend the audience. However, I do not think I will do anything here just for shock or offend anyone. Most recognized mainstream actors will not receive this role or will request to change important screenplay before accepting. Other actors also work well. <br /> <br /> Did you notice that this movie didn't appear on paid cable? Have you ever wondered why? The obvious reason is that it does not match the current political climate. It seems to be ridiculous for me that some premium channels now have porn softcore. (Approaching close to hardcore pornography) but will not bring mainstream movies like Sadly, although this movie is only 11 years old, but can't be created today. <br /> <br />
