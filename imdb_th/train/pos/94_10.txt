I'm a big fan of John Denver. I have his music collection on a vinyl record. I saw this special Christmas when it started broadcasting on TV and liked it. I have original vinyl albums and CDs. I have an original CD and released later. Newer versions will disappear for many songs though. I saw that it was released this year with all the original songs. With my surprise, I found the original CD, sold at $ 75.00 WOW - thought that Christmas CDs would be worth that much. For me, there is no amount that is worth selling this treasure. It's my favorite Christmas CD. I never found it on VHS or DVD. I like to have both versions. If anyone has space, please let us know. Thank you.
