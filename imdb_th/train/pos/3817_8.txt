If you have a drama in your life, whether it's your own or by someone near you, the pain of this woman (But in my opinion, it may be easy to be a man too). It's actually a movie that can't handle your pain without knowing what to do to help you get through. Obviously it's a movie about not knowing how to help people near you from pain. It's a movie that makes you realize that everyone is alone in their suffering. It is a movie that might cause someone to cross the edge ... which rarely listens to suggestions. I'm not sure if I want to recommend someone to watch this movie, especially the close ones, but for me ... it's a movie that makes things in perspective that show real pain and therefore Related to living It makes you realize that hey you or someone near you lives with pain. Hey, everything you worry about now is very important.
