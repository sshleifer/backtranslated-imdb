I miss the number of female actors that I can watch by myself. There are Lucy, Bewitched, I Dream of Jeanie (someone with Barbara Feldman) and my mind is empty, I can't think of other people. Every woman has a supporting role, not a leader. So for me, The Jane Show is a fairly good company. One thing I think I've watched many things that happened in Canada, and I never thought of anything that was filmed in a typical TV series that showed SNOW! It was made during the summer. LOL! It has been a great place to live wisely during the summer. But do you think they will show Canada a bit during the winter season as part of the way of life there?

I talk about But I laughed at Jane and the liberal approach, apparently, that she was accused of racism against her neighbor and I like his bald and crazy man. I found it close to the UK series. Office comedy with female lead Not the best joke ever. But for men who say that he can see only one person, that is, say something If I am with your wife, you may enjoy it a lot because it has sex in the office and that kind of story can be a good joke for couples to watch. 7 out of 10
