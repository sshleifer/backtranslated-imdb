Although there are no new episodes and it is rarely shown I used to love the magic of Sabrina and the teenage witch. I've never seen the last episode. But want to know what happened to Miles or Josh? And why the water had to disappear from acting for good, I'm sure the ending would be perfect But there are a lot of questions that have not been answered And I want to see the last episode of S.T.T.W! Because I heard that she decided between Erin and Harvey on her wedding day! I hope you choose Harvey! And let me say that Nate Richter is hot !! Too bad, too old for me though. Melissa Joann Hart has her own cuteness which she adds to the list. But there are many "stupid" things for the show, such as the famous band coming out of nowhere and playing stupid music. Plus the cat starts to get really lame while the show continues. And things that the "audience" controls the sound to laugh, I think it is lame Don't understand me wrong. Sometimes it's funny. But I think the show will lose "Miracle" of it, so when speaking in the list I gave all the glory to the actors, even though tried but Soleil Moon Frye had no taste and she was an awesome actor. I wonder what Melissa or what actors do with this story. The show is now over.
