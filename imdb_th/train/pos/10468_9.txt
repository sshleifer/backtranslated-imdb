Monstervision Is an item that I grew up with From late to hosting with Penn and Taller to one single. Bob Briggs, Joe Bob The show woke me up on Friday nights in the middle of the year and gave me the best driving memories for me. <br /> <br /> No doubt the best night. TV ever If you don't follow you, then miss it. <br /> <br /> I know that John Bloom and Joe Bob are still alive. But I want them to go back to where they are ... MONSTERVISION! Question ... Does anyone sit through "The Swarm" for 4 hours all? Q :) <br /> <br /> Monstervision can last a long time!
