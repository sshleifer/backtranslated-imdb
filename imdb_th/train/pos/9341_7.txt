Sandler is great again ... I've been a Sandler fan. This movie is the sadest story of Sandler. Its expression is excellent. I cry more. See. Click. But there are some similar points Considering the value of the family before losing it and can say 'I love you' is the most impressive truth in my life. <br /> Cheadle and Burrows are amazing ... Cheadle is one of my favorites from Crash. Don't expect to laugh or have a very good atmosphere ... if you Ready to face The reality of life, do not miss this film.
