I will be honest with you ... I like this movie. It's a great zombie flick that is packed with action, original ideas, good performances. But full of bad zombie effects The fourth part, "After Death" is also good. I would like to introduce this movie to the awesome fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> 10 from 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of the movie This horror should check out Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party, Massacre, Sleep Away Camp and other full moon pictures. Flick for other suggestions. See other comments I sent by clicking on the name of I am above this comment
