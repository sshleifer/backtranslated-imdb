This is a very impressive movie. I don't care what people say about this movie. This is a very good movie. The performance of Amitabh Bachchan's father is dying because he wants to teach his son how to deal with life in the event that something happens to him, and Akshay Kumer excelled in his role as Aditya Thakur, who lost his supporting role. Shefali Shetty, who plays the role of Sumitra Thakur, is excellent. Priyanka Chopra excelled in her small role that she had in the movie Ragpal Yadav as a servant with a brain and Boman Irani is an illegitimate father with good connections. The jokes and funny scenes are very good direction.
