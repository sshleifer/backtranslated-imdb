This is a film about an Italian artist in the 17th century and an artist, especially Artemisia, a career that had never been heard before for women at that time and she dared to draw nude men with a profile. Detailed his specific muscles. <br /> <br /> Most of the camera work is in the building where the artist works. There are some great shots. Close-up pictures with candlelight introduces the beautiful work of classic painters and is interesting to watch the painters and their students supported by scaffolding, scaffolding in detail in the mural Religious It is not surprising that the artistic elements of the movie (Face, makeup, makeup) is an absolutely genuine thing because Italian churches have preserved these details in their murals for centuries. The beautiful Artemisia was motivated by her father to study under the great Florence artist Tassi, who specializes in the art of perspective and landscape painting. (Very new thing) but the unsuspecting Artemisia is used After posing for her, Tassi raped her violently. Her father was angry. The trial of the court followed. <br /> <br /> This romantic drama has a fairly simple story and a satisfying ending. The outstanding feature of this film is the presentation of art and attention to detail. Scenes such as women running across the meadow and the breezes that are packed with their large clothes, add great effects. <br /> <br /> Artemisia is more than a painting to please. Own Her father painted pictures to please others. For this film, I think most will please.
