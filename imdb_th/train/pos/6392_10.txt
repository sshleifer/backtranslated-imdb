Independent B & W, this DV has astounding features, surprises and enjoys the ability to create the most crazy situations, then find humor and interest in them. It's funny and ridiculous. But as ridiculous as it should be, this movie has a heart and a reality here that makes this movie always attached. This movie is about how we all survived the crazy world. Seems to be the heart of the movie For the madman and outside the wall, as far as Leon is 30 years old, the old child helpers always try to keep together. He is like a perpetual boy who tries to catch a balloon that floats for everything to be the best so everyone can have what they want. <br /> <br /> The movie's performance may go beyond the top, but the actors. That really wonderful makes Van Meter's rigid parts probably the best of the bunch here with the efficiency that shines through her absurd tics. Just as the characters in the film do, we overlook her sudden explosion to see the real person under <br /> <br /> Majkowski is a true genius here. He uses the most distorted nonsense plot and makes them real. It was his script and actor who helped to keep everything afloat. It is a true testament to Majkowski's ability and everyone involved in this film with a terrifying plot and character. Majkowski has filmed a movie that may be contradictory and offensive and makes the mind and humor come true. This is a movie that is unique. Not to be missed. <br /> <br />
