Of course, it should not be swept into the jewel of this movie. (And I've seen hundreds of Hindi and Bollywood movies as well) actors, beautiful settings, places, and environments, profound emotions, sweet songs (especially the singing of Udit Narayan, Which I like) - everything is so cute The human elements (incomplete) were knit to create a drama and drive the storyline, as well as giving a subtle resolution. Alok Nath is an excellent actor, so open with the emotions of the characters that he played him almost. Will steal items from young stars I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves true love - people who are superior to superficial beauty for true love - one of the best movies out there in Hindi or otherwise!
