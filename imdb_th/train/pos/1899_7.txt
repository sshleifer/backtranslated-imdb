Arthur Bach wants to grow But that's a pity that it's not the only thing he has to do. Arthur had to marry Susan Johnson, a wealthy man, or he was cut off from family money (worth 750 million dollars). The problem was that Arthur didn't love Susan. (But I heard that she made good chicken) and just fell on the heels for the waitress and Linda Roll, a part-time shop seller. Arthur is an interesting friend. He is just a big child born in wealth, at least someone is taking care of him every second every day. Working just rubbing Arthur in the wrong way - he likes to have fun as a woman and of course drink. Drinking for Arthur is a group of Jekyll-and-Hyde complex; And while making him have all sorts of problems, it is very funny to watch on screen. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is great in this movie as Arthur has been nominated Enter the Oscar and the Golden Globe to win his performance. Moore is a wonderful person in the comical aspect of the movie, changing the comedy to a memorable funny gold. But he is still excellent in bringing Arthur down to the relevant level and making the characters cute Moore has help in the star department - Liza Minnelli is great, like Lina. Nobody is brave enough for Arthur and John Gielgud is great as the butler of Arthur Hobson. The best male actor from the film's performance and no doubt why Hobson has a strong and dry intellect. But he always looked for Arthur - and Gielgud was perfect in this chapter Arthur Gordon's film in 1981 was short and simple. But give lots of laughter
