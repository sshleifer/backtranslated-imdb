A few years ago, a friend received a video from one of his friends with Michael Mann's film 'Heat'. After we finished filming that movie and was about to stand up, we saw that there was another. One story after that, sticky on the envelope of the cassette, the owner didn't write it. But all of us were all stuck back to our seats with a clear launch without credit. <br /> Two hours later, I sat there. Wondering: I would never have heard this masterpiece. Come before .. <br /> <br /> This film is Europa Lars von Trier, awakening the film noir from death, creating reality with an obvious scene. But often there are similarities to the photos after the German war that I saw And then the tricky cutting! <br /> <br /> The story is a tough moral odyssey that doesn't have a happy ending. Peacemakers popularized German-American young men in Germany after the war. The intention of doing good to pay to the national blockbuster. But in most cases, he finds distrust and challenges to destroy himself. He was hired with Zentropa, a food and sleeping company (modeled on Mitropa), which the owner was one of the Nazi collaborators who baptized with baptism. Our hero fell in love with his daughter, who later became a member of the werewolves after the Nazi War. When he didn't understand the world (Or just Europeans) anymore. In his anger, he exploded the railroad bridge beneath the train he had just recorded. <br /> <br /> The last record for historical accuracy: in the real world. Wolves are not as important as movies that convey meaning. Most of them are the last coup of Nazi propaganda. After the SS assassinated Mr. Aachen, who had been taken over by the Allies two months before the surrender, the Nazis announced the creation of all the sabotage and terrorists ready to fight behind the werewolf. But only a few hundred people that Hitler, most young people, were trained in, and while two or three times, some were used to kill suspicious communists or forced foreigners. Workers in the Bavarian village to create fear for the people separately. <br /> <br /> However, the werewolf propaganda has a profound effect on the occupant. They were afraid of werewolves everywhere, wondering if it was behind any serious accident - but there was no exception. Another reason was found later. (Ignored by some recent pseudo-historians), for example, when the main gas exploded in the Bremen police headquarters, dropping bombs or when the Soviet military commander died from a motorcycle accident in Berlin. The result is the strongest in the Soviet tens of thousands of people. (In most children!) 'Preemptively' when suspected of being a werewolf and closing them in a concentration camp with many deaths
