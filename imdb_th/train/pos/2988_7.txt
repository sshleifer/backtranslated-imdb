The original and Barbara Stanwyk will be recorded by Stanwyk's performances. Other stories and performances are too scary and the movie itself is too old to be happy today. Bette Midler's version is more interesting. Much She is Stella Claire, an independent independent woman who is pregnant and rejects the help of her boyfriend. (Stephen Collins) or her friend She cared for her daughter, Jenny, gently performed by Trini Alvarado and came to the conclusion that Jenny's father could do better for her and eventually decided to change her life. Throughout the film, there were many tears, tears and memorable moments between Midler and Alvarado. Marcia Mason starred as Jenny's stepmother, who, though wealthy, would become a great influence on her if you like Midler, Goodman or just movies. Good with lots of emotions. You will enjoy STELLA, Bette Midler.
