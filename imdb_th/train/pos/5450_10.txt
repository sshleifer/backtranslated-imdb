Barbara Stanwyck plays Lily Powers. She is a waitress for her father in a small mining town. He also sells her to men. She fled to New York and slept all the time. <br /> <br /> Originally, I had seen the 71-minute version, but it was quite extreme - nowadays it's quite tame. This movie moves very fast and has a lot of sexual friction. Some things come out quite stupid (but fun). On this day, it moves fast. You can ignore that most will not happen. Even in 1933, there is no class. Or memorial about it - it's a little dirty and fun movie It separated at the end by ending a little "morality" that the censorship examination demands. It was unbelievable and stupid. (I saw it in the theater and the audience laughed at it - one guy was quite right, saying "No way"). I just saw the 75-minute version that was not cut, which is quite different, sad and better than this model. Will disappear until 2004 when accidentally discovered! I believe that this is the only version released - but be careful. <br /> <br /> The performance is good - Stanwyck jumps into her role and plays it in a superior way. She makes you believe that she enjoys cruelty and sleeps around. There is also strong support from Donald Cook and George Brent. Also looking for John Wayne as a star in the hilarious event as a gentle and gentle office worker! Fun, dirty and fast. I gave this to 9
