I saw this with little expectation and really liked it! Puzzling like Beckham is a fairly normal age movie about unusual girls. This is the breakout role of Parminder Nagra ("ER"), playing Jess, a teenager in England who is stuck between her traditional Indian family and her love of football. And even though she is older than her character, she actually plays the role perfectly. <br /> <br /> This is a movie about friendship - especially Jess's friendship with Jules (Keira Knightley), friends. Her team is going with Through family problems, especially with her mother wearing purple nail polish and small bows on her shoes and those who want Jules to be more women, wearing lace lingerie and flirting with boys and afraid that Playing sports means her daughter is a lesbian. Jules and Jesse both like to play the game and have trouble trying to convince their families to let them follow their dreams. Unfortunately, both of them love the same man - Joe, their coach. (Played by Jonathan Ris-Meyers) The love triangle puts the stress on their friendship. <br /> <br /> At some point, Bend It Like Beckham falls into the ancient mind. In another scene, dragging too long and this movie may benefit from a more rigorous overall editing. <br /> <br /> But this is a very fun movie about growing cultural conflicts and love. In football It's about empowering women to pursue your dreams and support your friends. Funny. It's charming and fun. Bend It Like Beckham is a small movie that can be done ... and done. <br /> <br /> Excellent 8/10
