Complete movie masterpiece! Good night, Tom has become one of my favorite movies all the time. No one should miss this movie. It's too good! Mr.Tom is a perfect picture of John Thaw as a ruthless old man who became a soft father when William Beech (Nick Robinson) was sent to him for almost identical evacuation. True heart movie The director clearly knows how to change the book into a movie and he is doing very well. This film has done a great job until the emotions of the characters and the things that happen make the audience feel a variety of emotions, from love to fear, and these emotions may turn into six pence. In times of turmoil during the Second World War, this film also shows the differences between cities and countryside. They are almost like many countries. Of course, those who are not lost in the movies are amazing and Truly wonderful
