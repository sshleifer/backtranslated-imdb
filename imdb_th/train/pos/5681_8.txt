I have no problem with this movie, which I think is quite good. It's a real crime LAPD video that bothered me. I wonder if Lion's Gate actually thought the general audience would want to see those who were brutally beaten to death and blood all over the place. Sorry, Lion's Gate. Unbelievable idea !!! <br /> <br /> Go back and watch the movie: Best actor, especially Val Kilmer in the late John Holmes. John Holmes is a perplexed man who assaulted the woman in his life (Lisa Kudrow as his wife, Kate Bosworth, as his girlfriend) and he was deeply in drugs. His connection with Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian) creates a spiral that causes the murder of the infamous Wonderland. How much is Holmes involved in the murder? We may never know the truth about the story. (Nash is still alive and free) but this film does quite well.
