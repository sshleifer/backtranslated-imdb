This movie is completely ridiculous. Not only plot But only cruel But the show is horrible Special effects are Asinine and all the movies are located in the desert after the war. Still, it's the most fun movie ever allowed to produce it for 101 minutes of laughing, due to the fact that we all know that there will be no fuel in 3000 years or El Camino. Others that I will not destroy, just because they are what makes the movie wonderfully morally I would like to recommend this movie just because of the stupidity. I do not know who will see this, expecting it to be a high quality feature. But if good laughter is what you want to watch Exterminators of the Year 3000!
