If you enjoy John Kandy's actions and responses, you can't help but like. But this movie Watchers who do not observe (and don't know) often see Candy as a broad performer - a big clown. And sometimes he is (see "Stripes" and "Splash") but when given the chance, he may be sharp and fragile It was terrible that he was only shown in many roles that showed his wide side, because we would not see the other side more. Oh yes, the movie. We can watch "Going Berserk" over and over again. (I know I have) with the frequency of "Caddyshack". It's a good thing. The plot, although slightly complicated But actually quite deep for this kind of thing, it helped Candy and Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy be ranked lower than to hit back from Candy ... and they bounce HARD worth it for everyone who likes work SCTV or other Candy jobs
