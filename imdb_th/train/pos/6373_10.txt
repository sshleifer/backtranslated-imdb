Atlantis is much better than I expected. In some ways, it has a better story than other movies that have a higher age goal. Although this film demands a lot of attention over time It's a great movie for all ages. I noticed that some young audiences expect to be funny but adventurous. I think everyone is bored with endless frustration parades. Many of these children have never seen anything except parody. After a while, everyone looked at Atlantis intensely.
