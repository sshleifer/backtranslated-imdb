Mirage (1990) is a very rare horror / chiller movie from 1990, released here in the UK on the label "New World Video". <br /> <br /> It's a horror movie that About the desert about a group of young friends The weekend party will only be killed one by one by the unknown forces that drive the awesome black truck !!! This film has a creepy scene and something here and there. But I must say that the show is very lame, even according to the low budget standard! But this movie is strange and I like it and I never sleep or shut, which is a good sign! I almost gave this movie on 6/10, but when I saw that it was creating steam up the road, there was a good time to pierce and there was doubt. In the main female role is also hot! I will give 7/10
