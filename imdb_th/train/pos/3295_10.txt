This movie is a story of beauty that is hard to explain. Maybe there are no exaggerated conversations or maybe a great soundtrack or maybe just Meena Mumari's feet, but it's a pleasure to watch this movie over and over again. I have never seen another Indian movie that came close and a few countries that match the integrity of it.
