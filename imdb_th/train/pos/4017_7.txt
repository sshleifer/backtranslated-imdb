This is a very memorable western spaghetti. It has a great story, interesting characters and very good performances, especially from Rosalba Neri. Her role as an evil villain in this film is truly classic. She stole every scene that she entered and was very expressive with her face and eyes, even though she didn't say anything. Her performance is very reliable. She manages to be quite enticing without being on top. (No matter what is wrong with being on top) Mark Damon is great in this film too. <br /> <br /> The music score is great and the song is the type that will play in your head like Continued for several days after watching a movie, whether you want it or not, there are two very fun parts I like the part that Rosalba Neri removes in front of the parrot in particular. In addition, there is a smooth gun that can do very well. <br /> <br /> I might give this movie 8 or 9 stars if not two things. The first thing is the quarrel in the stupid bar room that happened about 25 minutes in the movie. This is one of the most ridiculous battles I've seen in movies. It's not very good in choreography, and it seems that the number of beats from a musical is worse than any kind of fight. There may be someone who can overlook this if it's a parody of Terence Hill / Bud Spencer. The more intense and the quarrels need to be more realistic. Another thing that annoyed me about this movie is Yuma's cowardly close friend Mexican. I guess he should be a comic relief or something. But the character is stupid and unnecessary in this kind of movie and he is not funny at all All I can say is where? Tuco When you need him, <br /> <br /> Everything that I said, I would like to assure everyone that this is Johnny U, a western spaghetti. There will be mistakes I have mentioned and all types of fans have to watch this movie.
