Joan Fontaine is "A Damsel in Distress" in this film in 1937, starring Fred Astaire, George Burns and Gracie Allen. The plot about it is about the English woman (Fontaine) who loves the people. American who is mistaken for Astaire, a musical comedy star <br /> <br /> The movie directed by George Stevens has a wonderful Gershwin song, including "Good work if you can do" and "A Foggy Day". The best scene is the "Stiff Upper Lip" number which happens in a fun house. <br /> <br /> Astaire's cry sounds strong. In this film, rather than being in other numbers, dancing Burns plays as a popular publicist and Allen is Berne's secretary. She is hilarious The problem, as others point out, is Fontaine, who must dance with Astaire at the end of the movie. Stevens can easily use the pair because he shows a long rhythmic dance and takes place among the trees. I will think that it is twice as much, except dance is very lousy. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth watching, even if there are bugs.
