As far as I can remember, the change of Balanchine and Tchaikovsky's score are as follows: <br /> <br /> 1) The last part of Grossvatertanz (Traditional songs played at the end of the party) Repeat so many times. The last dance child before their scene ends. <br /> <br /> 2) The solo violin was written to eliminate Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty score but was inserted between the end of the party scene. And the beginning of Changing scenes Balanchine chose this song because of the beautiful relationship with the music for the growing Christmas tree that occurred shortly thereafter. <br /> <br /> 3) Solo for the warrior horse of Sugar Plum Fairy was eliminated > <br /> For me, the allegations that Balanchine has destroyed some of Tchaikovsky's great scores have disappeared.
