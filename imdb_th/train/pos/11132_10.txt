Jon Voight plays the man named Joe. Joe trembled as a child. He had a lot of fear and hatred for religion due to painful baptism. He quit working as a dishwasher and went out to be a wealthy businessman. He found the name Rutzo inappropriate. (Dustin Hoffman) and both have relationships They go out and work together to help each other. They become thieves. Both grow remarkably close and cannot live without each other. However, there is something very important that Rutzo didn't tell Joe and it might destroy any hope that they survived from the city together. This is one of the greatest movies ever. It is a heartbreaking and broken image of a lonely man who has nothing to lose except himself. Their story looks terrifying. But in the end it is important that people see It's one of the movies that the characters are like, like those who seem crazy that sometimes you find on the street. The difference is that this movie comes from their perspective. Their lives showed us and it was very sad to see the pedestrians in this film treat them like dirt, especially if we were one of those people. However, this movie doesn't try to make you feel guilty. But will show you the way of your hustling lifestyle It's not a pleasant and comfortable way of life, like many Hollywood movies that show like MILK MONEY and PRETTY WOMAN. The lifestyle of being a business man is dirty, ugly and ugly, and pleasant. Sadly, people disintegrate like Joe's character in this movie. The thing that impressed me most about this film is that this film came out in 1969 and has passed the perfect time test. Today's audience will still find a good meaning in this film and will continue to love it and love it as much as critics and audiences have done everywhere in 1969. This movie has been rated X but What I noticed about this film is Is a more honest, realistic and effective way Anyone who has had sexual intercourse before will know that humor is embarrassing and scary as hell can be, and this film doesn't shy away from anything. Sex in this movie may not be as graphic as you think. Movies that have been rated X, such as MIDNIGHT COWBOY, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, GREETINGS, LANG TANGO in Paris and FRITZ THE CAT. R level. At present, the sex scene in MIDNIGHT COWBOY seems to be quite strong. But of course they are not sexy They are not graphics. But it's true and that's what people should know when they watch this movie The language of the course used in the movie, especially the word "fag", is used effectively and is not free. Violence is a very shocking thing to watch even today. But there is a need to re-plan the world of businessmen I am very happy to see that MIDNIGHT COWBOY is not dated and still has the same effect as in 1969, if not more. I can't recommend this classic and I hope it will continue to find audiences because it is a special and memorable experience that will not be forgotten soon. <br /> <br /> Advantages: < br /> <br /> - Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are the ones that look harrowing and amazing. They have never had this role before or after, and they are completely different from normal. You will forget who played in a few minutes! <br /> <br /> - Beautiful score. <br /> <br /> - Don't date or camp like many movies in the last decade like today. <br /> <br /> - Work A quick and excellent solution. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: <br /> <br /> - For an adult audience only. <br /> <br /> - The opening scene is good. But they may be slightly stronger
