It's not a big movie. The show is not amazing. (Some subcontractors do not play well) This movie is not beautiful in all aspects. There is nothing creative or new. If you like big movies, this story isn't right for you. But it's really big, plus the story of Larry's story works because we know that this story comes from our own lives. The girl we didn't ask for dating, the test we failed, the friend we disappointed everyone in our history. This movie works because it touches. It's a great story because it's a small matter. It is the life that we all have with regret that we all have and still have a popular message: every life that we can live will have their disadvantages. The first time I watched it, I was 15 years old. It was shown at a party at my school. 16 years later, I continued to ponder this story, and every time I saw it made my face smile. Look at it. You are good. You will be happy with what you have.
