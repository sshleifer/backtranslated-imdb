I haven't read this book yet. But throughout the story, I was nervous with only one thought in my head: this is Vonnegut. I have never seen the composer and the life behind the work of the novel translated as well in the movie. This film has the same complexity found in Vonnegut's novels: jokes are often meaningful and symbolic, and the remarkable events and symbols are often funny. <br /> <br /> Campbell As the character of Vonnegutolte, he has all of the earmarks of the "hero" Vonnegut: Lack of concern about political boundaries. Humorous humor causes laziness in response to Airdrie and unwillingness to push a model of reality with his peers> <br /> Overall, I was surprised and impressed all who watched this movie. It was the same feeling that I read "Cat's Cradle" Vonnegut, my first novel, as if the most strange thing that could have happened. He thought that and he made it real and important. Yes, he has nothing but the excess "White Christmas" album, so it will go!
