- Small spoiler here! - <br /> <br /> When I watched the score for "Creep" today, I was surprised by many IMDb users who rated this movie. "1" I wonder: What do people expect from the movie genre? this? There are many people who watch movies without knowing anything. <br /> <br /> "Creep" is a HORROR movie and it is very good! Automatic means: It has a ridiculous story filled with evil dangers and simple one-sided characters. Why complain about it? Just use popcorn and coke to make yourself comfortable ... ... enjoy the fear until death! The first 60 minutes when there is nothing other than Kate and the solitary subway station that is incredibly shocking. There is fear and fear in every corner of the screen and you will give some jerks just because of the sudden sound of the flashing neon tube on your back. (In my opinion, the sound editing program works the best in this movie.) <br /> <br /> When Kate finds her according to the quality of one movie But it still doesn't become a bad movie The second part of this movie is not scary. But the blood effects are good and the story is quite well developed (... as long as you remember it is the horror movie you're watching and not the Discovery Channel!). So if you want to make yourself It was a very scary hour. Just watch the first hour of "Creep", then exit the cinema or turn on your TV. Do you already know the rest? Bad people will die and Kate will be the only survivor. But even if you watch this movie until the end, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> ... and if you want to increase your anxiety to the next level, do what I do after watching this movie. : Leaving the cinema on a dark night, go to the next subway station and take the last train back home ...
