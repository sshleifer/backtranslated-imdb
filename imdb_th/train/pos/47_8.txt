It makes me regret that this movie is not as popular as it should be. It is very underrated. But the movie bum bum, which can be enjoyed with popcorn and friends, such as movie transformers that focus on movies with a very high budget, such as 300mln or higher in special effects Only and which is a dumb movie without a story It's a kind of movie that I have, even though it's mostly. Of course, it is fun to watch CGI that has been created very much. But we didn't get what was needed from that type of film. <br /> <br /> I think the performance is really great. Especially Busy Philipps, along with Erika Christensen and Victor Garber (the people I respect) make this movie an Oscar. The emotional performance by Busy Philipps was surprising. It was a shame that we never saw the Oscar in her hand which she deserved.
