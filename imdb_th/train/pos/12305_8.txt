Not sure what to expect with this thing, aside from the same positive reviews I have read. Turned out that I had never imagined this before because it was close to "The Bride with White Hair" in the opera This is a fine line between being a joke and just telling stories of old fashion ghosts. There is nothing terrifying about this, that's not a theme. Beautiful ghost The main theme is men trying to save beautiful ghosts. This happened in ancient China with foreign kung fu exhibitions and travel to hell. (More or less) some shortstop action figures are quite cool and the best visual effects along the way I can watch this kind of Chinese movie all day long because they have great visual entertainment and very beautiful cheeks. And I'm looking forward to watching the sequel, the first story of this movie too. Highly recommended
