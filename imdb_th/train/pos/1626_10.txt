This movie is really funny! If you want to rest your brain for an hour, then go ahead and watch it. It's called blonde and blonder, so don't expect deep and meaningful jokes. This movie and enjoy all the stereotypes we have about two blondes. It's just a funny movie to date or with friends. (Especially if you're not too quiet, haha) Pamela and Denise are still quite hot chicks It's wrong to judge that this movie is a work of art. C'mon This movie is about BLONDES! It should be light, funny and superficial. Another thing I don't think women will appreciate and like this movie. But men will definitely
