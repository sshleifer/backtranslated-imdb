I waited until 4 July to write this because ... well ... because it feels right to do today. <br /> <br /> In 1924, Griffith needed a hit. He doesn't have anything big since the orphans of the storm (1921). He has been working continuously since then. But his films are smaller and unable to hit the correct chords with the audience He was planning a movie about Patrick Henry when he was contacted by the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) who asked if he would expand his ideas to cover the American Revolution. This movie is the result. When he graduated, he had a 14-lesson history lesson and there was no trace of Patrick Henry. <br /> <br /> We all know the story of the revolutionary war, but Griffith threw a love story. Nathan's peasant farmers (Neil Hamilton) fell in love with Sat Sat, Khun Nancy Montague (Griffith's leading woman, Carter Demter, for many years) The complicated story is the fact that Nancy's father hates Nathan... Not just Nathan. He hates the rebels. everyone It didn't help anything, while during the skirmish on Lexington's street, someone struck Nathan's arms, causing him to release his gun and cause Nancy's father to accidentally hurt. <br /> <br /> The comparison of the love story is embellished) The story of Capt. Walter Butler (Lionel Barrymore), a renegade British officer who feels he owes loyalty to anyone. With thousands of Indians creating six nations beside him, he hoped to destroy the colony and become the king of his own kingdom. <br /> <br /> Comparison with BIRTH OF A NATION (1915) is inevitable. The Montague family may be Cameron from the previous film, while Nathan may be part of the Stamman family. The sequence of battles of the Bunker Hill scene is very similar to the scenes in BIRTH OF A NATION and the attacking army. In this case, the Redcoats attack the ditch filled with patriots. The only missing thing is that Henry Walthall rushes across No Man's Land to put the flag in the muzzle. Surprisingly, the battle scenes in America seem to lack the power of the fighting scene in BIRTH and fail to attract audiences. It's not the scope, the camera's performance, "Billy" Bitzer is quite good. Perhaps the missing thing is ... dare to speak out .. sincerity <br /> <br /> Capt. Butler's brutality and people He didn't emphasize even though it happened in long shots or off-screen. Do not expect any heads to be pulled out in the near term, as we saw in INTOLERANCE (1916). In the same scene, the second butler who was the commander Capt. Hare (Louis Wolhiem) gouged the eyes of the colonies. A captive We see only the beginning of the action. For the rest, the camera focuses on Hare's face because he clearly has a good time doing this. Lionel works with Griffith both inside and outside since year In 1912, there was a story that he approached Griffith in his work and D.W. by knowing the reputation of his famous family, said "I didn't hire an actor on the stage," Lionel replied. "And I am not like that!" He created a very good and reliable villain. Louis Wolhiem appeared with his brother John Lionel three times; In SHERLOCK HOLMES and DR JEKYLL and MR. HYDE (both 1920) and newer in THE TEMPEST (1927) as Capt Hare, his fierce eyes and unhealthy hair not only But marked him as a villain only <br /> <br /> Neil Hamilton later said that America was scared to death. "He hid his displeasure very well, though, and we can believe. That he was a horseman at the time the shooting ended. Prime Minister Griffith loved Carroll Demeter and at one point asked her to marry him. She refused and from his stock company soon afterwards, her star status gradually faded away. <br /> <br /> The talk of a horse, one of the most amusing moments of the accident, must not be determined. During the lecture of Paul's riding He rode his horse up to the balcony of the family's house to declare, "Arrive! The soldiers stationed are coming! "But as he tried to leave the horse, could not negotiate the steps backwards and stumbled his rider on the ground! I'm surprised that Griffith didn't use it anymore. <br /> <br /> America is classic? Yes! Don't wait for 4 July to see it all the time.
