Two historical films related to Indian POW; Veer Zaara and Deewaar. Although Veer Zara is a love story of a man who gives everything to someone, Deewaar pays attention to his main topic. Not hidden that many Indian POWs are decaying in the Pakistani prison for many years - for those without the Indian government. Have time or sympathy or other aspects. I'm sure that some POWs of Pakistan are in India as well. But focus on movies Full of actors Some people are musical actors such as Raghubir Yadav, Rajendra Gupta, etc. Amitabh Bachchan, who plays the role of Major, performed very well. Akshaye Khanna did his job well. I think Sanjay Dutt's role is the strongest, though not for long. He did very well here and the delivery of his conversations was impressive as well. If you compare it with LOC, which is not something other than a day-long story that has stories in every direction (If it's a story) - Deewaar is a well-directed movie 7.5 / 10
