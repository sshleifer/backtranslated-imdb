The first American American in the Navy It was his tough struggle from being a poor farmer in diving school and more than that. It is good But it seems that it has been done many times When compared to all odds, they will not give up until they achieve their goals for emotional reasons many years ago. It may happen But the encounter with many of Bachcher's faces in this film is questionable, including the COO of the diving school, which involves his final test. However, all of this was composed from the scene when Robert Deniro came into the movie. Deniro plays the role of Sunday leader who is a diving instructor at the school. As soon as Deniro came in, he would not feel any serious arrogance that you would not be able to hate if you had no incredible fault. Before the movie ends, Deniro will give many speeches that will make you laugh how cool he is. But you are too confused with the way he chases them out In the end, you have to doubt some aspects of the movie. But accept that if it is all true, it will make you take a nap in the first twenty minutes
