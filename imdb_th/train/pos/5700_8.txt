I read many negative reviews of this film and finally had the opportunity to watch on DVD. To be honest, I don't really know what the problem is. <br /> <br /> It's a good horror movie that shows from various perspectives from strange actors who often kill the murderer / suspect, including the screen. John Holmes, King of Porn Please read the synopsis summary for the exact details about the film's story - I want to participate in the review rather than the story. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers have criticized the film at the level. Lowest due to violence I don't really see it. Many modern movies are worse than ever - private savings are more violent than this film, which often requires more blood stains than actual brutal killings.>> I was attracted to both halves of this film - the show John Holmes' first as a hopeless cash addict and the second half showed that he was a little conspirator in the blood. creating conscious This movie has a great performance, although Dylan McDemorant looks better than it is in the motorcycle rider and the goatee'ed bad boy's personality <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is great. B side rocks and obscure pop of the 70s spread over a couple of hours in the right places everywhere. Ala Boogie Nights
