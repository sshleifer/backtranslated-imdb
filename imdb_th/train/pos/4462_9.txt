One of the first of the best musicals, Anchors Aweigh presented many memorable musical sequences, such as Kelly's dance with Jerry the mouse, Kelly's dance with Sharon McManus, 7 years old, singing Sinatra and Jose Iturbi playing piano. Technicolor is complete with some innovative cameras, such as watching the piano playing from the bottom through the transparent buttons and singing Grayson seen through the camera's search engine. one Some story But you are involved from the enthusiasm of Kelly & Sinatra, the sailor's ass. They must take the young boy who escaped. (Dean Stockwell) returned home and Sinatra fell in love with his aunt. In organizing him with Aunt (Grayson), Kelly shows that Sinatra can audition with Jose Iturbi, but Sinatra is still young and innocent in this and in the words of He fell in love too soon. While they were trying to contact Iturbi that had never been free, he began to fall in love with other women. (Barbara Britton); But now, Kelly falls in love with Grayson. Aweigh is often remembered in the live / action / cartoon sequence with Tom and Jerry, but there are many more worth seeing. I gave nine stars because while it wasn't as good as the best musicals - Singin 'In The Rain, Music Music, Oklahoma - one of the first classes of their big technical productions (maybe Meet Me In St. Louis is the first) and better than most others.
