The best way for me to describe Europa, which is high on my favorite movie list, is the exclamation from friends after the film ends: "I don't know how to make this movie." All the original in the visual style is one example. The best of movies that can It is far from the filming style. "Master and Coverage" as far as possible. Combining images, sounds, effects, props, conversations, voice overs, work, editing, lighting and more ... even with Hollywood's short-sighted "dialogue", but the cinema is not about dialogue or the story of beautiful light, action or music. It works best when all the elements are in the same position, especially the combination of those elements, respectively, or the combination that they will be presented will communicate ideas. Reducing or eliminating the participation of one element and movies without meaning "Europa" is something that the cinema should strive for.
