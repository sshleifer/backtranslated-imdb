Oh sixty There are some interesting movies. I am a person who has already watched more movies. Now I enjoy renting movies and resting in the house instead of going to the theater. I have also seen a short film "The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle". I've searched this movie for many years. It is truly inspiring. Surprisingly, I can finally gather more information from your site. Thank you ........ I was surprised to find that this short film was the debut of the Disney movie. I can't remember Disney movies. I can't remember that it was an opening movie for Disney. I hope they will show this on TV. Sometimes I wonder if Disey holds the rights to this film or not? Is there a DVD? This is a must see for every model !!!
