Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson and Jose Iturbi performed in "Anchors Aweigh" directed by George Sidney Found a little boy (Dean Stockwell) and brought him home. They met his aunt (Grayson). Clarence fell in love with her. She wanted an audition for Jose Iturbi. They tried to help. <br /> <br /> This is a very energetic musical drama with great dancing and singing by Kelly and Sinatra. Kelly dances with Jerry Mouse in a delightful sequence. Grayson sings Jalousie and My Heart Sings is not one of my favorite sounds. But she did well. The piano performance of Iturbi is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Sinatra shows his versatility and why the girls slapped him with big blue eyes and faces. as a child For Kelly, this is an important break for him at MGM. <br /> <br /> Great movie.
