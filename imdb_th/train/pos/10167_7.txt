I'm not a fan of watching this movie. But when my girlfriend called me and said she had a free advanced screening, I tagged only to see eva longoria and laugh at the biggs jason <br /> Overall better than I expected but not so much Is like a hybrid of losing men in 10 days and like heaven General romantic comedy with a moment that I guess The film is quite short (about 85 minutes), but it is enough to tell the whole story, create character development and end happily. The whole idea of ​​haunted haunts its original husband is an interesting plan to follow. Eva works well to heal the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the supporting actors. (Especially jason biggs) makes laughter smoothly. <br /> <br /> Overall, there are lots of good laughs, so I go, otherwise I will rate this movie low. Hey, it's a chick and I'm watching this movie from crazy people. It's going to be a fair fight if women criticize this film and give you ideas about it.
