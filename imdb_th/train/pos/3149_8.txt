Not since The Simpsons launched it with a sitcom that I didn't want to change in a matter of minutes. Of course, it is said that The Simpsons killed the sitcoms, not one of them. <br /> <br /> The first season was like that because the teenage characters were not quite as bad as they became later. Sometimes they go to school. The following season, the characters come out Eric, a satirical twit, Donna, his girlfriend, head level, Kelso, dim bulb, Hyde, conspiracy theory and anti-punk establishment, Fez, exchange students misuse. And finally, Jackie, a dirty woman who is rich, spoiled For an adult character, Eric's mother "Do you believe that she is disgusting?" Eric's father. The exact arrow is not as difficult as he saw Donna's stupid father and her silly blonde. Every mother is sincere to their characters. But Kurtwood Smith's extraordinary glory, who found the perfect balance between strength and yet made his Red Forman quite sympathetic, without having to abandon the cuteness The main reason for this program is very good. It is a character that is difficult to play because it does not allow the actors to immerse themselves in the actual role as the Kelso character played by Ashton Kutcher. I am happy to see the two characters interact because they are the most different. br /> <br /> Hyde's character is a bit fun because he looks more realistic and we have to look at the orphan story for the seventh time. Although I said that the writer came with a wonderful story for him in the past season, <br /> <br /> Jackie played by Family Guy, voiced by Milcunis. Have nails on the board The sound that fits your character The only sad thing is that we didn't see the scene with her more and Eric because they were hilarious together ... too much of the story that was lost to her relationship problems because we received the post. Black and Eric and Donna. <br /> <br /> Finally, I will say that casting from the guests is always excellent. Some favorites: the charming girlfriend of Fez, in the middle of the season, Bishop Dan, Leo, totally wonderful, performed by Thomas Chong, another Faceface's girlfriend who is certified by Completely and as a special characteristic of the young saber witch Cool Catholic woman <br /> <br /> Come up above anything Fox
