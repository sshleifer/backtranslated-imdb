I accidentally watched this movie that was shown in Brooklyn - it's hard to explain the plot; It has many strange characters. But we have a difficult time choosing the options that make me laugh the most. I don't know where to start. Although the role of the role is well written and well-served It looks fresh. It's not something that has been reused many times. If this film can reach more audiences, I am sure it will be something that the audience is really satisfied. The story is a new and sincere story. Mistakes and misunderstandings that cause the final actions and dramatic conclusions. Cross Eyed is a very heartwarming comedy. It is an impressive story with a quick comedy. Definitely worth seeing!
