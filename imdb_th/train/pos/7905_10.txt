I am very sorry for those who went to watch movies with sheets and pencils to write bugs and note how bad the movie is. I feel disrespectful to people who watch movies and can't stop the truth and / or let yourself enjoy 90 minutes from a boring or busy life! Get people. GRIP ECGTB is a very entertaining movie. If you are serious about watching movies, this is not right for you. If you expect this movie to look like this book in some way, this is not for you. But if you like Priscilla Queen of the Desert's most happy or "I'm watching anything" by Moulin Rouge or the comedy "The Sweetest Thing", then let yourself escape to the Cowgirls. Really hilarious. It really has a very good song like glory. To kd.lang I also mention it has 90 minutes of Uma Thurman ..... I want to say more?
