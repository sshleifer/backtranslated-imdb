Peter Jacksons version is a better movie overall from the point of view of purpose. That was said that they are not the Lord of the Rings version of my favorite screen and let me explain why <br /> <br /> At first, the character's performance on the screen is too common and not interesting to Jackson's LOTR. All characters work too hard. "You claim that stupid cartoons in the version of Ralph Bakshi are better actors than real people?" One can ask. They are not really stupid. (Save for the Hobbit later about them) and they packed their personality more than Jackson's party - even with more limited talk time and that's because of the excellent _voice_ performance of LOTR of Bakshi, for example Aragorn In this version, his voice is deep and charming, full of authority. (Aragorn Lord) and with the old filings (Aragorn Ranger) This is because of the great performance of John Hurt compared to the rather spiky sound of Viggo Mortensen without souls and dueling is not smooth quickly: Hurt beats Mortensen holding hands. <Br /> <br /> Then there was Gandalf May be the most popular character among all the fairy tales in the Bakshi Gandalf version (William Squire). This is the real wizard. And by that I didn't mean that he shot the bolts from his fingertips (he didn't), but his presence was just a charm He is a mysterious, powerful and able to easily change from a gentle old man to a scary person. Add to that his look: tall, pristine, such as ancient oak trees, long beards as far as his body, pointed eyes, magical hook nose, and, of course, the classic wizard hat, Gandalf perfect like in Gandalf's book. Ian McKellen, on the other hand, is too boring. He looks too human, sounds like a human being acting like a human being too much, and not wearing a hat or not using a sword. Yes, the sword in this version of Bakshi Gandalf scored the blood of a ghost killed by his sword. (Like he did in the book) and that is a slow, stylish movement Gandalf is not the power to be busy. And must observe that while I was sad to say this, the great Christopher Lee did not make Saruman have Fraser Kerr's life in this film, despite the limited time and lines on the screen. <br /> <br /> Before I completely moved to the vision of the movie, I had to say that the voice acting and general visualization Ork is still superior to Jackson's bad guys, with the ghost of Bakshi provoking their enemies. (Or each other) continued with roaring, screaming and offensive language They believe that it is a monster and faithful to the book in my opinion. Finally, the Black Riders - or the most evil Nazgul - are horrible ghosts in this game, not just some racers who wear black. And they speak with the hallucinations that tempt their prey My favorite scene in this movie was when Nazgul was pursuing Frodo near the river. While Peter Jackson can't do anything but show the driver just chase the Bakshi party, throw a dream in a nightmare with a cool slow motion scene and thundering sky. <br /> <br /> But as far as I like this movie Jackson is only technically better. And that is because some of the important images As you know, Bakshi LOTR has a mixture of animated characters. (Hobbit and main actors) and real actors covered with color I don't have a problem using real people in this kind of animation. But they are not quite compatible with traditional cartoon figures This is true, especially with humans (riders from Rohan, tavern, etc.). The Orcs are different because they look different from other characters. Orcs while playing by humans with mixed animations Looks far beyond the version of the Jacksons. They have greenish brown skin, red eyes, shadows, flat faces and sharp teeth. <br /> <br /> The biggest winding in this movie, the audience is the hobbit. Although I like almost every character in Bakshi version compared to Jackson. But the character has a clearly superior hobbit. In fact, they are perfect with Bakshi. You will get annoying and poor bear humans. And you are forced to spend a lot of time with movies, so be warned Voice-overs are also available. But the actor's mouth cannot be recorded "Infusion damage" caused by these small weasels I never liked the half-siblings. <br /> <br /> It is well known that general failures in Bakshi scripts, limited play time (with limited budgets) and many missing scenes. So while this film covers almost half of the story But it was not done in a very detailed manner compared to Jackson's model. <br /> <br /> In summary, LOTR model Ralph Bakshi has superiority: <br /> <br /> - The overall atmosphere. (Feels like Middle-Earth) - Total sound performances - Music (I'm really digging fantasy points by Kont & Rosenman) -Gandalf -Aragorn (one of John Hurt's best roles) -King Theoden -Orcs -Black Riders -Elrond ( He's not a hippie god in this story!) <br /> <br /> While Jackson's version is better: <br /> <br /> - because it covers the whole story - the whole picture and the effect Special - Gollum / Smigal-Balrock-Hobbits <br /> <br /> Lord of the Rings by Ralph Bakshi Even though there are well-known shortcomings Which in movie animation as the best ever made, and it captures the atmosphere of a fantasy world of Tolkien, as well, if not perfectly. I will rate 8Â½ out of 10.
