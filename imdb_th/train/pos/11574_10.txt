This movie is a half documentary ... and it's quite interesting .... <br /> <br /> This movie is good ... from the true story of the sabotage of the Norwegian people. Weight production in Rukjan, Norway and the release of the remaining weight to Germany. <br /> <br /> This film is not perfect and probably better ... the best part of The movie is some of the sabotage that plays by itself !!! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the history of World War II and this movie is worth watching !!
