This police procedure is not worse than other times and is somewhat better. Obviously following the steps of "Dragnet" and "Naked City" but appearing to be a fun programmer. The best thing about it is the unadorned look that has been given in the world that has long passed ... the lower classes in New York in the late 40s / early 50s. Old tattoo to cheap hotels to greasy spoons These old police movies are like travelogues to the past and are very bitter to anyone who does not like the unclean city landscape today. <br /> <br /> Interesting is to focus on science and bolts. Of nuts, crime ... In this case, the murder of a tattooed girl found in an abandoned car. Tobin and Corrigan, our main detective, are the futsal operators. But without the tedious and painful efforts of "Lab Boy", they won't go anywhere. Although the technology is not in the same league, the police here use the efforts of CSI researchers to track their people. <br /> <br /> The way some reviewers write about this movie, you think of it. Will be directed by Ed Wood and played with special effects from his movies. What is good! I enjoyed John Miles as a former maritime police officer who turned Tobin police ... He was happy and fortunate to be close to the changing role of the welcome from the general Histories that faced the stone of that era. Patricia Barry is cute and cheerful as his brave girlfriend who helps solve crime. Walter Kinsella, disgusting and funny, like a former detective Corrigan I like the chemistry of these two and it creates something different from the robot's arrangement. "Dragnet" <br /> <br /> The mystery is not deep and the last chase and shoot out. Come for sure Will not be ranked in the classic movies of crime But in a short time, "The Tattooed Stranger" is more than my interest.
