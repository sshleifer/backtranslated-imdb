I just saw this movie in Turner Classic Movies last night and was blown away by Victor MacLaine's performance: in every sense of the word "Tour de force", the atmosphere of the year 1922. Dublin appeared from filming and production design using the most predictable techniques in the 40s and early 50s. During the wake of Frankie McPhillip Gaelic, Max Steiner's score was memorable. In the next film, like GWTW of 1939, he made a folk ballad to give the local color and feel of the place and time. John Ford: A giant movie in 1935!
