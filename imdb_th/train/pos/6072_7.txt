Branagh and Fishburne present great performances in Shakespeare classic Branagh, playing Iago better than I have seen characters playing in movies or on stage. Some people may say that this movie is more important than Iago, but I don't see Fishburne, the first black ottoman in film history, creating powerful works. Fishburne has always been a good actor. But acting as Moore of Venice may be one of his best. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have with this movie is to simply remove the important scenes. Desdemona has less depth in the drama. In this movie, she may not be added. One of the worst wounds that Braunak made in this film was the removal of the dialogue between Iago and Desdemona at the beginning of the second chapter. This drama shows that Desdemona may not be the innocent child that she plays in the film. There are many deletions that hurt the integrity of this movie. <br /> <br /> However, if you haven't read the drama or watched the Othello movie version before, I recommend this movie. The story is cut or not remains unbelievably fascinating. The performances as mentioned earlier are very good. If adding some important scenes and the characters of Desdemona have been slightly increased priorities, this will be a great movie. It is still an admirable original version. I give a little advice
