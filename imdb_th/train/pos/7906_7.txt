Gus Van Sant has created a great movie I'm a real fan. <br /> <br /> However, I can't help but feel the brain of Tom Robbins. "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" disappeared from translation to the big screen. Alone, Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sang are visionary and gifted towers. Finally, although this one doesn't work, <br /> <br /> It's not that the characters aren't well developed or the plot and content aren't lively. It's just our imagination that is more powerful when reading books like this. We are taken to different places and times, and sometimes we think of the worst and / or the best and it adds to the overall roller coaster of this book. However, movies can leave anything without using imagination and emotions, causing the roller coaster to deviate from the overall experience. This is what I believe is happening here. <br /> <br /> I recommend reading books!
