If you like Deep Purple, you will enjoy the great movie with Stephen Rea in the main role, the story about the most famous rock band of the 70s. Weird fruit and they decided to play together again But of course there will be many problems during their concerts. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are great and the song "The Flame Still Burns" is perfect. You have to watch it.
