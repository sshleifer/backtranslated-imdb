In the sequel of K-9 classic action comedy 1989, Detective Dooley [James Belushi] and Jerry Lee, his dog returned to fight crime. But this time they collaborated with another detective [Christine Tucci] and her partner. Doberman's name is Zues, which doesn't match Jerry Lee very well. Dooley doesn't match his new partner too. All changes follow the movie. This film is violent because it is a man who wants to kill Dooley in the way he treats him in the past. There are some amazing scenes about the death of Dooley's wife who doesn't seem to be in the film's voice because the rest of this movie is a funny action action dog, poop dog, funny fart and funny dog ​​bite Bad people in some areas, I know that it looks like a very low humor. But some things are funny I didn't watch this movie for a joke. I saw it for two reasons. The first reason is because I am a big fan of James Belushi and the second is the action scene. James Belushi is more fun than him in K-9 and the action sequence is also improved. It would be nice to see the characters from K-9 come back, but it's still a fun movie. If you are a James Belushi fan, you will love this movie.
