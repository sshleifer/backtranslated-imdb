DOCTEUR PETIOT, starring Michel Serrault, is a cruel story about a brutal man. The doctor who treated the sick in the occupied France, even if unable to compensate Nonetheless, he continued to control the weakness of the people. Great pictures and movies and a terrifying feeling for this complex story. He is the perfect psychopath. Charming and altruistic, creative and caring, calculating and murder The movie that the audience should not forget. Soon Kudos to Mr. Serrault for his cold painting.
