Absolutely beautiful, warmth for the head and heart. The filmmakers from the West are too hectic and too excited to try. My children watch it and they like it too What people actually do - go to show you that cultural differences (Japanese settings) are less important than human similarities. Go see it, whether you like dancing or not.
