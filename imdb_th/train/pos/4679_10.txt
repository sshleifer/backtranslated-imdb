Great movie with a slightly slow start - giving you a chance to cook. The story creates interest and complexity. Characters and stories subvert expectations and cliche in the right moment. Great location in New York City - Truth, Truth - is an excellent antidote for commercial necessities of "Sex in the City" - in fact, the whole film is an antidote to the HBO / Hollywood concept. New York City's Sex and Relationships It's a rare movie that treats its characters honestly and mercifully. Love it! A great actor with an outstanding performance by Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson and her love interest. (Forget his name!)
