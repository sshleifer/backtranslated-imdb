Performed surprisingly well for Insomniac's nightmare independent film, drawing a shocking picture of how it would suffer from insomnia It creates an atmosphere of dreams when the audience is taken to sleep one night in a life with insomnia. <br /> <br /> Starring Dominic Monaghan as Jack, we will see everything he sees. A long hour of lonely nights The lecture is almost hypnotic and from the first line it is impossible to turn back. It shows that somebody dealing with insomnia creates a balance between consciousness and madness. <br /> <br /> With twists and turns around the corner Highly recommended
