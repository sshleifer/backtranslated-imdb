I think the reason for diarrhea in this film is that most people tend to think that Sharon Stone is about 50 people and naked while playing sexy. No one is interested when the golden girl sits on a cheesecake and talks about their first climax. But to see if someone is posting a satisfying digital posture while driving Let's see. She looks good. She's a hot light year than my mother who is the same age! It's not the first Oscar or classical cult. But since the turn of the century, every movie viewer seems to be expected: a movie experience that will touch your soul. As such, it never claims to be either. It is an erotic thriller that is both erotic and exciting and is a continuation of the wonderful characters that we all like to hate. It is the character of Catherine Trammell, who helps to avoid this sequel. The fans of the first film want to see the cold queen ice. <br /> <br /> The film and the artistic direction are lush and extravagant and make I want to move to Britian. Of course, the score is amazing as well. <br /> <br /> Of course there are too many characters from the characters. But there are some great work from David Morrissey who doesn't really know. <br /> <br /> There is a failure in the script. Almost like the first movie that was inserted into a psychiatrist instead of the police. As well as the MPAA's criminal decision to force the film to be cut down which leads to obscenity that the story is known. <br /> <br /> At least it gives Entertainment and Enjoy watching and that is the only intention of the movie. So if you have meat with Mizz Stone, you may watch the movie and summarize your own conclusions before you vomit?
