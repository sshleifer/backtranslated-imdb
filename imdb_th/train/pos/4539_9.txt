The show is quite wonderful. But for people in this area in the 80s and now are Detroit automotive engineers in the area, this is a great movie. I also work with Japanese suppliers to make this movie more funny. <br /> <br /> Jay Leno shows his age last night in The Tonight Show! He looks pretty boy here ... 17 years ago, the opening scene with a drag race in what seems to be Woodward Ave With this set, I'm sure Vette, who was blown in the opening scene, was his own car. <br /> <br /> 80s movie, general.
