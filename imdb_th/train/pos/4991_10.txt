It's a shame that this movie is hard to hold your hand in the US. I found it through a rare video dealer and it was definitely worth it. This is the best movie created in the pre-code era and the best movies of the 1930s. The powerful director Frank Borzage created a great movie about Depression and with MAN's castle, he created a fairy tale amidst the difficulties of that era. Loretta Young and Spencer Tracy had excellent chemistry between them and they helped. Making this movie a great love story. Young's Trina is sweet and hopeful, while Bill Tracy's gruff and the closing movement between the characters create one of the most difficult things. But in the end, the worthwhile relationship in the movie <br /> <br /> MAN'S CASTLE is the most gentle, pre-focused movie code I've ever seen. Borzage uses fog techniques and dreams to change the village of the intruders, which Bill and Trina lives in the palace. The difficulties of the economic downturn have never been ignored. In fact, they are an important part of this film. But while the Borzage craft, this movie is a gentle fairy tale, the love between the characters makes the situation look less severe. It makes the movie look warm and cute. <br /> <br /> MAN'S CASTLE is the great success of the pre-code era. If there are many people that can be seen
