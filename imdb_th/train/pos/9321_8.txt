Is a romantic comedy. This is cute and win I think writing should be a little better to create a better connection. But that is not a very stumbling point, but Amanda Detmer and Scott Wolf give good and charming performances. This is my two favorite actors and I'm glad to see them performing as romantic actors. I hope to see them perform in other projects soon. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie will not change your life. But cute, warm and win Not a bad thing at all
