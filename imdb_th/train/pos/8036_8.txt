Some men think that snipers are not good because their actions are not good enough. If you think it's an action movie, this view point may be true because the action of this movie isn't really exciting. However, I think this is a psychological drama instead of an action scene. br /> <br /> Most movies tell us about the inside of two rifles that have different personalities and experiences. Thomas Bett, a veteran and has confirmed the killing of 74 people. It seems that he is calm. However, after Better shows his dream on Montana Day, we will see his softness clearly. It was a brutal war and the sacrifice of his partner, causing Becket to become a cold-hearted thing. <br /> <br /> Millar, on the other hand, is a newcomer, a green sniper Billy Zane did quite well in showing Millar's hesitation and fear when he tried. "Put a bullet into the heart" (as Beccket said). What he thought about Actuall's suicide mission was that it could be easily done and then he could come back and receive the prize safely. <Br / > <br /> These two men have very different personalities and I think this movie Succeeded in showing the differences and effects they have on each other due to different personalities These two sharpshooter finally argued and came to understand the communication and what they did to help the other survivors. <br /> <br /> Sniper is not a good action movie. One psychology
