While reading the remaining comments for this program, I can't help but notice that there are many examiners who do not watch the episodes of the show either through or according to their own needs. What about Kerching! It is clearly a children's show for children. If you are older, it will seem to be forced and may be stupid. I also found a person who said that the scene was stupid. But I remember that at the age of eight, I wondered why Ikequkake's Taj Mahal reached the wall and wondered if my parents would be stuck with me. Yes, it may be annoying. The performance may be better and some characters do strange things with their hairstyles. But as the kids show, I rate it 10/10 compared to what they broadcast today. Okay, that I hope it will air again. DVD release everyone?
