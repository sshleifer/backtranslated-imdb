I remember seeing this when I was seven or eight. I had to find the characters around because they left my impression of my heart that lasted a long time after the movie ended. And the ending now is sad ... for 7-8 year olds <br /> <br /> I had the opportunity to watch this movie again recently and found that the story was too simple Two-dimensional characters ... I think it's a movie that you can do with the innocence of a little child ... poor ... <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie for every parent. The person you have small children ... (I saw it in the original French version, so I can't tell you whether the translation is good or not).
