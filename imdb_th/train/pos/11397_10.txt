A timeless musical gem with Gene Kelly in a popular style, a stylish direction by Vincente Minnelli and a great musical number. It was a great entertainment from the beginning to the end. One of the movies that people watched with smiles and said "They didn't make them like they used to do!" But they never made them like this. The 25-minute hit musical drama series without any dialogue is one of the most beautiful movie history. Magic movies come from the hearts and souls of everyone involved clearly. Must see!
