Unknown to Michelle Rodriguez, while Diana was a genius She is perfect. Her inexperienced acting actually works as she wants. We have never seen her before, so it feels like her story. She also brings true durability. This thing works for you because we never doubt. You don't have to cheer for you to win because she never fights with fighters. We don't think she can overcome. So as a boxing movie, it fails. <br /> <br /> Then again, this is not a boxing movie. How do you make a movie about a woman who wants to be a non-boxing boxer? You can't, but Karyn Kusama is as good as many indie movies about "Girlfight" against the classification or genre and stands on top.

The mental and physical strength of this training takes time to play games like boxing, which is your anger. So this time, it's a big story. <br /> <br /> Or have another position to receive: Finally, boxing movies about women. Female boxing for a long time The cruelty that we often see in boxing movies is replaced by discussions about people's lives and feelings. All fighting things are used as a platform to draw large images. Respect. Overcoming adversity. Self-discovery <br /> <br /> I recommend "Girlfight" because it has good spirits and is an example of a great job by the first director. The conversation was never higher than the quality of the drama. But the story itself changed my perspective on something. Yes, now the world seems to be a better place. Movies do that <br /> <br /> Grade: B-
