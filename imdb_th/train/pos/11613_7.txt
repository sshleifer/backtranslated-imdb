Distortion is a movie that surprised me .. A multi-layered drama that focuses on men who write plays about his life experiences that have happened to him now. To be more precise, he felt that his wife was cheating on him, so he hired a private eye to spy on him. His wife didn't know that this happened. At the same time, the actors in this drama have somebody wearing their coat of arms by fooling around each other, and also we will say that the shameless people in the world of Israel All the things that happened in the theater with all the actors were happening and predictable. (But not actually happened) <br /> <br /> This director makes things move with the characters of the characters and edit in The way that makes you care, this is a really fun movie, which I don't mind to watch and recommend to people to try.
