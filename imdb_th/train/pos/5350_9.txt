I've seen The Running Man many times because I am a fan of Stephen King and have all his movies. But now it's better because 2 days ago I didn't know about this website and I didn't know that Paul Michael Glaser, who was related to this film, was Paul Michael Glaser, which I grew up watching TV Star. Mikey and Hutch For me, this is a delightful surprise because I can't tell you how I cried when Starsky or Hutch hurt a lot. Starsky (Kill Starsky) almost died. I cried so hard. My father had to turn his back on acting. What you expect of a child aged 12, now I intend to look for movies and programs related to Paul or David Soul and what Stephen King has his hands on me, so there !!!!!!!! Just said that happy birthday Paul !!!!!
