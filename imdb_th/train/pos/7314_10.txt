The first time I watched this movie, I fell in love with it. The atmosphere is my first attraction. I expect to have a carnival. But instead of watching the work of a highly creative killer with my head to a chilling soundtrack The fact that I cannot predict whether he will kill and when he will disappear is an important advantage in my book. The predicted horror movie has penetrated me. Now I know that the story is somewhat different. But if you like me, you won't notice them until long after the film ends. Motion Finally, when I talk about the immortal soundtrack It was one of my favorite drama scores all the time, so I was very happy to hear that Rob Zombie let it be untouched in his remake. When talking about the remake, I read a very comprehensive article about this, and now I know that Mr. Zombie regards John Carpenter. this This movie is great for every time you have a spine-tingling craving. But it is the perfect complement to the opening of the ending. You name it for the All Hallow's Eve movie Marathon :)
