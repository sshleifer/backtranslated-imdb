I am very happy to see this video at the store. I am looking for a happy movie and this movie becomes a real gem. I love this movie, a strange love story, not about twenty-one beauty. Rather a story of sixty years of beauty that was twenty years old It's a good story, well written, and performed amazingly well with the wonderful World War II band music that was thrown in. There is also a pleasant surprise for those who love the Scottish castle. It made me smile and ready to watch again, which I added a few times before I opened. I highly recommend it.
