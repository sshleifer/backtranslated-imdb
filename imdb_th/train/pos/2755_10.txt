When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it was something. "Love your neighbor" In general, the more the film continues The performance was excellent from both actors in that direction. Excellent. Unusual stories. Crying out for the first time in my life for a movie The real thing must be in a serious video game. 11 out of 10
