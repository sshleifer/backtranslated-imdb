Halloween is a movie that I have to go out and watch every time it is that day of the year. I still watch it sometimes when it's not a holiday !!! This movie is great. Jamie Curtis is an actor that I never stopped loving. This movie may be old. But the story line keeps me there every time, and the acting is absolutely fantastic !!! Even though I didn't see the remake, I felt that it wasn't all that necessary. I think Rob Zombie should never have disfigured this classic. The thing that killed me was knowing that someone saw the remake without hearing from Original. I'm angry. Just think about this !!!!!! This movie Great and it will be remembered in history as a classic.
