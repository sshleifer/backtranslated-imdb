I think it's a very smart movie. I'm very satisfied with it and can't 'Request more. Actually, I own the movie because I didn't return it to someone ... which I should do, but I really want to keep it because I really enjoy it. In addition, the fact that I do not own too many foreign movies and this is the first time Now I like Finnish things personally, so that adds a lot of fun to me. But overall, it's nice to see. However, if you don't try to understand Finnish or read a bit of subtitles, this film isn't right for you. <br /> <br /> 9/10 Of course.
