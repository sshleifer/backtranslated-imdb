After you see Vertigo, then watch the Bell, the book and the candles that are created within a few months of each other. <br /> <br /> My favorite Kim Novak movie, second to Picnic, is ranked third. The three performances were fantastic. Vertigo was the best of all. <br /> <br /> They came to Kansas Prairie, nowhere near Salina, Kansas in the 1950s to shoot a picnic. <br /> <br /> Bell's music score, Book and Candle. I believe it's one. In Alex North's Perfect for this bit of comedy, <br /> <br /> After Vertigo, Stewart and Novak make this funny movie fun to notice the amazing difference. <br /> < br /> Worth the time of my youth Novak Greta Garbo
