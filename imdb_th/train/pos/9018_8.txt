Although there is a low-key version in this country and not interested in other countries (the 'R' rating in America can't help - honestly, just because HBC uses C-word!) This is a really good piece. But it can be overcome by playing the two leaderboards. <br /> <br /> It's easy to win objections just because you are playing a physical or mental disability (Daniel Day-Lewis, Jeff Freeman Rush, Dustin Hoffman, etc.) and Helena Bon Turin - The Carter could not capture the decline of MND but physical, vocal and emotional ruthless drive offset entirely. In fact, almost all of her performances were performed through her eyes. (And what eyes!) This is a clever reversal from the actress who quickly canceled her English reputation and became a prolific figure. The prize must be followed, of course, even if it is not for this good performance. <br /> <br /> Branagh, who never felt his best in the movie (Except maybe 'Hamlet' and his play is diluted too Although he appears here, his other characters play with men who hate themselves, ultimately insecure and cute, with the subtlety that he has never shown and shows both intelligence and depth. In short, we believe him as much as we can't believe that he is Frankenstein as a priest in the 'proposal' as a lawyer in 'Gingerbread Man' as well as Andrew in "Peter's friend." This is his best work. - Why did he not produce the product sooner? <br /> <br /> As a movie, it seems to be more on television and if there are no stars. A lot. But it was a pleasure to see this pair showing their socks like this and I waited anxiously over them. (Although not 'Love's Lab's Lost' ...) 8 out of 10, but Branagh and HBC get 10 out of 10
