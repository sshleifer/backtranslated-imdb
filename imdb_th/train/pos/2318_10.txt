I saw this movie as a teenager and immediately identified with the image of Reese Witherspoon of Dani Trant, a 14-year-old tomboy in the Louisiana countryside, about 1957. She felt that she wasn't as beautiful as Maureen. Feeling the place in terms of her conservative conservative parenting At seventeen years, Court Foster (Jason London), the son of her mother's close friend (Gail Strickland), moved to the next door. Dani experienced her first experience while Court enjoyed her friends. Dani succeeded in his first kiss from him. But as soon as he saw Maureen, he fell on her head and left Dani. The sister's close ties are severely broken from the booming competition which will deepen when the court dies in a tragic accident. Then the girl will be made aware of each other's needs. <br /> <br /> Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are perfect as dear parents, trying to maintain the balance of their daughter's body at the same time. Family together Beautiful movies and great soundtracks with Elvis Presley, The Platters and many more contribute to the atmosphere of the movie in an amazingly simple time. <br /> <br /> New era movies To touch
