This film is another story that can be said that it is Madhur Bhandarkar. I'm not sure why he has a passion for showing children 's moles *** ion and the g * y concept for Indian movie audiences. But I found that those scenes were really disgusting! There is something new. It is a great work that Bhandarkar has collected, which shows him the story of an entertainment reporter played by the famous actress in the movie Mr & Mrs Iyer. What makes this movie different is that it also covers the story of People with this reporter interact with or become friends, such as roommates, colleagues, movie stars, models, wealthy people and others. Her newspaper <br /> <br /> Cool was clear: it was a good performance from Mrs Iyer, she is likely to be observed for this role. She acts as a recruiter. But shines in them She looks less elegant and beautiful in this film. But then, entertainment journalists shouldn't overtake the people they say, right? Judgment: Madhur has created another great movie that brings social issues to great strength. However, this film lacks concentration and no one is sure that the director is trying to convey what <br /> <br /> Does he try to show us the charm and glamor of the rich? Or is he trying to show us the life of an entertainment journalist and conflict with the life of a real crime reporter? He is trying to tell us how the government and the rich control the media. Or he is trying to show the problems of child abuse and folk g * y. Other concepts that apply, including unwritten rules that young women have to sleep with the director or co-star if they He wants to go to Bollywood. <br /> <br /> He also said that Their work soon after and turned to violent measures by marrying many elderly people, etc. He also spoke of unhappy women and children destroyed in wealthy families. <br /> <br /> All of this works for me. Too complicated for the average movie watcher who wants to relax from daily work.
