It's so exciting! After I saw "La Roue" this afternoon, a short film about light, I think this is true! This is a very pleasant thing and one of the most charming images I saw this year. It's even more amazing because it was the first radio to communicate and made a wonderful picture of the 30s. It is full of lovely songs and emotions that it dances fast and most importantly, it makes me happy! Obviously it's not difficult to pull a lottery ticket that a male actor is looking for. But the rhythm is exciting and the film is amazingly entertaining until I don't even think about it again. There are many funny movies that are hilarious and I think it is better than Marx Brothers. It may be the greatest joke of that time Quite perfect
