I am a big fan of both actors and singers, especially Gackt. And when I discovered this movie and watched the first example, I just thought that this was nonsense after a long wait. I watched it eventually and this is a comment. My .. .. <br /> <br /> I think everyone knows the story and will not talk about it instead of my first applause to perform. In general, Japanese movies aren't great. show It was great and entered it. Especially, Gackt reflected his character, emotion and change quite well. I liked many of his scenes, both amazing and amusing. For HYDE's part, his performance was good. But he was deliberately behind In order to be his character throughout the film, I don't like some movies, especially light and color. But due to the low budget, it still has a great time But the real gem of this film has some stories, but it's okay for me and the friendship theme of this movie is Sometimes, the development and the touch are really good. Occasionally, the story points to see a cruel world where no one gets life insurance and with a memorable death scene it reflects this story with images and notes that Interestingly, in addition to this movie, the movie Interwiew with the Vampire, played by the most beautiful American actor (not handsome, beautiful), actually Moon Child can be seen as a brother. Interwiew, but it is original by itself. The only problem with MoonChild is quite slow. Sometimes I am a Japanese movie fan and I am used to it. But it didn't change MoonChild with useless scenes or characters But all this movie is really good and has a lot of emotions, sometimes for actors / singers. Hope to see their other movies in the future and I recommend this to everyone who likes vampires - action-sci-novels and romantic movies 8/10.
