This film is the first trilogy of the three Miikes Society and a great start to the trilogy. The movies in the trilogy have a unique connection, and these themes are clear in all of his films. If you look close enough, the Shinjuku Triad Society is a cop trying to prevent his brother from being involved in a rather outsider gang. A lot of people try to fight to the top of Tokyos yakuza. The brother of the boy is a lawyer and the gang of three needs more help while the movie is black. to This movie is happening in a bad environment, so it is violent and difficult. Miike can do worse. But because this movie is serious, it makes you feel very heavy In addition, there are also many wrong sex, most of which are homosexual. This film has many ways that are generally gangster movies. But with great driving and true courage If you've watched the remote movie of the Miikes (Ichi, Murderer, Fudoh, etc.), this is worth checking out because it is a compromise between his aggressive style of acting in those movies and his more serious side. As seen in other films of the trilogy And as always with Miike, there are at least two scenes that you won't forget. (See and think which one is right for you) <br /> <br /> 8/10
