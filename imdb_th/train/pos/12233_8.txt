Astronaut Steve West (Alex Rebar) and his companions made a space mission that saw them fly through Saturn's rings. His companions were killed immediately. But they seem to be lucky Steve returns to the world continuously as a broad band of human pulp; While he became a savage assassin, dissolving every step he was pursued by his friend, Dr. Turr Nelson (Burr DeBenning) <br /> <br /> This story is often very funny. And situations that have to walk around - it's hard for me to believe that laughter is not intended It seems to me to be the type of effort in the low budget category from '50 and 60 'and as such it is an amazingly entertaining movie. The order with the nurse is just hilarious. We were also treated in separate screens that didn't add anything. But still a remarkable thing. <br /> <br /> Writer / director William Sachs deserves credit from this smart idea. His slim character is certainly memorable. I think his pacing will go a little bit, some scenes (like the scene with an elderly couple) walking a little longer. But in the end he handed out the stuff that was hard, opaque. Form B with horror. The important point is special fun. <br /> <br /> Arlon Obers's song is shaky and fun. (But still stupid at certain times) and Willy Curtis's movies sometimes create great images Which brought me to the wonderful and reliable makeup effects of Rick Bakers, which is the center of the highly regarded film until the last melting step. <br /> <br /> The Rebar is under Under the heavy makeup for almost all movies (Sachs also received praise from the film as well) and doing what he had to do well. DeBenning was created to be a rather scary and stupid hero and Ann Sweeney was not as hot as his wife. But Myron Healey, Michael Alldredge and Lisle Wilson are very helpful It is worthwhile to see the villagers like Cheryl "Rainbeaux" Smith (make a clear nudity) Janus Blythe (from Tobe Hoopers' "Eaten Alive" and Wes Cravens' The Hills Have Eyes') and even the director. Jonathan Demme, in part <br /> <br /> This is a midnight movie that is highly entertaining, with enough blood, chills and laughs to rate it as something worthy for Sci-Fi enthusiasts / Low quality horror everywhere <br /> <br /> 8/10
