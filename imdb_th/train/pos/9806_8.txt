I agree that the capital should be on DVD. I watched this program accidentally in 1994 and fell in love with Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was good to see Americans working overseas in London in the financial industry for change. I love Rolf in this role and love other roles I didn't believe that the show had only 13 episodes. I like William Armstrong as Hudson's charming, charming friend in the series. When they broadcast this program in the New York metropolitan area, it is always late at night or at closing times. Show less than an hour I feel that this list should continue. But changing the casting in the second season makes the show less interesting. I am not interested in Sylvia but miss Julia Phillips-Lane. Actress last season I feel that this program has a chance and often it works. It shows that Americans love and choose to live in London. The American character is not arrogant or trying to defeat an English partner. I like the fact that they try to make the actors more universal than they are all English. I like to watch Julia Ormond in the first role. I feel that this show will be longer. Sometimes I feel that the sample takes longer than the show in less than an hour. They can send actors to New York City and it will be popular in America.
