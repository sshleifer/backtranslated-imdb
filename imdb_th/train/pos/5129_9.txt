I can see why this film has been nominated for Best Live Action Short Academy, because of its expertise. Even if you don't like the Blues specially (but for me, it sounds like a lot of jazz), you can easily appreciate this movie. It has done very well. But for my life, I can't see why director Gjon Mili only directed a single movie - this story. In other words, the movie was nominated and the director has not been promoted. For black actors, I can understand this, not making their career turn into high gear because of the unfortunate that most white societies are indifferent. If you watch this movie if you don't enjoy the previous part, especially skipping forward about the 5:50 mark - which it picked up a lot. When the woman stopped singing and the actors began to improvise, the rhythm was a little better.
