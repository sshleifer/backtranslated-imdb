The first mystery is to guess what the original movie of Welles is. This is a real adventure - to see an incomplete skeleton and use forensic science. Imagine the beautiful woman that it used to support. <br /> <br /> If you do, you'll see and experience one of the best movies. The mystery that once The storytelling is very common: a simple diversion. The jealous husband is a red herring. <br /> <br /> The more amazing thing is the placement of Welsh stories in the artificial eyes that see the world. Gloomy. The first real noir But it is darker It's not a distorted world unless you miss the camera. What we see immediately is that someone who creates a vocabulary that will become normal. <br /> <br /> For all the celebrations, Kane is successful because of the drama and the wonderful story. The camera's eyes were shocking, but the Welsh experiment would go from there to explore Shakespeare's mysterious storytelling and self-reference. With this eye, both Othello and MacBeth began in this period and I think they are part of the vision. The same vision as this story. <br /> <br /> Noir feels that this depends on the idea that people are not responsible for their lives - they are controlled by random factors in their lives. environment So in telling this story, Wales must make the environment a character. Many characters are suspects of mystery. <br /> <br /> So we have a famous light, blocking and angles that we know. (And since seeing countless times) and we have deliberately closed scenes: parks, yachts, picnic areas, aquariums, harbors, courtrooms, Chinese theaters and theaters I am sure that the things that the savage were cut were many 'external' stories and not related to the characters. But with these strange environments, <br /> <br /> The solution to my problem is that the theater is doing. Among the environment of other characters presented as suspects In other words, the management of the Irish Black (Which we know from the record and one scene printed in the Union Hall is a novelist who wants) not: the power of human conspiracy (Park or civilization, courtroom models) or nature (picnic models or civilized aquarium models) <br /> <br /> Instead, it's a matter of intention by God for entertainment. This is a self-reference of what Welles is doing: bring these people (including himself) into hell for their own selves, which is emphasized by the Beijing Opera series that is based on Wales And of course, leading to a shelter that is a straightforward environment with awareness. <br /> <br /> More about self-reference: Of course, there is a conscious opinion about his relationship with him. soon But I believe there is a strong subconscious opinion about the environment in which he works in the studio. Of course, Wales was too tight and in the same manner as his character. And that caused the murder to occur in this movie, leaving the dead body rotten at the beginning of this comment. <br /> <br /> Poor Rita came from China that is linked to all things. Chinese cinema Expected to be raped from the top. Loss of women All superior environmental investments
