This movie is good It's not the best way to measure the good kung fu CG, but it's quite good. The first thing, the first thing is really good. The whole idea of ​​the gods vs dealing with the ultimate gods is a great story. My problem is too many characters! It's very confusing when they change the scene! Unbelievable special effects! The fight scenes are very fast and complicated. This movie is made from every computer. The performance was great as expected from the famous player Ekin Cheng, causing the lonely character Zhang Ziyi to do nothing for me in this movie. I think she will have a bigger part. But she made one fight scene The bad guys, the whole army of skulls and blood clouds are all scary. The music is also excellent. For me, this story deserves at least a mini-series, not a single movie. There are too many stories to be crammed in 2 hours. Maybe if there is a book or something, I can track all the characters and details. This movie sacrifices the story of the integrity of the action. I recommend Storm Riders for more every day.
