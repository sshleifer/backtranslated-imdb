This is a good movie that has a powerful love and redemption substance. I love changing my brother and the impact of the disease on my family. Perform well and monitor well If there is any defect, I must say that this story shows that the suburban families generally and their problems again. What about people with every cultural background? I like to watch movies that show all these cultures - like in real life. However, this film has increased in terms of value and understanding of how the disease can bring people closer to the creator. Love movies and it makes my tears
