Beat Street, although not "real" in some aspects, like Wild Style Is a film that guarantees to draw the heart of everyone who is proud of the culture of the city sample / music from DJs and Electro-Club culture. Br /> <br /> Even though I am Accept that sometimes the dialogue is quite amazing, you can not help. But felt the character and ultimately "Hope you are there" for the start of hip hop culture in New York. The city in the early eighties, the b-boy fight scene at the Roxy nightclub (real-time competition, real-time between legendary Rock Steady Crew and NYC Breakers) is important for the hip-hop fans. Hop like the classic album See the movement of some breakers in a slow motion, if possible, to appreciate all the sporting and quirky expertise of B-boy / B-girl. Appreciated due to Zulu !!!
