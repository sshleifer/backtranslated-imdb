OK, this movie is very cool. I don't think it's the best movie ever created. But it was fun My brother and I still show the scene for a while and will pull the movie out of the closet, sometimes blowing out the dust and opening up the fun all the way to the end This is a movie that must be forgotten and simultaneously enjoyed. The decision is the victory of Robot Jox.
