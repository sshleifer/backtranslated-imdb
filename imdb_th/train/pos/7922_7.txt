In this horror film, the Cold War paranoia, the 50s, the American Reagan era and the high school movie Adam Arkin played the role of Tony, the rising star of the Full Moon Heights in 1950. (Ed McMahon) travels to the Communist Romania and while he wanders the road one night he is bitten by a werewolf. When he returned to America, he could not control his wild animals and encourage fun to kill. Frustrated, he escaped from the city. A decade later, immortal Tony returned to town and enrolled again in high school. He still couldn't control his changes and the townspeople and his friends realized that he wasn't a human. Everything ends during the great football game of the school. <br /> <br /> I expect this to be one of those movies. 'Terrible, it's good' from the early 80s, but I was surprised that this movie is really funny. Actors including Kenneth Mars as Roz Kelly's stubborn coach as Tony's former firefighter, Demond Wilson as a bus driver and Alan Arkin is a strange doctor While watching this movie, I was impressed with the writing and humor that was similar to 'Family Guy'. 'Full Moon High' has nothing in common and has never been seriously done.
