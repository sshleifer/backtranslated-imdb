I'm shocked. Shocked and shocked by the IMDB users, 428 people who voted for me earlier have not given a score higher than 7. 7 ?! ?? - That is C! If I can give FOBH 20 I will be happy to do it. This movie is ranked high on the Pantheon of modern comedy alongside Half Baked and Mallrats, one of the most hilarious movies of all time. If you know _anything_ about rap music, you must see this !! If you don't know anything about rap music - learn something and watch it! The comparison with 'Spinal Tap' failed to appreciate the genius of the movie that is unique. If you like Bob Roberts, you'll love this. Watch and vote 10!
