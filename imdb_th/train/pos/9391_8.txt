Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh stole the performance here. Cage and Boyle are good, but what makes this neo-noir juice is creepy and violent and the pride of Hopper's JT Walsh br /> <br /> Delusions cause people to go astray. Dropped out of it <br /> <br /> I found a strange parallel in the film's opening scene when Kage walked into a trailer in Wyoming to work on a friend's drilling. He ... and the opening scene at Brokeback Mountain when the characters do the same thing! But that's another story. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hopper is his best person here ... cocky, aggressive, aggressive, aggressive, aggressive and explosive. JT Walsh (RIP) is great, like Same as the man who has a dark past trying to live lawfully (almost good). <br /> <br /> There are only 4 real letters of note here except hard. Deputy Director in Red Rock, Wyoming The first twist started from the beginning and then was a neo-noir adventure in a small, quiet town. Satisfied 8 points.
