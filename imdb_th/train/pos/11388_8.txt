If I can remember, Ira Gershwin, the lyricist and brother of George, presented Gershwin's catalog for this film. In many ways, it was a 50s movie by Freed Unit at MGM and Directed by Vincente Minelli with the help of Gene Kelly. Of course, <br /> <br /> Gershwins is the greatest of Every Broadway musical team But in my opinion, George is one of the greatest American composers of that time !!! Of course, Gene Kelly is one of the two greatest male dancers in the movie. (Can anyone guess?) And I don't think he will have any suspicious actors. But I think the rest of the actors need some explanation: Oscar Levant is a famous person in his era and as a true friend of George Gershwin, he must be in this movie. He is a talented pianist and a talented composer, as well as a neurologist and hypochondriac Famous and here, as always, he played himself. <br /> <br /> Leslie Karon is not known at this time. The type of "gamin" French, a talented dancer, she never has beauty. Indeed, George Guétary, who played the role of Maurice Chavalier. Oh, I mean Henri Baurel is a Greek and not a Frenchman. But he is more than a Frenchman, as a layman, even though too young. <br /> <br /> Gene's voice can be used here. But Guétary has a much better sound device Although the genes are used more clearly elsewhere in "Singin 'in the Rain", where his character is calculated even though he shows himself as a heel sometimes (He is not for nothing The original Joey heel in Pal Joey, Broadway musical) I am not fascinated by his "I Got Rhythm" scene with children who do not appear to be as natural as intended in my opinion. <Br /> <br /> I also found that the character of Milina Nina Foch is quite annoying. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this film is the longest ballet at the end of the movie. Based on the title of the song, along with the set and the set in the style of The great French impressionist painter <br /> <br /> I find it hard to believe that Gene and Oscar are struggling artists and I don't think the music numbers will be held. As it should be, Gershwin's songs performed very well in this movie. <br /> <br /> The DVDs are made with good graphics. (When they support it) and the monaural sound is good but shallow
