In general, romp through the reality of Cheech and Chong, which includes drugs, singing, drugs, cars and driving, even more drugs, pee Wee, aliens, gasoline, washing, stand up, funny, drugs, surprises and SPACE. COKE !! It is not linked or can be like in Up in Smoke, but still incredibly funny without being bizarre like Nice Dreams. There are some classic scenes that include open scenes where they get gas for cars and Drive to work Also funny is the song of Cheech (Mexican-American) and Chong's track. Another notable scene is the welfare office scene with Jones. (Human voice) from the Police Police series and the old man laughing. In conclusion, this is a good track to up in smoke and quite able to watch when conscious or not. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
