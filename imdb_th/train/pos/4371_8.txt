When Braveheart first came out, I was fascinated and recognized as one of the most crazy fans in this movie. When Rob Roy came out, I was amazed and even though I enjoyed this movie, I didn't think it would be a great movie. However, over time, my appreciation for Rob Roy has increased and my enthusiasm for Braveheart diminishes. Braveheart is definitely an excellent entertainment. But there are also shortcomings The most important thing in my view is the indescribable depiction of Robert Bruce, who is undoubtedly the greatest king of Scotland. Another is the historical inaccuracy of the film, which has caused the film to deteriorate in proportion to many historical distortions. I think I still feel worried about the fact that it is in this movie that is visible. (At least me) looking back at the beginning of Mel Gibson's humanity is clearly visible for the first time. In contrast, Rob Roy has continued to grow over the years. Partly because it helps to avoid the most mistakes that I think in Braveheart, but because Rob Roy is like a fine wine that grows and is more complex in each view.
