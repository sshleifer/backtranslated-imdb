The first time I saw this movie came back in 1980 as a young boy. My father really saved it from the TV. I have to watch more than 20 times before releasing the last DVD. <br /> <br /> Of course, I bought and watched the DVD and was shocked by the changing dialogue. In the first version, which I still have in the VHS, the mood of the movie. Thank you. The conversation is really dark. However, the new version with Van Der Beek et al is more than a cartoon. <br /> <br /> If you want to use it in another way, it's like watching the original version of Akira with the dub Alphabetical Japanese translation <br /> <br /> I have never complained about the story and the quality of the animation does not deviate from this story. But it caused the question of Posts in his movies .....
