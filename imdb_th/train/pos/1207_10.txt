Still love it 17 or more years after the first time I saw it, in fact I discovered that I had lost my copy of this and felt very sorry. Although it is not related to the original (Which is a child I have never noticed and is an adult that I do not care about) This is what the cartoon * should * be like, dark enough to be interesting and light enough that everyone will be happy I am very glad that my parents raised me in this kind of story more than the cartoons that we see today that teach our children. This song is wonderful and stuck in your head forever ... I downloaded the soundtrack. All at one point or another
