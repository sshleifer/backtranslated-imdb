This is a lovely story of being fascinated by the expulsion of guilt. <br /> <br /> Mathis, on a lonely night, walks in Riga (?) Through a woman on the wrong side of the bridge. He passed without any words, splashing in the water, followed by a cry for help, only to make him act. And then too little and slow. <br /> <br /> The film recorded his efforts in finding more information about that woman. On the troll bar in the area, he found her purse. He lives more and more together, changing his "appearance" when his passion increases. He must do the right thing. In a remarkably filmed dialogue with "The ex-boyfriend", his subordinates, forced Alexej to face the guilt that the couple felt. <br /> <br /> For a long time, the soundtrack was heavy to emphasize the guilt of a cute film noir with twists. lovely Good indie finish
