Halloween is one of the movies that makes you feel deeply! I think it's the most horrible movie of all time. Michael Myers is the best boogeyman! He was so scary! What makes Halloween special is that there is no special effect that you can tell how the computer is moving. But makes people scared of hell for 25 years and the film still has the same effect as in '78 <br /> <br /> It's about Michael Myers boy. He killed his sister at the age of 6 and many. The next year escaped the mental institution. Dr. Sam Loomis was behind him and would do anything to get him back because he explained that Michael "... pure evil, darkest eyes, demonic eyes" Michael is doing a mission to kill Laurie the younger. In other people, played by Jamie Lee Curtis, he's new to her children on Halloween while her friends went out partying and of course we know the rules and understand them! But Laurie may have a chance because she is a virgin; D <br /> <br /> Halloween shows respect for many psychopaths. We have another character, Sam Lomis and Jamie Lee Kuri. Janet Leigh's daughter Halloween is a great movie that destroys the boundaries and allows you to lock the door, close the window and turn off the lights! "They will get you! They will get you! "Halloween, the ultimate horror movie! <br /> <br /> 10/10
