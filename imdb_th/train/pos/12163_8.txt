I found this film rather expressing the way the main characters disappear. But more clearly about some things in life than those who mock him (For example, his roommate) <br /> <br /> He was tortured and You like to watch him being tortured! It has a distorted side that is scary. But we are all happy to see him out of suffering again. <br /> <br /> It's like the characters in the game or the people passing through the land of the mine or against the enemy We like to watch him under the attack of sniper or fire. But at the end, we are happy to see him survive ... <br /> <br />
