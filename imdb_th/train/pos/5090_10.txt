I love this movie Great stories and good actors and movies It tells the story in a way that I can easily understand and pay attention without falling asleep. I want to know where I can find the soundtrack. I can't find anywhere. Please email me if you know I can get the soundtrack. In addition to not being able to find the soundtrack that I think this movie is interesting, Swayze did very well. I think this is his best work. His past movies are available. But this film tells the story of change This will go down in history as one of the best TV movies ever aired. Congratulations to the producers and writers of the great work.
