This is a unique and distinctive movie. It is powerful with characters that are highly developed. A very good performance <br /> <br /> I love the director who is not afraid to ask the audience to think ... <br /> <br /> Bret Carr dares to look inside. Ask questions and Dig under the surface The nature of this film requires viewers to look inside as well. It may take courage to do this. I can see that some people who have close thoughts may find it quite disturbing. However, I found that it stimulated more thought than just entertainment. <br /> <br /> Bret Carr is a original filmmaker with a vision. I want to know what he will do next. <br /> <br /> See him.
