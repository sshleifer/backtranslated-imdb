In fact, I found this movie 'interesting'; Finally, one thing that is worth my time to watch and rent. It's true ... Some scenes are above emotional feelings, shouting, etc. But any movie that doesn't focus on the agenda type or 'ax to rain' is almost none! What surprised me is that I read other reviews made by S.Fran inspectors on other review sites. But found that his negative reviews represent a more accurate explanation of his criticism Not the movie at all Anyone who looks at this movie will know that it is good to introduce family and friends. There is no chase. Yes! Being a "family" in Italy is my own. I can relate to the environment that is fully displayed on the screen. The movie has a thrust as well. It is what real life can live in that environment. Good movie
