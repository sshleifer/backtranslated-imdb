In general, it's hard to evaluate these cut-and-paste movies. Some groups may be quite good, while others can reduce overall product rankings. For example, in this scene, every girl in the doctor's office is very exciting ... one of the best viewing history. If so, there is a segment of Asia ... This woman is always fun. And stories that combine together are interesting ideas The alternate scenes that close the offer are not bad as well. Technically, the production cost is quite high.
