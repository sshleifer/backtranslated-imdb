I had to go through the list of Oscar winners and was surprised to see that the film beat Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid to get the best picture in 1969. After seeing it, I was not surprised. It's a way ahead of time related to movie style and using Flashback to help develop Joe Buck's character. <br /> <br /> The most amazing thing for me is the depth of Joe Buck's character in a short film. I think Voyt caught the innocent and cruel when provoked. Two scenes that really touched me after he stopped working in the cinema and when the old man persuaded him. I think when he looks into the mirror, he tries to see if he is someone who is doing or is going to do something horrible. <br /> <br /> I think it's a great decision for Hoffman. Otherwise he may be typecast after graduation However, this is considered good all the time for a reason.
