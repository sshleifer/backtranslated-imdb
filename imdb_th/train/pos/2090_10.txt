Zigfield "It doesn't show the ability she has in addition to her exotic beauty, but in" Good Earth "she shows that she can really show! Her beauty was erased and she had no great outfit as well. Someone said that she didn't show the true emotion in this movie like hell. Her character, Olan, was a shy and shy woman with inner strength. She is a quiet part of the film, with only her eyes and body that will convey her emotions.
