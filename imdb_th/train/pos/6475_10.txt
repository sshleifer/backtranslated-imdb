It has only 2 episodes in 5 episodes, but I can tell that this is one of the best things I've ever seen. That is on a television, silver screen, or even in real life. <br /> <br /> As a writer, it's very good, almost unmanned! As an audience, it was so fun that I was annoyed when I went through a fortnight instead of Monday to Friday. It is clear that these negatives are really positive. <br /> <br /> I'm a modern person who has turned my back on a TV series. Compared to movies, TV series seem to be old, quite tame and generally boring! "Five Days" brought the TV drama to the 21st century. So for me, at least it changed my mind to watch it.
