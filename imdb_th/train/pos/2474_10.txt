There are many things that conflict with this movie for me before I watch it. <br /> <br /> First of all, I'm a typical high school kid in Shakespeare's class that I don't like. Half of! Shakespeare won't be over UNINTELLIGIBLE Without letting me focus on almost all of his encoded plays ... encoded in his most difficult language .... and I still don't get much benefit <br /> <br >> seconds It's 4 hours long! I never thought it would be good. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you something. This movie is very good. I'm really beautiful. I understand all the languages ​​that are currently showing. Now the script tracks the characters in this film, which is the same script that I can't understand in Shakespeare's class. And here I open my heart and understand it I doubt myself while watching a movie almost! But lo and behold ... when he had done it, and after that Shakespeare came to life So this model of hamsters showed me that Shakespeare is a true expert. When I saw it on a large screen, especially in the popular movie format with a high budget. (Ready to shoot beautiful movies and photographs) and show amazingly by Brannagh and actors ... I understand what happened What was said Excellent and passionate language It helps to make the mood more raw ... when the words cannot explain something, perhaps Shakespeare's words can <br /> <br /> I still hold to this day at the fist of the North Star ( Animated, English dub) The greatest movie ever created No movies for full entertainment But for a movie that would come close to removing the fist from that position (which Hamlet made - approaching) is truly amazing ... it's not a movie. It's an event. <br /> <br /> The more amazing it makes me impress, Shakespeare. Wow. There is powerful power. One of the most powerful and rare movies there. <br /> <br /> This thing has received two hundred billion stars from infinity stars. Yes, <br /> <br /> Anyway, all the children who are there in Shakespeare's class ... forget it. You are wasting time. You have to watch the play. Justice will only happen to them.
