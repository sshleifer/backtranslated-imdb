Bring this movie to do what it is not a remake, but a completely different approach to the same concept. It's not epic like the original. But a popcorn thriller The sight is incredible. Everything else is ok. <br /> <br /> For what it is, I think this movie is great. But I like everything Burton does. People need to stay calm and stop acting as if it were the end of the film world. / This story shouldn't be remake and not <br /> <br /> The ending looks cool.
