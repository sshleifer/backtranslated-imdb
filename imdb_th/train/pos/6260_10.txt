This is the spiritual stimulation! I am an Iranian and lived in the 21st century. I do not know how such a large tribe lived in this condition at the time of my grandfather! <br /> <br /> You see that today or even in 1925 on the other side of the world, women or babies can provide everything for him or her, clean and on demand, but 80 years ago People began to live to have more grass. It is really interesting that these Persians had problems finding sheep pastures. But they lost their flocks along their way. <br /> <br /> I praise the Americans who came to this tribe.
