/ * Slight spoiler * / <br /> <br /> Go back before Evangelion will be built before Hideaki Anno will be the idol name and house name for many anime fans and Before Gainax reached the fan status With only the Wings of Honneamise produced by Gainax at that time and shorts or the famous Oticon course, Gunbuster has a difficult task to follow. It doesn't make it easier for yourself by choosing the type that has been done countless times. Space Opera <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Gainax decided to bring it into six OAV parts (straight away. At the video), this series makes the series bigger than possible, if it is made into a movie. This also helps to prevent it from being too boring and too long with a pointless battle and many fillers along the way. In addition, they also tried clearly to see clearly from the test space opera used in Macross or Gundam and many other popular space opera. <br /> <br /> For one show, the show started out pretty. With Noriko in Okinawa High School for Navigation Noriko is the daughter of a ship commander who died on the battlefield when she was a child. This made her life in an institution quite difficult because some of her classmates began to wonder if Noriko was a favorite of teachers. At first it was a comedy that focused on the characters and scenes of the school. Things changed quickly when the alien and Noriko and Kasumi invasions were announced. (The best girl in the class) was chosen to help the gathered fleet. <br /> <br /> The central group of the Gunbuster area, focusing on drama and action. Two more characters were introduced and some parts of Noriko's past were dragged up again. In addition, threats from aliens are approaching every minute and presenting Gunbuster, the last hope of mankind. Wise As an Okada writer, he combines the principle of time extension to make things in the short-term, slow-moving time for those traveling at the speed of light. Which means Noriko may be part of a war that took almost a century to complete In addition, the main feature of this drama is the accent when Noriko sees her friend again when she returns to the base which is much older than her. Science may not be perfect. But it was presented in a convincing way, even with some SD science theater shorts, during the time when Noriko, Kazumi and their coaches gave a brief description of the scientific principles used in the series /> <br /> The animation for the series that was created in the 80s is definitely good. The design is an 80's retro style, of course, but it's charming The animation is reasonably fluent and the character's design is good, even if the costume is betrayed. <br /> <br /> Some of the obsession with Gainax fans will take full advantage. Later, Mechas, throughout the performance, was quite cool with the Gunbuster as the ultimate killing machine, strong and vast. The final episode made it all in black and white. Although generally believed (But not confirmed) that this is done for budget reasons But gives a different atmosphere to the series, which is perfect for the back. <br /> <br /> The music is a very general area, opera, fair, too crazy in a very general place and not worth buying. It is compatible with most series. But it is quite annoying sometimes Tanaka is not a really famous songwriter and another respectable series that he is working on is Dragon Half. If you think of 80s anime songs, you will know what will happen. <Br / > <br /> When the series goes on, the focus will gradually shift from drama to space. Opera is an epic battle. But in a way that the audience will hardly notice this. Step by step, the drama will be toned down and the battle will be on the front line. Even if there are no aspects When I saw Noriko and the crew fighting for the existence of mankind, and with the final battle to see some questions, it was presented to the audience about the position of the human race in the galaxy. And how far It can go to guarantee self storage. Although they did not receive an answer later, they still offered interesting food for thought. The final episode is extremely epic with a good ending. But quite predictable, although not ending all the endings, there should be many strange twists It's suitable for the series again. <br /> <br /> Gunbuster may sound like your first space opera, with alien invasions, big battles and private plays and bigger parts. That is But it was exceptionally well done for change Instead of combining the same elements for six consecutive episodes, the Gunbuster presents a change from a small drama to a large epic courage. According to the way we find characters that are interesting and well-drained, where each other's relationships have changed dramatically due to the time-extension phenomenon The list is written tightly, although it is likely to fail at some point. Incredible events and magical mecha attacks can be easily avoided. Overall, traveling the Gunbuster leads you to a very relaxed, sometimes sad, sometimes heroic. It may not destroy the scope and scope of the space drama genre. But at least making them slightly bent Highly fun classic anime But there is no defect. <br /> <br /> *** / *****
