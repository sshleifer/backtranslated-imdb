Everyone should watch this movie because each of us is broken in some way and may help us to realize 1) My life is not as bad as I thought and 2) the importance of raising children who need it. There are so many. Thinking that this movie is based on real people, makes us think deeply about life and the world there is and how it will be damaged, but corruption does not have to go to your home. We all have choices! I recommend this ... and while you are here, I want to throw in "The Color Purple" and "Woman, Thou Art Loosed" by TD Jakes. <br /> <br /> This is all. Movies made from life and allow us to see life
