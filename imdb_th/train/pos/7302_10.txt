As John Carpenter's writing on 'Halloween' is nearing its 30th anniversary, it has been spawning since the seventh season. There are new creations, imitations, and every year around Halloween. When they make the list of '10 most scary movies' that are always available It is quite remarkable for movies created with a budget of around $ 300,000 and is the highlight of the new generation of actors. I can keep going, but the big question here is: How does this movie happen today? And all I can say is amazing! <br /> <br /> Pros: Simple credit order But scary that creates emotions Memorable scores and bumps by director / co-author John Carpenter and Alan Howarth take great movies. The protagonist direction of Carpenter, who makes high-level suspense, gets a great shot and is careful not to show his villain too much. A good performance from an unknown actor, mostly good humor. Michael Myers is a scary and scary man. Many creepy moments that will be with you. Slow but steady pace and never drag. Unlike most other slasher movies, this movie is about fear and fear rather than blood and huge content. <br /> <br /> Cons: May not be as scary as now. Many stupid people really stand out. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: I want to start this topic by saying that this is not my favorite movie in the series. I know that is not a popular opinion. But how do I actually feel? Although it is a truly important movie that helps to reach a new generation of movies. And just because it has been remade for the new generation does not mean that it will be forgotten No way, no way. <br /> <br /> My score: 5/5
