Critics need to review what they learn as quality movies. I think critics have seen too many action movies and surrendered to the movie style of the matrix. Europa is a fresh air. Movies that have a lot of layers that the audience is not enough to understand or appreciate. This remarkable movie Lars von Trier shows that the old style of filming can create great movies and create plays and stress The rear projection effect he used during movie production and adding characters and emphasizing the conversations they had Other effects that he uses, such as color and black and white in the same scene as Hitchcock and the girl with a red cloak, attract attention and help increase the drama and meaning of the scene. The comment is great and has a hypnotic effect once again, focusing on the main characters in the scene and the action there. <br /> <br /> I can talk about the effect. More This film is its own category and adds reality to the drama of the movie. Movies to buy if you don't already have one, and another story that you should have <br /> <br /> 10/10 Don't miss this noir movie from one of the great movie directors.
