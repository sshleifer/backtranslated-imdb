It would not be better than this. The strong limitations in Mike Sullivan's expression could not be demonstrated in any other way. Tom Hanks gave the best performance of his career. Young Tyler Hoechlin drove the wheel of Emotion Playing basic characters for the story And veteran Paul Newman for one of his best performances for a long time. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a bold graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner. / Son with two applicants who are not suitable for the role Mike Sullivan has no father since he was a child, so John Rooney took him in. Even though the kind man Rooney is involved in the crime Therefore, Sullivan's debt is only a debt settlement that is related to himself in the business. Now Sullivan has a wife and two children and tries to keep his children safe. But at the same time rewarding his master The events that followed will test Sullivan's loyalty and accept the family's fate. <br /> <br /> With David Self's excellent adaptation, the conversation is not very often. The story unfolds in a beautiful scene in the 1930s (the great artistic direction by Richard L. Johnson and Nancy Haigh) covered with rain. (Snow on the ground) This drive is an excellent Irish score of Thomas Newman, especially when needed. <br /> <br /> But the most important technical element in this film is the beautiful photograph of Conrad. L. Hall This is the best movie I've ever seen. And i watch many movies The scene with Mike and Michael in the car. Entering Chicago is quite impressive. The image starts at the front of the car, revealing the mic (hangs) through the windshield. Later, he drove to the side of the car to see Michael (Hoechlin) waking up and looking out at his side window. As it continues, it will carry a side car and a dolly back around the car and reveal the magnificent scenery of Chicago in 1930. <br /> <br /> With the top performers and teams visit I'm talking about Sam Mendes, who launched his documentary film in 1999 with American Beauty (received many awards from him) before American Beauty Mendes worked as a theater director of the British theater. But decided that he wanted to continue saying that there was nothing new for him in the theater With only two movies, Sam Mendes marked himself in my book as one of the best directors. (In the list of about twenty-five) <br /> <br /> This film illuminates the genre with viewers and misses. And expresses the true theme wisely Photography, acting and stories are phenolic. I'm still waiting for the Gangster Gang of New York, but now I'm fully confident in saying that this is "Film of the Year" considering competition (signs, insomnia, minority report) is a strong saying.
