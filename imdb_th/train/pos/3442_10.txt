This film makes the idea of ​​intellectual intelligence and tries to analyze the story. I don't understand why people leave this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a Jerry Bruckheimer fan, this movie may not be right for you. <br /> <br /> This movie is Highly realistic. Actors and actors are examples. <br /> <br /> There is no special sound. So special side effects. <br /> <br /> The camera works very well. The music is great. I can't wait to get the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> It makes your body stun like Constant Garderner directly. There are special abilities, not followers.
