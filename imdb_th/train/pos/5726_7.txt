"The Grudge" is a popular Japanese horror film created by Shimizu. Shimizu knew he didn't do anything new, so he did what one wise man would do in his place: Forget the logic and focus on giving the audience a fun ride. He uses clich√©s commonly known as related to ghost stories. But Shimizu plays with these elements in an imaginary manner. Nonlinear narrative is not just a mechanism. But is an interesting way to present a sequence from a different perspective At the end, what I can say is that if the horror movie has only one purpose, it will scare the audience. (Just like the comedian makes people laugh.) The film succeeds in flying with color. I watched it in the cinema with the audience and it was fun to see the audience crazy about it. It may not play well in your living room.
