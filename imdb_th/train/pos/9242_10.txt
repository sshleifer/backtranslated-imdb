It's hard to rank this movie because you rate it for production or fun. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in 1988/89 or so when I was a kid and I regret that Said that it began to have a lifelong charm with the ninja The plot is quite scary and the show is quite bad. But there is something mysterious around the ninja in this movie which makes the atmosphere quite good The important thing is the fight scene, while the 'little' sparce is really good. <br /> <br /> I have to say it's better when I was a boy. Now I can see the staring point of nonsense Unbelievable In this movie But as a "Sitting to watch a little beer" The martial arts movie I'm not wrong at all. It gives and is better than the mountains of junk style "American Ninja" that was spun off in the 80s with hundreds of men in black suits <br /> <br /> In an interesting record, Dusty Nelson, writer and director Sakura Killers made another ninja movie under the banner of the movie Bonaire called "White Phantom". I don't know if this will be The sequel to Sakura Killers or not, but the Sakura family is one of the main features, including the same logo and similar stories, this time, including the White Ninja as well. There is little feeling in the atmosphere, but the fighting scene is great and frankly quite bad. <br /> <br /> So if you are a martial arts fan then blow it, kill a few hours!
