Books created from this movie are excellent. It took a while to experience Houellebecq's exotic style, but when I understood the emotions behind the writing, I was attracted to the world of sadness. In fact, there is no book that affects me a lot. This is not a good thing - it describes my personal struggle and makes my struggle difficult to accept. Houellebecq's insights were captured by Harel and the hero's indifference and indifference to the world that rejected him was a perfect picture. This is a movie that reveals the current society for the humble men in every horror movie. Hope that everything will change in the future But for now, we have to accept the rat race as shown in this movie. It may be best that Harel or Houellebecq won't create such geniuses again. One is enough for every human being.
