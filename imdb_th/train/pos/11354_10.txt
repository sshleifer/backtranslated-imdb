CitizenX (1995) is the answer to the developing world towards Silence of the Lambs, where `silence 'threatens the peace of mind. We' people 'are exhausted and we are sad. Chikatilo's translation of this drama is quite good. Thank you. Westernized friendship between two Rostov police who have become equal. CitizenX may argue with (!) The death penalty better than Kevin Spacey. The Life of David Gayle (2002) <br / > <br /> Humans are mammals. Machiavellian Which is in the limbic brain (lizard-logic), why two children who know better threw a kidnapped toddler Why are blood thirsty women shouting `li-lilililililii 'In the act of terrorism OBSCENE? - My word for this thing is `limbic control', lizard-motivated logic that will dominate the` enemy 'if you have the word' enemy '/' vengeance 'in Your vocabulary can be easily done. <br /> <br /> In the 1980s destroyed the Second World War Rostov (located at the mouth of the Don River near the Black Sea). There is nothing that suppresses Andrei Chikatilo's motivation for 'occupation. limbic 'from overcoming the layers of civilization The simple victims of Chikatilo (Jeffrey DeMunn) are often children who ride intercity trains for fun because they can't afford anything else. <br /> <br /> CitizenX reminds us of the refusal of Soviet rampage. The bureaucracy causes the death of the lamb. Rostov's serial killer travels free for almost 7 years after the police are arrested and released. <br /> <br /> The politics of fighting crime are dangerous to police forces everywhere. Although regular treatment will suffer from corruption around the world But in the West, the vote by politicians can create a competition between chronic agencies, which is preventing the response of crimes that are more cooperative. In the Soviet Union, CitizenX, however, the killer party of Viktor Burakov (Stephen Rea) is suffering from a dictatorial suppression system. <br /> <br /> Geoffrey DeMunn shows Chikatilo's inadequate psychic power with the wrong power. The perfect vague point in real life. Chikatilo has a lifelong experience of merging and evading capture. <br /> <br /> The chaseers, on the other hand, are like strange birds that have been blasting innocently. Perhaps with the design, Stephen Rea had a very strange performance as head of forensics. Rea's Russian accent is incompatible. And his Burakov is without humor and sullen compared to everyone. <br /> <br /> So it was Donald Sutherland who went with the picture Sutherland's Col.Fetisov, the boss. Burakov's, and at first, his only sponsor was Militiaman, who was too imprisoned with an elegant airline, bearing testimony to the decade of government officials. His awakening as a police-driven reason But still fascinated, became the most important ideology of the film. Joss Ackland returned again as a terrible avenger, the ideology of the Communist Party. Bondarchuk oversaw the investigation. Naturally, he overthrew the arrest of the most likely Communist suspect. In 1984, a man held a rope and knife in his pocket, which was expected to return home: Andrei Chikatilo <br /> <br /> He soon changed Burakov with another one in Moscow. The apparatchik detective Gorbunov (John Wood) insisted that the investigation now focuses on The most recognizable 'homosexual' scene of this film, sad and sad, occurred during the disruptive institution of Bondarchuk & Gorbunov: one stupid policeman reported seriously. "I wonder if it's a friend. It is adultery. I have drawn some parts' - Great Laughter <br /> <br /> 5 years after the body began to overlap in 1987, police tried to persuade criminals in the end. The only Soviet psychiatrist who is Dr. Dr. Alexander Buconovsky (Max von sod), which is called UNSUB `CitizenX '. After that, he noticed Fetisov & Burakov saying' ... You make a great person together. 'We agree. <br /> <br / > The steps that have been drawn throughout the decade and perfectly capturing Glasnost - `openness' inertia The difference with Perestroika - `Restructure '- probably not much bigger than this for the case. Although Chikatilo still prowling around the train station, the police plan is about to be produced. <br /> <br /> In 1990, K. A. Fetisov was promoted to the rank of general soon. His karma, Bondarchuk disappeared from the scene, allowing the investigation to be carried out in the end without political intervention. Staff, communication, public relations - suddenly all existed. On one night of the phone call, Fetisov received the FBI's chief forensic leader in the killing of the FBI's armed forces at Quantico, where Fetisov discovered. The officer would regularly rotate the murder to prevent psychological damage. /> <br /> Fetisov advises the forensic chief of the newly promoted now `Colonel 'Burakov from all these changes in his confession. An avalanche that turned into the movie's upstream scene. Fetisov is the most gentle apology I have ever seen in a movie: `Personally, I apologize to you and your wife deeply. I hope that one day you will forgive me with my ignorance. 'He almost whispered. <br /> <br /> The production of HBO, CitizenX is a movie with the highest caliber. (Only shot in the most impoverished part of Budapest) but Randy Edelman's fierce soundtrack is overwhelming - and often only one of the brutal brutality People who speak Hungarian will know Hungarian accents and accents. <br /> <br /> Chikatilo's true murder is a bleak picture of unusual behavior caused by character defects. This makes the murder seem to not happen outside the premises - but of course they are As President Kennedy warned us, "We are keeping the future of our children. <br /> <br /> CitizenX communicates perfectly that killing is too scary and rude to take revenge. The rapist continues to dominate; Serial killers kill to dominate The soldiers too `The possessor of Limbic 'This makes people bad. <br /> <br /> Warning - Spoiler: --------------------------- - ------------------ Real Andrei Chikatilo is the most known serial killer in the world. Sentenced to an offense, he was executed in 1992 in the form of a Soviet death sentence, all: one shot behind the head Stupidly, such a method destroys any possibility of studying deviant brain after death. <br /> <br /> Summary: ----------------- -------- ----------------------------------- The best result is protection. Killing is not a prosecution. Executions are a guarantee of social failure in learning from the complex reality of the deaths of victims when we send evidence of the history of the methods / why they died. The killer and not learning sorry if they die. <br /> <br /> Vengeance does not make the victim unskilled. The blood of the murderer is nothing better than against the attack. Too late. <br /> <br /> Revenge instead of regret is not justice for the dead - it is comforting (10/10).
