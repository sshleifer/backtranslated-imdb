One day I heard a few friends say, "Scarface sucked ... Some idiots tried to create another godfather in the early 80s." Now I listen to the fool / see CNN regularly. Stay away. Then my friend sent me a DVD and said "This is the No. 1 Pelican" and confused. I try it. This is the best movie ever. It is more true than all the shit about stolen car racing, which is too expensive for someone in that area to pay better than Al Pacino m203? I give it this ***** ***** from **** suitable for Al or GTA: Vice City fans
