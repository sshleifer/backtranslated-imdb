Eventually I bought and added a copy of "Show people" in my collection. I cannot comment on anything more than what the previous audience mentioned and the characters, plot and overall quality of this movie without having to repeat it. Seeing the appearance of many of the characters of the MGM silent star, it is worthwhile to watch both in and out of places. I like the scenes that Marion Davies played on his own and faced the main character of the film Patricia Pepoire. Make sure you read her lips because there is no name card indicating what she was saying when she saw Marion Davies. But it is something that affects "I don't think I like you." Put the corn on the tape and prepare to go back more than three quarters of a century in the history of filmmaking. Have fun!
