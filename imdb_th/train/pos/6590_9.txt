Clever and exciting, "The Invisible Man" stands out in the year 2000, among the sci-fi lineup, balancing the direction of the bizarre "Farscape" art and sometimes as a beautiful script The show is between "Law and Order" and "Doctor Who" on the faith meter. But there is no denying the fact that the character "I-Man" surpasses the caricature Even the characters that demonstrate predictability, such as the Keeper staff and Eberts, have been praised by Paul Ben-Victor and Vincent Ventresca. The chemistry has evolved and changed beautifully to make it stand out. Up by a team of writers and directors revolving around the door Effects have never been allowed to beat the plot, and sometimes science just insists on things that are truly unbelievable. The low score of the show is still entertaining and I have never seen the pilot episode stressful. Matt Greenberg and Sci-Fi should be praised and fans have the right to demand a comprehensive DVD release. Every time I meet the "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" marathon on Sci-Fi, I will roll my eyes and sigh, lamenting the excitement and possibilities of science fiction programs.
