The Master Blackmailer, created from the short story of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, about "The Adventures of Charles Augustus Miltonton" is the first story of Sherlock Holmes. Interesting and dark story This movie is quite boring and sad. But it's quite fun (Especially funny scenes) <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson try to reveal the identity of the illusion The blackmailer who destroyed the most famous British family by publishing a personal letter that destroyed their lives in some way Eventually they found that he was Charles Augustus Milverton, who was "Art dealers" after the tragic consequences for victims who cannot afford Our hero will have to help Lady Eva, the next Blackwell, who has to pay a lot more than she wants, otherwise her upcoming marriage will be canceled for sure. The scene in which Holmes and Watson steal Milverton's house is severe. Although this movie ends happily But the voice was sad and sad. <br /> <br /> Great performances from Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke (as usual) and Robert Hardy as the famous villain. (Most viewers may remember him. Today, when Cornelius's Fudge in the Harry Potter) Serena Gordon as Lady Eva Blackwell's Glen Norma West as Lady Shrewsbury Hempstead and Sophie Tom. Ridge as Agatha (Related scenes I gave it 1/2 1/2 out. ***** My only complaint is that there is not enough Lestrade inspectors (I hope they add in the scene of the short story that he gives the explanation of the burglar Two people, one of them, match Watson)
