This is the original Bugs Bunny cartoon. As a result, the character was still in transition - he was not drawn as he had been later and his voice was not correct. In addition, the chemistry between Elmer and bugs is slightly unusual. Elmer is a poor man who buys bugs from a pet store, has no guns or wishes on his part. However, although this is still a very fun movie The bugs in the early days were more brutal and brutal than later. In the next movie, he was busy with Elmer, Yosimite Sam and others because they started it - they were busy with rabbits. But in this film, he is like Daffy Duck in the late 30s and early 40s, which is an annoying jerk that loves others !! "The Anarchist", the true hero instead of the comic later Although this isn't the best Bug Bunny cartoon, but it's fun to watch and it's interesting to see how much he has changed over the years.
