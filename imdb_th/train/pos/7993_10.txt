There are many reasons to watch this movie: to see the fact that the Latin American whip about the kidnapping of police corruption at the continental level among the many realities that we rely on Latins. Denzel Wahington's performance is excellent. This man is still a great actor and it continues in this way. Dakota Fanning, just 10 years, the best actress has become and I congratulateThe rest of this film is a miracle. I have it in my collection. <br /> <br /> I hope they happen to those who create Hollywood to make movies like Complete in Venezuela, where they show our reality better about mistakes. They have movies that are played in the little Venezuelan territory. (For example They should do more like in Mexico. <br /> <br /> The song "Una Mirada" I hope it will come out on the soundtrack. It's great. My rating is 10/10
