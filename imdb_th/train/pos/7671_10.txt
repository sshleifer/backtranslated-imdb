Dr. Mordrid. How can I say that? Jeffrey Combs made it again. <br /> <br /> Anton Mordrid is on this planet for 100 years, waiting for the evil sorcerer Cabal to come. Killing Mordrid and Kabal had practiced together since childhood. Therefore, Mordrid knew all the secrets of Kabal. <br /> <br /> The movie that was a little confused at first But soon you will feel that it is part of the action I will not give up the ending, so go and see Dr. Morrid. <br /> <br /> I found this movie very fun because it had no violence or sexual scenes. The movie focuses on the story and that's what I like! I found that the best movies are movies that have passed. This is because you are obsessed with this matter. Dr. Mordrid is a very interesting movie! I give 20 out of 10 worth. <br /> <br />
