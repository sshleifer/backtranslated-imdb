Cinderella is one of the first films I have ever seen and for me it's no time at all. It is a cute movie with beautiful animation. My favorite animation scene is the dress-up scene - I just like those mice. The music is cute, not as good as Snow White. But they are happy to sing and remember Tchaikovsky. The dream is desire and this is love? Is excellent The character is also happy. Cinderella is very ideological and strong and I am very funny. The mentor did well as Lucifer. But I love the best stepmother. She is really evil when compared to the great character in the name of the guardian angel. It is true, this movie dragged a bit along with the comedy show of me. But it's really funny so I don't care I don't think it's an exaggeration, you don't exaggerate, right? It doesn't play on television. But the terrible sequel is made on Cinemagic on a regular basis. If you want the wonderful Cinderella adaptation, try using the wonderful Ever After or the luxurious Slipper and the rose, which is not as good as this. But no matter what you do, avoid the sequel that I have a mistake in ownership because you will thank me. 9/10 Bethany Cox
