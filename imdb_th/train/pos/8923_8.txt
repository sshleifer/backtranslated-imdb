The Blob is a sci-fi movie with a flick of B-movie in the 1950s. You might know this: two teenagers (Steve McQueen & Aneta Corsaut) saw the meteor hit the ground and when they went to find it, they ran to the man Old with something strange ... blob next to his arm They took him to the doctor's office and went to find out what had happened. From there, the droplets spread to eat everyone in its path. Special effects are wonderful fun like stories. There are many wonderful touches like police playing chess on the radio and police in other areas. It's not a masterpiece. But has a special place in its genre. Steve McQueen is very good. 8/10
