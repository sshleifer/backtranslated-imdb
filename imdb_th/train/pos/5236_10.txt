This sophisticated visual game presents the story inside the story. "The protagonist is the writer Bart Clive, who continues to fight with his new message? Which, at the same time, the screenplay that we are watching in the movie, is Bart playing as a screenwriter who writes a screenplay? The fight with Bart's message became a story, as well as the environment of the flats he worked and cared for his little girl. The friendly environment offers ample opportunities for illusory games involving a few light and cat areas. The simple outside world of the room is more complicated with the unstable dimension of messages that are influenced by filmmakers' interventions that appear on the computer screen. The ever-changing perspective makes the answer to the question complicated. What is truth and what is Maya? Which world is primarily observed and superior to the rest? Anything can be used as a basic orientation point in the lecture area.
