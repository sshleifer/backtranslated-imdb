I found it very amazing, even after many years we still talk about this movie! Obviously, this movie is not that bad or someone else won't even talk about it. I'm very happy with this movie and still do! I guess this movie is not for everyone. But of course it touches the hearts of many people. <br /> <br /> For those who think that this movie is "overrated" or "over-hyped" ... Okay, we only have public movies to thank. For this! lol * Do you see that it's not a critic / writer of articles that create "big" or "hit" movies with the general public? People make movies very successful. The Titanic is shocking. Let's face it, watching this movie has never been done before. At least there is no need for any special effects that are necessary to really capture the essence of the ship. This movie is very accurate, even James Cameron, it's time for your ship to sink in this movie, along with the REAL that sank on the fate day in April 1912. Even the silverware for good is matching! <br /> <br /> Let this movie be fun for you! Critics think that this movie will take a long time! When this movie really came out and people began to hear by WORD OF MOUTH (which is the best form of advertising for your mind) that this is a good / good / movie that should be worth watching then every People began to flock to the cinema ... not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more! So I wouldn't say that this movie is "overhyped" ... at least it doesn't like the buildup for MATRIX that reloaded or HULK is "overhyped". Ha! Critics do not even think that Titanic will make enough money to cover Cameron's giant movie budget that has to be used to create a mammoth. However, the money in the movie is taken care of by a budget of 200 million. and so on! <br /> <br /> Personally, I love this movie. However, this movie may not be suitable for everyone. Don't say that this movie sucks because of love! That's the most popular thing I've ever heard! Don't like movies because there is romance in it! Cute story The conversation should be better. But come face to face ... the real star of the movie is not Leo or Kate ... it's GIGANTIC Ship! I think every actor, including DiCaprio and Winslet, works well. It's not their best job. (I've seen better jobs from both), but it's not the worst job I've ever seen on the screen before. Let them rest! <br /> <br />
