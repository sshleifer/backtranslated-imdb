I think that is part of the reason that this movie was created ... and aimed at all of our gamers playing Nancy Drew's PC games. Recently, there are many movies that use video games and I Think this is one of them. <br /> <br /> So this movie doesn't follow any books. But it will follow some parts of the game I bought and played every game of Nancy Drew as soon as it came out. And such games come from HerInteractive and for "women who are not afraid of mice!" And some of these games have won the Parent 'Choice Gold Awards. > I also took my two stepchildren to see it and they loved it! 10 years old, then started playing her first game Nancy Drew, one day before I took her to watch a movie and she enjoyed playing the game a lot. She not only loves this movie But can't wait to go home to finish her first game and start a new game. <br /> <br /> My other daughter is only 7 and she loves This movie But she is too young to play a little game, but she enjoys watching her sister play sometimes to see what happens. <br /> <br /> This game is for children aged 10. More years. All games tend to receive relatively good reviews and are classified as adventure games. For more information about the game, just check the game. HerInterative Nancy Drew Personally, I think this movie is quite good and I will buy it when it comes out on DVD.
