A terrifying crime drama from Pou-Soi Cheang, director of "Home Sweet Home". In general, it reminds me of Billy Tang's "Run and Kill", even though it is not as polished as it should be. However, it was an interesting and flawed physical assault on the Cambodian people, Pang's name. (Edison Chen) who came to Hong Kong to kill a lawyer While fleeing from the scene, he killed Sam's police partner, which would add to the insult of injury in the midst of dealing with his dying father. dozen Corpse and relentless violence There must be something in the air recently because I have never seen a lot of humans beating the pulp from each other recently. This is a terrible, nasty thing which is why I am part of it and me. Applaud their feelings It's visually appealing and the sound design is very unique. Everything will continue to spin until all the characters find themselves in the world of pain that roars. Subplots related to Pang's engagement with sexually abused women add depth to the story and create a surprising fourth action, which is a good act of grotesque surgery.
