Let me first say that while I watched every episode of StarTrek at least twice, I don't think of myself as a Trekker or Trekkie, that is, people who live in their parents' basement and attend meetings wearing suits. With pointed rubber ears I gave this movie seven stories together from the historical mistakes of the novel. Performances are better than average. But the storyline is not surprising They try hard to do reverse engineering. But special technology is still a great experiment. If you call it the first Capitan pilot of the Enterprise, Commander April, then Capt. Pike, Jim Kirk and others, according to the statement of Riker and Kirk, we made Klingons educate them and give them technology. (That's why the main approach was created), but as I said, these things have no reason to defame this reputation. I hope the plot will get deeper and then special techniques can use the back seat.
