I watched this in July and, despite the Christmas theme, it was impressive and delicate. Not for those who have a true heart because it is full of imagination and a lovely time that sometimes is not reasonable. William Russ has done a great job as a hank. I just saw him in the remake of The Long, Summer Summer, where he played a weak character. But in this picture, the expression in his eyes all the time while Hank sees that the things that happened to him are wonderful and gentle. Valerie Bertinelli is wonderful and cute as usual and believes in this role very much. And Peter Fulk as Max is great and always creates a smile when he appears in many important scenes There are many special scenes, including scenes that Hank realized that Max was who in his life. Not for everyone ..... Especially those who do not watch the movie 'Feel good' and this is definitely a story! If you want everything perfectly and reasonably, please avoid this. But I think it's worth watching again, which is why I recorded it. (Yes, some of us still have a VCR :)
