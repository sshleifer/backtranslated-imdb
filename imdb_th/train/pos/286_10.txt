I read many promises when in the cinema and they were bad .... I think you have to be one type of person to enjoy these movies. If you're not someone who likes Waltons or Little House ... U won't understand or don't enjoy these movies ... <br /> <br /> Now, about Loves Abiding Joy ... I know he is. Bad news from The beginning of the movie .... I hope it shows the end rather than letting you just think. This film is related to Jeff ... 6 years later, so you know that he will be interested in Girls <br /> <br /> I want to say that I enjoy all 4 movies. .. not crazy about books ... wait until the next movie The way Clark talks will get you every time. I like to see January Jones appearing ... maybe a family or something.
