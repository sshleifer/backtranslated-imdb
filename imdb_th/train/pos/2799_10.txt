As an anti-footballer, I (on the surface) take my brother to watch this movie as anxiously. But I hope it will be East, East II. The trailer looks fun, so I think I will let it go. <br /> <br /> It takes about ten minutes. But after that I was stared at the screen and that was nothing to do with the neck cramps. Caused by sitting near the front because the auditorium is full Live performances and lively, engaging characters and real jokes All the halls laugh out loud every minute. Football fans or football fans aren't sports related to the main principles of love, friendship, family, independence and competition. Add a dash of Sikh culture and you have a recipe for the best British comedy I have seen for a long time. I dare speak better than the East is East. <br /> <br /> This movie With a lovely rhythm, never living longer than necessary or not letting anything unfinished, make the audience fun and mentally engaged Although it is not a movie that looks twisted and rotated. But there is a pleasant surprise about how and what doesn't happen as you expect. <br /> <br /> Say that there are elements of predictability. Take advantage of friction rather than use as a script filler. I think that depends on your preference in the happy ending. Personally, if there are other results, I will write a letter with strong words to the author. <br /> <br /> For the actors, I must say that Juliet Stevenson (Paula) has performed the best. I never knew that such people existed. But she's the truth of her with strange concepts, sometimes causing me to believe that they might do it! Reward for those who are not the most convinced (From the main character) goes to Kiera Knightley (Jules), but don't understand me wrong, even if you offer a great performance, it just has someone who must be the best and apologize to Kiera. This time you are <br /> <br /> Tip: Don't go before credit. When the light came back, I realized my horror that maybe I shouldn't watch this movie. My forgotten love But the ice junk has melted into the sweet blue water Oh what am I saying? It's great and I can't recommend enough. I will definitely buy when it comes out and add it to my 3 video collection. I am a student. I just splashed out if it was really worth it.
