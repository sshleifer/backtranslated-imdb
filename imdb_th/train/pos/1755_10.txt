This movie is a riot. I can't remember the last time I had a good time in the movie. I've seen a few good comedy in my time, and usually they are funny. But this one is a wall and a large wall. I think the Best in Show is the last movie that I laughed so hard, and in this movie it doesn't stop until the end when they do a 5-minute mood plot. Continuous attack of one torpedo and a stupid situation. I want to watch it again before it leaves the theater because this is like Zucker's movie that you don't get funny. All in the first You have to watch it two or three times to get it all. <br /> <br /> As far as the real movie goes, it may take a better solution. It changes quickly. But we must forgive that. All the characters are excellent. It's not like Adam Sandler's movie that he tried to do funny and others suffered around him and was a joke. I think I will remember all the main characters for the coming year because they are very satisfying. There are no victims in this movie. Thank God that they have 45-year-old actors as their fans. Catherine Kinner plays the role of her and she is the most beloved in this movie. You just hope that a woman like you actually is not "10" like other top women, but her smile is much warmer than Julia Roberts. Too much cynicism. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie trailer I assure you that the trailer is not made for justice. They didn't tell all good jokes. Just some of the ordinary people. <br /> <br /> Oh and another. I hope critics put this in their top ten. Many people complain that comedies are not accepted as they deserve, and at the end of the year they are not on the list. That means you Burt !!!
