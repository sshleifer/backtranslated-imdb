I rented this movie last weekend, creating a surround sound system and getting great sound from special effects. This movie is an excellent rental movie, with special effects that make my fiance afraid. I'm not going to watch movies and see this. But it was a terrible late night, not feeling like going out to watch a movie I would recommend!
