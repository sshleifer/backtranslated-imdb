I own this movie and have watched it many times over the years since it was launched. The Prince did not shock us with his excellent acting style or whatever. He was a musician and I felt that it was what he showed here. He was just the best person to tell this story through influence. This movie is mostly straightforward and is a teenager. But that was the fault of the director / writer, but it was a great movie with better songs. The headmaster and moral conviction in the Purple Rain is quite strong, and if more movies are needed, the foundation we have been taught as young children, we will have a better environment around when seeing that art reflects life Reflect art
