If you come into the movie with the expectation, leave it now because there is not a lot of hype to do this justice. <br /> <br /> If you want to categorize this movie into one category It is a spy thriller with elements of noir, bits and pieces of action, science fiction and cyberpunk. All tied to fantastic storytelling, twisting, mind-bending plot and spectacular movies. The comments here are centered on it being adapted in both the good and the bad of other movies. But as they say that every baby crib is from Shakespeare, so when you pass away, you will be in danger of sitting. <br /> <br /> You will have to suppress unbelief in Some points and While the scenes were never convincing, but there were some parts (read: elevators) that experienced low budgets and mysterious images. Do not misunderstand that it means being at the same level as the wonderful sci-fi movie channel because it is at a much higher level. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for action, you should turn to it. But if you are willing to sit down and devote a good 90 minutes to a new movie viewing experience, do whatever it takes to do it! Watch this movie before it's cool to see!
