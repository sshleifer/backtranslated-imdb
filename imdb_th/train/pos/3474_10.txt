This movie is worth watching only for John Lennon's outstanding painting by Jared Harris. It doesn't matter if Harris isn't exactly like Lennon. Manners, expressions, gestures, emphasis and attitude are pure Lennon. The best scene: Lennon in a local coffee shop practicing verbally with his girlfriend, stating that "Silly Love Songs" by Paul McCartney and Wings have the # 1 status in America.
