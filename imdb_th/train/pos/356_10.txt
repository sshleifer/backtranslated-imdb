Become a level production with low budget The variety of characters is amazing, from the dwarf ax to the 7 foot ghoul! I enjoy the relationship between the leader that is not too touching. But romantic enough to keep the attention going I also enjoy the blend of humor. (Which may be very easy to get too much / not enough liability) which means it's not too dark or too tricky It is a great step from other efforts of the Hellbreeder and Sanitarium eaves in terms of story and production They have an excellent website which is worth checking out. Can't wait for disaster. If the level of improvement continues, it's amazing.
