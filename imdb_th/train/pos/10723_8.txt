I read the opinions of other users and decided to put them in too. Some users are stuck in the idea of ​​'reality'. This movie is intended to be 'fantasy' .... to be 'if it happens'. Fun movies. It never meant 'real' or serious. It's fun for everyone I know when it comes out - even if it's a tragedy of the challenger's explosion ... I'm 30 years old and enjoy all this - son. My little ones love it too! After that, I shared it with my daughter and she loved it as well. SpaceCamp is a fun family movie that should have been fun. 'The Truth' Everyone in the world should be lighter or stuck with watching documentaries or documentaries and avoiding other types of movies. Apologize for the young people who watched this movie first and then went to the actual SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and another at Vandenberg AFB in California) - they had to expect to find the same environment shown in Movies and felt 'diminishing' ... I think their parents didn't explain the difference between fantasy and reality. Oh, well, if you like fun fantasy movies and have never seen this before. I highly recommend! Enjoy!
