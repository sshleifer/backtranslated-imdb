I am from Romania. I will try to speak in English. All I want to say about this film is that it is and will be my number one all the time. Can see more than 30 times at least and will see for many years It has all the little things that I like in the movie. It makes me cry. Show distorted love stories and many questions about love and reality and what is truly important for different people. It happened that for me, this most important thing, the love of the human spirit, he is an internal creature, and this I see in this movie. Maybe for me it's more than a movie. It's a proof of my mind that it really exists and you do the best for every moment you live with your partner. It's a long way from reality to sci-fi. But .. What if What will happen if the capitalist system disappears and the economy will collapse? We are all concerned about other problems and my idea is that on your deathbed, the bigger things you remember, not the wealth, not the adventure, not the country you visited and the people who remember you But your true friend and true love and hope that after you die, everyone will be a perfect God and people will be better and more cared for Watch this movie and may help guide you through life like I do :) Greetings from Romania
