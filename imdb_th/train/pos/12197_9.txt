This is probably the most obvious number of movies of all time, not Columbia Studios, which cut Orson Welles' original manuscripts significantly. What we still have is a movie that is defective. But beautiful that shows the overwhelming talent of Welles as an actor / director and Rita Hayworth as a very talented actor. <br /> <br /> 'Lady from Shanghai' is a noir movie. Which is the most hot and confusing Welsh with an irregular accent, portrays Michael O'Hara, an Irish traveler who, after meeting a charming and attractive fate. Elsa Bannister (Hayworth in a great performance) finds himself forced to get a job as a boat crew. Everett Sloane of her husband and disabled, Elsa or 'Rosalie', while Michael likes to call her to play unattractive innocent dolls next to O'Hara on her website as a lover. Proceed The partner of Arthur Bannister in his law firm George Grisby (Glenn Anders) is on board. He is a strange and unreliable person who offers a special offer to Michael: he will get Granted $ 5,000 to help Grisby in pretending to be Grisby's death. So it seems like a murderer. The plan for Michael to close the technique and run down in the sun with Elsa, but things didn't go as planned. <br /> <br /> Hayworth gave a good woman to a good woman. One of the most perpetual in the picture is very vague. At times, she seems to be truly sensitive and looks like a child in other places that are cruel, bored and difficult. She is a beautiful person, whether he claims to be wet in a swimsuit or dressed in a black dress. Hayworth photographed beautifully here and she is still far from the 'Gilda' role. Her famous Orson Welles, her husband, cut Auburn her trademark to lock the dyed blonde crop. It was a great marketing trick and he changed her amazingly changing attitude. She is not a bad woman who is sympathetic. 'Gilda' is here, but she is a black-hearted hunter who sees murder as a very useful choice. <br /> <br /> The pairing of Welles and Hayworth Come at a time when both have a lot of problems in their marriage. They are divorced after making a movie, so this is a curious matter for complex relationships. They show hate, not romantic lovers, so it is difficult to assess whether they have real chemistry or not. Of course, every encounter is powerful and full of raw sex with Welles as 'fall guy' (he even admits himself in the movie!) And Rita as a baby across the pair. <br /> <br /> Welles character is a general noir of 'nomadic' with a lot of feelings. When the voice from Wales proved to be true, Ohara didn't use his brain much. 'Expected to miss her (Elsa)' Wales often play with friends who are smart and charming, so his arrival here because Michael, who is not smart, is strange and very interesting. Actually Welles is an actor That has a good talent and he pulls it out well. <br /> <br /> Everett Sloan has a fluency as a disabled husband of Hayworth, one wondering why he hired Michael Apparently his wife was interested in him so romanticly, why did he invite 'threats' on the device? One interpretation may be that Michael gave 'service' to his wife that Bannister could not be in his disability. Some theories have something related to Elsa's behavior before she meets her husband. (Is she a prostitute?) And Grissby's knowledge about Bannister's most intimate secrets. Br> This is a complex and complex movie that has a perfect plot. the best We are more interested in the love triangle than the murder story. As with most noirs, Wales gives us a lot of his usual wonderful movies, including the popular 'Hall of Mirror'. It's a fantastic scene. Will eliminate previous mistakes in the movie and give it a great The scene in this fun house is visually beautiful with a feeling like Dali in the painted scene. (Obviously, Orson painted the picture himself). The delicate images used in this film by Welles help to increase the plot and make this a thought-provoking experience. <br /> <br /> The conversation is scary. Burned and confused by a surprisingly low voice, the voice of the young lady Hayworth proves her ability to perform in this film and proves that SHE is a wonderful girl of 'noir'. It's a pity (Only a little, because Rita is a great dancer) She has performed a lot of fun and memorable musicals for Columbia in the 40s instead of the dark theme noir. She is a great actor when having the opportunity to show her talent. <br /> <br /> 9/10
