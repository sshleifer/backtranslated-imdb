I do not know the real situation when I sit down to see this. The fact that this story is based on the true story. After the death of the boy's father, Rhonda tried to help her daughter Desiree (... I don't know if anyone named their children). It was created for children, as is often the case with "family" flicks (that say go ahead and bring everyone together to see, even if I prevent teens from going out. From that you are sure To buy the concept) but it does not reduce the importance of the death of the parents and it does not speak to anyone The story is interesting enough and moves well enough. The performances are different, with the excellent Burstyn showing the majority of her actors. Mathis followed with well and Ferland and her colleagues. (With only a few exceptions) is the least credible person of the group (And frankly I'm not in the target group for this.) Editing and movies are standard and not less than certain. While humor is limited to a few humorous lines But the sound is not unpleasant There are two or more scenes in this I recommend this to fans of this type of movie. 7/10
