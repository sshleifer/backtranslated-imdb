The beautiful story of the eldest son came home and learned to love and be a part of everything he left home to escape from pain and movement. It shows the society that may be strange to us in the Western world with the feelings of the family we lost. The story is beautiful, sad and sometimes funny and amusing. It has a sense of realism that we no longer see in our Western movies. <br /> <br /> The performance is unusual because while the movie continues, the show is a documentary of ordinary people This is a great governance and filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Want to see more movies from this director?
