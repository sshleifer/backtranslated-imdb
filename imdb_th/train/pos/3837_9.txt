Back in the forties, when the movie touched on a story that has not been accepted into the "polite" society, they use the code that is expected to float above the head of most viewers while alerting those in the know. Happening There may not be a movie of a decade of intense debate, while the strange Desert Fury is located in a small gambling oasis called Chuckawalla, somewhere in the California desert. The owner of the purple living room, Sage and the casino, is an amazing Mary Astor in a pair of cigarettes and sportswear. Liz Beth Scott, one of the cities, is driving into a city full of hands. She is looking at Technicolor like a 20 million coin, but listening to the dialogue between them which introduces older lesbians and partners who are not with her friends. (Who is wondering if the original AI Bezzerides script makes this relationship clear?) The more obvious John Hodgkin as a gangster and Wendell Corey is the envy of the envy of madmen. He added Burt Lancaster as a city sheriff and sat down for both Lancaster and (surprisingly) Hodiak fell to Scott. However, it seems that Hodiak not only had a past with Astor but also a wife who died under The suspicious circumstances The desert sun makes these ingredients hot and boiling hard by slapping their faces and exchanging them. Don't go through this great melodrama, filled with creepy exotic blooms if it comes to you. It's an amazing movie.
