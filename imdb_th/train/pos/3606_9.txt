I enjoy girls fighting It's something I can see over and over again. Great performance and I think Michelle Rodriguez has done a good job in this movie. I will speak very reliably. This film shows that women should stand for what they want to do in life. She has compassion and hatred at the same time. Dealing with a foolish father didn't help her much. Although he loves her, he really hates Her mother died when she was a child and that caused sadness in the role. Love stories are a part that I like in movies too. I feel the passion they have. Then the drama came again and it seemed like she chose between boyfriend and her long dream. I think it is over. It is the end point that you have to decide what will happen to them in the future for everyone you love, a movie that is based on sports that have good stories
