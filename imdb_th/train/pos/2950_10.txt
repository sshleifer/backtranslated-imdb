If you've ever been sad that you can't get a movie from DVD, it may be the 'raving' that you are looking for. How often do you laugh when watching regular comedy shows? I was too young to see Richard Pryor in his greatest moment, and when I was old enough to see Eddie Murphy's 'Delirious' and 'Raw' (not a joke) I never knew Eddie was getting strong. Mostly inspired Now I am older and have seen both Pryor and many comedians. After Murphy, I know two things: everyone stole iron from Eddie while Eddie fell in love with Richard. That is a huge difference: Eddie is a traditional, funny, humorous, generous person? And so on. He is something that has never been seen before. He is everything we need. Today, Eddie Murphy is boring and old ?? But once he was a king and 'raving' is the greatest castle ever built. Truly one of the most enjoyable routines of all time
