"Angels in the Field" was originally a movie in 1951 from the Ted Turner Library; Disney lost in 1994, this time using the California Angels (now Los Angeles Angels) as a team. (Disney used to be the owner of this team and the Anaheim Mighty Dight Hockey hockey team and still use this term well? <br /> <br /> This movie is about two orphans who want a family. A man promised children that the family would do it only when the gods won the flag. So he asked God one night about it. The boy who prayed can see help coming on the way. (And only that boy), for example, when the first angel came down, the player hit the ball hard not only But will only cause the bat to break, so the ball !!!!! For the post-star season of 1994, angels are at the top of Al West. (My home team at Rangers is one and still). However, they lost the game because the boys were in court instead of the White Sox / Angels game (no central baseball department at that time. Chicago was in the west) and no angels. Come to help So there is a new rule: No angels can help in the championship. But wait! In the championship game, the Angels win !!!!! It's a miracle. <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie: This is a good movie. I mean, I pray every night in the last few years for help with schools and things. Look at me now! My job is great !!!!! So for this, show that if you believe that God can send His angels to help you resolve any problems you may have in your life. And secondly, this is a family baseball movie that is always exciting. This is an old Disney movie as well. I just saw this recently in the New Disney Channel (blech !!!!!) <br /> <br /> "Angel in the field" will change your life forever when you see it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
