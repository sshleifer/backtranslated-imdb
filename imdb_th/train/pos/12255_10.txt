From the Austen movie in the 1990s, this is my favorite movie. "Persuasion" which is a movie that made me change to Australasia Before seeing "Emma" I had seen the previous two versions, but in Emma one seemed totally wrong. More like Lady Teazle and another one, she seemed half wrong like a possible deceptive person. But here she seems cheap and stubborn. In general, I think the attitude and atmosphere of the production convey the charm of this novel very well. In fact, it's one of the best and sweetest things I've ever seen in the nature of Christmas treatment. The script has an unusually good form and an additional part of the adapter, such as the light beam that reveals Harriet to Emma in the church. But in perfect condition Mark Strong, while Knightley is not what I expected But I enjoy him a lot: He brings out the characters that speak well and actually works in contrast to Emma's emotions and Frank Churchill's rage is quite funny. Bernard Hepton makes Mr. Woodhouse. Carroll is almost ridiculous person; Samantha Morton as Emma's protégé is soft and tight like she should be. And as in the same "Pride and Prejudice" of the same manufacturer, we are convinced that the character's involvement in the end may have faith - in some cases for me, this production is and remains happy
