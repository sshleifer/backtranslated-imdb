The last adventure for Japanese lawyers with an impressive package is a piece of Pinku Cinema that is fun but slightly new. In the sense of thinking while stepping back to the associated evil, <br /> <br /> The film opens with the appearance of a female ghost and looks like it's going to explore the north. nature There may be a series of interesting new directions; Unfortunately, after the ghost became nothing but Scooby Doo - a trickery style (cooked by corrupt officials, eager to get people out of the lake where he hid gold thieves), the director Yoshio Inou It's a familiar content. From the first two movies, the result is quite old. <br /> <br /> Hanzo is the chief investigator who wants him to interrogate the woman through the use of his powerful penis, slicing his enemies and violations.
