This film is about the life of Queen Victoria during her youth, and in the first few years as the King of Great Britain <br /> <br /> "The Young Victoria" has amazing production. Every scene is designed and decorated with resolution. Elegant costumes, luxurious locations and beautiful landscaped gardens make "The Young Victoria" very impressive. I was most surprised by the kind of filming The way in which everyone has a relationship with the background or foreground is a good idea. The scene that impressed me most was when Victoria talked to Melbourne. Melbourne is located in the middle of the door frame from the corner of Victoria, while from the corner of Melbourne Victoria is located between the areas in which Melbourne held his arms on the hips. <br /> <br /> The story clever A person who has been pursued and understood without Queen Victoria's historical knowledge has many incidents that need to be rushed or not explained. I expect to have a coronation scene and a few seconds of disappointment. <br /> <br /> Overall, "The Young Victoria" is a good movie and it would be better if it was longer. To be able to explain the event appropriately without hurry
