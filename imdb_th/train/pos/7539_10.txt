I really like to watch this movie. Like most people who watch it I'm not sure if I received the Whoopi Goldberg as a comedian and she made a lot of funny movies. Like the actions of the sister <br /> <br /> However, this is not really funny. It's a drama that has funny moments. So if you are looking for a riot, laugh, then look at it. <br /> <br /> This film is about a black family that has moved up from the city's good neighborhood to the middle class. I will say more But it thinks it will make the movie lose This film is not only But involves racial relations between white people and blacks only But also about the relationship in the black community I think it's worth the opportunity. If you are not interested in watching other movies about the relationship in the competition, this film is not right for you.
