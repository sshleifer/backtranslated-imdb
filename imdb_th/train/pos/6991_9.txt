This is a great movie. The actors are the perfect combination of characters and the story is appropriate. This film is about a successful doctor who steals the bride's body and takes them to his home. When the body was at his house, he took out the stuff. (I hate to use common words like this. But I forgot what he had removed) and put it in his wife to treat the child Then the journalist Patricia Hunter examined the situation and began to find out why the bride was dead. She travels to the house, doctors and interesting things begin to happen. Of course, look at this oldie, but goodie if you can.
