In Barbary and John Wayne, John Wayne played the role of Townsend Harris, a true diplomat from the United States, who was responsible for opening Japan to truly international relations in the end. In the year 1850, before the Commodore Perry pushed the gun into Japan in general and forced to make a treaty with Japan in 1853. Harris, which arrived soon, worked through the details and helped. Ensure that Japan is a country that does not have a preference. Honor the first treaty All of this is true and is shown in the movie. From other sources, I find that the love between Harris and the Japanese geisha is mostly fiction, and this love is the focus of this film. (So ​​the name) <br /> <br /> My first reaction first When I saw this film as one of the surprises, John Wayne was a diplomat! When he was a diplomat in most movies, he said please and thank you as he punched people !!!! So when he saw a man who was not an actor and was able to play diplomatic games, it looked very strange. In fact, I couldn't think of too many actors in 1958 that might be more unusual for this role. By the way, I saw Harris and Wayne's photographs without any similarities with him. <br /> <br /> However, even though there is a story that uses a lot of freedom with truth and Strange actors Still can see a lot Color movie shooting is good. The film shows good insights about Japanese customs and culture and the performance is not bad. Overall, it is a movie that can be watched and watched even with strange screenings. <br /> <br /> PS - Read a little story for this movie. You find out more about real life characters, including the fight between Wayne and the director (John Huston), which Wayne clearly made him come out !! From what I read about Huston and how he got into the actors, this was an event that I always believed. And it is a good example of John "diplomacy"
