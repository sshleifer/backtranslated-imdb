This is a great ending for the show. The fact that Admiral Jay is able to perform two swaps in Anderson perfectly. The fact that she allowed herself to be infected was therefore infected with the queen by "poisoning" which, in essence, ended. The way they ended, it wasn't much for Reunion movies. However, they brought "home" to them and the way they did it was wonderful !! It's sad to say goodbye to my family. Ended up with Tom and B. Lanna with their children as they entered the alleyway of Alpha Is a good way to show a new starting point It would be good if there are some reunion movies - just to see where their characters are today.
