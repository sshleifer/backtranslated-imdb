I agree that the screenplay is not good and it has some parts that are slow. But all the critics of this movie need to learn fun. First of all, the performance was great (Michael Douglas, Kim Basinger, Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria). Michael Douglas proved that he still exists and Kim Basinger plays a very interesting role as a wives wife. Both dynamic pairings add to their amazing abilities in the pot, and the second is the most fun movie I've ever had in Theodore for many years. It's simple if you want to go to the movies and have See lots of fun. The Sentinel
