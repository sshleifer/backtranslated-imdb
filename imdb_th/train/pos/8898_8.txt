60's is a great movie (I saw it completely in one night) about the hippie movement in the late 60s, although the title is recommended. Otherwise, the first 5 years of the 60s are not important in this film. <br /> <br / > The main character of this film is Michael, a political activist who travels to the United States. Vietnam War There he met his girlfriend, Sarah's brother. Michael.Michael Go to Vietnam to fight (It was a surprise!) He came back from the war and changed in "Tom Cruise, which happened on the fourth day of July" (which is a surprise !!). Kate, Michael's sister. Conceived from rock and roll artists and fled home and went to San Francisco during the summer of love. The ending was terrible (the father became generous and everyone was happy) but I let the story This slipped away from my vote. (Other movies are very good!) <br /> <br /> Actors' performances are quite good and the soundtrack of the movies is great. All the main activities of the sixties are in movies such as JFK and Martin Luther King murders, as well as the big hippie protests, the summer of love and stock! Look closely at the "Woodstock Speaker" gravy (what we have in mind is breakfast in bed, price 400.000!) As a first-aid staff at Woodstock! <br /> <br /> At the end of the era 60 is beautiful, a movie about a beautiful decade! 10/10
