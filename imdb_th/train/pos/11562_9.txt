I can't understand how wonderful the pairing of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon is. It's as if the movie doesn't need even more characters because you will never be bored with the dialogue between these two stories. <br /> <br /> Lemmon is in many famous movies such as Mr. Roberts and The Apartment and The new live matthew from his Academy Award winning The Fortune Cookie (Billy Wilder, as well as Lemmon). The film wasn't as great as the story. Can not sustain it for a long time. (I thought it was almost 2 hours) However, this thing went fast in half an hour, even though the introduction of events leading to Lemma at Matt Tuay's apartment was very long. (Like this sentence) That is a little quirky thing and during the rest time you have a wonderful time. <br /> <br /> I have written comments on how to follow this movie that sucks and I will Do not go deep into it. The reason why this kind of happiness is because this movie was created because the innocence of American movies began to fade quickly. Have some sexual references But they are managed innocently that you can't even "Well, I never ..." came out of the smartest people out there. It was fun to watch movies from an era that was long gone and that might be the reason why the sequels didn't work because you had Matthau and Lemmon say a few words f and that didn't suit them. <br /> <br /> Of course, now they are gone and you are happy that you can still enjoy them in this great movie. I think the only male actor in this live movie is John Fideler. Edman died soon, so you have it. Is one of the best comedians and movies ever. <br /> <br /> Added: I just learned recently that John Fideler died for the fans of All of them, I am deeply sorry. I do not mean any disrespect and I will try to beware of what I blah blah blahing next time.
