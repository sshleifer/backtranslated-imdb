Although it is not as creepy as traditional primitive cult (ZOMBI 2), I prefer this one more. This is because of the faster speed, better settings and the excellent 80s soundtrack. It is full of action and has a sweet gore effect by Lucio Fulci. In ZOMBI 2, but they still look good It can be done quite well. But it certainly has a wonderful share For example, some zombies move very slowly while others are as fast as ninjas. Some people have brains while others talk about funny lines. But who would expect stability when talking about Italian horror movies? Even the zombies are still flying! That's how rad? Of course, having to watch for gorehounds and zombie fans, it would probably make most action movie fans satisfied as well. Check out Zombi 4 as well.
