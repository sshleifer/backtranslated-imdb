The fact that this movie was brought out on DVD, still formatting to the TV and with vague images makes many movie actors really annoyed ...... and rightly this thing deserves. Better care <br /> <br /> A story about a street performer who wants his son to pass on his craft (daily rules) and break up with a little girl instead of the method) and the problems that follow. after that The old man bought a child who was a slave auction, and soon found that the child was not a child, which he thought was a clear case. <br /> <br /> The old man "Bianlian Wang (Xu Zhu) is a kind of person. Funny with missing facial teeth and smiles infected with "Doggie" (Zhou Renying) is cute. The rest of this story is the way they both manage. After that, I tend to like the ending. Proceed slightly in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> Overall, it involves a story full of drama, thrill, humor and sadness. Don't expect quality pictures for the money you spend. go with DVD until it comes out on a wide screen for rent
