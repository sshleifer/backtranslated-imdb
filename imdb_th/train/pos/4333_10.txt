See this in the preview - Great movies - Great characters - Witty and intelligent conversations - Best actors - Peter Falk will join Oscar - Paul Reiser as a person charming Giving a clear story about making movies - it was his long dream to write a semi-autobiographical story about the relationship between son and father, and more specifically between him and his father - this was a success Breathtaking and fun, fashion - Selected actors have been selected very well and give a feeling of family. - I recommend this movie to anyone who wishes to see a genius drama and a great performance.
