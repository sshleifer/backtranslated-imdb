This is a very good animation about 3 best friends in a small town in England. One finds a passionate love and a new beginning with a young piano teacher when the tragedy strikes and the heart changes forever. The movie that will have a tissue box for you of course! Powerful pieces This is one of my favorite movies forever. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler !!! Spoiler alert !! Spoiler !! * <br /> <br /> The main character is led by a handsome young piano teacher and a romantic flower. "Friends" are both jealous of her. To the tragedy quickly She lost her love and friends in the deed. Eventually, an unexpected surprise pulled them back together. (In my opinion, her forgiveness is not guaranteed)
