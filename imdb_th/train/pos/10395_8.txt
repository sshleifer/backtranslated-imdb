Amazing adventures of Arabs The former King Ahmad and his best friend, Bandit Abu (played by Sabu of Black Narcissus), find Ahmad's love and love which King Jaffar (Conrad Veidt) has stolen. Don't stop at all It is the invention of a new adventure for the heroes. Personally, I found Ahmad and his princess a bit boring. (There is no need to ask why John Justin, who plays Ahmad in the fourth place on the credit) The thief at one point found that the devil was in the bottle. I still love Miles Malleson as the Sultan of Basra, the princess's father. He gathered amazing toys from around the world. Jaffa bribed him with the hands of his daughter along with a mechanical flying horse. This may be considered as one of the greatest movies of children forever. But special techniques have been dated horribly. At present, children will certainly insult overlays when Abu and Jeanie are on the screen together. And the scene with a giant spider looks particularly scary Although most young people may think that King Kong doesn't look good at this time But Willis O'Brien's stop-motion animation stop is better than a thousand puppets on a rope that doesn't look like a spider. 8/10
