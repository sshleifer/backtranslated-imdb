Stargate SG-1 is a movie that is different from the movie "Stargate" in 1994. I'm glad they decided to expand the story. The show started at the beginning. Retired Jack O'Neill had to go through the door again to meet Dr. Daniel Jackson, his old friend In the first two, we meet Samantha Carter, a very smart person who does not allow anyone to walk across her and has a peaceful warrior Teal'c and sympathetic to his false gods. <br /> <br /> The main bad guy is called Gouald. They are parasites that can insert into their own brains. So control them and do evil. The powerful Gouald is often considered a "System Lord". The warrior behind Gouald is called Jaffa. Set Gouald's parasites in their bodies until Gouald can enter the brains of one person. <br /> <br /> Through various episodes, the survey team consists of Jack / Daniel / Teal'c / and Sam through the wormhole that sent them. To another planet immediately (This device is called Stargate) and they meet new cultures or bad people. Some parts of the world, which means that they do not go through the Stargate once in a while and rather deal with the pressing problems of the world. <br /> <br /> Over the years, you see the decline of SG - 1 team that has a close relationship and has a story to create more characters On the other hand, this means different parts of the world that are completely understandable. <br /> <br /> My score: 8.75 / 10 ---- While most of the performances are good. But there are some parts of the story Has not been encapsulated and less important than these travel gates for the past few years But still a great science fiction!
