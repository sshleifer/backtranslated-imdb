I saw this movie with my father. I have to stay for about 15 years. It's about Star Movies. One afternoon, the movie started a bit. But you can tell that those bandits gather to score It's a good rhythm after the first half hour. <br /> <br /> All the actors are excellent, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I can watch this movie all the time. I think it is the stupidity of the plot and the characters that try to deal with very strange scores. Jokes are not repeated But sensitive and violent at the same time that makes them hilarious. <br /> <br /> The perfect comedy for a lazy afternoon.
