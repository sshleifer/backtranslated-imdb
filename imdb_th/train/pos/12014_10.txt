This is the most incredible movie I've ever seen. The actor gave a wonderful drawing of the characters in the movie. The story is conveyed precisely. The story begins with a young woman from the British Isles and her father travels by steamboat to Nauvoo, Illinois. She is a member of the LDS Church and he cannot. He thought she was ridiculous for traveling and discouraged. She encouraged him to read about Joseph Smith the Prophet. This is where the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith begins. This film shows his life and the history of the LDS Church at the same time. Properly Sometimes it's a graphic, but it's necessary. The emotional expression is very reliable, which makes my emotions spill out. The shooting was excellent. How to present the story is impressive. After the movie ended, we couldn't sit there. I was shocked. For those who know very little about Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet, I want you to see this. If nothing else but to get an understanding of his life For those who are members of the Church, I encourage you to watch. It will add your testimony to this amazing person. This is a must see.
