I will make it short and short. People who write the story for this show are genius. The actors are perfect for the roles they play (CJ's characters are legendary) and they have many chemical properties on the screen. It's a very successful comedy. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the new episode, which may go back in the past 6/7 months, I wonder what happened to Paul. I am very sorry to see that he died when I watched Google. He was a funny person and played the role of himself perfectly, a father who is too protective of anyone who likes to protect his daughter from the fire and away from the boy br /> <br /> Funny story, I think, lost from strength. For strength even without Paul. <br /> <br /> In addition, I think most people will enjoy watching it.
