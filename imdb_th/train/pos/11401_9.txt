Americans in Paris combine a variety of Hollywood art and music. This film is built on MGM's supremacy as a musical theater. The film has an unforgettable song from the Gershwins, which was called Beethoven and Mozart in the 20th century. <br /> <br /> Gene Kel Li is still at the highest level of his power in this film, although it may be argued correctly that this film is just a warm-up for his best work in Singin 'in the Rain (1952). These two films are closely linked. In addition to the connection of Arthur Typ, Broadway melodies in "Rain" continue to live in the American ballet scene in Paris. This may be the only time that the special dance numbers are mentioned in the opening credits of the movie. And it should be because it shows Gene Kelly's skills as a top dancer and choreographer. <br /> <br /> The actor of this film is consistently excellent. Leslie Caron shows the movie. Her unbelievable appearance shows the maturity that makes you think that you will make movies for many years. Her basic dance sequence, and later, she worked on ballet, giving surprisingly sexy moments to the pair in the MGM Musicals, especially the work of Cyd Charisse in Singin 'in the Rain and The Wagon Oscar Levant. Kelly's, who received the best moments of two movies: during the party ended (Which I won't allow anyone who doesn't watch movies) and is one of the most memorable musical numbers of this movie Which, together with his amazing piano skills and cutting-edge effects (at that time) <br /> <br /> The lesser memory is Georges Guetary as the romantic rival of Kelly Nina Foch as Leslie Karon's romantic rival The relationship between May and December between Kelly's character and Nina reminds me of a "person" relationship between George Pepard and Patricia O'Neill in the breakfast at Tif. Fany <br /> <br /> It makes me less satisfied than Singin 'in the Rain ballet, although it's extravagant and well-produced. But not suitable for the remaining movies Ballet was born without touching or the real reason. And different from the Broadway melody sequence, it has nothing to do with the story - and in the best musicals, the songs often have raison d'etre. <br /> <br /> What makes it worse is the ending of the movie. The story happened immediately after the ballet. Although the ending is not surprising. (This is MGM's musical) but I hope there will be more ... The movie after the ballet ends As if director Vincente Minnelli felt he could not follow the ballet with other things This movie makes me stray quickly. <br /> <br /> That is a bad thing. American people in Paris ranked the best in Hollywood musicals. It didn't reach Singin 'height in the rain, but it came close and it still proved Gene Kelly's skills as one of the greatest dancers of all time.
