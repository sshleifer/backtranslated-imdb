I have to agree with you. Caruso Jr. Lanza is the best voice that God has given. If only But he will find the courage to leave Hollywood and head to the opera house. He should be an American Caruso, everyone said. It's a great introduction to the boneless art form about it, and if that's how it would be like that. Watching this movie, you'll see why Mr Lanza still talks even in my home. Some people say Pavarotti. I say MARIO LANZA for this movie when it will be on DVD. They will have to be Reconstruction and VHS are not good enough, but this should be the only Lanza movie that is put on a boring DVD.
