The wide-ranging film of Broadway music, Nathan Sinatra, likes to roll the dice and organize illegal crap games. The beloved blonde Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) wants to marry him if he quits craps. He decided in the final game when Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando!), The big bet put into the city. He bet on the sky that he can't take Sarah Brown. (Jean Simmons) went to him at Havana. That may sound like a strange summary, but it's a movie! <br /> <br /> This is a true mixed bag - there are some wonderful things here. All songs are good and the dance is excellent. The real stopper is shown at the crap game at the end. Brando is still quite good here - it may be strange to think that he sings and dances. But he pulled it out I have to admit that seeing big and big Brando, pulling out difficult dance moves is a lot of fun! In addition, Sinatra is quite good and Blaine is excellent as a long-suffering girlfriend. Her song and dance numbers are definitely highlights here. <br /> <br /> Now for the bad part - Jean Simmons is a great actor. This movie is too long in 150 minutes. The scene between Brando and Simmons will be dragged and should be shortened. Most characters speak in very precise English - never use abbreviations. Sometimes it may be trying to make jokes out of the mouths of gangsters. But I found it trembling and it caused me to leave the movie. <br /> <br /> It's worth it to catch music and dance. But it is too long Will go to see you for a while
