Men, I love this movie! This made me go back when I was a child. This is the day when teachers still show movies in class about real stories, and if you do well, they will roll back the movie slowly so you can watch it. I still remember one of the openings ... "Tutazema is his name and he is an orphan. He lives with his sister in the village." This is a great movie for children and is durable like a red balloon. At the end, the other Indian boys in the village attached a feather to Tutazema and he became an eagle himself. He always lives the way he wants. He will fly into heaven.
