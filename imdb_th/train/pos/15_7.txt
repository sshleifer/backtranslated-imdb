I guess the movie has magic. I don't want it to be slippery or seamless. It can skip the background data too quickly in some places, too slow in others, etc. Magic in this movie: scenes in the library There are many small flaws in Stanley & Iris, but they do not distract from the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in terms of life that seem difficult to understand. Both characters are smart. Still, Stanley didn't understand enough to work because he couldn't read it. He couldn't read because he had too many adventures in his childhood. Iris, although receiving good education But was not adventurous enough and could not understand how to pass her life back In both their shortcomings and their strengths, the characters compliment each other It may be a lengthy story that will accept that Iris will leave the office every year in the factory or Stanley has never concealed his knowledge of enough to work in construction or a better job And while these "mysteries" are described in the story But it seems that they are unfolding I think that no one takes a new idea to script. Even so, it's a good movie. Imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton will do on the screen if someone!
