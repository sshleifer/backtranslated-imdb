There is a spectacular and exciting photograph that the heart stops here in the range of scenery and animals from the Arctic to the tropics and everything in between. The techniques of the camera are varied and can work from close range to aerial work. The amendment is very clear and the comments are also clear, with the right tone and amazing facts and stories about our world. The point that the film fell into an attempt to cover and include four themes - seasonal patterns, climate change, stories of each animal. In the end it was getting a bitty and disjointed. Overall, it's worth it to get, especially the problems that have been covered. But don't expect Oscar content
