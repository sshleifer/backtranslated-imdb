In one scene, he shot an animal after the animal, while another scene killed the Indians and ate the food that they were cooking with fire. Under this brutal external appearance, an unstable person who was lightened to plead with his companions (Stewart Granger, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Lamlin) who will not leave him It is not the most satisfying movie and has a drama created that leads to a depressing and appropriate conclusion in a snow storm.
