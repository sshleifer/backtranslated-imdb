In Iran, women are officially banned from men's sporting events. In June 2005, the Iranian national football team had an important game against Bahrain in the Azadi Stadium for the World Cup. A group of Iranian women and football lovers like boys and trying to enter the stadium without success. <br /> <br /> Football (and the Flamengo team), beaches and movies are what I am passionate about. So I love this gem about girls and their football passion. Director Jafar Panahi from "The White Balloon", "The Mirror" and "The Circle" filmed this movie on the day that Iran conquered. Bahrain and qualify for the World Cup in Germany The incredible and funny adventure of these Iranian girls is one of the most delightful movies I've ever seen. My rating is nine. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): Not available.
