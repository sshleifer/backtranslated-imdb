As Dr. Alan Stone Corbin Bernesen, acting like crazy in "The Dentist" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> With the tendency of obsession He was in high gear. Dr. Alan Feinstone lost his consciousness in his daily life. <br /> <br /> When the doctor realizes that his wife is having a relationship with a child in the pool. Torture, murder, overall assault! "The Dentist" is a strong movie! Bernsen makes Dr. Feinstone's character more engaging and offensive at the same time. Even though he is not in his tomb But the audience still felt sympathy for him That is my friend ..... It's a good show. <br /> <br /> A strong actor in supporting the actors around the jewel of this movie. Great direction, good killing and stabbing and effective pacing will keep you entertained throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended!
