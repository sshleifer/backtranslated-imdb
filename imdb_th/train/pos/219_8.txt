Simon's carefully written dialogue is truly inspired by Matthau and Burns. You can hear the crackling of the script. There are a few movies that can develop relationships between actors and scripts. For example, the famous combination scene can be tedious with less-qualified actors. Matthau seems to be born to play Willie Clark. (Of course, Oscar moreso in a strange pair) and with the habits and gestures that Matthau packed with the characters. (The row in which he argued that he was with it He lived in the city while Lewis lived in a country where Lewis was "Not touching" is the quintessential example of this story), making it one of the best performances I've seen actors in any role, whether funny or anything. The duration Matthau and Burns work together nicely. visit The differences that they show are an emphasis on Simon's special ability to create comedic conflicts. This film is just one of "The ultimate must" and want a famous place in the history of the movie
