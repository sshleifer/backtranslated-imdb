The babies were rescued by Sloth and Mammoth, but the tigers joined with them for the purpose of bringing the baby to the end. They walked through many difficult and dangerous paths, and immediately the tiger fell and rescued by a mammoth. At the end, the tiger group tried to catch the ball, but Mammoth helped his tiger colleague. Convincing can overcome this attack and let the children return to their father and community
