Charming does not begin to explain "Saving Grace;" It is absolutely irresistible! Anyone who participates in this movie will let their minds rise (ha ha) <br /> <br /> Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) recently lost her husband. But her problem is getting worse She left deeply, causing her to have no money and unpaid debts. Faced with losing everything, you have to find a way to get a lot of cash ... soon! She received the idea when the gardener Matthew (Craig Ferguson) asked the famous gardener of the city to advise him about the plants that he was growing secretly. Grace realizes that his factory is marijuana, so they decided to use her gardening skills to grow a lot of high quality weeds, then sell it to pay off her debts. <br /> <br /> The most outstanding quality about "Saving Grace" is my favorite. All characters are extremely sympathetic and economical during the first 20 minutes. This movie is a great encouragement, not a stop. Everyone wants a happy ending for everyone, even if it means ignoring some illegal actions. <br /> <br /> The performance is the most important. Brenda Blethyn is one of the best female actors. United Kingdom and this is the reason She transforms what is a caricature to become a living person and completely breathes. She is a good girl But she's not stupid. Craig Ferguson is as friendly as Matthew. He's a loser in the game. But he is so cute that it doesn't matter The rest of the actors in this category are also there. But the special mention had to go to Tcheky Karyo, a French actor with aura about him always, and that was right for him. But he has good humor. <br /> <br /> Nigel Cole discovered the perfect tone for It's all about charm. One of the problems that I have with English humor is that all the energy seems to be drained out of the movie. Here, the movie is always a favorite and amusing, not saying "Saving Grace" is just a movie. Satisfied that will make you smile and feel good. While this movie is not a joke outside the story But there are two or three scenes that have nothing to watch like hippies. <br /> <br /> If there is a problem with this movie Even if the question is answered and the end ends unexpectedly, <br /> <br /> Please see "Saving" especially when you have a bad day.
