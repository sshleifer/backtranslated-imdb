I rented this movie many years ago and was completely fascinated with it. Recently, I felt strange that I had to come back to review a few movies that I had enjoyed so much during my life. I decided to give "Erendira" a new look again. And I'm glad I did that. Soon I discovered that even though the time didn't shine in the film's shine, <br /> <br /> This story is about a teenage girl (Erendira who plays Remarkably By Claudia Ohana - in some respects, she resembles Winona Ryder!) Which accidentally burned the house of her grandmother's mansion after the grandmother played hypnotically by Irene Papas forcing the woman The girl becomes a prostitute in the street. <br /> <br /> One-time viewing is attractive and attractive - although basic evidence-related investigations about prostitution do not have hot sexual content. The story revolves around the interaction between a girl and her grandmother and many other colorful characters that they experience their sojourn - which is in the rugged and ruined part of the Mexican countryside. > <br /> The film has an atmosphere that looks and looks like a dream that has been decided. Sometimes it is a strange top border. But not to the point of speaking the film David Lynch In addition, it is worth mentioning that this film is a natural comparison. Read comments from previous audiences below ... <br /> <br /> Often in the background you hear the accordion that Quiet and melancholy Appropriate musical accent to emphasize Mexican settings Movies about many rural locations in the desert are great. <br /> <br /> This movie has a good rhythm, not too fast or too slow, and after every scene I feel I have. To rewind the tape and repeat it again just because you want to do that For me, it's really interesting. <br /> <br /> Hope you can see the Spanish version of the movie with subtitles. I studied Spanish at high school and college, and I was happy to understand many conversations by ejemplo: "El mundo no es grande como pensaba." ("The world is not as big as I think" - that is, it is a small world. ) <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me of old wine, old bottles that are full of dust, which when I drink it Very satisfied But you will be left with sadness when you realize that there are not many bottles like this
