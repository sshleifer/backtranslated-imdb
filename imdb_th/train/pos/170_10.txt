Don't listen to this nasty criticism. This is a gem! Joan, a wealthy young man and her brother, finds herself innocent after his father's death - and now they have to work for a living! She is a journalist. Naturally, he is a mob driver! By encountering their careers, met with thanks to Clark Gable. At the same time, there was a chance at the moonlight underwear to swim for a group of cute little things But this thing should not be taken seriously Like this (Thank God that she stopped dancing!) Gable is an eye to see as a flowing connoisseur. He's not a star, so doesn't have to be a hero. Great to see him playing something different and William Bakewell is great like a confused sibling. The montages and tracking shots from director Harry Beaumont, who made this work a fast pace - and the occasional wink to the audience! fun!
