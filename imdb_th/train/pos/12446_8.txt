When I first heard of Modesty Blaise, but never read novels or short stories, my wife and I liked the movie a lot. It delivers in a lovely manner, introducing her character and background well. <br /> <br /> Although it has some elements that flick action. But it is a more familiar drama Sadly, this is also where there is a major drawback of the movie. The close play relies on the talent of the actors and unfortunately there are only half the actors who deliver. While Alexandra Stdenden did an excellent job as Modesty Blaise, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau Her, which is the evil character Mikilos - did not make his smile through the plot as if it were an enlarged toothpaste advertisement. He failed to create an atmosphere of anxiety to make this film a masterpiece. The supporting actors have similarities from gangster and dead sluts to good performances from Fred Pearson as Professor LOB and Eugene Yuan as Irina.
