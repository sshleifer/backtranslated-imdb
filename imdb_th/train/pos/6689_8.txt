As a comic book reader who still sees himself as a child with a heart, I admit that I may be leaning towards this film a little. I mean, there are still no good superhero movies for a while (Note: Batman Forever is not a good superhero movie). I want this movie to be good and not like my last trip to the cinema (read Blair Witch Project) I'm not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Mystery Men don't have high tension. The action is full of flick, it's a joke. And on that basis was successful Everyone in the small theater laughed and clapped and laughed through the final scene. Stiller and Garofolo have fun together, as always, and Azaria adds to the sensational madness. William H. Macy plays as a great actor while Kel Mitchell and Paul Rubens at Driven by fart being added to make children happy. <br /> <br /> Although the scene is strange, both Batman and Blade Runner) and some funny stories are obvious, it's still a common joke. There are some lines that will catch even the most boring viewers and bring tears from the laughs in our stomachs. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie. Although not always classic But it is funny twice as much as Austin Powers that is new The writing was good and the actors were great. If you're worried, plan around you and pay less. But no matter how, you will be surprised I mean, who among us is not rooted for the loser for a long time?
