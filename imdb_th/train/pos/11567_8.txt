In the studio of 1930, this short film was used as a test area for new actors due to the ease of production compared to full-length documentary films. Therefore, it is interesting that this person should be Shirley Temple. Founder for a long time Himself is the most famous child actor of all time Then again, she might not be the one who was tested. I would imagine that Frank Coghlan Jr., Shirley's older brother Sonny, was in the movie and gave less impressive performances. Then again, the 9-year-old Shirley Cathedral may not be easy to follow. <br /> <br /> The film opens with an unimaginable gag involving a leaky ceiling, which I think was designed. Come to have the Shirley Temple Look at the blasphemy ceiling, showing the family's work status in the movie and giving clean changes in Shirley's next qualifying scene, walking amid the rain. <br /> <br /> Sonny 'birthday, and his father tried occasionally and was terrified of concealing the fact that he wanted the dog and Sunny that he really wanted himself. But Sunny was afraid of the dog because he was bitten once and crawled forever since. Wanting to know that when his father confirmed to receive the dog, Sunny decided to escape from the house rather than having a dog in the house and while he escaped. Going without a destination in sight, it is curious that this movie shows what it looks like. To be indifferent to the homeless people who are beyond the surprising indifference that exists today. <br /> <br /> Sunny sends bacon cooks in an iron pan on the side of the train. (Immediately after the train flew to When considering how close he is to the track, you will think that the guy will go out of the track. But it was not important.) After Sunny stopped eating breakfast because of the sour stare that his joyful smile received from the man, he continued and the homeless man disappeared from the movie. It is interesting to consider what the next movie will do because this thing has lost this poor man. <br /> <br /> No matter what happens, Sonny can hear the dog. Wailing as he passed It and jumped down to find a dog covered with fins It may seem that he will take the dog immediately because he has just left the house for fear of dogs. But it seems that for him, he must be warned that he has no power over his dog. Power over him As soon as he saw a dog that needed help, he overcame his fears. <br /> <br /> Hey, if that's all I had to do, what I had to do was just find a spider. <br /> <br / > It is a very convenient movie that everything works as it should be. But it is cute and fun enough (and as short as it used to be) to be a fun movie We didn't expect the story in the 19-minute movie, but Pardon My Pups also contained a lot of stories and character development in a short time. And there was also a fight scene at the end of the movie that had to make Charlie Chaplin proud. But it is not difficult to see how she will become the most famous child star of all time
