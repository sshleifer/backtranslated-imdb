First of all, in the defense of JOAN FONTAINE, I must say that Ginger Rogers would be a monster as Alyce, an English woman who has a great role in this story. Fontaine created an image that was drawn as a heroine here. But her inexperienced performances were not as good as her performances, and her dance was better than not mentioned. Fortunately, you still do better. <br /> <br /> But here it is ASTAIRE, GEORGE BURNS and GRACIE ALLEN that have been charged the most - and they are great fans of Bern. And Allen will be surprised by Astaire's ease of dance. What is particularly interesting is the big house that won the Hermes Pans an Oscar choreographer. They joined Astaire in what was to be the most creative highlight of the movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I can't say much for the slow pacing of the story - or some outstanding situations that are very demanding. Patience from viewers It must be said that some humor is depressing and the usual romantic misunderstandings that occur in any Fred Astaire movie of this period are traditionally treated. There is only music that shows an increasing need. <br /> <br /> Some delightful Gershwin songs appear again in a moment. But not everyone will receive the treatment they deserve The best supporting actors are Reginald Gardiner, the best in comedy as a servant of Connex Collier and Montagu Love (Joan's father mistaken for a gardener by Astaire). <br /> <br /> When Whatever Burns & Allen is near reminds us how funny they are on radio and television programs Both were surprisingly skilled in keeping the footsteps of Astaire. <br /> <br /> Director George Stevens made sure that the number of dancing on Joan Fontaine's hills and Fred was taken at a reasonable distance. She left her composition as Astaire's dance partner.
