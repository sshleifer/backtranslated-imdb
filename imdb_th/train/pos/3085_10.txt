I watched episodes that were not aired online and I am very sorry that the program will not return. It has a selection of talented and best performers. It seems that every actor is a personal friend in real life. At the end of the program, it is sexy and very engaging. Of course, some of the stories are not realistic, so what ... Every character is cute and you are deeply rooted for them. The show reminded me of a cross between two other favorites: "Sex and the City" and "Felicity". I would like to show appreciation to all the actors. Note to executives ABC: Nielsen's rating report will not show actual results. Most of the audiences will record it. I am very disappointed with the important networks that make us overwhelmed with real TV programs or teen programs. Why must getting content that is mature, generous, and well-behaved? We must change to HBO or FX. I can thank the network for placing the remaining episodes online. New media will be more popular among viewers.
