In the age of fifty years, the age limit of movies in Brazil is as follows: There are no age restrictions for 10 years, 14 years old and 18 years old. Usually Westerners are allowed for ten years when they are Increasingly violent, they will go to 14, but it's hard to see Westerners who are under 18 years old. Winchester 73 is one of them. Well, how is this movie considered different from the average? The hero, James Stewart, is fighting with his brother who killed their father. He is looking for revenge and seems somewhat traumatized, far from good people in general. Anthony Mann tried to change this type of character in the next movie he did with Stewart. Shelley Winters, a leading woman, far from virtue. She continues to follow people who are with Dan Duryea rifles as Waco Johnnie Dean is one of the greatest criminals to remember. The story of a movie that follows people with rifles is often one of the best things for Westerners. It will be created as the movie Fritz Lang, which has not yet passed. When it was proposed to Mann, he started from the center again and did not do anything prepared for Lang. With Winchester Mann creating a different Western concept Winchester is still a great movie that will be seen over and over again. But there is nothing comparable to the impression that has occurred to those who saw it when it was released.
