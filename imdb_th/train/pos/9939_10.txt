This is a cartoon series in which most actions take place in the human body, in which actors are vitamins, viruses, blood cells, etc. I will not try to explain more details. You will have to look at yourself: you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I remember watching a child in the 80s (with Swedish voice). I talked to a few people who were children in the 80s and they loved it too! I have to admit that the education section of the episode didn't pass to me at the conscious level. But the whole idea of ​​teaching children while they have fun is great. I just saw a few episodes. There is humor and heart in it that is rare in other children's programs today. <br /> <br /> 5/5
