I don't know how IMDb sorts the comments. But I know that as often happens on Amazon.com, there are a lot of negative reviews for this movie, which repeats the vague talk point. Campaign or not, only IMDb knows. <br /> <br /> For this movie: Never mind. It's a funny, cute and straightforward movie. <br /> <br /> For over a decade I work in Brooklyn, live in Queens and visit relatives in South Bronx. But I did not find anything unreliable or exploited about these children. Is Grandma a strange character? Yes. Does the conversation and storyline acknowledge this? Yes, thank you. They do. Other movies are located in LES and have Dominican / Puerto Rican children? Do you betcha that makes this movie a crime? As some of the comments (In my eyes astroturf) will recommend? Hardly a thousand plastic flowers come out. <br /> <br /> This is better than any of Degrassi's high JR or Degrassi. Highly mocking when compared, but we never felt that way before and I Experience the essence with the humility of the goal and the gentle spirit of this movie. <br /> <br /> Saying that I like to know the backstory behind this bounce! :-D
