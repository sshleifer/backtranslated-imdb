I believe I received this movie when I was young. I remember watching as a child. But I have never seen this movie. I can remember well. Ol Rageddy Ann, Andy, Babette, the Greedy, King Koo Koo. But one day when I moved out of my childhood home, I found it. We are together I am now 17 years old. I still see it all the time. It's one of the most fun and impressive movies I've seen and enjoyed at the same time. And personally I think they should create a sequel Hmm, yes, it is definitely a sequel. Now I'm considering to have a captain's bird somewhere on my body!
