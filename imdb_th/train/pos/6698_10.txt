I used to love Sabrina The Teenage Witch and saw every episode. I remember when I sat at 18:00 every night and waited for it to come in the jukebox, but when Sabrina left high school, the performance began to decline. The best series must be when she is friends with Valerie. (I'm not sure what kind it is) then the next series (friends with Dreama) are still very good, but when you leave high school, it doesn't seem to be correct. All the main characters seem to be left behind, which means that it doesn't have a very old "spark". However, the first set that Sabrina is in college is still quite good and can be watched. Into their home, it is wrong She is no longer a teenager, so the name of the show is not correct and without Hilda and Zelda and Josh, the show doesn't look right. Thank God that he passed in the last five minutes of the episode that will take her. All in all, I still like to watch the old episodes of Sabrina, a teenage witch, but I think the writer took it too far and should be left with Sabrina out of high school. Because after that the performance certainly lost magic
