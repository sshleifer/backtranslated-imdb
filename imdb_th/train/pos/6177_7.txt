The adaptation of Will Eisner's spirit goes to the TV screen according to many other proposals developed from comic book pages or comic books. (Remember that both are not the same media). Actually, it is ironic that this is only a modification (at the time of this writing) of Alice that is clever. Eisner, intelligent, cracked, extremely intelligent. <br /> <br /> The story looks like the Republic Pictures are interested in making movies and negotiating with the copyright owners in the mid-40s, but they can't close the sale. The rest of the play on the screen became a continuation of the story, THE MASKED MARVEL, one of the best games in the Republic. Sometimes it is also for the studio that has a passion for decorating with materials adapted from cartoons, jokes, radio and comic books. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For years 1987 This was done for TV movies. Obviously it was a pilot that failed for the TV series that was offered. While long-time comic readers, such as myself, may have a little bit of violence in criticizing the adaptation of viewers who are not familiar with the characters, may be able to provide new observations clearly, regardless of what the screen concept is like <br /> <br /> While sitting and watching the story that opens with the characters interacting in the midst of some crime, Little Lady (my wife, Ryan) hammered Send it in one sentence "This thing can't be decided if it's serious or not!" That explains well both the SPIRIT and the creator of Mr. Will Eisner, the true genius creator in the cartoon. <br /> <br /> Sincere to show Eisner's world on the screen Denny Colt / The Spirit's selection, Commissioner Dolan and Ellen performed quite well. Even though it is in a contemporary environment But it is still in the tradition of "good old days". As long as the dress is finished, you know when men and women still wear hats! That leads to the final point. (And crooked) at this point, and that is the director and producer create conscious and successful efforts to make the character Will Eisner look like facial expressions and body language We say glorious for them for their efforts. <br /> <br /> It's terrible that there's no follow-up series! Oh, in the film world today, cartoon adaptations seem to be a hot topic. Perhaps some big producers and directors may produce first-class SPIRIT for large screens. We can hope. <br /> <br /> Updated: Date, Chicago, Illinois 2008/06/04 Now everyone who goes to watch a movie at a multiplex mall can see an advertising poster. The new movie of THE SPIRIT (Title MY CITY SCREAMS); Which will be launched on Christmas Day 2008. Now we will see what we talk about Just keep your finger crossed! Will be continued ............. <br /> <br /> Second update: We watched a new movie, the interpretation of writer-director Frank Miller on THE SPIRIT on the second. Three days before We have received our wishes. But this is a good thing or another case of "Be careful what you ask for; Because you might get it? "Please read our article elsewhere on IMDb.com THANX!
