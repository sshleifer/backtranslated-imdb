I like the quiet noir of the first part, the performances of Pacino and Cusak, especially their scenes together. The mood of the setting and the cohesion of the old pol and the ideal youth are affected. I want Bridget Fonda to have more scenes in the movie. She is a serious and attractive character. This film fell out of the tracks for me when the mayor began to spy on the mafia to the bottom of what his boss apparently didn't want him to interfere with. This is an unbelievable story. Something I didn't understand: Why did the police and Vito have a penalty if the latter sent information that could bring the corrupt judge down?
