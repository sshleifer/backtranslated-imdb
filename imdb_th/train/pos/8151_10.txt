(And belonging to both groups) have a good time to look at the words of this rap culture and the ego, identity / values ​​/ philosophy, pseudo-actors are talented and able to perform superbly in the character that is shown See This song is too funny to believe. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the best pseudo-documentaries to come, including "A Mighty Wind".
