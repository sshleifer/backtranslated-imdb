I remember having watched this movie when it was first released in 1982 and really liked it. About 4 years later, I had the privilege of seeing Luciano Pavarotti singing at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York (in Tosca). Watching the ending of this movie reminds me of a great night. Don't like anything about this movie? The melodious music and Pavarotti (Fini) are the best and still look good. Actually it's very funny in some parts & the 'food fight' scene is still one of the most funny stories I've ever seen. A hot air balloon flight over the Napa Valley is beautiful & is the song that he sings. "If we fall in love" (one of the few times that Pavarotti sings in English) and hears the beautiful Santa Lucia partner. Get the real person. This is a movie about opera singer Georgio Fionini. Which was just born to be played by Pavarotti Kathryn Harrold & Eddie Albert is a great person in the support role this story But I will love this on DVD, especially now. Pavarotti is no longer with us because I think this includes the best performances of Nessun Dorma sung by him still in the movie today!
