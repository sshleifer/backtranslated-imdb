This animated movie (Co-produced between Ireland, Belgium and France) relates to one of the most strange stories of the film: the creation of the 9th century of the famous luminous book of Kells in this amazing storytelling, a young child The name Brendan lived in a monastery ruled by his uncle, the abbot abbot who was concerned about the protection of the temple. The raid comes close to Forest to find a material that shines the name Aidan needs to be done to finish the book. In doing that mission in the forest, he found the help of a friendly fairy named Aisling unexpectedly, elaborately hand-drawn and elaborate. (There are some computer animations in a few important passages) in a way that looks like both Celtic. Art and with the use of creative colors and geometric shapes of all types, this film is uncommonly strange. But it is a strange thing that is different from putting diversity But is an eye opening pattern If anyone would do nighting - beyond some modern times, such as African monks in the 9th century, Ireland? We must say that the combination of Catholic and Celtic heresies in this film has never really been linked. And sometimes cartoon relief is too wide That's why I can't give them the highest rating. But these are minor problems with movies that create great impressions and imagination.
