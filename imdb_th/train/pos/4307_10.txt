Perhaps not before Rodney King's riots But in the past few months is enough My parents said that they saw it and the next thing you knew was that the police were acquitted and that LA was being burned. It shows the status of racial relations in America. The story is white. Mack (Kevin Kline) and Simon-African Simon (Danny Glover) become friends after Simon saves Mack's life in the black slum. Meanwhile, Davis film producer (Steve Martin in a serious role) thinks that the joyful violence is really great ... until he is shot. There is also some existentialism in the movie: Mac and his family know that they are not as they want. <br /> <br /> Looks like "mistakes" have been received. Interested in people in terms of competition This one came out very quickly. Maybe we can't have a stable racial relationship in this country. In any way, "Grand Canyon" is a great movie. It confirms Kevin Kline as my favorite actor, starring Mary McDonnell, Mary-Louise Parker and Alfre Woodard.
