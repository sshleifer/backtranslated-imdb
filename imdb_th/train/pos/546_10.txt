I think it's one of the best sequels I've seen for a while. Sometimes I feel as though I just want someone to die. Stanley, who killed the annoying characters, is great. It's a very good movie that you are happy when you die. My only problem is that in some scenes, it seems that the person with the camera in the house is shooting and it's strange. Judd Nelson is cute, at least in my opinion, and he is excellent in the role as Stanley Caldwell. Great movie
