May and her husband visited children and grandchildren. The visit was awkward because the grandchildren and "kids" didn't seem to know each other as they thought. The warmth that should disappear After dinner, May's husband said that he felt ill, blaming it for his daughter's cooking and that he wanted to go home. He died that night. <br /> <br /> May be a widow. Obviously she was not married passionately or interestingly. But she has a purpose She has someone who wants her, and even though her needs won't be fulfilled for many years. But she has something to do with her day. <br /> <br /> She feels depressed and messy. She went to live with her daughter, Paula, who shortly after her mother arrived, letting her mother know that she never felt that her mother gave herself a lot. She released anger with the mother's lack of attention. May seem disarmed and surprised But she seems to have no energy or desire to make it right "I am your mother and I love you" What is really saying? (I've heard this story from my own mother too many times and still don't understand what it means.) Paula is nervous. (Better than a little) Both women are needy, although they show a lot of different <br /> <br /> Paula is involved with Darren's friend, her son who is a repairman. Nurturing that works in the home of her son while Paula is working during the day. May have a conversation and lunch with Darren. Darren is a married man who lives with his wife because Nicky, an autistic son But should not be with the wife at home. <br /> <br /> may attract Darren She enjoys the connections they seem to have. Darren was attracted in May because she offered peace and understanding that he had not received from other women in his life. (He is also interested in money that may say that she can give him "Escape from everything." Although he was not interested in the desire to join him in this journey, they ended up sleeping together in an empty room. During the day and may enjoy fulfilling as a woman she has never known for many years and never expected to know again while her daughter Paula often told her that she would leave. Darren married What she is doing is ok. <br /> <br /> In the writing group that Paula leads to may be instructed to be forced to live with a widow that she doesn't mind. Have sex With an old man who is barely able to show clearly, and it is truly painful and insecure when we see a disgusting face in May as she suffers only one terrible contact. <br /> <br /> Finally, Paula discovers Her mother painted the exact graphic that her mother and Darren were having sex. <br /> <br /> This film will have many people see in many ways. Sympathy will be divided. At one point between Paula's writing group may reveal a short article that she once felt as if she hated her children at the end of the day and would go to the pub after they slept. Going home before your husband <br /> <br /> Clearly, a good mother doesn't think of leaving her only child while she goes out at the local pub. However, May also revealed earlier in the film that her husband doesn't like having friends, so she doesn't have She did what he wanted her to do. She is a miserable person. But endured it because, as she said "It's easier." Therefore, while May is not the best mother for those who are sympathetic, she may see that May's actions are actions of women who want to have sex and live only a few minutes. In her life. A woman who wants someone to listen, she knows her as a human being to have friends and lovers. <br /> <br /> Paula, though, is nervous and unhappy. Distant parents who raised her Of course, it's not difficult to understand why Paula was completely betrayed by her mother. <br /> <br /> It's a finished movie that is more complicated than I said. Many reactions that may conflict It is a movie that should be worth discussing and debating, and above all that is worth watching. <br /> <br /> One thing that this movie makes us have is horror and fear in a desolate life. No matter who is considered "right" or who is considered 'wrong' by each audience, the theme of old age and loneliness causes fear in most of us that is inevitable.
