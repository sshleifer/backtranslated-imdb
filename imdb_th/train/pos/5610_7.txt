Roman Polanski controls the changes in the same theme as Repulsion. I can't imagine having an honest film director who can't get a good director in Le Locataire, but both parts of the art may not be satisfactory. Most people <br /> <br /> Polanski is very good at making us feel the torture of his character (Deneuve in Repulsion and himself in Le Locataire), starting with a lack of self-confidence. Slow to Will gradually become a mental discomfort in the end The combined tests of the characters and the audience are different from the horror and tension of horror movies because there are no tangible supernatural elements here. While the horror movie allowed to have a belly (Whether it is cheaper or more complex) Polanski has abused us, and if in his opera a dark humor is a permanent matter, we are mostly in our nerves compared to our seats. <br /> <br /> Suspense, horror All of this morale is about playing with the expectations of the audience. (Or fool or fill them), not with people's nerves In my book, Rosemary's Baby is an even greater success because of the paranoia and the reason why it is constantly struggling: stories about pairs that move in strange flats while we are forced to identify with a single character. Moreover, if the fantasy element is in the mind of the hero, the most uncomfortable situation since our audience is forced to judge, he denies him while we are tempted by the expert ("paint 'n lure") as him.
