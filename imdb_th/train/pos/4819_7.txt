Overall, I think it's a very good movie - I hate to use the word 'good' because it's quite dry. But it is very beautiful to see and the middle performance by Rupert Friend and Emily Blunt is very strong. The thing that I like most is that although the beauty of all the costumes and settings are gilded and shiny, this side never enters The center of the film, which is a good and strong writing (thanks to Julian Fellowes: D); There is nothing colorful or too full of pomp. I'm not very excited. (When Victoria was dragged out of bed to let her know that she is now a queen, then you do not receive a less beautiful crown). It walks lightly and every line in the movie is worth <br /> <br /> No doubt that the love between Victoria and Albert is without a doubt that even though it is a fairy tale on the face And friends and blunt do very well to show that these two people 'How easy it is to get together, even for the first time. (My favorite bit is when they come home after hunting and Victoria. That is what the movie is about.) Blunt holds her own beauty as well. She has a face that needs your attention and I can't talk about the outfit you wear - everyone is beautiful if I am blunt. I will have problems with separating them! All the remaining actors perform well. Harriet Walter as Queen Adelaide is highlighted. <br /> <br /> The only answer I have is that it lacks a sense of urgency or an event that may have. Does the movie look more exciting? (It's quite tame) I don't know. I want it. 'Something' happened which would make Victoria pull out the power and prove that she was worth a little more. When she and Albert argue, I love it. I can do it with an amazing time, even though it may be just me. <br /> <br /> Finally, the risk of loving everyone The type of pride and fear in the crown and what will be in such a position, especially in children This may be part of the fact that this movie of Victoria's early life is suitable for what I have written for one of my characters in 'The Sword & The Scion'. Those who follow my book, you can guess how the characters in Victoria reflect how appropriate it is). It may be part of a movie that shows that the government has returned to vain in those days because they do not seem to make. The poor Of the country, which in turn renewed admiration that Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were very active in the domain in this country It makes the government seem useless - I think there isn't much change. <br /> <br /> Blogs in movies and books: http://sempergratis.blogspot.com
