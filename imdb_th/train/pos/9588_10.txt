When Paris was burning out, I didn't care at all. I did not enter the Madonna phenomenon and all popular days I think it will be a camp and stupid. I am wrong about this movie. I watched it after the film was released for ten years and I ran out to buy it. It took me back to the time and place of fun and excitement. I felt like I knew every character personally. The 80's were exciting and the film captured the essence of gay culture. It's a great job! I went on the internet and found that some of the original members of the actors were doing now. But I can't find it all If anyone has any information about the member, please let us know. <br /> <br /> I hope they do another documentary. I like it.
