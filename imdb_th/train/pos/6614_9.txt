I read that this story is not good that the story is not stable that Volckman feels he has failed in some way. <br /> <br /> I disagree. Before proceeding well Well done, not only But only try new techniques But there are also points that should be worth thinking about: Will Amata reduce the value of life? The big question ... <br /> <br /> I saw him trying hard to create feelings and he didn't give up. This is applauding. I am sure that it is an interesting exercise in the creation of such characters. I saw the artist reduce the pattern to a minimum to create strength for a moment. I identify this movie with this. <br /> <br /> Moreover, it is more interesting than the roto-scoping show by Richard Linklater and the story of Volckman is more meaningful than the later story of Linklater about drugs Stick to the old news, everyone knows, but nobody does anything. Renaissance has more than you think. And there are many stories that have many holes that can do better. <br /> <br /> Well done. Volckman works really well.
