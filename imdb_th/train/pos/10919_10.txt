Five Deadly Venoms is not bloody and violent like Story Of Ricky or Super Ninjas, but it has the best sequential fight scenes in film history. Hong Kong director Chang Cheh created what many thought was his masterpiece. This film launched the career of the five men who played poison. Mingo plays another terrible story. He will go to the Super Ninjas anyway. Kuo Chui, who is Philip Kwok, will tell Ricky and Hard Boiled stories. Any sopy sock fans can apperciate this, but I still think it's not as good. Super Ninjas (created by Chang Cheh) but the chopped socks are good and this is one of the best.
