********* Ten in ten stars ********* <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that this is a TV movie. The phrase "made from TV" makes me tremble. gray The production cost for television movies is lower than the production cost for professional movie studios almost every time. That being said, "Christmas Carol". This model should be released in the cinema because it is a good thing. It is my personal favorite in the movie. "Christmas Carol" because all aspects of this production are of the highest quality. Yes, there are a few mistakes on the screen that have two ghosts visiting Scrooge, but there are no real movies that have at least two mistakes. <br /> <br /> Scott, the top performance Visited as Scrooge. He is happy to see. In fact, I can't think of a single performance in this movie that shouldn't be applauded. Taking pictures of places and winter scenes is fascinating. Music scores are loved and warm. Added to that strong director, perfect film and honest script; We have here one day to be considered a classic holiday. It's not long enough to be a classic. But marking my words one day soon will be a movie that has become an annual Christmas tradition in my home because it reflects the true meaning of Christmas: love, unselfishness and giving. In a selfish world, grabbing my family and I can lose myself in "The Christmas Carol" starring George C. Scott.
