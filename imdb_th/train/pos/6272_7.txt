<br /> <br /> I saw once. No Man's Land (1987) - IMDB link http://us.imdb.com/Title?0093638 - and found that it works. This film is about only men who stole Porsches, disappearing in sixty seconds after 13 years and nothing more. In fact, there are many scenes that are worthless. And the ending is terrible. <br /> <br /> The Sphinx has a magnetic screen that should be used better ...
