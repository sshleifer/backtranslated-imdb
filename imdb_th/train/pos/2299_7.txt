Anyone who says that horror is not an educational film, right? Thanks to the excellent Hammer short film. Now I know, at least, never let a strange visitor say that a wine and a piece of bread and salt in my house because he might be hypnotized and this combination will make He has control Mind and mind forever! Thanks hammer! The tenth episode in the House of Horror series is another story that I'm looking forward to seeing, mainly because the men in the director's chair are Don Sharp. One of the best filmmakers in the UK But still sadly insulting Sharp is responsible for the cool Hammer movies such as "Kiss of the Vampire" and "Rasputin: The Mad Monk", including the overlooked productions such as "Dark Places" and "Psychomania". His participation in the House of Horror is one of the best in the series with a complex storyline. But interesting and revolving according to a delightful mystery theme The plot focuses on the dealers of two antiquities that stumble upon strange objects similar to mirrors. But actually it's an ancient sweeping device that can be used to call Choronzhon; Guardian of the devil of hell The mirror is very much needed by Satanism because they need it for ceremonies. But Michael hesitated to sell it before knowing the true value of the device When he took the young woman who was afraid of running out of cults to avoid losing, Lamai was drawn deep into the conspiracy. Satanism and eroticism of young women is a typical British horror story. But David Fischer's screenplay was never boring and there were many offers. There is also an admirable tension, dialogue with flair and excellent performances. (Especially John Carson as the leader of the cult is truly eerie). Recommended!
