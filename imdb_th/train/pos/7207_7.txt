I entered Deathtrap, expecting horror movies. And while being something like this movie is; I can not help But thought it was only a detective of a poor man Obviously, the 1972 classic movie inspired the film. Not only in terms of plot But of course it is the case that is being implemented. Michael Kane's casting in an important role is just a confirmation. This film is based on the drama of Ira Levin. (Who had previously written Rosemary about Baby and The Stepford Wives) and focused on Sidney Bruhl; The playwright has the best day behind him. After playing his latest bomb, Sidney found himself at a low level; And this was not helped when the drama titled Deathtrap; He was written by an amateur that he taught to his door. Deathtrap is a guarantee of commercial success and soon Sidney began planning his own story. Which involves inviting amateur writers around to kill him and sending Deathtrap into his own work. <br /> <br /> Despite the twists and turns that are wise, Deathtrap matches one key element and that is itself. Drama The movie failed to create a cute character and it was very difficult to focus on the story when you didn't take root for one player. This does not help in the performance. Michael Caine creates good and fun work as you expect. But no one is proud of himself Christopher Reeve felt embarrassed in his role as Dyan Cannon tried to make the character ugly, ugly, only one by acting annoying. Fortunately, the story is good. And it is good enough to help this movie The story has many twists and turns. Some work is better than other work, but there is enough to do to make sure that this movie is interesting. Director Sidney Lumet deserves credit as well because the style of this movie is another advantage. The central location is interesting in itself and the movie that fits this movie. Overall, I have to admit that I enjoy this movie; But it should be much better
