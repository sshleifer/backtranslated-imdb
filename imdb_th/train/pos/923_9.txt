I never saw it on tv But rented a DVD via Netflix as soon as I found it available I have high expectations and I am not disappointed. It's funny and the animation is great. That quality level I expect from a documentary film only, so I was surprised by some bad comments about it Maybe the release of the DVD is better? One bonus of the DVD is that it's fun to see both pilots. I am an adult and I am really grateful that it is for adults. It's not just kids who like cute cartoon characters. It is nowhere near "obscene" as some people claim. But I can see that some parents do not want children to see me. Very disappointed that was canceled. I hope they will produce more episodes. Or maybe a movie
