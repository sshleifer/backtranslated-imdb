My family watched Arthur Bach stumble and stutter since the movie came out for the first time. We have the most memorization lines. I watched it two weeks ago and still get the comedy and life perspective that Dudley Moore played as Liza Minelli did an excellent job as a sidekick, even though I wasn't her big fan This movie makes me enjoy watching movies. My favorite scene is when Arthur is visiting his fiance's house. His conversation with the butler and Susan's father is spitting on the side. Line from the butler "You want to wait in the library" and follow Arthur's answer. "Yes, I will leave the bathroom. The question" is the notification NEWMAIL on the computer. "Arthur is truly a" joke "!
