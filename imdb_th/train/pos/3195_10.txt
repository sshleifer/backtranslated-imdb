THE BEAVER TRILOGY is one of the best movies ever. I was lucky enough to receive it with questions & answers with director Trent Harris at the NY Video Festival a few years ago. Then bought a copy of the Trent website. This movie must have faith to see! I sincerely recommend searching Trent's name on the website and then buying movies from his website. He is incredibly good to boot. Don't be confused: The cameraman in the fictional part of THE BEAVER TRILOGY is not Trent! <br /> <br /> After seeing the ending a few times, I have to admit that I may be able to do without Sean Penn. It's like a trial version for Crispin Glover's "Orkly Kid" and More interesting is a curious list if you are a Penn fan rather than a good video. Although Penn is quite funny and you can see the salary of a big star in this awesome B&W video, <br /> <br /> This may be one of Crispin Glover's best roles and I like to see Update Original documentary about Groovin 'Gary. When you watch this movie, you will never have a laugh out of Gary's head anymore.
