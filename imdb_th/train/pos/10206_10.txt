In the year that I attended a film festival, I saw many small movies like this that never had a theater and they ended up with a $ 3 trash at WalMart. I just found the Yank Tanks DVD there. It's great. But it was so sad that it became a remnant. <br /> <br /> I love this movie very much. It is everything I want New Yorker Films to translate names directly. It is good that the American people stretch slightly. If the name of the movie allows the audience in the United States to better explore random chaos The movie imitates life and the visa in return. <br /> <br /> In addition, I find it distracting that the subtitles make the price in dollars! The euro is not difficult to figure out, making viewers who like to do math. Watching a movie, especially one photograph in Paris, the audience should not be affected by being warned: I'm an American who looks at movies and they are converting me to dollars. <br /> <br /> Looking forward to seeing more of these actors and more from writers and directors as well.
