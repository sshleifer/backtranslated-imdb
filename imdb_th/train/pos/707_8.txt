Must be honest and say that I have never seen independent movies before But I think this movie is doing very well Directions and movies are engaging without having to distract. The setting and lighting angles used to create the nightmare world that the main character has successfully attached Many hallucinations and memorable moments from this movie are stuck in your heart after it has ended.
