Someone said that "Right at the right time." It is true for this documentary that I have doubts about the truth of the scene and think that it may include some performances but it's not. It's true. This is nothing new for people in developing countries and / or poor countries. It clarifies how to deal with people by corporate media, human polarization misinformation, deliberately creating tension on the streets, sometimes to the point that the army, intelligence agencies or even the government. (Many people believe led by United States) use agents that attack "any" to provoke violence The naval officer in the movie mentioned this too. They want to see people facing the street. All these situations are played in Turkey. (US pet dog in the Middle East) throughout the history with 3 experiences, and recently, a secret plan made by the Turkish army has been revealed through the religious / conservative media of the government. Opposed to the religious doctrine of the army, which the very important mosque was bombed by army officials to stimulate people, etc. <br /> <br /> The thing that makes this movie is that they are filmed from Sometimes Accidentally when an event occurs Obviously, the director is a professional Chavez. Regardless of whether this will allow directors to filter and manage events and information, I don't know. <br /> <br /> And whether Chavez will protect the people of Venezuela and the dictatorship of the United States and the world economy without or not Suppressing any opposing thoughts with power and ultimately becoming a self-indulgent tyrant, history will tell <br /> <br /> But at least Chavez is hoping and I believe it's worth it. Will get a chance
