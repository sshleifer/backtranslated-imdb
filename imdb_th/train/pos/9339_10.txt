For those of you who do not refer to it, clubberin is 4 punches, one body ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, following the review <br /> <br /> I miss WCW Saturday night during the wrestling period. I love going on this stage. I remember watching Steve Austin amazing, Rick Rude, Brian Pillman, Cactus Jack, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, DDP on his work day, Lord Steven Regal, Harlem Heat, Ricky Steamboat, STING. Everyone's name. The point is, WCW has an excellent roster in the days before Hogan and they're producing television programs for entertainment. Dust Rhodes, in a comment later in the year, gave me a new reason to watch when I started smoking as a teenager ... I hope Vince will put him on the mic for the show or maybe twice. Great American Bash? They are CLUBBERIN! DA PLUNDA here! He's wonderful. <br /> <br /> -DirrTy
