I remember that the trailer for the Legend of Zu was quite impressive and was a fan of A Man Called Hero (My Favorite Forever) Storm Riders. I decided that I had to watch this. I know there are many criticisms about Ekin Cheng's acting abilities everywhere, but he is Hong Kong's most favorite actor until now. (Better way than Nicolas Tse) There is no doubt that this film is an art from beginning to end. I still think that only actors are real and everything is a computer created at the end of this movie. They have to work a lot and they deserve good credit for that. The story of this movie is a fairy tale between good and evil, with a love story that has been thrown in (I guess Ekin Cheng pulls out women easily). But that's not what you expect I hope there will be martial arts with fists and fists over the magic fighting abilities. But that is life and it never goes the way you want And why do they hear the sound of a supersonic plane in the battle through the sky? That's a funny way too. The Legend of Zu can't be a man called the hero in my eyes. But it flows like a video game and that's not a bad thing. If the company decides to publish the game in this movie, I won't be surprised because it consists of all video game elements. Good work. Please create another fantasy movie like this.
