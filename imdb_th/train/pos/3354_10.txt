Finally, this movie came out in DVD format in Italy (completely restored). I have watched this movie many times and I found that it actually happened today (2003) when Italy suffers from The brainwashed dictatorship (or the United States) I'm glad that people have been evicted, while Mastroianni plays the role of this movie that can sing. Maybe they taught Sophia Lorens of this world how to be strong and fight to be accepted as human. <br /> <br /> Go back to see the movie: because most people mentioned that performance Great. Surprising. I have to assume that, unfortunately, there is something missing if you don't understand Italian. But I can assure you that the expression of mania, distortion of reality in a radio event in the past that Hitler visited Rome can really make you shake! <br /> <br /> Masterpiece! <br /> <br />
