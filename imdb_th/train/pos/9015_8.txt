At first, this person came from England, so of course I had a 98% chance to be a smart and very good movie theater. I have never heard of this before. From the minute I saw Helena Bonham - Carter, I said to myself: Oh! This is My Left Foot. The female version. I'm right, but I was wrong because the two films are very different. My left foot is the same movie of John Ford and this movie is the same for Chaplin. (Not because it's funny But Chaplin felt the melancholy of your tears.) Correct, because in the 1990s Lewis came back a little ugly by playing as a disabled person and he did it with a good feeling. This place is very beautiful. Bonham-Carter Do the same thing But has a very feminine temperament The story is well written and very smart for me. Miss Bonham-Carter Be part of the greatest woman of the year 1990 by Emily Lloyd in Breaking The Waves Gee! And look at her eyes! She has the most beautiful eyes of the cinema from Jobyna Ralston, Louise Brooks, Michele Morgan and Ava Gardner! She is also a true talent as seen in many other movies. See here. You won't regret! And it's a great job for Branagh as well!
