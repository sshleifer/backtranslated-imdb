When I think of 'Women in Prison', my thoughts are usually Italian / Spanish productions by director Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei; And while these movies are often very lazy, they are also very similar and when you see You may see them all. I have to admit that this type of movie is generally not my favorite. But in reality, the idea of ​​women behind bars is doing very well many times outside Italy and Spain. And the new world picture of Roger Corman responsible for some of the best things. Caged Heat is the first release of director Jonathan Notre. The director is Oscar and is a well-made movie with lots of entertainment. ! Usually this film focuses on the story of a girl who was caught as a criminal and sent to a women's prison. This prison is controlled by a wheelchair tied to the director of the queen. And she was wrong playing by the girl; Bring them to the escape plan. <br /> <br /> This film is lighter than fear than I had been a woman in a prison that flicked; But this is more than an offset scene for action scenes and great conversations. It must be said that the plot is not particularly original or ambitious and generally follows a structure similar to other women in prison movies that came before it; But that's not a big problem. This film has never been bored and filled with great scenes. Including trying to escape while working in the fields and robbing the bank This film is assisted by the direction director who is sure to receive the masterpiece of The Silence of the Lambs and the great performers with many great qualities; Including the ultimate legend of Barbara Steel in the role of prison guards. Overall, Caged Heat may not make the viewer think much at the end. But it is a fun, slightly flick, and those who love this type of movie have to follow it for sure
