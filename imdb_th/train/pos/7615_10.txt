This program is one of the greatest programs on television. I mean, an excellent performance, anxiously, a comedy. It has everything and has a simple story like a plane crash on the island. The character is very good and Evangeline Lilly is hot !!!!!! Matthew Fox shows us again that he is a great actor. Josh Holloway is great. Jorge Garcia is hilarious. This unexpected plot turned out to be the back story of the music character at the end of every episode. JJ Abrahms once again proved that he was a great writer and producer. I mean, it's better than ALIAS and I love ALIAS. Anyone who doesn't watch this program should consider getting a DVD and watching because they lack great things. This show may be the best show in television history !!
