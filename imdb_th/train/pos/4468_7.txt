Two crews were donkey-men, Joseph Brady (Gene Kelly) and Shy Virgin, Clarence Doolittle. (Frank Sinatra) They meet with beautiful Susan Abbott. (Kathryn Grayson) and the couple fell in love with her, but you might guess. <br /> <br /> The story (even the musicals in the 1940s) is ridiculous and everything is fine and Wholesome - annoying quickly This movie is too long. It took 140 minutes and it was too much for a foolish story. There are also boring numbers by Jose Iturbi and his orchestra. <br /> <br /> If you are dancing or Sinatra or Grayson is singing There are no songs that are especially memorable. But Sinatra has a beautiful voice that you don't have to pay attention to. It was shot with Technicolor that is full of MGM's luster. The performance is OK - Kelly is a good person. (Although he saw that he was a pushing woman) and Sinatra was great. Grayson didn't do anything. But she looks incredibly beautiful Some of her pictures made me breathe out! There are many highlights here: Sinatra and Kelly dance and sing a lot. Sinatra sings anything, Grayson's two songs and the famous animation sequence that Kelly beats with Jerry - an animated mouse! Tom made the same funny pendant. There is also a small Dean Stockwell who stole every scene he entered. <br /> <br /> So it's too long and the plot doesn't stop. This is a very popular game of that time.
