Last night I saw this movie at a special theater that was shown in NÃ¼rnberg and it was great. I have to admit that the original music elements of the cello players and the percussion / xylophone players have influenced the mood of this film. But the movie itself is effective in the image of the tragic Nibelungen fairy tale. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in silent movies or in Nibelungenlied I would like to recommend this movie. The costume is excellent and the outfit is full of novelty and the performance is amazing and amazing. (Typical of the silent film about "Tragedy") Unfortunately, I didn't see the first part of the couple. This film is related to Siegfried. The story of this second film begins after Siegfried's death when Kremhild (Gudrun in the Norse version of the story) begins planning revenge on her and her brothers. <br /> <br /> In addition, I also watch the movie. This is also German. I am a native speaker and have basic German knowledge. It's hard to read or not. Subtitles (You now call that thing in silent movies) At first, because the old German script, so I suggest that if you look in German, you must make sure you can separate "k's", "f's" and "s's. "In the old script :)
