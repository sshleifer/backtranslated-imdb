Young Victoria is a beautiful film and has presented Queen Victoria in a different angle than everyone thinks about her. The movie wiped Queen Victoria's "I'm not fun" impression and showed that she was a cheerful young woman. <br /> <br /> When I love history, especially Victoria history This movie advertised. I was very excited and counted down until the day it came to the cinema. I was a little worried that it would be wrong in the past. But it is and i love it I discovered new facts about Queen Victoria that had never been known before and it made me very interested. <br /> <br /> Queen Victoria in many lights is one of the greatest kings of all time. we What is your true personality and life? She was treated badly by her mother's advisor, Sir John Conroy, because he wanted England to have a regent. This is what inspired Victoria to be an amazing queen that she is! The love between her and Albert is very deep and this is done very well by Emily Blunt and fellow Rupert, both of whom are great! Young Victoria is the heart of the love story. But at the same time, looking good in the important parts of British history ... I love it !!!!!!!!! 10/10 ... No doubt!
