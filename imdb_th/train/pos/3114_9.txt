I will make this story quite short, so don't waste anything for you. This movie is excellent. From beginning to end, it is full of real excitement. The fighting scene is great. The chase scene is exciting and it moves according to the moment it feels really slow until the end. When things are described, Damon shines and proves to be an actor Very strong. You dare not believe him in this chapter. He is this role. Also welcome in the series in David Straithrain (hopefully I'm spelled as close to the right) as a brave CIA agent, killing Bond. This thing doesn't stop and will make you sit on the edge of the seat. Something that reaches the end is just a nasty little thing. The ending is left for the sequel and I hope that they will consider doing more of these things because no one is bad. Great movie in every story and a great ending to an amazing ending. <br /> <br /> PS The shaky cam doesn't hurt any action, but I still think we can do it by did not do anything The good news is that you will notice only when people are talking about and not doing much.
