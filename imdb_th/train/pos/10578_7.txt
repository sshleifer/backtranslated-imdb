"Footlight Parade" is just one of the exotic musicals that Warner Brothers produced in the early 1930s to prevent depression. "42nd Street" and the Golddiggers series were produced in the era This too, and they were truly created. Millions of Americans forgot their problems for a while. The great talents of Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell are the only Foolight Parade that has an incomparable James Cagney. Almost ten years before his most famous "Yankee Doodle Dandy" music. Here he dances in the traditional form of dance, most of his arms tend to fall at his side and his legs make waves and kicks of all types. It's easy to see that he enjoys himself and that makes us enjoy him even more. <br /> <br /> While almost every sequence of songs appears at the end of the movie. I believe that this movie was created before the installation of the production code, so some costumes and scenes are a little more interesting. But it's all fun. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter what the plot of the movie is, just knowing that it has both laughter and top performers. In addition to those mentioned above, Guy Kibbee is still here. Excellent here. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
