I went to watch this movie, expecting to be a horror movie. What I received was fear after scare. It's a horror movie that is the core. It's not as boring as any other horror movie that has a haunted house. But ghosts and blood This film doesn't show you the most death that shows the fear of the characters. I think one of the best things about the concept is not just a house that haunts anyone who enters the house. They become haunted no matter where they are. Office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms ... etc. After reading reviews from outside, I was really surprised that the critics didn't like this movie. I will go to see again this week and get excited about it. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie with 10 stars because it did what horror movies should It makes me very scared.
