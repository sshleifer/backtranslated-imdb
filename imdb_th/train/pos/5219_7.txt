Gere and Danes are two employees in the public safety department that tracks the sex offender who was released. Gere, the player of Babbage, refers to them as his flock. He is the new Allison's trainer. To get his job, Gere sees his sheep very sick and disturbed. He asks questions that are not on the list and tries to act like a cop and solve crime. He was constantly warned for this behavior, so the reason he was replaced During his last few days of work, the young girl disappeared and Bab√© was confident that it was one of his flocks that went astray. He and Allison narrowed the list and discovered that some offenders were awarded the AWOL. So he decided that he wanted to follow the missing woman instead of helping the police. <br /> <br /> There is something distorted and sick in this movie, such as when Babbage and Allison go to this building where a lot of people do things that interfere with each other. There are also people who kidnapped the girl. At the end of the movie, we see what they are crazy about. However, I will not call this movie too much because it will not appear on the film. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: If you like thriller and movies about serial killers and police chase the killer.
