Something about "Polly" touching my heart like some movies It's a witty, funny and emotional movie. I was a late fan of this movie. I didn't see "Paulie" until May 2004 and ordered from a wide-screen DVD from an eBay seller. <br /> <br /> Special techniques for performing Paulie's speech. That is great My son asked me how many birds knew the phrase. My favorite part of this film was when Polly was in the company Gena Rowlands (Ivy) followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) had a great role. As a man with a good heart You are deeply rooted for him along the way. <br /> <br /> You can't go wrong to rent or buy this movie !!
