Don't be fooled by stupid people. This is a sweet driving! The true successor of Tetsuo the Iron Man and Ichi the Killer, this gem begins with a bang and places the blood on thick, until the credit rolls. It seems that aliens are taking over people's bodies and altering them into a war machine that will be used to fight each other in a distorted game for the enjoyment of their race. The winner of the fight to eat a loser Mostly it is a plot. But who will be interested in this good blood? I don't know how many slime buckets are used. But it's disgusting to see There is an interesting and effective stop-motion when the occupation is progressing and caring for love is filled with living things, and CGI makeup has a few limitations but actually does not deviate. Pay attention to the overall quality, at least for me This film is a truly fun and boring film that deserves a lot of praise and is truly a classic cult position. Search and watch, you won't be disappointed!
