Good for evening entertainment - but the plot is not reliable. Garrison's relationship with the First Lady was not true and without feeling. The president was cutting cardboard. And who is the real villain? No development or adequate explanation I still don't know why they want to kill the president or how the mole is involved. The villain has no name and has not yet developed, so you never feel involved with this. Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland try hard to insert reality into the story - the chase and the encounter are good, but Kim Basinger and Eva Longoria did not believe in their roles. Basinger lacked the character entirely and Longoria was not able to represent the Secret Service. This may be a very good movie. But somehow missed the way with too many unanswered questions Disappointing in the overall picture, although there are some very good scenes And do they use the 'West Wing' set for the White House scene? - I expect CJ or Charlie to appear!
