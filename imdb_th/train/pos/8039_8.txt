Sniper gives a real new meaning to war movies. I remember movies about Vietnam or World War II. Lots of shooting. Everybody dies. Bam Bam "Sniper" leads the war to the next level or refinement. This film expresses all the emotions that have a definite purpose - human uselessness in the wild, the hatred and trust that occurs between Beckett and Miller and the hustle of the moment they pull the trigger Movies with a low budget seem to be happening for every flaw with action, suspicion and excitement, because when it comes down, it's just one shot.
