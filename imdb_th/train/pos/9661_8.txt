After losing Emmy for her performance as Mama Rose on GYPSY television, Betty won the Emmy Award the following year for BETTE MIDLER: DIVA LAS VEGAS, a special concert filmed at HBO from Las Vegas Midler. The live stage performer since 1970 proved that she is still one of the most exciting live actors in the business. From her classic "Friends" opening number, where she descended from the wings of a beautiful cloud pole, Betty ordered the stage with style and talent from rap numbers called "I Look Good". Proving that she has a funny voice like other actors in this business, as she breaks her way through a variety of musical choices In the part of the performance that she revered, mocked for too long But she manages to combine her old Sophie Tucker jokes here for good benefits. (Although she forgot one of the jokes in the middle of telling it But her ad libbing until she remembers that it was madness.) Bette treats us as "Rose's Turn" from GYPSY and the title song from her ROSE, including unscrupulous plugs for her hit movie THE FIRST Wives CLUB makes her home near the end with "Stay with Me, Baby" from THE ROSE and is her number one hit "Wind Beneath My Wings" from BEACHES. It's a night of entertainment, music, comedy and for fans. Midler. It's something to do.
