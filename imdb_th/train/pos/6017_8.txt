There is no way to confront 'Zabriskie Point' from a reasonable standpoint or try to explain using words and conventions that you use for other movies. This is because it's not a movie. It is the thought and feeling that the filmmaker has transformed into a film-like object. What we see is not the revelation of the story. But is a sequence of events that we haven't seen in movies every day But only imagine that when the background that we are ourselves will procure when we hear about the tragic events in the news or from friends, we see the imagination of the people that are abstract with us. No one knows. But we have never heard of these things before in books or on TV or somewhere Then what do we see event that happens We see people arguing, driving and escaping inevitably. There is only an escape from the intangible things - it is the overall situation and the cruelty that the mass of civilization has allowed to exist, even if lazy or ... human nature. In the late 1960s, our Los Angeles players acted against and responded to the self-suffering of modern existence. These creatures are powerful empty slates that can show the characteristics that we can imagine if we want. Although actions that may be viewed as criminals or not responsible But the character is not a criminal They are human beings who seek to return to an unfamiliar existence that does not occur beyond the normal conditions they encounter every day. Not that they are happy or sad But they achieved their own reality when they moved from the suicide of modern life They succeeded in real life in the natural world, even though they were the next victims of the present existence. At the end, 'Zabriski Point' is a compliment attached to humanities and the natural world. While the world's most desolate parts succumb to our progress, we lose our souls on the path to the death of the human spirit.
