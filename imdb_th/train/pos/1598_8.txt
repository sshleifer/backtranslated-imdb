Whether I like the plot of the formula in this movie or not. I have visited many times and it always holds up. Looks too cool for some people But I think any opera lover will love it. Norman Jewison, a Canadian friend, has a tremendous opportunity with his movies and casting, and it usually pays in movies that are not in the middle and delicious either Like this I doubt Cher's acting role. Often, whether she chooses to reduce this part of her life or she doesn't get a role that is good enough to chew I find that she is a great actress who can escape to the same role as this person or is loud and brave and fierce like in "Mask". I sometimes find funny rhythms (called hair salons). that "Cinderella"), but this is the intention of both the writer and director Nicolas Page to play as a lifelong opera full of exaggerated gestures at one point calling for a knife to break the neck He himself Brooklyn scenes are magical. This is Brooklyn, under the moonlight, romantic and amazing like an opera. All in the movie that is very satisfying without having to taste everyone by shooting for a long time. I love the ending. Everyone brings like a Greek singer, all parts that are delicate and harmonious with others. 10
