This is one of the best performances of standing up. EVER. Eddie is outside the wall where I watched this damn program for almost five years and it still rocks every time. Everything from his vast physical jokes to the trivial stories that are at the top of words from the brain. You don't have to look further than this line. "The word Herb. You say erb, and we say herbs, cuz ther is f ### ing h in there." Bright.
