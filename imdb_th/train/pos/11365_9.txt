Okay, let's start by saying that this movie is not the exact offense and the pursuit of Andrei Chikatilo's law as it may be. In the Politburo that is lagging behind, there are no serial killers. In fact, the legal system has managed others and "Killer X" (as he was actually called) and was found when bringing Fetisov Burakov in the case As soon as they realized that they had murdered many times in their hands, the authorities assigned dozens of officers to find and stop killing men who were not suitable for what was seen as As usual serial killer parameters as well as the director and writer, reminded the audience that this is the only constant. "According to the real event" for this documentary is not true. <br /> <br /> *** Follow the spoiler **** <br /> <br /> This is a good example of the movie. Hollywood style thriller that still gets the basics of what happened. It's easy to follow and has enough truth to make the viewing interesting. Yes, Chikatilo rapes and kills both children and adults, both men and women. Yes, low-cost experiments allow him to be free to kill for many years. Yes, innocent men are accused of murderers and "confess" to crimes that police demand. Yes, the gay community has been harassed while crimes committed crimes (Although there was a rescue from Buracov) About the truth and truth, in addition to all these events, is a drama in a manner that tightens tension and fear regularly. <br /> <br /> That the director and co-author Chris Gerolmo has a perfect actor. Stephen Rea's growing emotional involvement in the killing and development of expertise in investigating clues to the offensive actions of Donald Sutherland about the Soviet party's hacking and the fragile spine that is obvious when needed. The excitement of the children of Von Sydow as part of all criminal investigations makes sharp conversations and sharp fixes in ways that cannot be evaluated. <br /> <br /> Take action on things. Which is "Citizen X" almost perfect "almost" because the moment of self-congratulation at the end is not appropriate) highly recommended that the novel is a story that has been told not the truth The presentation ... but considering the film. "Serial killers" that Hollywood often spit out are good enough for me.
