I picked up the movie without a lid and didn't even know what it was. But when I watched it, I laughed so hard. It is now one of my favorite movies of all time. Rusty and the masterpiece makers. I would like to recommend this movie to people with humor Thank you Rusty, who gave us something to laugh at.
