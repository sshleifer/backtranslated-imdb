That's not a movie review. But it is a comment about how we blinded our past. <br /> <br /> Recently, I watched Winter Soldier and The Ground Truth. It's like watching a remake or sequel - except it's about Iraq. Vietnam is similar to the Winter Soldier because it is a one-sided message. Both films show that we are willing to participate in the conflict based on hypocrisy and allow our children and brave people. (And innocent), both of these films show that the mind is applicable to the minds of young people and willing to make them an effective killing tool. But training is not enough to teach the diplomatic skills and treatments needed to overcome the struggle for. In the end, this is what has lost the war in Vietnam and should be defeated in the war in Iraq. <br /> < br /> My only negative opinion is that this film has one aspect that can be easily passed as a left-wing propaganda. Not by myself, you are the heart But by people who are determined to discredit movies and news A more balanced view will speak to a larger audience.
