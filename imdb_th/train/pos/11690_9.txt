This movie I'm going to die to see. Now it was decided to rent it. It was completely worth it. This movie makes me laugh from the beginning to the end. Chris Rock is a funny person, no matter which movie he will come in. However, this should approach his best If you are looking for family movies such as pre-teens and higher, this is something you can't pass.
