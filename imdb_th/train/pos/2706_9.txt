I saw this film at the Brussels International Film Festival. I met the film director too. I heard that Ed Wood wrote the story in 10 years! I'm sure he thinks he will be his masterpiece - his success. <br /> <br /> If you take this movie seriously (Like Khun Wood does) It's one of the worst movies. And this is cool. The great joke of I Woke Up Early, the day I died is that it didn't try to be a good movie. <br /> <br /> This makes the movie very good The script is full of destruction and anarchy - a lot of black humor. Billy Zane's role is really great. You will see that this is a high art ... or low waste. <br /> <br /> **** / *****
