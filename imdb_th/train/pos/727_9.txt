One of the best, if not the best rock and roll movies ever. And it's not just ridiculous fun There are many clever jokes in there. Of course, I love Ramones, but with the theme "Anarchy" and "I hate high school", the film doesn't get too serious, which is a great thing about it. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie once. first The spring of 1980 and I saw it again recently. Since I went to high school in the 1970s, it made me feel like <br /> <br /> As I said that this movie didn't think about that. Seriously and not pretending like other teenage fares of seventy-eight and ninety. And when talking about it, it's not dirty or disgusting as well. PG rating only. That's hard for movies in this category. Excellent classics and truly amazing time capsules
