After reading the comments many times, I felt that I had to add in my two cents as well. "Missing sadness" is one of the most memorable shorts that I think I've seen. I had the opportunity to see this at the New York Independent Film Festival. I feel that this film is beautiful and incredibly emotional. The story is extremely complicated, especially in a short period of time. This story focuses on the girl who is the victim of her inappropriate father. Soon she was chosen to "stop" him by the demon played by "Eric Etebari of the Witch". After watching the program, I was very impressed with the way he played the characters that are unique and different I never knew he was doing well! His character is very complicated and he is very persuasive. His performance was really great. The woman is ok and the father is good. There is also death in this story that follows women around until she can escape from her future. The impact and shooting of the movie is really incredible. I wonder if they have a budget of at least one hundred thousand times or not. It is difficult for you to see high quality short images. The launch was amazing when compared to the popular documentary. This is not to say that it is not flawless - I think it takes a little time to start and the call is long. But this thing stuck in my head after watching for many days There are very few shorts with this quality.
