In the words of trade and In this 'light wars', John Cusack played the killer Hauser brand sent to 'Turaqistan' to bring Omar Sharif out of the oil business to create problems for the former vice president of our own company. This, Hauser will have to juggle his fake position as a manufacturer of wedding fairs for the pop girl Yonica. (Hillary Duff) and a liberal journalist named Natalie (Marisa Tomei) <br /> <br /> Technical side: <br /> <br /> - The performance (by the main character, at least) is very good as it should be. John Cusack's dialogue, some of whom clearly did not write for him, because he often felt uncomfortable speaking ... may be unrealistic, more accurate. JoAnn shows great work and is often hilarious. Marisotomi, while I was never a big fan of her, was perfect for the script and worked well. However, Hillary Duff is very scary. They want an attractive Middle Eastern pop star. (Or Russian or whatever accent is highlighted). Unfortunately, they go with her for 0 to 3. <br /> <br /> - As I said above, the writing looks a little bit and doesn't match the point. Only the dialogue of John Cusack Not a lot of ideas, but something. The story still has a little laughing point, which is good for satire at one point. But it returned to a whole new level. Here, luckily, the Cusacks and Tomei have always looked cool and calm, and that makes a mix of movie madness and actor's leadership. <br /> <br /> <br /> - Joshua Seftel, who was earlier The drought of true credit for his name works well with movies quite broadly. He manages a small budget ($ 10 million) as well, stretching it so that it seems to be more. Seftel can also blend the humor of the story very well .. with a painful and difficult part to see the real war. (Including killing civilians, etc.) <br /> <br /> - as long as the general words continue Very well done, especially the 'Golden Palace Poker' ads on American tanks. At that point it will become too small. But in the end it still correctly portrays what it will be in the style of the style. 'Mel Brooks' young <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is very much. Well done for a limited budget and it is definitely worth watching. It will not go down as one of the great satirical movies. But not the worst. <br /> <br /> 7/10
