I think it's a pity that the top comments in this movie have the words "Innocent and frightening nonsense" I think it's a great comedy and entertainment. We have to suppress their unbelief that lesbian and male love men may fall in love, have children, and live together happily forever. But it was great to see it playing in movies and having a warm heart Isn't it possible? There are many unbelievable events described in other films. Good acting script is a joke. The only negative opinion is that the story may end when the family drives out of the first house instead of explaining whether the man is still remaining homosexual.
