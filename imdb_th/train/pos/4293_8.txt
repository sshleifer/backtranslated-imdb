Alain Chabat is a good actor, writer and director. But it may be a little misunderstood that the 'idea' credit for the story that may cause them to roll in the path when Aristophanes still learns that it is 'i' before 'e' Except after 'c', but as I said, Chabat is a good actor and he can be charming when he wants I also gradually beat my hatred towards Charlotte Gainsbourg, a successful work. If you absolutely insist on knowing that the 'plot' is a story about this man who is only forty of his age and more than content to be single. This did not sit with his mother and five sisters and freed them. Then he 'managed' with his colleague's sister to make money - fifteen thousand euros - being his new girlfriend. Achieved by marriage and angered him so he asked him to leave the hook. By nature, they gather together. But on the way there was a sub-battle of Benedict and Beatrice, and everything was thought to be a painful ninety minute and very well done at the French box office that the sequel might not be suspicious.
