I rate this movie 7/10, which is an average of 8/10 for screenplay, direction and production values ​​1944 and 6/10. For the show, my show rating is calculated at 4/10 for the screen character. All except those played by the heroine Ella Raines as Carol Richman, the great 8/10. In addition, I praised Thomas Thomasz as a Burgess examiner, who was persuasive that he didn't think Scott Henderson's verdict (Alan Curtis) Of his These two have formed an alliance to prove Scott's excuses. <br /> <br /> I have this movie on the DVD "Suevia Film Noir Cine Negro" in Spanish "La Dama Desconocida" with the soundtrack. The original "Ingles" track is an alternative language, because even though I can't find all of the English versions, I'm worried that I will see Ella Raines' performance again after being impressed with her performance as the heroine. In "Impact" in These players only female owner of the garage. Another role that is believed to be a hero In the innocence of her chief engineer and denied many suggestions that she should return to her home in Kansas (The name of her boss's pet) before solving the missing excuse, the fact that she secretly loves her boss Believes that since he seems to have a formal business relationship with her, he has designed the house and playground so I think "Family" has a light in Carol's brain. <br /> <br /> In the 1940s, with "movie codes" in operation, producers could draw sex images through metaphors and here it was done in the form of The form of an angry drumming played by Elisha Cooke jnr.Carol doll himself into a simple, virtuous girl in an attempt to lure the drummer into Providing information about her "The Phantom Lady", the other main characters, Jack Marlow (co-worker of Scott Henderson), played by Franchot Tone, which my performance showed too dramatic and wondered why Carol, for example Having noticed him all the time and strangely admiring his hands here, the screenplay should be improved and more suspicious because the movements of these plays signal the plot too quickly for the audience.
