Disappeared in 60 seconds, an action comedy movie that made over $ 100 million, but was criticized by most critics. Personally, I think this is a great movie. This story is reliable and has the best performer ever for this type of film, including Nicolas Cage, 3 winners, Robert Duvall and Ann Jelina Jolie. In addition to showing talent at the end, this is a perfect blend of action comedy and drama. My rating is **** (from ****)
