Not all come close to the sum of the parts. There is no problem. The film consists of the most creative directors of our generation and famous for casting. The group was designed around the same theme "Love in Paris" but the similarities would end there. In fact, considering that the theme of the themes from these different directors has many forms, it's amazing that we can feel that we are still watching the same movie. There is no great effort to become a comprehensive overview. This buffet has many excellent ingredients. I'm glad that no one tried to put everything in one dish.
