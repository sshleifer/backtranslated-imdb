This is the powerful Italian adaptation of The Postman Always Rings Twice novel, directed by Italian great Luchino Visconti. The most interesting thing about this movie is that in every way it crosses the source material to become more and more original (interestingly, Camus also gives Cain's credit for inspiration. The main theme for his outstanding novel) This movie has more power and intensity than this novel because Visconti can create a movie that is equivalent to the storyline. Cain's storytelling But allowing more complex sexual surveys Adam and Eve's American novel is passionate about creating merciless whites. (The lead character, Cora, is afraid of her being identified as a Mexican and embarrassed that she is married to a Greek immigrant) that is not related to the Italian context in the countryside. This work will help the classes to be antagonistic to the middle stage and to dance among Goku of love that is passionate about the romance of the two main characters. This movie is a complex, questionable and worthwhile experience.
