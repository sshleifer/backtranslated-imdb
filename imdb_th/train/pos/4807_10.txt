I think this movie is really great. Not only history But only correct But still has a style that is elegant and intimate I am a big fan of Emily Blunt's Victoria image and the way she keeps her soul, even though she is forced to take refuge as though she was in her youth. Blunt, showing charm and sometimes stubbornness that Vicotria became known (May be infamous) The romantic element of this film is genuine and gentle that at the end of the movie, you truly understand why Vicotria chose to spend the rest of her remaining time in Albert's mourning There is a value of recording as well. I admire the beautiful scores that are astonishingly moving along with the dramatic movements of the story. I still considered the movie to be distinctive. Some scenes made me quite breathless because of the lushness and beauty that they portray. <br /> <br /> There are a few movies this year that are beautiful and gentle like a movie. this Is one of the best of 2009!
