Saying that the film is falling, it is not necessarily bad. I am very pleased to see a depressing movie if there are issues to do and this film has one story. It was a painful story for the Chinese men and their families because they experienced many years of hardship and fertility. But I have to remind you that this may be the story about the worst movie that will come out of Hollywood in the 1930s - because the peasant life in China is hard to say the least. Prepare to see the various parts of famine, death and disease. <br /> <br /> About the only negative thing, in addition to suffering, is that Paul Muni is the leader. While he is a talented person, it is only a real shame that Hollywood often gives people of European descent to play as Asian actors in this era. If you pay attention, it is quite clear that Muni is wrong for that part.
