Shakespeare's plays have time to overcome. The language will destroy the time wall. But maybe it was an actor who did that With my surprise, Othello is great. <br /> <br /> The character of Iago is played very well by Kenneth Comrade! Even Aigo is really evil and disgusting. The character plays well until doing what Shakespeare intends for the philosopher to be happy that the audience hates. I must say that the fishburne performance here is also good. <br /> <br /> I recommend this for Shakespearean scholars and lazy students. (Those who refuse to read books) as well
