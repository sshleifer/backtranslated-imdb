I enjoy reuniting again! I will give 10 points if they have "Hassie" and "Little Luke". Not even mentioning where they are today or why they are not involved in the reunification. They are very famous characters and I think it's a mistake not to explain the lack of their appearance. <br /> <br /> However, I'm glad TNN has made the series again. I am looking for episodes for many years and happy things that can tape the whole set. (I might miss a few episodes) Jenny Hanahan
