This sci-fi masterpiece has too many flaws after the editorial team has killed after its debut in 1936. It is surprising to see. But the script allows for intellectual speeches about war and progress too. Has been reading many high-spirited messages all the time. Raymond Massey and Cedric Hardwicke, both the great actors, have become fans Ralph Richardson is very good as a "nobleman" megalomaniac noble warlord. The predictions of World War II are very surprising considering that the world is approaching the most serious conflict in human history. At that time I'm glad that the war didn't happen like it was in the movie. There are some visually appealing editing scenes linking the time between various episodes of the movie. Although it's not as fun as I hope it will be. But this movie stuck in your heart long after you saw it.
