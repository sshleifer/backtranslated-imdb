I enjoy this movie and I have very low expectations due to all the negative comments I read before going. I went because I wanted to know what all this fuss was about because some posts were very angry with this movie and with Koreans. Oh, and from Korea, which brought my favorite movies, I like the host, but not what I like best. My favorite sci-fi / fantasy movies, you can feel my taste: Mirrormask, Stardust, Serenity, Gattaca, Willow, Matrix, Resident Evil series, LOTR, Stargate, Dark City <br /> <br / > It's not as confusing as everyone says and the monster looks good and the battle is great. There are some things in the box. But not important I ordered things like that and stopped asking why so long ago when I saw a summer movie. Korean legends are interesting. The stories of reincarnation are different and I think the main characters are suspicious like Korean actors on other shows. Ethan (Beh) I look at Asia so <br /> < br /> Yes, it may be better and I hope in the future in Korea with a strange sense of life, intense emotions and unexpected humor. Variety for blockbuster types Could it be a combination of Host and Dragon Wars in the future?
