I enjoy every moment of this beautiful movie and amazed by this female painter that I have never heard before. So I explored her life and worked after that. As it should be, I found that this movie is not as accurate as history. I was slightly surprised by the negative comments on this film due to this inaccuracy. Come on, guys, not movies and shouldn't be a biography. (Or a novel!) Any historical film that distorts reality because it should be an art in its own right The film director has the full right to use elements from reality and history to create his own world. Artemisia is a great movie and I think it makes many people. (Including some people who give negative comments) to explore the life and work of interesting artists
