I used to watch this movie when I was about 7 years old - which is 33 years ago - and I never forget this movie! I am very impressed and brave little boy and beautiful eagle. And I didn't want to believe when he became an eagle when everyone in the theater thought he was going to die ... <br /> <br /> My sister is in this movie with me and I ask She recently, if she remembers the movie we saw with the boy and the eagle and she said that she only remembers as we saw yesterday So it's not just me. <br /> <br /> This movie must watch !!! <br /> <br /> You will never forget it - like my sister and me ...
