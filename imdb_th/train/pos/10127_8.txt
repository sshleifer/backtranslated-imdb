This is the beginning of it all! True, this is not the best friend. But this is the pilot of the program. Don't forget and not a bad person at all. We got to know the gang and Central Perth where our story began. Even when we first received the signal of Ross-Rachel's relationship that would take place over the next ten years, when Ross said: 'I just want to get married again.' Was determined while the writer was going to have a relationship with Monica-Joey, but now, when looking back elsewhere .. Rachel is now introduced to Chandler As if both had never Well before But later in the episodes called This 'incident' conflicts with the two who have met three times. However, the point is that this is a good start to a great performance. It may not be a normal friend that we are familiar with by the actors. But in a few episodes, we will see why the program is like that! Look further. The first season is an explosion !!
