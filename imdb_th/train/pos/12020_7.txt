The Last Hard Men found that James Coburn was a criminal who made a long sentence to escape from the chain of gangs. He and his friends headed to the Mexican border from prison and were safe, because Coburn had a revenge mission. To kill the peacekeepers who brought him and in the process of killing his woman. <br /> <br /> The peace officer was Charlton Heston, who is now retired. As he explained to his daughter, Barbara Hershey, Burns was trapped in a hut and was involved in a Waco-like conflict. His Indian woman was killed by a gunshot. It is not something that he is proud of. She is the guarantor of the damage in the hunt. <br /> <br /> Lest we be sorry for Bern, he made us realize that he was evil. Heston is his strongest hero as usual. But the honors of acting in The Last Hard Men went to James Coburn. He blew everyone out of the screen when he was. <br /> <br /> Burns received a bright idea to make sure Heston followed him. With the abduction of Hershey and taking her to the Indian Reserve His son-in-law <br /> <br /> The Last Hard Men is one. Nasty and brutal western Andrew McLaglen directed, and I think it could be a project that is for Sam Peckinpaugh course, it shows his great influence with the slow motion to emphasize the violence. <br /> <br /> For Peckinpaugh lite, The Last Hard Men is your movie.
