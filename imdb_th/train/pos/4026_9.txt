Pinjar is a true masterpiece ... It's a thought-provoking movie that makes you think and make you question our culture. There is no doubt that the best Hindi movie I've ever seen. This film should be screened at film festivals around the world, and I believe it will be a fighter at Cannes. All the characters are perfectly cast and Urmila Matkondar and Manoj Bhajpai are haunted in their role. <br /> <br /> The story that the film tells about the break is very important and it should not be. <br /> <br /> There is no prejudice or prejudice and the scene is human. There is no one country that is considered good or bad. There are evil Indian, Pakistani evil and good Indian and Pakistani. Great movies and melodious songs with meaning and haunting Everything about this movie is amazing ... and the performance makes me suffocate. Everyone was perfectly selected.
