If this film was created a few years later, I would give a lower score. However, for the year 1909, this is an impressive little movie and still stands out today. Do not try to compare this silent movie with silence later - the industry has changed completely that the shorts of the first decade of the 20th century did not watch movies made in the 1910s onwards. <br /> <br /> Film This is a length of 11 minutes (on average for most movies at that time) and is the theme of Edgar Allen Poe's cash for AMONTILLADO. While many people are familiar with this story. I will not explain more because I do not want to destroy the movie. Just enough to say it's very creepy !!
