This is a great movie. How do these women try to help the husband? I think the performances of the great actors I have to think about this movie for a long time. I think every student should watch this movie so that they can think of war, relationships, friendship and love. I like this movie because it tells me and shows me how strong love is. I hope I will be strong as a woman. I like it a lot because it tells something about relationships and that's what I like to watch in movies. I think you can compare the movie with the pianist Der Untergang. If you combine these three movies, you will see a picture of what happened during the war We should remember something like war forever.
