I do not really know how people are about this movie. But one of my favorites It is not preaching, not moral neglect. It should not be a conflict. It's just God. Any possible god, regardless of religion and it's really funny. <br /> <br /> Jim Care plays Bruce Nolan, a TV reporter, often stuck on the light side of the news, desperate to prove. Own Good work in anchor work This drive is something that slowly drives his beautiful girlfriend like Grace. (Jennifer Aniston) When the last straw was executed, he wouldn't laugh quickly. But shouted before God, which would make Bruce's power Bruce made his life better for himself until he felt guilty to help others, which he still missed his power. At the same time, his constant excitement about his life made him more selfish and left his relationship in a dangerous area. <br /> <br /> OK. But as a plot, it works well Fashion, step by step, that we face the challenge of becoming a god is better than joining his problems together and can hide himself quite well. <br /> <br /> As you may know from Heard about this In the first movie, Carrey's perfect performance remained in the character. (Which is lucky enough for him) and the control and atmosphere in the movie scene in each scene Regardless of whether they accept or not, the role is written or rewritten for Carrey, especially without him. Humor will change because humor will be half executed. And the humor is very good at first But without Carrey, it feels like a wonderful life. Wanabe <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston is great and no matter what people say. At least you don't think that when you see her She shows a sincere performance and makes you forget that you are watching a movie. She and Carrey feel like a true lover. <br /> <br /> The movie feels that ggooooodd (watching movies to understand) has a lot of good feelings. Thinking that is appropriate and better than expected, and overall should not be called together to help Carrie's work life. (Which is not anywhere)
