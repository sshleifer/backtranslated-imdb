I never saw Richard Thomas play as a bad guy. I'm not sure I want him like this. And I'm not sure he can pull it out But this surprised me He sent my spine shaking and made me look closely at the street people. This film is aggressive and fast. Bruce Davison is reliable, but what he can really play is a good guy. The real ability here is Thomas. The ending is quite awkward. But maybe that's how people fight ... If you're a Thomas fan, you have to see him here with a bad feeling.
