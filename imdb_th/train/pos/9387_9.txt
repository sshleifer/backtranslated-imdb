As others commented, I checked this after Siskel and Ebert stated that this was one of the top hits of this year. What gift then I went out to buy so I could borrow it out. <br /> <br /> Say the best? Dwight Yoakum stopped his truck when he realized that someone (Cage) was in his taxi. When Cage looked at him, he apologized. "I'm sorry if I make you scared." Yoakum also handed his pistol in front of the cage. "Does this look like I'm scared?" A little humor after the escape. (And temporary) exciting <br /> <br /> have fun with this Seeing signs "Welcome to Red Rock" continuously causing wailing and smiling heads The song creates a creepy quality hunting movie that is reminiscent of "Twin Peaks" different from "Twin Peaks" but it doesn't spoil things by going too far in foreign countries by wanting "top" yourself br /> <br /> I accept 15-20 credit views. Do you see that they have Yoakum's "Thousand Miles from Nowhere" playing as a freight train that bends down to the desert floor. Covered with snow in the distance This is an incredible and fluid frame. Moreover, I have never seen a mix of images and sounds on film. In addition, it is completely consistent with the story.
