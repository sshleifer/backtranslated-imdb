The first time I saw this was a child living in East London. The scars of Hitler's army were too clear and the movie's scenery was reminiscent of our streets. I remember the nightmare after seeing it. The strange thing is that it is not dated if it is seen as part of social history in fiction movies. <br /> <br /> In addition to the devastating wars around the world, the size of the machine is not very good and has nanotechnology increase But overall, it's a great job and is well designed. It's very interesting to see how space travel is. I think shooting a spacecraft from an enormous gun would definitely kill an astronaut. However, it is very accurate. Man desires to make war. War means catalyst for development. <br /> <br />
