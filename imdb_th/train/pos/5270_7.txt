This movie may be terrible, but it's very fun. Bad performances and bad directions help increase the movie craze. The twins are both funny in the role of Connex. If you go into this movie, expecting Conan or Ezalibber first, it is better that you hate it. If you watch it while in a good mood and accept that it's fun, you'll have a good time. See the scene in which they tried to hang the brothers, which is the most fun scene in the movie. I hope the Mystery Science Theater 3000 should do this !!
