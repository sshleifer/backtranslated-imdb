As a person who has seen and followed Hartley's public work for many years, I think what used to be a story told through real stories has been elevated to a vague philosophical concept. <br /> <br /> while having fun The steps in the concept of Henry Fool, in which the film reflects the quality of the objects within the movie in Henry Fool. The object is memoirs ... In Fay Grim, the object is encoded memoirs, which itself is stolen, forged and mutated into something. Obscure until unable to actually understand - such as the script process Writing and creating movies in the modern era, where most blockbuster movies are more than a story in the past That is, according to philosophy, Fay Grim is about what Perhaps a tragedy that is now stunned and boring. (As mentioned in the opening scene at the publisher) <br /> <br /> being said that many of the best movies are missing if you Did not understand the characteristics of Henry and the importance of the memories that were looking for Henry is the first demon covered by Simon as a modern Faust, without understanding how the sad character of Henry, the quality of the plot and the story of Faye. <br /> <br /> The sufficient 'details' that are expressed through verbal events - the knowledge of Henry Fool's plot cannot be compared to the 'sense' of the character's quality as Done in Henry Fool and therefore I think that for those who walked into this movie of 'so', responding to the interaction of creation, then what is it? <br /> <br /> However, Henry Fool is also the Hartley movie that I like the least until I Will know that it's bad - stinking and infectious - precisely because Henry Fool's confession isn't good ... not just obscene or dirty But inevitably broken Henry cannot be a suitable villain - and this may be a sad flaw that makes him the most beloved ... like Gollum in the work of Tolkien. Henry is pathetic. < br /> <br /> Not found in Faye Scary though Henry's dialogue is excellent. What was found was that all the movies were created to be encoded - the sort of plot, other stories that became another bad story added to Henry's confession. It is interesting. But it is something that cannot really be decomposed if not watching the first movie Perhaps Henry's performance is faster, probably better than letting the publisher describe the basic story of the first film - although this story isn't something that the first film was about - unless it was a temporary observer. > <br /> Part of encryption? Hard to say ... a little disappointed at the magic sexual gimmicks
