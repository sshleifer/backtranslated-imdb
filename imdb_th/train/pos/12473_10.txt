A warm and sensational movie with fantasy-like quality. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn is always wonderful. <br /> <br /> Samantha Mathis gives a great performance Something about this will haunt your memory. <br /> <br /> The most important thing you have to see this 5 year old is Jodelle Ferland. I was impressed with her appearance. To see her over and over again She is the miracle of God's creation. <br /> <br /> Judging from the high ratings of IMD, I'm not the only one attracted by this actress.
