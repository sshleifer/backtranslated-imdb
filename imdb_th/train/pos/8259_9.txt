I think the best curse in attending the Toronto Film Festival is the schedule. Your release date is confusing. Quite frankly, I'm just happy. Fido was chosen for distribution in the United States. In any case ... <br /> <br /> Have you ever seen Shaun of the Dead before? D. Then can the girls reconcile both? If you can use your name, may be Andrew Currie, a Canadian assistant in the first zombie-themed film or zomedy (seriously, that's what the book says in Toronto called), even though it's mild, arid, or English. Shaun of the Dead, but Fido still adheres to its roots, which is dedicated to the 1950s black and white television, including Lassie and the infamous sci-fi pulp that was pumped out at that time. > <b r /> Fido's special talents (Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connelly, Dylan Baker and Tim Blake Nelson) are a testament to the ability of the original. This film demonstrates all the effects of evidence: the world in which zombies are right. Adapted to be a servant because of their true number due to a strange accident. What will you use your new servant for butler? Labour? Pets? Can't speak? Fido tackles all of these possibilities in a sweet and surprising manner with thanks to Connelly's work. (As one of the zombies mentioned) and the young TV actor K'Sun Ray, which seems to be Elijah Wood ever, <br /> <br /> If you expect another Shaun of the Dead, don't waste time with blood. Enough and emerged in a category that will satisfy you and you just leave the bitter and depressed theater But if you are willing to see what happens to Shaun of the Dead when it jumps over the lake, you're in for a treat. Thinking that Fido was a sensitive person, defeated by Shaun's older brother, who is often more rebellious and you start to get drifting. If you like zombies (Or at least tolerable) young children and a lot of deadpan satire. Fido is a movie for you If this is not the case .... You know the drill, just press' em Square between the eyes.
