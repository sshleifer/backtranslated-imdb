The story of Hammer's few stars makes this powerful English horror piece revolve around the house and the fate of previous tenants, all of which have been told to Scottish detectives to find the missing actor. <br /> The number one story that seems to be the least impressive of the four stories is related to the writer and his wife who just moved in. Home and plan to stay for a short time so that he can be one of them. Horror novel He created a frenzied character named Dominic, who was scary and soon found himself mad as he began to see this terrible man everywhere he went. After his wife convinced him to seek psychiatric help, a really straightforward sub-topic was not recommended for me. I will not destroy it for you. <br /> <br /> The next story (the best in my opinion) shows Peter Cushing as excellent as Philip Grayson, the man who moved. Came into the house for retirement soon Travel to the nearby wax museum. (Which dealt with disgusting matters) which he was very shocked to find a wax that looks like a woman in his past After a long time, old friends (Who has a history with this woman) is in town to do business and visit him The two men are awakening rudely. Soon they find that this woman is more than a sight. <br /> <br /> Three star stories, one of my favorites ... Christopher Lee. Reid, after moving into the house with his strange daughter, Jane Mentor, whom he had been profoundly suspicious of the way Reid suppressed his daughter Come to know ... if you know what Lee is doing, you will understand Britt After buying a cloak from a mysterious merchant, actor Paul Henderson found himself becoming a living creature that he showed many times in his career. <br /> <br /> Overall, pacing and direction are The very good things of the show are great gothic touches here and there and powerful scores to fill the atmosphere. This person is a keeper and highly recommended.
