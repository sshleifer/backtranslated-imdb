I find it difficult to do as it seems to sink in the middle while I try to make the head or tail of the person who is fighting and why. One of the problems is culture / language. Here we have problems with China / Taiwan / Japan, which we know little and because we read English subtitles loosely. Another problem is that there seems to be only half that describes Too many twists and coincidences However, it seems unlikely that there will be a bad movie Miiki at all and this is not the case. Stylish violence and cramped bones that show less sexual behavior than traditional beliefs and family aspects All in good riding But perhaps checking the story may be really useful before watching this one.
