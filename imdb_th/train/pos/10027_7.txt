Of course, Titanic is the first good movie you see. But you should see it a second time and your opinion about this movie will definitely change. The first time you watch a movie that you see, a love story that lies and thinks: Oh, how romantic, second time (and I'm not the only one to think like this). It's annoying and you just sit at That looks like a movie idea when this ship will sink ??? And even this thing is not impressive when you see it many times The performance in this movie is not bad. But certainly not great The price is less than $ 20 million. Everyone is surprised that there are almost every movie in him. But in my eyes, the worst character of this movie On the other hand, Kate Winslet's performance is excellent. I still think that the director is very talented to bring the movie of that size together. There is one lesson to learn about this movie: There are too many love stories, as it is a filmmaker, should not try to add romance to every movie !!! Out of 100%, I gave this movie only 71%.
