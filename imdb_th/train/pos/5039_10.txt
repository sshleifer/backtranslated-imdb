Beautiful, absolutely beautiful This is a movie about two children whose father had a vision immediately. He claimed that the angel came to visit him and told him that they had to kill "demons." They kill these so-called demons with an ax to the head and chop them up in the rose garden. Their father claimed that he saw their sins when he touched them. This movie continues with distortion in the end. <br /> <br /> The thing I like about this movie is Is their father really crazy? Or is he telling the truth? The audience was left to decide. Go to judge for yourself and watch the movie now.
