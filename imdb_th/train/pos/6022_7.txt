Zabriskie Point is often mistaken for Antonioni's political film, Antonioni's American film Stylistically following the "Bomb" series, which means that the pace is earlier than the previous epic. But of course, no less strange. <br /> <br /> In general, the general mistake is that this film is an honor for the hippie generation. Which is very different Marked from the youth "Rebels" Daria from a real estate agent. But in true Antonio fashion, they were alienated, both trying to escape from the environment. Mark leaves the meeting of the rebel students and Black Panthers is disappointed with the empty rhetoric while Daria still travels with her car painlessly. <br /> <br /> Antionioni, the main director Then shallow and then move to the city An environment full of variability of corporations, popularly meaningless advertising billboards that must be expanded to support the similar growth of the population, generating profits at the same time. It is an environment in which the two protagonists escape, although it seems like a coincidence. <br /> <br /> Of course, when Daria stopped by a small village on the outskirts of the desert, the environment was enough to suffocate. And people, as in the case of the best lost by the old boxing champion, now become their own shadow, sit around, drink and smoke and talk nonsense An incredible grief sequence makes it even more powerful with the integration of half of the wild children living around, led by some "benefactors", but "destroying true American history" in symbols that are not ambiguous. See Antonioni's About the Hippies Just a half-plus glimpse into the canvas of human sales The order in which the two characters give love "join" in the imagination. The "flower" model reflects a similar sequence in "Red Desert", in which Giuliana tells the story of her son. It is a colorful phase in a colorless landscape. Half the vivid imagination in the breathless reality. <br /> <br /> The ending may be the pantheon of a great ending in the belly theater, ghost exorcism. <br /> < br /> Antionioni's two "international" films (English "bombs" and "Zabriskie Point") of England are less than the past masterpieces. Faster speeds and inevitable planned settings (Swinging the London Flower Power of America) But when it came down, it was clear that he didn't lose the edge.
