"Opening Night" was launched in 1977, trying to create ambitious works. It succeeded in Gena Rowlands' truly remarkable performance. The characters in her theater Myrtle didn't have to be the one we loved in real life. She is obsessed with herself, often nasty, and makes her life happy for those around her - in other words, unlike some actresses! Myrtle is still a woman on the edge of collapse - we're pretty sure that the demons that she fought are real or imaginative, even though we let it be a secret early Clearly, Rowland is a good director with the love of her talented husband, actor / director John Cassatate, who also has a role in the film. This film has no flaws - it's too long and the last part of the movie Myrtle goes on stage while very drunk seems to be cruel "improvised" in some dialogue - at least while on the stage - too long. Some of them give good performances, especially from Ben Gazarra, who plays the lazy producer of Myrtle. Joan Blondell's characters are not fully developed and I don't. Can understand why she is in this movie, except to silence myrtle. Watch this movie for Rowlands alone - she's fascinating - and it's hard to take her eyes off even if you need it sometimes
