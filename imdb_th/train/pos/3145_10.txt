The 70s list is the best TV program of all time. It was there with Andy Griffen Show, Saturday Night Live and The Simpsons. In my book, acting in the 70s continued for eight seasons, all focusing on teenagers / young people related to relationships. Separated from parents and the future as a whole. <br /> <br /> Two main characters, Eric and Donna, are two teenagers who live next to each other. They live as close as possible in their lives and begin to feel more of their feelings at the beginning of the first season. Many performances revolve around their relationship. <br /> <br /> The other two characters are Red and Kitty, Eric's parents. Reid is in service, so he pushes Eric around Kitty in the opposite direction. Even though she drank heavily But she treats Eric and friends with caution Bob, their neighbor, apparently, Donna's father. Bob giggled with many women throughout the story of the show. Bob also made a lot of annoyance to Reid. <br /> <br /> The remaining characters are Hyde Kelso, Fezz and Jackie. They are Eric's friends. They also play an important role in the story of the show. <br /> <br /> Well, the first season is great. This is when the characters begin to feel new things to each other. The first season is traditional, fun and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The second season is good, although it's not as good as the first season. It's the first basic continuation. Eric and Donna are together and everything is great. <br /> <br /> The third season is my favorite. It goes back and captures feelings and humor in the first season. I still think that the chemistry of the characters has improved a lot, making the show more fun than watching. <br /> <br /> The fourth season is not close. Eric and Donna Arne are not together in this show. Showing slightly less satisfactory It's still funny even though I'm not as fun as the previous season. <br /> <br /> The fifth season is the season that I'm happy all the way. It's a senior year for the gang, so it really helps. The fifth season has the best ending in every season. <br /> <br /> The sixth season is very good. It's very funny, even though it doesn't catch the feeling like other seasons. The gang leaves high school, so I believe it doesn't make teens feel that previous season. I don't like the last three or four episodes because they have a dramatic feeling that is important to them. <br /> <br /> The seventh season captures the same feeling that the 5th season has a way, even if it's not have Do not have to do all the way I am happy with the seventh season while I do everything and the ending is great. <br /> <br /> The last season was sucked. Eric is not in it that destroys it. Kelso is not in most of them, which doesn't help anything. I hate the eighth season until the last episode. I think the final episode is really good and the ending of the series is appropriate. <br /> <br /> So overall, if you enjoy comedy, try the 70s. Look, they stop doing new episodes. But still available on TV I also recommend buying Season 1-7. It is up to you if you want to buy Season 8.
