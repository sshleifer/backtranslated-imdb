Cinderella .... <br /> <br /> I haven't watched this movie for five years, the time I saw it. The magic still exists There are certain things that have a feeling in the tales, of course, entertaining music and all the favorite secondary characters. The villain in the form of the sisters of that step is evil and completely wicked. Then there is the most magical of all Disney. I made a set and you know the rest. In summary, the four Disney Princess films are great. But this is a magical experience that is charming, admiring and enjoyable. Oh, and of course Cinderella is great as the main character in the movie. <br /> <br /> If you think about it, Disney's movies may be captivated by Elene Wood and Others that the movie has such feelings, you can't help but smile. <br /> <br /> They say that the moral of this story is a dream come true. Of course, in the real world, some people are believers. In this movie, it's wonderful when your rainbow smiles. <br /> <br /> And the rest is ... Cinderella
