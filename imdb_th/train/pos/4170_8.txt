I've watched this movie more than once. It is a very creepy story that has been screened on television since then. The only problem I have with the name for obvious reasons ... One thought in an instant, the famous candy cake by Drake's! Out of the first part, 'Hound of Hell' will suffice. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna often manages to feel serious about what he has done, whether it's good or bad. But this is a fun Halloween fare offered by the CBS network. I like the part that Crenna uses to travel to some vague countries to search for magicians to help him conquer the beast. He asked the taxi driver how to find this man. A wonderful conversation between a local taxi driver and Crenna in terms of a taxi driver showing his own ethnic beliefs. 'Oh, Mr Barry, I left that when I came down from the mountain ...' - meaning To the magicians who rarely see or advise people, and no one knows how to actually contact him. <br /> <br /> The movie is still fun.
