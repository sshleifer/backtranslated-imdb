The first time I was caught by mistake by composing the first part of the movie and then I was fascinated by the story that unfolded and strayed with the great director. All characters are fully developed, not larger than life. But just like the people we live in, wherever we live in the world, in Sweden, in Turkey or in America, every human being who believes completely, has talent and exaltation, Hollywood can learn a lot from this beautiful movie It shows that there is no need to go into the little details behind every action to bring clear and bright content and that shows the director's ability! Thanks to Kay Pollak and the great actor for this wonderful treatment !!
