Although it is not a horror based on the original meaning But this creepy little movie has delivered the product It seems that the vampires are loosened in a small German town that drains their prey from the blood. Police Inspector Karl Brettschneider, Melvyn Douglas, one of his early roles, believes that a mad killer, not a vampire, is running rampant. The only person who believes that he is Ruth Bertin (Fay Ray Ray), girlfriend, inspector and laboratory assistant of Dr. Otto von Neumann (Lionel Atl), a famous scientist The townspeople suspect that Herman Gleib is strange, playing with his usual madness by Dwight Frye, who seems to enjoy his role very much. This film has a little sense of humor that helps to alleviate the violence associated with all the murders that occur. One funny thing is Gussie Schnappmann (Maude Eburne). Ruth Bertin's aunt thinks Herman is strange. It doesn't become a bat. But turned into a dog, Maude Eburne and Dwight Frye created a good comedy team. <br /> <br /> This film presents elements from "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari "with Dr. Neumann, using the power of the suggestion, a statement from" Frankenstein "using human blood to help create life in the laboratory and "Dracula" because of the murder, everyone believes that the examiner is an exception, except the inspector and his girl are the work of a gangster. These elements are well blended by the director Frank R. Strayer, with a little comedy that is thrown in for good measure. The mix of versions that I recall uses color tinting to add a scary atmosphere. So try to see this version if possible.
