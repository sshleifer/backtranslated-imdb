This is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen in my life. This is not just a fun movie or a well-built movie. This is an important place in the art of movement, and although it is not a technical skill that makes it a place in the history of movement. <br /> <br /> Wladyslaw Starewicz created a stop-motion movie about The secret life of the beetle He imagines the world of insects that are linked to home work, nightclubs, cinemas, even small props such as posters, bicycles and paintings. <br /> <br /> In this movie The beetle has a relationship with a dragonfly, causing the disappointment of locusts; But he was a camera technician and decided to shoot Mr Duang returned home and found that she had an affair with Mrs. Duang. Mr Beetle chased the lover away. But forgive his wife Both make up and go out to watch movies. And the movie they watched is Mr. Beetle and Dragonfly explain it so it sounds boring But when he saw that it became a movie capture job, apart from Emile Cohl and Jiri Trnka, Wladyslaw Starewicz also invented everything that future animators would use in their work. For this reason he must not be forgotten.
