I just want to add my two cents with value and forgive me if I repeat what has already been posted. But I felt it was worth it to warn Damon Runyon's genius. If there is no amazing road, the writings of Damon De Monrony, this movie will never be created or another great classic. Related to gamblers and people who liked it since 1960. Damon Runyon worked as a newspaper and he came from Colorado. But he is sure that _get_ the scene of the east coast road If you're not a big fan of old Hollywood comedies, I'd like to introduce other flicks from Damon Runyon's writings; "The Lemondrop Kid" and "Little Miss Marker". Bob Hope, in addition to his politics, is always funny. (As a western liberal, I found his politics quite funny too!) Damon Runyon lives !!!!
