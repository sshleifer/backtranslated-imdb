"Ko to tamo peva" is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The tragedy has a profound meaning about the fate of humanity that appears through the eyes of ordinary and ordinary people, seeming to come from the abandoned Serbian province of God before the start of World War II. I saw it in a small movie theater in Russia where the film had a very limited distribution and I had no chance to see it since then. It's a shame that this great movie is almost forgotten now. I searched for a copy of VHS or DVD of it many times and alas - not found at all. I will thank other fans of this little gem of making this movie for advice on how to buy a copy.
