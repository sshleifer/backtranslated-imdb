I can't say that this film deserves anywhere close to the amount of sulfuric acid that has been piled by some inspectors. Yes, it caught up with the hard work, hamfisted the correction and confidence in the special technique of cheese ball. And it doesn't have enough energy that the comedian will have to let the average audience member sit without checking his or her watch. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it has a funny laugh. Actors who are talented and realistic and classic underdogs Macy, Stiller and Azaria are excellent as the "core" team and Garofalo and Studi do excellent work that adds to the conflict and diversity for team I can't say that Reuben or Mitchell has added a lot of movies, even though each person has the opportunity to shine. <br /> <br /> The plot as I said above is something. At "Your underdog makes you good" is not surprising, because you know that they're going to succeed. What makes it worth it is not ridiculous heroes and ridiculous villains. But is a dialogue and interaction between the characters Under everything, these people are children with hearts that want to do the right thing. The best scenes in this film make this film an emotional basis. See the relationship of Azaria and the long-suffering mother. Macy's lovely innocence, in unwillingness to accept caps The secret identity of Amazing Wrath of Stiller. (Unlike a strange, lazy boy, you know someone who is often angry. Garofalo's desire to avenge her father This naive belief that the sense of justice and goodness will make the world a better place is the true appeal of superhero comics. And under the appearance of the parodic "Mystery Men" shows us why the hacking comic book is important to many people. <br /> <br /> It's never a gel that's satisfying. Sub (love, family life, conflict within the team, etc.), but the main point is the fun that surrounds it. The fact that it should be good, ridiculous fun seems to be missing with some investigators here, so I will leave the caveat: if you are the type of audience that finds him enjoying cars, cartoons and scratches destroyed by Who did not explain and without reason ("I believe that this is something .. * rumbling * ... _magic_ xylophone?") Then you have a deep and humorous idea for this movie. Rent Sandler instead. <br /> < br /> (7/10)
