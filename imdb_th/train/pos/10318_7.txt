It said that both movies and baseball flourished during the Great Depression. It appears that the terrifying reality of the nation occurs after this economic disaster, creating the need for relief for the people from time to time. The temporary escape can be found in the TV series that is currently doing, which is baseball. <br /> <br /> Similarly, traveling for a period of 2 or 3 hours in the dark auditorium of the cinema. The presence of radio in everyone's home made the economic downturn one time adapted to world events and organized many dramas and (especially) comedy performances for the interlude of satisfying reality < br /> <br /> The time is booming at all levels. The reading habits of children and youth help create comic books that we know have great characters and exciting adventures, but comic books do not appear astonishing. All of this is fully developed with 4 color pages. Color all by yourself There are media that are their ancestors. Obviously, Newspaper Comic Strip is a parent who gives a visual storytelling / storytelling story. <br /> <br /> Another direct ancestor is Pulp Magazine, a prolific prose publication with stories about himself. Drama in adventure as well The pulp has been in existence for decades and is introduced to Edgar Rice Borrough's TARZAN and Johnston McCulley's ZORRO in 1930, offering bumper cultivation in the manner of characters such as THE SHADOW, AVENGER, BATTLE ACES and SPIDER, MASTER of MEN Everyone finds a way to stand in the news among others. <br /> <br /> The other one is DOC SAVAGE, a superhero full of stories written. The cover of the pulp may be just a "picture" of the hero. There is a special strength, a sense of intelligence and intelligent intelligence of the protein Doc as a superhero model. <br /> <br /> He also has gathered military friends. 5 of his people joined the team of adventurers who free themselves. Each person has expertise in a given field. So we get the highest ranking: chemists, lawyers, construction engineers, electrical engineers, geologists - archaeologists - paleontologists, and others. <br /> <br /> The story of Dr. Savage has been Very popular in the 1930s and '40 into the mid '50's. They then entered the space for a good 12-15 years. Then brainstormed, began packing old novels into "containers". New cover book soft The new look of the cover image was presented with Doc Muscle's stylish drawing set with a torn shirt at all times. <br /> <br /> The repeated introduction has been proven to be highly successful. Of title per month (And a moment) Soon there was a rumor about Doc Savage! When did the producers of the respectable "Man of Bronze" come back to the news for more than 10 years before the project really was gathered together? It is an animated film and a brilliant producer for the special effects film Geoprge Pal. The director of this movie, along with Warner Brothers, <br /> <br /> When DOC SAVAGE MAN OF BRONZE comes To Movie Houses from a team of carefully selected actors, although there is no "name" that is familiar to the audience. With the former Tarzan of TV, Ron Ely is a more complete lead actor, Pamela Hensley, in the lead role and actress Paul Wexler. (As a villain, the sea captain); There will be no other name recognition. And it may be positive in this case. <br /> <br /> The story is a good job of making most of the audience familiar with the group and at the same time planning. Using subtitles by Paul Frees and short movie clips is a way to track the introductory move to the main content of the story. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, there are suggestions that this story will go. Along with producing the same "camp" work as the Batman series. The first scenes that looked very good about Doc and the entire team that performed their special duties were thrown into humor by Paul Frees' narration. And unexpected and unlikely results (For example, a doctor's experiment with a small rocket / missile became part of the method of capturing small fish at that time). The whole story unfolds like that, causing the audience to collide with the little camp frequently to remind. We are not too serious. We are also confused about the fact that Mr. George Pal is the producer (the last one). He is well known for the special effects, of course, that is a factor that can be used well in the scene. The sci-fi action of the world of the characters in the movie Pulp. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing it quite vividly. Mrs. Ryan (Diana) was in the hospital, just gave birth to her second child. We, Michelle (08/14/75), Jennifer's eldest girl So, after several hours in the ward, went straight to the old 63rd & Kedzie Marquette Theater here in Chicago. <br /> <br /> See it and be a man. Familiarity with Doc, so I was disappointed with the final work. I accept this business 'Camp' a little, but would not object if Mr.Pal deems appropriate to let everyone go out and have a dinosaur and a volcano that is really good for Pulp / Comic / serial excitement. > <br /> And also the actors led by Mr. Ely and others make the whole movie a favorite if not cute Various scenes and locations that we can see very much like the sequel or adventure in the 30s, which is fun for everyone. <br /> <br /> And maybe that's what they are trying to do as well.
