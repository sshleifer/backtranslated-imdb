The end of the era was published in America in the spring of 2002 with "The Rookie", a Disney action movie that appears to be "The best for the latest !!!!!" It happened here in Texas! In fact, the story begins in West Texas, which is evidenced by the area code found on the sign there. It's about a high school coach who believes in his high-level baseball team so he decides to be a professional !!!!! <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie: It's great. !!! !! It is a very good sports movie. The "The Mighty Ducks" trilogy. It also takes film viewers across Texas from somewhere between Panhandle and El Paso to the Metroplex (where I live). Can tell because I know the ballpark (ie "The Ballpark in Arlington;" Now it's "Ameriquest Field")! It's a good thing to see Disney's "golden age" ending here in my area !!!!! <br /> <br /> RIP <br /> <br /> Disney's golden age <br / > <br /> 1920s -Spring 2002 <br /> <br /> "Everything starts with the mouse ... and ends with baseball" (sobs) <br /> <br /> 10/10
