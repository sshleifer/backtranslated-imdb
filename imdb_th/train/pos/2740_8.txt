Great black and white night movies and more. Highlights the real-life account of the 1950s murder in Kansas, where the whole family was wiped out by two men. <br /> <br /> The story was written by Truman Capote, so you will receive a free death sentence at the end of this movie, which is ridiculous when knowing the facts of this case. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson play two people who do not believe in God with a distorted view of life and those who kill this great family unnecessarily. <br /> <br / > Despite an annoying end at the end, this is an exciting story from the beginning and the movie makes this thing even more interesting. The famous photographer, Conrad Hall, did a great job in this. It made me want to get more modern movies in black and white on DVD. <br /> <br /> Blake Wilson, John Forsyth, Jeff Corey and all the supporting actors. Visit in here Watching my third movie took place in early April of 2005, not long after Blake in real life had a virgin in his wife's murder. No one can help but look at Blake and this movie is different from that.
