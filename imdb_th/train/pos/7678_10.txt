I just watched Holly along with other films about human trafficking and child sexual exploitation called Trade at Film by the Sea. International Film Festival I must say that Holly is trading from the water. <br /> <br /> Holly is a powerful and amazing movie on many levels, from an artistic and film perspective. Sound mixing, camera angles, directing and acting are the starting points. <br /> <br /> In addition, the methods that deal with the topic are tasteful and non-profit It presents child sexual exploitation issues in a form that includes both knowledge and accuracy. The filmmakers gave great attention to detail by capturing the differences in the spread of child sexual exploitation and human trafficking. Often having to deal with this kind of thing, it attracts viewers with the graphic scenes of rape and violence. Holly can do these things without falling into the general Hollywood trend. <br /> <br /> I'm happy to see Holly in two separate film festivals. One in the US and again in the Netherlands I can honestly say that I have never seen more viewers. Just listening to the conversation after screening, people will ask what they can do to fight sexual exploitation from children. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend everyone about movies and content
