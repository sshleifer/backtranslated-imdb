My story: The joke in THE LION KING posing as a sequel Surprisingly funny. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, "Lion King 1 1/2" is another funny story that is straightforward with the video. I don't see why Disney released the video here and released a crappy movie such as "Chicken Little" and "Return to Neverland". Out of those movies, it's better to see in the video store (in the "New Release" area). Instead of seeing a theatrical poster outside the theater, <br /> <br /> This film is just a trick of the first movie (although the episode "Simba's Pride" hasn't happened in Timon (voiced by Nathan Lane) and Pumbaa ' s (voiced by Ernie Sabella), the view we saw them create fun for the first movie The original soundtrack from the first film, such as Matthew Broderick, Woopie Goldberg, Cheeche Martin and Robert Guillaume, returned to their voicing role from the first film, while Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller gave the comedy as Timon's mother and uncle who didn't. Satisfied /> <br /> This sound isn't fun. Maybe not now But go see for yourself The fact that it's not serious in the story makes it even more fun. It's like MST3000 with Timon and Pumbaa. <br /> <br /> Video movie ratings: *** 1/2 out of 5
