As others have said here, every scene in this movie is a gem. Most movies are fortunate to have one perfect scene, but the director of the Jew collides every time. Actors have played great roles and in addition, Dick Hyman also has plays, opera songs and other songs created for the perfect couple. It is hard to imagine how they will keep the right mood throughout the long film production. The comedy is subtle (mostly) and the camera work reflects every little emotion of the storytelling. Cher is a funny nature like Vincent Gardenia (which I know most through the role of Frank Lorenzo, All in the Family Until I saw him on this issue and then closed Broadway in the 1980s) deserves more stars The unfortunate victim is only a small part of the iceberg. When talking about giving the glory to this great actor, Jewison once wrote about this movie. <br /> <br /> Want to read hard. Will know why the average score at IMDb is so low ...
