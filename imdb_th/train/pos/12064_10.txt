"The Woman in Black" is one of the most creepy English ghost stories ever made by a young lawyer after traveling in a small town to manage the property of a dead client. With a very creepy atmosphere and horror being calculated and delivering the highest possible result, the actions that make the audience deeply involved and the final scene is rather disturbing, the performance is excellent and the tension is hard to resist Can't A truly creepy horror movie. For this picture, I dare to watch "The Woman in Black" alone at night, with the lights turned off. Suggested 10 out of 10
