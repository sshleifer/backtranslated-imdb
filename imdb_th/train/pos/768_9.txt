This film has a foul odor. Many shows, too, but I <br /> <br /> don't care if there is a strong representation of what 80 is <br /> <br /> like (for many of us in anycity anyway ) And what hip-hop, Zulu country <br /> <br /> and breaking the dance is something like great music, excellent dance <br /> <br />! Seems to be a documentary over time. <br /> <br /> When hip hop is a way of life Also interesting to see new. <br /> <br /> York looks like a center from a nuclear attack. Some viewers <br /> <br /> May be too young to remember. <br /> <br /> During the 70's and 80's, this is the ultimate hip-hop movie / brake. <br /> <br /> The dance movie that came out at the time. Of course, <br /> <br /> 80 is considered a joke now with bad TV shows and movies. <br /> <br /> But they The inhabitants of that place will remember <br /> <always br >> once loved when music, dance and graffiti are fresh. Yo!
