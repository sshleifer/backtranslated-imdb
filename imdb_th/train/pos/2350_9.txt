I am one of the most blessed in every episode of Daisy pushing this season and hope that the writer's strike will not end the beginning of a brutally good performance. Ned is a pie maker that owns restaurants in the city center and has special abilities. Emerson is a private character with his own strange personality. Knitting Charlotte (Chuck) is a childhood friend. But not anymore and is the sunny spot of Ned's life Olive is a jealous but generous waitress. Oh and add a dog. Jim Dale brings all the characters together with his great lectures. Chuck Ned and Emerson, along with Olive and sometimes dogs, can solve the mystery of the murder many times with the help of Ned's special gift that will bring the dead back to life again. Funny and romantic comedy items in a cute and kind way, and I would like to recommend to everyone.
