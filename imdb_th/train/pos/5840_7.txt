While the location of the film is rather lame (Ollie was diagnosed as "Hornbobia") This movie is a cute and fun movie. It's a bit better than the movie they did after this story - probably because this is the last film of Hal Roach produced by Laurel and Hardy. One of them because all the chemicals disappear in these movies and the boys play their roles purely for pathos. They have a slight difference in which all subsequent movies lack Li is going to have a nervous breakdown and has to stop working for a doctor (James Finlayson - in his last film with the team). However, they do not like sailing and Stan has the idea of ​​renting a boat attached to the harbor - then they can get the sea air they need without having to worry about anything! When they were on the boat, the criminals escaped from the boat and they all accidentally left the sea. Fortunately, this part of the film was well received and eventually made a good come out. <br /> <br /> Although not a movie, Laurel and Hardy are full. With length There is no annoying and distracting musical numbers. (Such as in the Devil's Brother or BABES in TOYLAND). There are also physical comedy movies at the appropriate level, something you won't see after this movie. Partly because of the declining health of children (and Ollie's increase) and partly due to the overall insecurity of the film after this
