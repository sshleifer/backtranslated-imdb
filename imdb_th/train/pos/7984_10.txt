Man on fire is one of the best drama / crime movies I've ever seen. Even with a slow start But the story is very complex and surprising. This is the perfect role of Denzel Washington, which he served as a bodyguard called Creasy, who was suffering with his past and was a alcoholic. But never gave up on the duty to help protect his latest Pita Dakota Fanning plays the little, cute and adorable Pita, who loves many things and acts faithfully. She has a great future waiting in front of her. As I said that the story is quite complicated to fully understand, you have to watch a couple of times. <br /> <br /> This film was created in two parts, with the first hour that everyone was happy. Nothing is wrong. Everyone lives happily until Pita's abduction occurs and Creasy is almost killed. And then there was the second part, the rest of the movie, which was all complicated and quite gruesome and annoying when Creasy recovered from a serious injury and began to chase and kill many criminals and "La Hermamdad" responsible for planning And the execution of the kidnapping of Pita. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington shows us his most advanced acting abilities, along with many talented actors who have a good future. In front of them It is really embarrassing that the film has not been accepted enough. Washington deserves another Oscar for his performance, and Fanning and the director also do. And even the high quality visual effects. <br /> <br /> If you like the thrilling excitement The most amazing thing is that the composition of this movie is based on real stories and real characters! 10/10
