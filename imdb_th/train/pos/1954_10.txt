I think this movie is very good. It is not creative or original like the first time. But who would expect it to be It was fun. The more I miss it, the more I like it and when it comes out on DVD, I will pay it proudly every last cent. Sharon Stone is excellent. She is often though her films are scary (Catwoman), but this movie is not a movie. This is one of the movies that will be evaluated throughout life and may become a classic in the picture. 20 years old. Don't wait for it to be classic. Watch now and enjoy it. Don't expect to be a masterpiece or something that attracts and touches the soul, just let yourself go out of your life and engage with them. <br /> <br /> All of this is a fun movie. And I highly recommend People who haven't seen it see because of what the critics and box office say is not always counted. See for yourself. You never know. You may enjoy it. I recommend hats for this movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
