If you enjoy Cleese and Britain's 'Pythonesque' humor at that time, this little gem is definitely hilarious. <br /> <br /> Arthur Lowe is a true therapist. With TV friends when it first came out and its classic words became part of our jokes for 30 years and will do forever! I have it on the tape and it is constantly popular. <br /> <br /> Maybe some investigators think it's too serious. <br /> <br /> I don't want to believe that now. Only available in the United States (of course, NTSC) and not in the UK, which is an important part of British humor history !!
