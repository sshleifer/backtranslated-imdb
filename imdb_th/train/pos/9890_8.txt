Unfortunately, this movie never made a DVD at all. I saw it when it was first released in theaters in 1983 and then again when the VHS was released in 1992. Recently I saw a VHS copy at the flea market. I'm not disappointed The first thing that is clear: Claudia Ohana is beautiful and happy to see. But then this film will take you to an unrealistic world where you have to ponder the value and decide what is really important to you. The film has many things. It is about how the World Bank and large corporations use and make developing countries slaves with capitalist plans to force them into debts that they cannot repay. It's about the way our economy takes advantage of us by forcing us to owe credit, mortgage and car payments. It's about trying to maintain the innocence that we have never had before and maybe we can't really help. It's about good and evil, and about sometimes difficulties to tell others. It raises many questions. But did not give an answer I think sometimes this is good. For this reason, this film is worthwhile to be recorded and seen.
