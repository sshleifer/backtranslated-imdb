I saw this movie in the cinema at the age of 6 or 7 years. I like it very much and just became the owner of the VHS version. <br /> <br /> My 4 and 6 year old kids love this movie and have been asked. Repeatedly and again to watch. <br /> <br /> I am happy to see again as well. Although I have to admit that it is not good on a small TV, <br /> <br /> I don't have a grown-up child, so I don't know what they think. <br /> <br /> The music is so cute. My daughter continued singing. <br /> <br /> Hope it helps.
