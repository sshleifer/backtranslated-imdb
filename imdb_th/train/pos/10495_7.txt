Saving Grace is a great movie to watch in a boring afternoon when you are looking for something different from a regular script and want to have fun. I mean, the whole idea of ​​this film and all marijuana in it is madness! It was the first movie I watched on this topic (drug / marijuana) that was not really criticized, only created a joke. Grace Trevethyn was a widow who lived in a small town in the US and had many financial problems. Because her dead husband, who killed herself because he was full of debt The problem is that Grace, who thinks of having money to keep for her, finds that she has to pay the pound of her husband's debt without losing everything, especially the house she loves so much. She had never worked before and was in a tragic situation until her gardener Matthew found out that the smoking pot decided to cooperate with her in selling a large amount of marijuana.
