Eyeliner was worn almost 6,000 years ago in Egypt. In fact, it was not a lot of stretch in the 12th century. Is there a second season that is currently aired? It was amazing for me when criticized by people who didn't know or didn't watch the program at all. Is a waste of space on the board and other people's time The first show of the series may be a little painful when the actors begin to replace them. But that's what is expected from the show The rest of the first season was excellent. I can't wait to start the second season in the United States.
