I just watched the roll and enjoyed it. It became Toby Malone's most outstanding performance. I found myself really interested in what happened to Matt throughout the story, which was a lot of fun, stepping into a very harmonious character. There are many good twists as well. It will make you guess until the end. Other characters to watch out for are the crazy Tiny and the attractive Jessie. It may not have a huge budget for Hollywood Busters. But don't let this make you worse anymore. You may do something worse than checking out. You won't regret. Good fun. 7/10
