This is the movie Eytan Fox, the second story that I have seen. Best actor Lior Ashkenazi, the actor on Walk on Water, plays a minor role in this film. <br /> <br /> But the true star is a young Israeli who lives together in a small apartment - Noam (Ohad Knoller), Lulu (Daniela Virtzer) and Yelli (Alon Friedman); And the Palestinians who join them - Ashraf (Yousef 'Joe' Sweid) has a type of friend / sex in the city. (Most are gay) and they just want the war to end so that they can continue to live peacefully. <br /> <br /> But that's what happened. How many pictures or how many people are mad at you for peace? The war will not end. Many people have spent many years trying to bring both sides to the table. But they just want it to continue, for whatever reason There are many aspects in Israel, both there and here in the United States that need everything and will not consider peace. There are many aspects in Palestine that seem to be out of work. There should be peace ever. No one is interested in ending this war and the children suffer. <br /> <br /> This is always in your mind when you watch funny and engaging movies. It will not disappear. You know there is something sad going on and of course it happens. With both strong feelings and revenge as an inspiration, the tragedy often occurs and that is what makes this a friend / sex version in the city. There is no superficial, it is real life and it is something that Beautiful to see
