I just saw this movie due to Jake's recent success with Brokeback Mountain. I think I will watch movies that I missed. I had no expectation of going into this movie, so I was surprised that I missed this movie. It is the story of a lovely father and son and it is a story that is underdog. I also shed tears at the end of this wonderful story. This movie attracts the attention of all ages. The only reason I gave 9 out of 10 was that it was slightly slower in the middle. But it came back strong in the end The performance is wonderful, the story is beautiful and the movie is fascinating because of this scene. Go watch this movie! Rent, buy, watch it, love it! I know I do!
