I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival. It is not as obnoxious as it should be. This is a three-part documentary (each episode is 50 minutes) with Slovenian philosopher and philosopher Slavoj Zizek Zizek. Sex, fantasy, morality and death (She is the sister of actor Ralph and Joseph) <br /> <br /> I enjoy playing this game a little. But I think it will be more fun with DVDs. Because there are many ideas that will be digested The analysis of Freudian and Lacanian was quite heavy and watching the whole series at once became a little confusing at the end of the two and a half hours. It doesn't help anything that bad coffee and bladder possession makes me feel sick in the last hour or more. <br /> <br /> My only real problem is Zizek. Choose a movie that is quite good. Obviously, full of Freud's themes He spent a long time in Hitchcock's movies and David Lynch was not a fragile expert. I want to see him trying to support his theory by using a variety of movies, although that's just me really saying that I want to see the fourth and fifth and sixth episodes. <br /> <br /> Zizek is very funny and humorous. Some are watching. He presents what is in the narrative while inserting into the actual scene from some of the movies he talks about. For example, we saw him on a motorboat on the way to Bodega Bay (from Hitchcock's The Birds) or sitting in the basement of Bates Motel (from Psycho), which did not say that his theory was not a provocation. Even when I found myself disagreeing with him, it made me think a little bit more about the movie. Which is what he tried to accomplish
