This is a strange HK movie in many ways. First of all, many action scenes are not that fun. The first gun battle that occurred in this movie was nonsense. Not cool or stupid, but stupid. That doesn't mean that there are no great action scenes. But most did not reach the level of other movies that I have seen The opposite is that this movie has a real character, not just people. All the main characters are interesting. (Except for the head of a bad guy who is flat like a billiard table) The protagonist in this movie is very fun to watch. The conversation is quite clever and doesn't seem to lose much translation. This movie is worth watching. But I hope the uninitiated American audience doesn't think this is the best thing HK has to offer.
