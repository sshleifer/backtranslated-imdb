CRY IN THE DARK <br /> CRY IN THE DARK is a movie that I expect to present a great performance from Meryl Streep and a strong movie. This assumption is based on the fact that in addition to the nomination of Streep's best actress, the film also received the attention of the big prize group. <br /> <br /> I expect A CRY IN THE DARK. Will be such a dramatic drama - created at all levels If you ask me that this is an unknown classic movie, <br /> <br /> The film opens slowly, causing the audience to relax in the big palace and notice that in their hearts is Love an incredibly simple family. Fred Schepisi (director) chooses a random moment to capture the family during the holiday that gives the feeling of the tragedy that is about to happen while showing the joy of Lindy ( Streep) and Michael (Sam Neill) Chamberlain take care of their children. <br /> <br /> While the famous line "A Dingo Took My Baby!" Today has become quite memorable. Even the zither I laugh at all the death of Azaria was caught horribly real. It's subtle and realistic, causing the audience to panic and ask questions. <br /> <br /> Most movies take place in the courtroom and focus on Chamberlain's ongoing struggle to prove their innocence to the media. And the court The suspect of the murder of Lindy <br /> <br /> The clear truth for us from the beginning that they are innocent makes the experiment more tense. As a member of the audience, I fully invested with Chamberlain's fate ... and felt really angry and hurt when they were badly seen by the media. But at the same time, the media / public opinion is understandable. I like the way the media does not create sympathy. But they always have the right reason to keep their opinions. <br /> <br /> The last line of the film is profound and captures the perfect composition. Making this film different from other courtroom drama <br /> <br /> In terms of performance, the only thing that is important in this movie is Streep and Neill's movies ... and those He conveyed all aspects For me, this ranking is one of (if not # 1) Meryl Streep's best performances for her expertise in different voices. (Of course, very impressive in their own rights) Streep never lost the heart and soul of her character. I think this is one of the more detailed performances of Streep and she hit it out of the park. And Neil, an actor who has never impressed me in addition to charm and charm in JURASSIC PARK, is a perfect turning point for Streep's performances. From what I have seen, this is undoubtedly Neill's best work. It's a shame that he was not accepted by the academy by nominating a leading actor to match Streep's ... b / c Both of them play smartly. <br /> <br /> Catch more emotions than most movies. And still wondering incredibly ... CRY IN THE DARK is far beyond my expectations I suggest that people who know this movie just flick, which Meryl yells "dingo take my child!" Watch the movie and see that A CRY IN THE DARK has just that much. One line. <br /> <br /> ... A ...
