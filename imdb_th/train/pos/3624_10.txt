Rookie made me smile from beginning to end. Dennis Quaid has a role for perfection. The little boy playing with his son is great. He makes this movie a story that father-son must remember. The message is good. Follow your dreams. Failure to follow is alright, as long as you try. The excitement is clear. I believe that this movie will be a classic movie.
