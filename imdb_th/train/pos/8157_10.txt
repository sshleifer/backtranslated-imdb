Got R scores for strong language, violent content and some nudity Quebec ranking: 13+ Canadian video ratings: 14A <br /> <br /> The fear of black hats is one of the most fun and original comedies I've ever seen. It is the rap version of this movie. Touching it is a shame that many people have never heard about the gem of this movie. If you manage to find this movie anywhere, don't hesitate to buy. Even if you don't like rap music, I give 10/10 the perfect. The only one I can think of right now is this movie, Clerks, The World, according to Garp, Virgin, 40 years old and Chasing Amy. This movie is a funny image of Antha Gang. Philadelphia This film culture is about a woman named Nina Blackburn, who made a documentary about a group of rap-wearing NWH (N **** z with a hat). They are a pattern of rap groups. That made many controversial rap songs as being Gangsta.Fear Of A Black Hat is a great comedy movie and I highly recommend it, even if you're not a fan of the Gangsta Rap scene. Stay in the Top 250 <br /> <br /> Runtime: 88 minutes <br /> <br /> 10/10
