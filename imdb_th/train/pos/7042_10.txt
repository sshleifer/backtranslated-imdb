First, people are talking here that because this thing is released in the amount of "limited" means it's not good ... that's what Hollywood studios "big five" want every People think so they can pass. "Unqualified properties without having to lose face or imagination by truncating them directly Until now, this production was released "limited" because it was seen as "not patriotic" by some people. <br /> <br /> Now I like this feature a lot. I think it's a better way to "Charlie Wilson's War", even if it's a "fictional" account of something. "Never happened" but as OBVIOUS always, so will go to everyone and anyone interested or affected by America's current foreign policy "" or "foreign" countries "turakistan" and "emerald city" are Trying to resemble Iraq and Baghdad as well as the company "Tamerlane" go for "haliburton" (with Vice President Dan Aykroyd playing Dick Cheney, LOL). Quietly, actually this movie is a DEAD SERIOUS game, not a satirical story. None of the following (The main example is John Cusack's character associated with depression. But not just) <br /> <br /> I found that all the characters can relate to something / someone or a particular pattern. Now advice; If you are not politically active, especially on the aspect of "Globalization" You will not enjoy this feature much because most of the content and within the "jokes" are targeted to "non-" personality "for the general public in the daily base ... Except the main one is Hilary Duff, who plays a well-known pop star, must say the name (S) or not) at CORE. The feature is anti-globalization. The message was delivered with no distortion and the comic revenge Joan has one point that is like this: "And here we have a book that you know who is related to the way I conquer the world and solve problems with my father" .PRICELESS) <br /> <br Nong Cusacks' sister and brother played very well, just like in "Grosse PointeBlank". I would say "mature" a little longer. Marisa Tomeihere didn't show her butt and breasts to "impress" us (like she did. Recently "before the demon knows that you are dead ") But she plays a very serious role and tries to pull it out quietly. <br /> <br /> Many critics don't understand. (can not do that Or not wanted) This is not a "normal" movie, but rather a cartoon documentary This feature stands for messaging and does not accept Oscars or has "images" sort of viewing in the purchase of the latest "HDTV experience" TV ... I have even noticed in my local newspaper that movies. This is not good Interview because it's not "art", while the war films of Iraq have been lifted to "balance" clearly and "Participation" makes one wonder if all the mainstream media in the world will be included in the hands of many people .. <br /> <br /> I bet that this feature will prove popular. In foreign countries than in North America As I said earlier, it is all words about America's foreign policy and how to be hijacked by the group. "Special attention" ... Having "normal" American soldiers wearing the company logo "Tamerlane" on combat suits But effective in expressing reality as it is or will soon be a thing of the past. <br /> <br /> Some unattractive images: when "liberating" the country will be a commercial ad Hilarious scenes about how future journalists tend to collect "news" ("Everything must be better with x-box bullocks"))); Military deal with "Disruption"; <br /> <br /> Overall, I do not recommend this to "patriots" or "hard-core" patriots, or otherwise this feature does not make it accessible. "The spirit of the soul" of people (such as propaganda and important commercial interests, always trying to do so) instead of having a well defined message for those who are truthful and towards some ideological goals that Obviously "always"
