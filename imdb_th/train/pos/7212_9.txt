I will not hesitate to adjust to 'Death Trap' in the top 5 of the movie adaptation to the best stage ever. Caine and Reeves (lower-performing actor who never had more chance to do Romantic love, "Superman") played superbly here. Even Dyan Cannon - I normally don't care - plays a role in taking advantage of her annoyance as an actor. <br /> <br /> I don't. Sure to compare "Deathtrap" to "Sleuth" - Another great adaptation of the story that Michael Caine - correct or fair, although both are a lot of similarities, but "Sleuth" is very much about class wars when the battle of wits and houses in the "detective" is right. Set at least. The characters in the movie are both actors - not real houses. There is an equivalent in "Deathtrap" and "Deathtrap". It's not a very witty fight because it's a chapter. Press briefly about how people should not be condemned. (And not as smart as they think) deserves everything they receive I will say that both movies are excellent examples of the genre and worth your time and money. This is America after all. You don't have to choose! <br /> <br /> I don't twist and turn the plan. But I don't think it's important. I've watched eight or nine DVDs in ten years and still enjoy chemistry and the time and horrible moments when things become "all pear-shaped". Everything works well. Until the ride became more important than the real destination. <br /> <br /> Everyone who likes Hitchcock's humorous and suspenseful movie style may enjoy a lot of "Deathtrap".
