The beautiful image of the traitor (Victor MacLaine, in an Oscar winning performance) who was hunted by his own conscience Ireland, the scene that shows the fight and the actions of the mob is very realistic, focusing on the inner despair of the person. The lack of hope for a better future seems to be a worse fate than death. <br /> <br /> Director John Ford creates a dark and tense atmosphere. Max Steiner's amazing music score adds to the joy of the movie. The Oscars also come from the best screenplay nominated for Best Picture. This is one of Hollywood's classic.
