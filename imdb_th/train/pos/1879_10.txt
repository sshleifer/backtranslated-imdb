I'm too young to remember when I saw this movie for the first time. But I saw it like the second time about 7 years ago. My sister told me that I had to watch it. Now my whole family has memorized We bid at least once a day. I definitely like this movie. I still laugh all the time. Of course, it's about a millionaire who is very drunk that is not responsible. The whole point is that he still has humanity lost in other people that we see in the movie. And he is willing to give all love I would like to recommend this movie to everyone who wants to laugh. Many laughs It looks cute and cute, and if your movie is a movie, it will literally change your mind into a "funny" look with your group of friends or family and I promise that you will have nothing to say about this With an Authur cable in your head It will make you laugh for many years. <br /> <br /> It's really hard in my family to find movies that everyone likes. But I feel that this film makes us closer And I know it will do the same for you !!
