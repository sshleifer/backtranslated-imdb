I watched the first series with greed. But wondering if I will go back again after a long stay However, I adapted to the first episode of Series 2 and was stuck again. This is a really great TV program. New things like Mission: Impossible. Back in the 1960s, the characters were rounded and expanded when the series continued. They changed when they adapted to the condition. New environment But still being a clever character Someone you don't think you feel sorry about something happens to them. I hope to have 'lost' for many years to wait - and I don't think much if I have never received answers to all the mysteries!
