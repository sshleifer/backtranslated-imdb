I think 'Blackadder III' is one of the best series. <br /> <br /> All episodes are really funny. Personally, I like the episode. 'The invasion of France', but those with superstitious actors in 'MACBETH' are really funny. The way Rowan plays with them is the highest level of humor (English). <br /> <br /> Actors: 'Don't speak. That way again, play; Blackadder: Oh, you want me to speak to the Scot. Actors: Yes, Blackadder: More than MACBETH ...! <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Rowan and I have most jobs But I think he made the Blackadder series very well. <br /> <br /> I hope that Rowan will continue his wonderful style. But I think we can trust him because he has worked in Bean 2, which will come out this year. I can't wait .. <br /> <br /> I gave Blackadder this 3rd. 9 out of 10 points
