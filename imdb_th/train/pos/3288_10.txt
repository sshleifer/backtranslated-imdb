This is a great fantasy movie. One of the people who like me is really cool. The director is Bernard Rose, the director of Candyman. He started superbly with this movie. <br /> <br /> A movie about a girl named Anna, a glandular patient On the 11th birthday, she draws a house on a piece of paper from her exercise book and falls into a dream that the house is real. The dream that followed each time she changed was the appearance of what she added to the picture. In her third dream, she met a boy. She thought she had created the name Mark. She is friendly with him and their relationship is stronger when the dream is dark and scary. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Burke, Anna's player, is a great actress. In what else She really gave a great performance in this movie. Hans Simmer's score is the same as Broken Arrow. The song is horrible and mysterious. It's a real shame that the soundtrack is no longer available on CDs. DVDs are only available in R2.
