Anyone who witnesses our justice process - or lacks it, will find that this movie is truly satisfying. There are not too many shades of gray for the character or plot. Every character in this film is a clear example of what is the best and worst thing about our society. The popularity of this film may be due to the fact that most of us, at one time or another, have to deal with problems that arise with those who have power in the name of "politics". > <br /> Interesting performances across the board I sympathize with the victim of rape - at the same time I find it gratifying to see her wiping a self-satisfied person and being arrogant from the face of the former attacker. In particular, I found a barrage that is one of the most ugly characters in all the movies I have seen, so it's good to see her old victims shut her mouth well. The rapist and the psychotic leader is equally ugly, so it is suitable for Dirty Harry, who is offended by him in the end. This is part one of the saga Harry the Dirty equal to the first.
