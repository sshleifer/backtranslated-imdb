This movie is one for all ages. First of all, I must say that after seeing this one time, it became one of my favorite movies of all time. Why? Easy. Ben Coccio (writer, director) has compiled the true art work that 99.9% of today's movies are truly entertaining. Director Ben Coccio gives us the truth to be true to us as a learning tool Will know why this happened Main media, spin and spin But Beck Cocio looked at the shooting of the school in the face, able to go where there was no other form of media that had been before in the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill classmates. While it is graphic and absolutely awesome, is it impossible? The gloves come out. The lies and the sugar coating of our media professors are discarded and we are taken to a place where we can find the truth of what has happened. Sometimes it is not just a loose screw, as everyone likes to think. Sometimes, hatred and loneliness are more deep than humans. We show that these boys are us and us. The society left them behind and the consequences were scary and true. <br /> <br /> Respect and love your human friends. Lessons that we all should learn. Thank you very much for creating this film. Mr. Coccio I hope to be expected that you will continue your filmmaking career.
