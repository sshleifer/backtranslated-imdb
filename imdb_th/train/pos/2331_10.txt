At first, I was surprised that the main character of the TV program could bring death back to life. But then I thought I would shoot it. Guess what? I like "push Daisy" and hope to get Wednesday night to see it. Then for the next week I watch a few times on my DVR Colorful characters, witty banter, quick dialogue and new unique situations attract me into and captivate from beginning to end. The relationship of Ned and Chuck Charles is an interesting story to watch as they work on a love affair with the fact that they can't get physical contact. Even the characters of Emerson Cod are becoming increasingly complex and Olive Snook! Jiminy Crispies! She broke me! The narrator's voice is fun to listen to, and the movie makes me impressed that I'm watching movies instead of watching TV. I recommend my family and friends to use "Daisy" and they are also requested !!! The show is worth waiting for a week for the new episode and if you don't see "P.D." I suggest watching it!
