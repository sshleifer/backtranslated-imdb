This is a delightful film, although the evidence is stupid. It is gratifying to be guilty of watching. It seems that Meg Ryan will be able to pull out the role in this movie. (Another example is Joe and the volcano) That's what makes her a star. Of course, Walter Matt is also capable, and he makes himself play a role in creating an einstein that is funny and has a good heart I think you can say that both of them are good characters in drawing cute characters, even though they are cute in different ways.
