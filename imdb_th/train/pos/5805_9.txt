(There is no way to spoil much because there is no plot to reveal. Still, I think I will explain something that happened so ...) This is it. This is the most ridiculous movie I've ever seen. There are no words to describe this film, though. "Wacky" "Nonsense" and "Ego Trip" are close at hand. The half-hour release is a really strange music video without a plot or continuation other than MJ that had fallen from before. One of the highlights of this part of the "movie" in which MJ is flying a cheerful plane through what appears to be a half-arsed intro bond rejected and the part cut from a yellow submarine. (Dear, you can't do it This story <br /> <br /> Then, with the remaining one hour "movie" started with a lot of clay. (Some really creepy) saw our "hero" and pursued him looking for autographs. Obviously this made us dumb (reduce the song), brought quite anxious and he managed to lose them. temporary Fortunately for him, because it means he can see the falling star and again I don't do it, become a clay rabbit. He uses this cunning disguise to try and sneak through them. But for the reason that I do not remember now, they look through it (oh no!) And the creepy chase begins again, another song (big shot) <br /> <br /> Shortly after the chase ended, MJ brought the rabbit to life until he was arrested by the police. (In the middle of the desert) because it is clearly illegal to dance there. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film has the same oddities. Highlights include MJ. Clean the bar to refine. Smooth Criminal includes taking people with his finger, not Just killing men But burned his shadow into the nuclear weapons wall Another good time was when MJ saw Mr Big (Joe "What happened to his career at this point?" Peschi) kidnapped a boy whom he was friends with, creating an amazing Tommy gun and at the time of Violence again Pepper, this movie seems to randomly turn on everything that moves. The last moment I will mention is when MJ is surrounded by the master and his private army. Seriously, this guy had dozens of people working for him and they decorated like a commando rather than a villain, which I thought they were. How can he get out? Why did he become a robot with weapons and shields? This is three-quarters of the changes he has made most of the time when being backed up in one corner and / or during the run. <br /> <br /> The film is quite surreal, with an entrance and No continuity
