I just saw this movie and I was very surprised. It is not often that I can see my favorite actor in one movie at a time. <br /> <br /> I really like the pocket scene and it's good to see Rachael Bilson and Hayden come back. Live together I think their chemistry in the camera is a direct result of spending time together outside the camera. My favorite scene is far (Surprisingly) Bret Ratner's piece ... without having to abandon too much, I will say that there is a surprise that makes you hang ... <br /> <br /> Very good old couple together and You get a real impression that they spend time together throughout their lives. <br /> <br /> Both Chris Cooper and the Ethan Hawke group are packed with surprises that look realistic and like the experience I have in the app Big apple Overall, this movie is the perfect place for dating ... especially if you already like this city. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for the next day in the city of love. have
