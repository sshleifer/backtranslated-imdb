Maybe you don't care about social criticism or filmmakers. (I was surprised at the meaningless view. Kasdan seems to be promoting when it is obvious that the action in the movie promotes the importance of CERTAIN. The ending is confusing me.) Magnificent symbols throughout; The arc of the spiral character image; The conversation is an absolute masterpiece. I have watched the movie dozens of times and I am still amazed by its perfection. There is no moment to cut or line actions that are not related to the theme. Realistic human performances from all actors The scene in front of us is amazing. <br /> <br /> I have a beautiful sap-meter. The sound of the ring never stops during this movie. If you are a thinker (Not a normal viewer) This movie is definitely a passionate attraction. (You have to agree with the message that will thank the display. Who cares if it makes you warm and fuzzy? Is it interesting?) <br /> <br /> Personally, this film affects. me? Meaningfully In my top 5. <br /> <br /> Note: The first reviewer spoke clearly from the unusual perceptions of African Americans. What he may not be able to remember is whether there is a hand? Shaking, not hands-off, white man who died spiritually 'Just see a man giving respect and admiration. And what did he do about it The fact that he is a black person has little to do with it. (The color is used to draw parallel lines and gaps. There is no accident that the opening sequence changes from black and white to color.) If you watch the blacks in this movie as 'token' ?? You may want to re-evaluate your concern. You may only see black and white, right?
