"Shower" is a story about loyalty about the non-stop progress of the modern world in the damage from a rather traditional and human life. A man was forced to choose between a successful career, a big city life, a wife and a mentally ill brother. Eternal doubts between what we want to do and what we should do Modern Chinese and ancient Public baths with cricket rallies fighting shopping centers and skyscrapers Many old men who do not want anymore One Chinese country, two systems, as Xiao Ping said ... Even though one of them is killing another country, <br /> <br /> The gentle movement is full of funny moments and bitter desserts. And laugh equally Actors are very large, especially those who show the role of mentally retarded children. And Yang Zhang did a good job. Simple, simple. Let the story flow through itself. <br /> <br /> My rate: 8/10
