Unexpected happiness like I have never heard about this movie. <br /> <br /> Humiliating because it is guaranteed to have more viewers. <br /> <br /> Amazingly humane stories. With a gentle social message Predictable in resolution Completely executed by the employer Take beautiful pictures with the colors that are floating on the gray, which captures the nostalgic tone of the movie. <br /> <br /> My last attack on the Chinese movie (Bath, The Road Home, Not One Less) is something. Exciting that I hope To continue to explore China and the people in it are amazing canvas for filmmakers. "The King of Masks" can be introduced as a starting point for anyone interested in Chinese movies recently. <br /> <br />
