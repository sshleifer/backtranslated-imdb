This movie is a movie that is made from a very powerful real story that can make it look angry. I said that because of the brutal persecution of people in this case, innocent Australian couples who were charged with killing their children <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep was accepted by many of her performances This movie came out But I think Sam Neil is good too. Suppose that both are excellent. But the role is slightly more difficult for the stream because she must learn the Australian accent (She learned it well, I have a problem understanding her part) <br /> <br /> Without having to abandon anything, all I can say is that this movie will make you exhausted.
