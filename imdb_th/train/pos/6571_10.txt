<br /> <br /> The first thing I have to say is that I am the owner of Jake Speed. I saw it at least 10 times. This movie is one of the most fun movies ever created. The movie begins with Margaret (Karen Kopins) trying to find her sister. Her sister was kidnapped in Paris and the family had not heard anything. Jake Speed ​​(Wayne Crawford) came together to tell her where her sister was and offered to meet her. Jake Speed ​​is a hero. He didn't work for money because he just needed help and had a good adventure. His partner (Dennis Christopher) Follow him around and write their adventures in the novel. This movie is a great adventure. It's hilarious. It's full of action. It's great. I think it is a cult cult following. Very small. Crawford is perfect while Jake Speed ​​and sends torpedoes that you will never forget. Kopins and Christopher are also good, both young women and close friends, respectively. John Hert (John Hurt ) The person who broke the stomach in the aliens played an evil demon that just added fun in many ways. The film is similar to Indiana Jones in many ways, similar to the James Bond movie. Whether it is What is the name of the movie that much more enjoyable.
