You are no more gloomy than the tragedy of "Othello" and the film captures quite a good drama, with outstanding performances by Lawrence Fishburne and Irene Jacob Fishburne expressing the suffering of Othello's audience while he was a victim The lie of Iago reliably even when epilepsy Jacob is a loving and loyal wife who becomes the tool of Otto's revenge on Igo or is his anger. (It is not clear that there is no motivation for Iago's behavior.) Although Kenneth Brannagh (sp?) Shows his normal ability for Shakespeare in this film. But he is quite inferior. Cassio and Emilia's characters still walk in and out of the scene, even though they, like Iago, seem to be more important to the plot. I haven't checked the movie with the drama to see how many lines have been cut. But I know that Shakespeare tends to develop his character, even those that are not important. It seems very good. <br /> <br /> If I have criticized the film, it may be that the story. Spread out too quickly and the relationship between some characters is not more organized. The director has excellent actors and no one offers bad results. The relationship between Cassio and Othello and between Emilia and Desdemona needed to be developed earlier in the film. I have a feeling that they are more intimate than the movie suggests. Even if you feel this in this movie, Othello and Desdemona still need time together. Although their anguish is reliable But the number of interactions they have with each other makes them look like they just met On the other hand, it may just be found --- like Romeo and Juliet. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: Good performances are too short. <br /> <br />
