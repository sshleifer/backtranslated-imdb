Directing behind this film is a great story for comedy. Many scenes seem to come out of comic books and are much darker (see - not a wise story) than I expected. Getting this may not be the most fun movie ever, especially if you are a very rude sexual joke because there are very few. (Compared to others like Something About Mary or American Pie) As you watch again, many jokes stand out and are fun. If you have read comic books or watch comic book movies (Batman, X-Men and others) and like them, you may enjoy the subtle humor that continues throughout the story. If you don't like them, you may like to ridicule the respect that this movie has to offer. If you like this movie, the DVD has some special features (8/10).
