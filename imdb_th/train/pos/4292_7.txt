Didn't know anything about the movie before watching and I thought it was an "unexpected" factor that helped me endure at first and after that, as I expected. <br /> <br /> settings Interesting, strange, but interesting. The story has a gap / cross that I think makes the audience not interested. There is no great soundtrack played in the background, creating a "romantic" atmosphere, but all of them are not important. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Emma and Lewis is very beautiful. Not that I cannot I fell in love with it and here I wrote this review. The image of the deep love of the two actors is excellent and I believe that is the theme of this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a romantic comedy every day. In fact, not all of us will appreciate it. I had to sit for a while and gradually began to understand the little things that I didn't catch at first. I can't guarantee that everyone will like it. But i hope you do
