I work with children aged 0? 6 years old and they love the Doodlebops Doodlebops that are energetic, bright and attractive. When they started singing, '' We are the Doodlebops. We are the Doodlebops. We are Doodlebops. Oh, yes. Come join the fun because we laugh and we sing all day. Each fun item is a Doodlebops adventure. Don't try to change the world with a sermon. All they do is fun. May be related to Doodlebops, a lively alternative and an interesting choice for general children's television programs
