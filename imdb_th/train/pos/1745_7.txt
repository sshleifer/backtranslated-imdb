How friendly, charming and sincere. I'm glad to see the old Lugosi. It's friendly and lively. Disarm. It is a document of a long lost vehicle. (The best TV series today is hardly able to compete with these moderate good serials.) CHANDU is a person who is optimistic and deep. It's a revival of the mind. It's not stupid. A fool is a person who does not receive the agreement to use the publication. CHANDU has an irresistible and easily irresistible and friendly feeling. Chandu is a western magician who uses this eastern name and who loves and protects his granddaughter with a killer part. <br /> <br /> Chan looks out for his supernatural gift in a quite way. Providence and Pan <br /> <br /> As Nadji is a relatively sexy niece, she is kidnapped by the priest of Ubasti: the evil Vindhyan. In fact, the poor sexy girl is kidnapped in the coffin after being Sent to sleep with flowers Almost kidnapped from a boat by a fake police, the temple of Lemuria and a creepy ritual similar to the image of KING KONG? And the cynicism of the RCC. Rituals and rituals Immoral and heartless means drunk and this is only his performance He is an average model, drunk, uncle, naughty and crafty and inclined. This may sound like respect for Lugosi. Still, Wood's biography from Burton made me impressed about Lugosi. I enjoy the strange show of Lugosi. <br /> <br /> This serial is unfairly beaten.
