I saw this movie for the first time at the Berlin Film Festival and I have never seen Hong Kong theaters before. I felt like sitting in a roller coaster. The action was very fast and there were no boring moments throughout the movie. It has martial arts, love, special techniques and a great plot. My favorite scene is when the Taoists drink, sing and fight for themselves - one of many scenes that emphasize the extraordinary musical elements of the movie. This movie must be clear !!
