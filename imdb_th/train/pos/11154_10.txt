In my opinion, this is one of the greatest films ever made in America and deserves every award that has been awarded and is attached to the top 100 list of AFI (although it is too low in This list of the top 250 IMDB programs) If you enjoy showing the highest level of talent (Voight and Hoffman are great couples), drawing characters and creating directions for editing and filming movies. You will love it as much as I do. Schlesinger draws a bright, always credible image in the late 1960s of New York City and is a large number of victims struggling to overcome personal demons and survive in the midst of poverty, hopelessness. The technique of creating movies used here captures the feel of the film movement in the New York underground. (And of the city) was excellent and no less than dazzling I've seen many ideas. (Including quick editing, incident management with the sequences of drug / travel sequences and flowing cartoon faces during the murder scene to convey the suffering and fear) to the filmmakers Other stealing br> <br /> The relationship between Joe and Ratso is handled in a manner that is seen as an unusually strong friendship. I think the director manages this matter very carefully, not to deal with time censorship. But emphasizing his energy in the importance of connecting human beings in life, whether sex or not. <br /> MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a film with courage, influence and importance that is lost. Lost without any impact over the years, so if you don't see it, you are thinking of authentic American classics I recommend this movie to everyone. <br /> <br /> Score: 10 out of 10
