This is one of those rare movies. It is a lovely and attractive, elegant and strange gift. I think it is necessary to travel to Italy or any holiday, because it reminds you to experience a wider experience. (Search for magic) I love Josie Lawrence, especially as Lottie Wilkins. But all the leading actors and supporters are impeccable in this movie. If you like fashion and clothing, it is especially well done. I just hope that they will be released on DVD because I have exhausted my tape version! <br /> <br /> Absolutely worth your time, just be sure to come and see without interruption.
