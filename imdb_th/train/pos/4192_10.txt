In what might find yourself in Fuller's best movie list (That's when I saw them more and this just Shock Corridor) Pickup on South Street is a noir movie that a bad girl and male protagonist. Not a stereotypical type Like all of his other works, Fuller shows his own experiences and feelings of New York style that are often lost in Hollywood Noir. On a small budget - at least for Darryl F. Zanuck's favorite thing - Fuller and his actors create a favorite character even in the dark atmosphere. The good guy is the person who will not be violent to you even if they are looking for a buck. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter are all excellent. Only a few people can think of who can really pull this character out. He is a bit like Bugs Bunny while he can be a wise person who is a cunning person. On the other hand, the character of Skip McCoy has a set of values ​​in his life. He did not go to other people's business and tried to take care of the working world outside his small cottage on the river after being sent for three years. He sneaked up unconsciously when he picked up a woman's bag (Peters) on the train and lifted things under the eyes of the government. It may have some secrets that can make him a lot of money. But the most important thing is the price of this movie because it's related to the Moe chair (Ritter is one of the best and most reliable actors of that era), the former woman (Kiley Evaporator) and the police department. <br /> In addition to the elements that have been told by the enthusiastic journalism style (Like the previous position of Fuller with boxers) New and relevant conversations There is a natural movement of the fuller camera. And the third thing acts This is a lightweight and tight film noir that is worth checking out, even if you are not familiar with Fuller. (It's rather strange than some of his later works)
