This is the true story of an Australian couple who was charged with murder when their baby disappeared. Meryl Streep is always excellent and tries to keep our attention even if she plays as a favorite character. <br /> <br /> The media craze surrounding this case in Australia is reminiscent of Sam Sheppard's murder in Ohio in the 1950s. These real-life situations show that the media This can affect the handling of criminal cases. I remember the Plain Plains dealer, Cleveland, using a large headline that says "Why can't Sam Sheppard in prison?" Finally, the prosecutor succumbed to unstoppable pressure and Sheppard was tried and convicted. He was imprisoned after many years. <br /> <br /> I love movies that tell real stories, do it in an interesting way, and create important points in the process. This is one of those movies. Other great movies that tell the story of innocent people accused of crimes include "Hurricane", "The Thin Blue Line" and "Breaker Morant". In particular, this film is another Australian film. Highly recommended stories. <br /> <br /> 8/10
