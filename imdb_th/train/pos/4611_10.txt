Version: Universal / Hong Kong Legends R4 DVD release Cantonese / English subtitles <br /> <br /> Once upon a time, five years ago the world was overwhelmed. 'The Matrix' and I may be one of the few fifteen years that still believe that 'Terminator' is better than 'Matrix'. I'm a normal teenager looking for good action movies and then There was a bright light on a television station that I had never really watched. A small station called SBS, one night I noticed in the TV guide that the movie starring Jackie Chan - 'Police Story' will be released later. At the age of fifteen and only seeing 'Rumble in the Bronx' and 'Rush Hour' I said ... "WOW AWESOME" and sat down to watch. Two weeks later, after SBS performed the trilogy 'Police story' I know I have met my favorite actor. <br /> <br /> Jackie plays as a Hong Kong police officer who is holding the drug Jue (Persevering) Selina. Fong (Brigit Lin), the secretary of Chu, was arrested by the police and witnesses were assigned to protect her. Bad things - reaaaal bad - when Chu's case was dismissed and he decided he wanted Fong and Chan to die. <Br /> <br /> 'Police Story' is one of the best action movies. The most Chan movie started strong and ended with one of the most amazing action scenes ever filmed. Everything in it is very good. However, some funny parts may look tepid than a few people ... <br /> <br /> As a story, this is one of Jackie's great efforts. For the action movie, the story is quite good and Jackie is a better actor in this story than he did in 'New Police Story'. This is not a 'miracle' but may be a good thing. <br /> < br /> 'Police Story' is one of Jackie's best works. It made me stick to the Jackie Chan movie and should be a good start for Jackie's fans. The bad news for everyone who saw this for the first time was Jackie Chan's movie. - 10/10
