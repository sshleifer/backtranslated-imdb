Cutting the chase scene: This movie is one of the most amazing and intense films I've ever seen. The first movie in many years that left me absolutely unsettled. I barely felt out of the cinema. I felt so bad. <br /> <br /> I stared at the screen for about fifteen minutes to try to find a way to explain the power of the film. Just fail Highlights one side of it - diary style, video format, documentary style, unflinching images of the character's strength events - seems to spoil all the importance. Some people may find it ridiculous that any killer might look like normal. But not every killer is raving at the mouth. Many people are ordinary people, not insolent. It's different. <br /> <br /> And that's probably the coldest idea.
