Just watched this movie from a DVD and thought that the performance was very good. But the whole story is left to be desired This film has the texture and appearance of Panic in Needle Park or Drugstore Cowboy. It's hard to believe that humans can live like this. Based on the society in which all their existence is based on simple drug use, crime, violence, gender and lack of self-respect for any person or thing There is a prominent role in John Holmes, a former "burning" porn star. A supporting actor is also good. However, this is a bleak, dark, disturbing and depressing movie. The murder was cruel. But the daily lives of these people are also cruel. Unless you are interested in murder or a "fan" of John Holmes, this is not a movie to watch. If you want to watch the drama "docu" about the Truman Capit Murder in 1960 In Cold Blood, starring Scott Wilson and Robert Blake is much better.
