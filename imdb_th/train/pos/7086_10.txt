NB: Internal spoiler This great movie "about" many things they have achieved: time travel with sci-fi, uncertain psychology, dystopian society, what is the real syndrome, undermining the belief system. <br /> <br /> The distinction of the distorted timeline of the story encourages fierce debate - witness the discussion on this website. Or review the thesis at www.mjyoung.net/time/monkeys.html Tae! The emphasis on that time speaks of the great plot that came from the great work of the writer David and Janet peoples. Not to mention Chris Marker's "La Jetee" inspiration. This film is one of the most successful and interesting movies ever. But there are many levels that are said here. <br /> <br /> The true genius of this film is to focus on the disgusting side effects of time travel in the minds of James Cole (Bruce Willis The best work of his career here). His journey continues from the warriors, hunting for lung-ho vaccines to victims who are not folly. And come back again Sweeping other broad stories focuses on personal matters between James and Dr. Kathryn Riley (the great Madeleine Stowe), more and more. I like the view of moving / opposing the two characters at the same time. For me it all came to a head in the fleabag hotel room scene from this point. James? Once captured by a strong commitment Now in the utmost doubt about his own reality; While Dr. Railly, a brilliant and rational scientist? Finally, he was fiercely confident after receiving proof from James about his horrific predictions. Her despair to pass James and go to the mission reveals how far she has come. <br /> <br /> Gilliam makes us care about these characters, especially through the time of Stress that increases tension The balance that arises between the roller coaster mood and the puzzle, the puzzle / thriller, is great. And the storyline at the airport was so tough because we saw it clearly through James' dream. Is here after James has decided to stop all the regulations ?? And is fighting his madness more than ever? That he stepped back on the plate and did what was necessary for humans. See Jose and the gun? (Previously, references to "Vertigo" and the alternation / confusion of the person were great) This is a movie that will be interrupted during people's thinking. It not only holds up under repeated viewing, it needs them. The "Twelve Monkeys" are intelligent, bizarre, funny and suspicious. <br /> <br /> The supporting actors are excellent, especially Brad Pitt. Every scene of him But had survived And with David Morse as Dr. Peters (interesting that this movie just let the audience have evil inspiration) and Christopher Plummer as Dr. Goin, but the greatest prize is Terry Gilliam, who is superior to him - just his outstanding Brazilian. (Of course many, especially the solitary fighters who tried to escape his disastrous environment: insanity, insanity, insanity) Every frame of this film has a stamp and his unique tone. The soundtrack is great as well. <br /> <br /> This is one of the greatest achievements of my 90s, which is truly my favorite and is sure to have to wait a long time.
