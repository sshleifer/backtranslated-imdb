Otto Preminger ends around the noir at Twentieth Century Fox. The new collection of "Laura" leads to being a brave detective actor. Dana Andrew plays the police again. But this time he was insulted and accused of brutality with the police by his chief - "You don't hate hats. You like to beat them!" Mark Dixon (Andrews) insulted criminals because his father was a crook He didn't want to be "Sandy Dixon descendants", so he became a police officer. But his method is cruel and hateful Who hate Scalise (Gary Merrill) for criminal offenses However, the mistake occurred with Paine's father-in-law, Jiggs Taylor (Tom Tully), the daughter of Morgan Taylor (Tearney), who separated from her husband. you Paine slapped his wife, causing anger to her father, who appeared in his son's apartment. But not until Dixon left the body There is no better suspect. Jiggs is arrested and charged. <br /> <br /> Full of guilt, Mark falls in with Morgan and offers money to lawyers. He decided to continue receiving Scalise, but left the letter to the department in the event that he died, confessing everything. In the end he was unable to live with the knowledge of what he had done and he allowed the letter to be read by the chief and Morgan. Despite all the tragic circumstances, Morgan acknowledged her love for Mark and will wait for him. <br /> <br /> It's a good story to see this movie on DVD after the chaos. On television for many years Eddie Mueller, a noir film historian, commented and worked well. But I found that he insisted that the audience would not see the importance of casting both since "Laura" six years ago. In that sense, he was misunderstood because they appeared in "The Iron Curtain" two years ago at WTSE and this film was successful at the box office. <br /> <br /> Andrew and Tae Yarney is a novel together and Ruth Donnelly is a great cartoon as the owner of the restaurant. Martha blows the flame between the detective and her. <br /> <br /> The night view of the city makes this movie dangerous. Threatening Gary Merrill is great in the base. The low-life Scalise, which used to have a criminal case against Dixon's father ("Your father likes me," he joked Mark), Karl Malden, and the young Neville brand is excellent as well. And Tom Tully touched and joked like Morgan's unfairly pop pop. <br /> <br /> Noir, a movie that can be watched with great actors.
