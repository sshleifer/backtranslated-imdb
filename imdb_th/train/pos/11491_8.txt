The Unborn is a very different movie. James Karen & Brooke Adams is in this movie and they perform quite well. This film is built firmly and it will help you go. Although I think you must be a horror movie fan who must watch this thing because of the scenes and plot. There is a short sex scene that has no nudity that may be left to some people. This scene may cause someone like me who is entering the movie and think that this is a good movie. There is a scene where Adams' characters are crazy about and killing cats. But you can tell that it's not true The song is very different, but very good. The Unborn, in my opinion, is an eerie movie that is unpredictably fantastic and it's quite strange! I recommend all horror fans in this movie!
