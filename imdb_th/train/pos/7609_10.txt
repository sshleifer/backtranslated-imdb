Absolutely excellent performances The second season begins, where the first ends with a lot of mystery. Finally suspense, if not every episode and mystery One that makes me think and think again It's truly great that writers can connect with all connections and connect all characters together and combine all these elements to make the characters' lives in the show meaningful Never fail to be excited and I wait for the new season. Hope that more secrets will be revealed and at the same time more mystery to be solved. The casting is too good for this performance to fit the character perfectly. Really can't wait to discover the secret in the end Hope that all ads will not make the ending.
