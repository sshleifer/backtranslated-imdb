The good thing about this movie is that it stands alone - you don't have to see the original. Unfortunately, this is the biggest disadvantage. It would be good to combine some original characters in a new story and see how their lives developed. Sinclair, like in the original movie, is great and gives the best comic moments as he tries to deal with the awkward and embarrassing situations. Forsyth will congratulate the courageous effort to Move the character and create the original sequel. But this film has flaws and ultimately lacks the original warmth
