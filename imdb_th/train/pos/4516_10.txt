Since educating Rita Julie Walters is one of my role models and her performance in this story as a woman who helps the man she loves to be harmonious with his feminine side. I will not believe that her character is in the hands of a few actors. But Walters pulled it out with gusto and dress up. Adrian Pasdar gave the best performance today to the male lead.
