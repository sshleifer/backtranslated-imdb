8 simple rules are comedy But there are some life lessons, especially one adult lesson about moving after the loss, which is when Paul died, which was the first episode that I had watched from the Hennessy-Cate mother ABC. (Katey Sagal), daughter Bridget (Kaley Cuoco) and Kerry (Amy Davidson), and Rory's son (Martin Spanjers) - look for someone else for advice and support after Paul's death (John Ritter). Cate's parents (James Garner and Suzanne Pleshette) I'm almost at hand for later in the season 2 of the show, they decided to put David Spade in this list because he's done with the series, NBC Just Shoot Me! But all these performances are quite good. This show reminded me of the classic family sitcom from the 80s and 90s that had been on ABC.
