I read Schneebaum's book (the same name as this movie) when it was first published and was very impressed with his ability to look through "being" (self and people The Amazon that he lives and loves) How to live the right life His next book was not very powerful. But showed his ongoing mission His explanation of his sexual relationship with the people of the tribe was an advance in the early 1960s, but his honesty and openness about this matter were welcomed. This film represents both the magnificence and generosity of the man. But also shows the inevitable destruction of innocence (Which is not a morally positive word in this case) that occurs when the "civilized" person enters the traditional society Helping humanity from its own destruction
