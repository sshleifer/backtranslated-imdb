"Cut" is a full-tilt spoof of the slasher type, and in the main part it achieves most of the predetermined things. There are standard slasher cliches; The creepy, old-fashioned, wild, unidentified killer, did not have a blood storage tank, and of course both were interrupted by the killer while they were having sex. (Which is hardly a spoiler) <br /> <br /> Set-ups are their own simplicity: school movie nerds set to complete the "masterpiece" slasher. Unfinished finish because of the murder of a couple. Of actors This was done - okay, disorganized - leaving Kylie Minogue in the first game. They were joined by one of the survivors of the original movie, played by Molly Ringwald who stole the movie because she received the best role. The rest of the actors are well suited to their roles, especially the lovely Jessica Napier, who plays the exact role, while the chaos and blood erupts around her. <br /> <br /> There is Many red herring fish There is very little time to try to figure out who is the killer because this movie moves quickly. There is also a low budget, including a clumsy correction which may be a careful consideration. A good soundtrack as well. If there is a problem with this movie, it is a decision, whether it is sending or showing respect for the slasher type.
