Joe Don Baker is one of the actors who are always better than his content and are often appreciated. He had been in many movies, whether it was heavy or a hero, and was strong and strong that Wallace Beery had done half a century before. Baker can deliver material that is ridiculous from other actors and that is a great thing for him. He seemed to mean what he said, regardless of the old idea or madness, which made him in the league with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Strauss. It's what makes WALLKING TALL Trilogy work well and the same magic is at the final justice. This is a popular movie in theaters and videos in the 80s and it is older than well-known acts of that era. By moving actions from Texas to Europe, there are really timeless qualities that do not cause you to escape from screen actions. To be honest, I like Greydon Clark's movie, which is a ridiculous director in the veins, as well as Clint Eastwood in the 70s. The final justice is one of the lost gems in the late 80s, similar to MAN ON FIRE in true effort and violence. I think if they do this with The Rock, all new audiences will love it as much as I do.
