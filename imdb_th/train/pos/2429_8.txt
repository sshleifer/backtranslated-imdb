If you love Deep Cover, you may like this movie as well. Many Fishburne verse poems recited in the Deep Cover come from the poems of "Once upon a time in life", the screen adaptation of the play, which Fishburne wrote. If you love Larry as much as I am, you will love this movie. That is Larry, all hot and flawless Of course, playing with guns and using illegal substances is a strange gangster movie, but the script is beautiful and the story is impressive even in a slight flick. <br /> <br /> Amazing movie ... Dark, scary, sexy and exciting. If you sneak outside at night or hang out in the clubhouse, you will get the proper impact from the cramped scene. (Reflecting on being stuck in life) full of intelligent and complex relationships, this film is cramped ... every feeling is reflected in the dress and the camera Good work!
