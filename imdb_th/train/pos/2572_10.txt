I think it's a very funny movie. I love dog movies and comedy movies, so they are combined twice as much. K-9, k-911 and k-9 PI are my favorite movies. The only downside is that I don't really understand how Dooley's wife died. She died before the film, but how? If they say I must miss Besides that I gave two thumbs / tails up! Those dogs (Jerry Lee and Zeus) must be trained a lot. They were very funny and all the sounds that Jerry Lee made when Dooley spoke to him was very funny. My favorite is when Jerry Lee sings and when he bites a private person to receive information.
