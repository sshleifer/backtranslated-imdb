I waited for many years before the film was finally released in England. But was very pleased when I saw it There are many wonderful things for this movie for starting the show. It's not all I want in horror pictures. But everyone in this film has received good results. This chapter and script are always interesting and interesting, with a good feeling of Lovecraftian, making the movie a truly strong backbone. Add to the amount of terrifying nightmares and occasional horrible blood and winning movies It has the blood that I like too. In addition, the character of Marcus, a transgender bodybuilder, anger and daisy, a retarded lover / his toy is truly crazy and suspicious. Shocking or even more than anything that Hollywood can create. My only gripe is that I want the ending to be dark in the tone. But still able to use it, so overall I would like to recommend this to a serious horror movie
