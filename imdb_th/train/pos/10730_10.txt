Unfortunately, SpaceCamp came out at the same time as the Challenger Explosion, which actually put crimp when it was time to bring it out or even if they should bring it out. I'm glad they did. I watched SpaceCamp for the first time in the drive movie. <br /> <br /> While I have heard Lea Thompson and Tom Skerritt, I have never heard of other people in this movie. So it was really shocking that I found that those children were performing and performing really well! Of course, Kate Capshaw is also great. <br /> <br /> I like the scene, especially the scenes of children prepared for the journey they can hope for. The launch of a real spacecraft, of course, is old news to us. However, this movie is different. <br /> <br /> All of this is my most precious movie, maybe I can escape, but it's great for the bean area like me. After renting from 30 to 40 times, I finally found it in some stores and bought it. Now if it comes out in DVD format only I might have it forever This movie received 9 out of 10 from me.
