As a "rebuttle" for AFI's top 100 films, the British Film Institute made a documentary about Martin Scorsese. <br /> <br /> Now I'm a big fan of movies and am proud of myself seeing movies. Many story But now I'm facing my idol. In an excellent documentary film Scorsese went through the audience through several stages of American history in the film. This is divided into many parts, including the Western, Gangster and Noir movies. Martin Scorsese is full of enthusiasm. Bounce is a great tour guide, as well as a great teacher.
