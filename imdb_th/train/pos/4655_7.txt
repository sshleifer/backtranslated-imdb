Peter Ustinov plays a great shrug that just got out of jail when the movie began. As soon as he walked out of the door, he started working on the project to steal the group again. But this time he has a relatively high tourist attraction Actually, this is one of the weaknesses about the movie while he doesn't know anything about the computer. (A few years ago in 1968) but turned out to be a true computer genius overnight! However, he came up with a plan to disguise himself as a computer expert and get a job with a large American company so that he could eventually embezzle cash. Considering the knowledge of his computer, it was surprising that he had a great plan and managed to infiltrate his computer system and defense. But it was a movie after all so I was able to suppress unbelief At the end of this film, he and his new wife (Maggie Smith) can escape with a million pounds. <br /> <br /> At the end, though, it gets confused and Smith announces her very much. Can actually accumulate more than two million people by investing wisely in the company that Ustinov started (although she didn't realize that they were all simulation companies). This would probably mean that she eventually bought these shares. this value What they seem to indicate (And I might have guessed wrong here) is Ustinov and his new partner, quickly cash in stocks before becoming known and the stock will become so worthless. Either way, it seems that the movie is posted in a magical ending where no one is hurt and everyone is happy - and this is not reasonable. It is a shame. While most of the performances and writings are very good, Karl Malden, Bob Newhart, Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith are great. <br /> <br /> If I seem to interpret the end, please inform. Let me know
