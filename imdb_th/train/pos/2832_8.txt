I saw this film in 1969, when the film first debuted at the Kameo Theater in South Beach. It is now the famous Bar Club. It was the last year of the 60s and this movie was very popular in the house. It has everything The gap between the creation of the sexual revolution, the pursuit of success and the conflict between following the "tradition" of the family and the pursuit of their own lifestyle Gus is at the hippiest peak, Sin City in all. It is an honor. Beautiful women, famous pendants, laughs, conflicts, romance and even happy ending A very fun time. <br /> <br /> Posters from this movie are placed on my bedroom wall. I looked at it and went back in time. The time of my youth and my time with my father was a good time in my life.
