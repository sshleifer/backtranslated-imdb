One thing I can say about this movie is very good! Actually, I just bought this movie a couple of months ago because I saw a new version coming out. I am happy to find that it was created in 1978 because of the 70s (although I never lived there) was one of my favorite decades, especially for music! When I actually watched this movie, it was really good at the beginning. But after about 50 minutes, it became boring and repetitive. I will admit that the animation impressed me! It's something I've never seen before and it's quite good to see. But this movie seems to be a bit better than this. It should be more interesting to talk and tell the story than the surprising 15 to 20 minute scene. Then, during the last 5 or 10 minutes, the movie came back again. But ended abruptly In my opinion, I think it's very long. I know it takes 13 minutes in 2 hours and that is still a long time for cartoons. But since it's boring for most movies, it makes it look like it's 4 hours long !!!! But overall, it's a movie that's ok. I guess then I'll watch again in one of the "Never do anything" I will see a new one and hope it will be better!
