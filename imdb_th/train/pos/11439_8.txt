OK - as far as these 2 versions of the movie have 2 people involved in the creation - John Korty and Bill Couterie (George is the creator - he doesn't say anything in the movie - just help with money) - version ' Adults' are possible by Bill Couterie John Korty. Don't like or approve this model. (Like doing on the back) thanks to Ladd's movies under them, not advertising this movie and throwing all of their advertising money for "The Right Stuff" in the hope that it will attract them. Past; ... and it wasn't So this movie never really had a chance when "Twice" connected to a cable (HBO) - they showed a wheel with Bill's version and John threatened to sue if there was a show anymore. The showtime has a 'clean' version. The versions on video tapes and laser disks are versions that have been certified by John (who has more power than Bill). It's a shame. Actually, because the 'adult' version is better and not reasonable. But it is very suspicious that it will be released in that version on a DVD (or any other form that is not appropriate). Sorry to disappoint everyone. I know that all of this information when I was president of the Twice Upon A Time Fan Club (there are still many movies from the list - used to be the owner of the 'adult' version in the inbox but stolen - only with some HBO copies now. ) 8 stars is the 'adult' version - 5 to the 'clean' version. Other questions just ask.
