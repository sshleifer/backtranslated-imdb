If you don't see this charming little, you should look for it. It is the story of Sad Sack, a failed war (Fred MacMurray) with a list of 4-F every time he tries to join a military branch. He found a magical lamp that certainly had Genie (Gene Sheldon), but the Genie was more than MacMurray, sending him across time to serve in the time and place he wanted. It's cute, cheerful and pure fluffy and you can't help but like it. The plot is like a Disney movie, especially since the two stars (MacMurray and Sheldon) both created a lot of Disney movies in the 50's and 60's. Get together No need to say everything ends well for everyone and the audience will feel very good.
