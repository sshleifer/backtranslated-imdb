Clara Lago is a great person as the main character of this film, typically a movie about a Spanish / American girl who moved to Spain with her mother during the Civil War. It turns out that the mother went home to die and she was left with her grandfather. She also made friends and experiences in a short time. Tomiche (Juan Jose Ballestra) annoyed her at first. They then became close. This film was beautifully filmed, mostly bathed in light colors. Carol desires her father, who is a pilot in the war, and you can feel his love for him. While the war itself uses the back seat in this film, it covers the lives of the characters. I think you will like it Look, especially for Clara Lago, who has done a great job as Carol. She is definitely an eye-catching person.
