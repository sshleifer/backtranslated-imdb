Raggedy Ann & Andy is the first movie I have ever seen in a movie theater. My father took my sister and me and the funny thing was - when we got home, the father asked us "What do you want to do now? And we say we want to see Raggedy Ann & Andy again! Hahaha and my dad took us back to the theater to see it again - at least that's how I remember At that time I was five years old. <br /> <br /> This movie was very scary for five years old. Scenes with giant oceans of desserts and hypnotic camel scenes .. I can't remember many from this film. Naturally, the beginning is wonderful and few scenes - I hope I can find it again Should be able to find it now. <br /> <br /> I remember that I love Raggedy Ann & Andy.
