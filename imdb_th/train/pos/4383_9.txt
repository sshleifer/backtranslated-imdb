** Attention Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that Rob Roy is one of the best movies in the 90s. It is a great achievement for everyone involved, especially acting. Of Liam Neeson, Jessica Lang, John Hertz, Brian Cox and Tim Roth Michael Canton Jones portrayed the image of honor and disgrace. The duty of a man can be expressed, alas ... <br /> <br /> It's all the time and unfairly compared to "Braveheart". These are two completely different films, probably similar in the fact that they are both about Scots in Scottish history. But this comparison often bothered me because it seems that almost thought "Braveheart" was a better movie. "Rob Roy" I like "Braveheart" but the idea in comparison to "Rob Roy" is insulting me. Make it easier. I love "Braveheart" but it's a very pale shadow that I love. "Rob Roy" This is my only reason ... <br /> <br /> - "Rob Roy" is about. Real people <br /> <br /> We see William Wallace in "Braveheart", not real people. Is the legend of a martyr who is bigger than life Because of this image, he is still a perfect man, never making mistakes and generally showing to the Scots in the land of promise. When he finally fails, it is not his fault. Like Jesus, he was the most treacherous person he trusted. He had to go through the worst suffering because he wanted a lot of freedom. <br /> <br /> Wallace's depiction is very good and effective. But it doesn't inspire or intrigue me I found that the human ambiguity is more than human perfection. That is why "The Last Temptation of Christ" is a better movie than "King of Kings" and that is one of the reasons I think "Rob Roy" is better than "Braveheart". Rob Roy may be a hero and brave. But he is far from perfect He made many mistakes that affect the lives of his loved ones. Now, of course, the wrong claim to the Duke of Argyll is an act of nobility and courage. But it is a selfish and selfish act Do not forget that the relatives that he claims to protect are driven to homeless at the end of the movie because of this action. But Rob did the best he could, and that's all you could ask for from him. <br /> <br /> Rob, Mary's wife, is a formidable person. Let us start with the way she looks in this movie. Of course she is beautiful. But she didn't make makeup and in general she allowed to show her natural beauty Compare this with two love (Or one depends on your perspective) of William Wallace in "Braveheart". Now these two women are hot. But almost does not indicate how women look at the time May not be a fair comparison But is another example of Rob Roy's efforts for more effective precision. <br /> <br /> At all times, "Rob Roy" Mary must be with the ruthless rape by Castham that is cowardly. She feels right. Forced to tell Rob about her fight But not because she knew that Rob had to seek revenge for her rape Such revenge would mean Rob's death and Mary was not ready for this sacrifice. <br /> <br /> The villains in "Rob Roy" are equally interesting, even though the enemies in " Braveheart "will be written well Robert Bruce, a brave and cowardly man, is a disease caused by moral decisions that everyone is fond of in the realm of fiction. Should he claim to be King of Scotland or should he betray Wallace for the safety of his family name? Bruce is the most ambitious character in "Braveheart" but from Brutus in "Julius Sezier" to Fredo in "The Godfather Part II". This type of character is hardly the same as the original. Longshanks, although the villain of interest in his rights, is one dimension. He is an outbreak of evil and his dictatorial methods stand opposite Wallace's courage. <br /> <br /> "Rob Roy" There are three great villains in their tavern. he First of all, let's start with the Marquis of Montrose. He is obsessed with his own image until he lets the innocent man suffer because of it. "Look, I am not a parody" is a word that he likes in his "factors". He is obsessed with power, displeasure that the great great man whom the Duke of Argyll has been Considering more prudence at that time He is a self-absorbed and shy person. He is an evil nobleman. But with a method that makes him unique, <br /> <br /> Cunningham and Callarn are conspirators in "Rob Roy" and are also the direct attackers of Roy with Callarn. Cheating in cowardice until almost funny He will do everything to preserve the Marquis's good wishes, including back stabbing and trickery. Cunningham is an interesting character in what seems like he has been raised to do everything he can to get Marquis's status and love. He wants father But he knew little that the Marquis was his true father. So when the opportunity to receive wealth comes from Callarn, he grabs it without question. He is like the evil of modern people, so himself has a center and useless that he doesn't care about the consequences of his actions to others. <br /> <br /> Many people criticize work. Tim Roth in this film, Hogwash, I can clearly say that Cunningham is not just evil. But still a psychopath throughout the story In a world where his men and stepchildren can shoot random people for fun, Cunningham is an unbelievable character too? We live in a society where people seem to reduce the value of human life. "Rob Roy" just teaches us that only the situation of this reduced value has changed. It is a problem throughout human history that the absurdity of the human heart will not allow compassionate ability. Rob Roy and Mary give us hope that good will prevail. But the snake will always exist in our world. <br /> <br /> Another character that I think is interesting is Duke of Argyll. He is a true nobleman and the value of honesty and politeness is opposite the Marquis. He appreciates the courage of Rob Roy and Mary and has a direct trouble for the Marquis and his factors. He gives hope to the world for authority. Hopefully people like Marquis will be excluded and not rules. <br /> - The final battle in "Rob Roy" is more exciting. Episode 10 The battle scene in "Braveheart" <br /> <br > One thing that I'm bored is that someone told me "Braveheart" is a better movie because of the fighting scene. First of all, the fight scenes are almost identical to the original. From "Spartacus" to "Gladiator", Hollywood has a long history of fighting in European history. "Braveheart" has the best fighting scene ever in the movie But they experienced one important problem These fighting scenes have no context except for the struggle for freedom. <br /> <br /> Now don't understand me. In fact, there may be many movies that are more than 10 times dueling, like fighting scenes. But the context of the fight between Cunningham and Rob Roy is a beauty that must be viewed. It is one of the greatest scenes in film history. I would like to explain why ... <br /> <br /> First of all, the fighting style and bearing of both characters in this fight describe the character perfectly. Cunningham is full of danger and Rob Roy is strong and brave. Cunningham used a sword while Rob used a sword. Cunningham struggles with the fast-paced movement while Roy's fighting style is clear. <br /> <br /> All movies from the first half are slow until the second half is deliberately exciting. It is a powerful thing and it is clear that Rob must eliminate the terrible evil that makes his whole world full of evil when Rob finally gets. (Truly and figuratively) It is one of the greatest moments in film history. Rob wins because he has more lives and his honor is greater than 10 Cunningham. Using music is a scene that makes you feel cold. The goodness of the true evil is more powerful for me than to see a friend removed so that he can shout "FREEDOM!" But wait, maybe it's me. <br /> <br /> - " Rob Roy "More realistic than" Braveheart "<br /> <br /> I do not know whether the elite or Scottish people talk about the same people in" Rob Roy ", but I feel it's clear to try to capture the pattern. Their speaking I feel that many people are bored with "Rob Roy" just because they don't understand what the characters say. If this is the case, read the Shakesphere or put a closed caption. "Rob Roy" is one of the greatest films of the 1990s. Many conversations in this film are wise. But maybe you have to watch the movie a few times to understand. <br /> <br /> Conversely, the dialogue in "Braveheart" is not that interesting. Of course, what do you expect when the main character is a Scot who plays as an Australian? This is a myth and there is a clear attempt to not make speeches in those days. This movie happened hundreds of years ago, "Rob Roy" and they talk like people today. So the reason many people like it better Today's viewers are becoming more lazy and they don't want to spend time or patience in understanding complex things. So, as with many epic films, they expect to see the villain speak a familiar English accent while the heroes speak in a local language, not far from our American language. Of course, Wallace is a Scotty. The But in addition to listening like Scotty from Star Trek and "Aye "'s counterparts to acknowledge the Scots in this movie, it is in line with the Hollywood tradition that we believe that Scot should listen. <br /> Can these descriptions prove that "Rob Roy" is a better movie than "Braveheart"? Hardly, but if it proves one thing, it shows that it is not common knowledge that "Braveheart" is a better movie "Rob Roy", so to say simply "Rob Roy" is a movie. With content about the world today. "Braveheart" is a movie about myths that inspire But not realistic You can decide what you think is better ... <br /> <br /> Score - Score - 9
