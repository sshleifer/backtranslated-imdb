Excellent. At first, I thought of receiving the Communist Party of Amrita Pritam and the movie of Taiwanese patriotism of Dr Dwivedi is more straightforward than strange. But when I read the novel For not being deceived, seconds and Dr Dwivedi as the goal, this film has a delicate topic in a delicate manner. Any damage from war is a woman like some poets say and this film is its identity. It is also a sad explanation about the Hindu minds because they cannot stand against the kidnapping of girls or Hindu brothers who can burn the fields of his suffering. On the other hand, it shows the economic angle after the division or in reality, why women were kidnapped at first. I think the kidnappers think that kidnapping children will become legal homeowners and the new government. Will not be able to ask them to go home This is separated from each other to show the courage of the characters of their Puro and Bhabhi. They are two girls in the village who are not interested in the outside world and are at every risk. Since there are many documentary cases when those women are not accepted by their families in India, <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that women have to understand the pain of other women.
