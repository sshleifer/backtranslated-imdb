It is suitable for a Sunday musical that will make your heart beat hard and no one can do better than Little Richard. This man can sing the drawers, close the women and set rock and roll. <br /> <br /> Look at Leon. To show a clear style as he did so with David Ruffin in The Temptations and Jackie Wilson in Mr. Rock 'n' Roll: The Alan Freed Story. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting biography when We saw Little Richard fighting with his father and his church and with him. He himself is what he is He wins the fight and no one has his voice or style.
