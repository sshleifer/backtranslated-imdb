I watched most of the movies that Nick Mancuso lived because, frankly, I loved men, although while he was very old, he often played the role of baddie (fans for a long time should note that he had some reasons for this ) It is a movie that is quite familiar in terms of plot. (But most of the movies today are not genuine) but Rick Roberts is attracted as an incomplete husband. Martha MacIsaac attracts equal attention as a daughter. If that was her goal, anger and sometimes difficult to like, Nick also received in terms of being able to demonstrate both charm and psychosis. However, the plot of too much happens outside the screen - such as motivation, previous behavior, good times and bad times - and things that appear in the characters never make the audience (eg I) The final scene makes everything needed in the category "But the story ..." and overall I can't say how much I care about the characters. That being said, it's what it is - a reasonably enjoyable way to spend the afternoon - and I still like Nick.
