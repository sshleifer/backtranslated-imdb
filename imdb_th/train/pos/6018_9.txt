I saw this in the early 70s (when I was 16 years old) and despite slow settings, meetings, riots and many more when the desert began to fall into context and I liked it. (Still doing it, it's very good). Back then, I was in what seemed to be a minority. All criticisms seem to concentrate on the lack of action and storytelling.
