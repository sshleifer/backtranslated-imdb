This is just the best movie ever! Sorry, Hollywood! I saw it in the early 70s as soon as it appeared on Bulgarian TV and I immediately liked it. (At that time I was 14 years old) 25 years later, I bought it on a video tape and a few months ago it appeared on DVD here in Bulgaria. I've been with this movie for 35 years, and my friends and family do as well. My son was a teenager when he saw it for the first time and he immediately loved it as well. (And this is a model that grew up to watch Hollywood movies in practice only without speaking or understanding Russian!) What makes Danelia's masterpiece special? It's hard to say because it's hard to explain what beauty is ... but the truth is that you can watch this movie dozens of times with the same joy as the first time I can't remember other movies, no matter how much they cost or how many actors ... Chapeau, Maestro Danelia! Bulgaria loves you!
