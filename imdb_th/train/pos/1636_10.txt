This is one of the greatest movies of the 80s !!! It protrudes like "Shit is in the punchbowl" !! I do not want to believe that Mad Magazine condemns it or whatever. And they also put their names on the show with "Stuart", "Chinese woman, I don't speak English" and "fast UPS". What happened to that? And I love Ron Lebman - he's a fox !! Wondering why he deleted the name from the credit It was his most funny chapter that I knew. Of course, he is not a cunning person like Norma Rae. But in my opinion, this movie falls on the Lamphun National Holidays. If you like movies like Porky's, Fast Times, Last American Virgin or Teen 80's movies, you'll love this movie !! Rent and you will see what I mean !!
