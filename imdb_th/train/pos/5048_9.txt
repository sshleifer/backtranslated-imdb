This dark and interesting horror movie comes from the concept of religious murder. The story of a man living in Texas, USA, a formidable story and killing his two sons after God ordered the world of the bad people. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton director This film portrays the crazy father who is known as Hand of God Killer, while Matthew McConaughey shows his best performances to date as the eldest son, Fenton Meiks. Decided that he could no longer be a burden in his childhood and used the story to tell the story with FBI agent Wesley Doyle (played by Powers Boothe). <br /> <br /> In many movies Users want the audience to be chained to the seat from start to finish and this is one of them. Even if you want to stop watching But you can't do it because of the true power of this movie. <br /> <br /> The director has done this movie very well and they help to plan a good scene. Excellent But if there are disadvantages, some are very powerful and may disturb some people. <br /> <br /> While the concept of this movie is very dark, small children help. Draw pictures of ideas through great performances. This movie is really a spine and can guarantee that you will get good seats throughout. I would like to recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror and disturbing movies, or anyone who wants to see something different. <br /> <br /> 8/10
