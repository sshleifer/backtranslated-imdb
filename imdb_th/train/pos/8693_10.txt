I am very young when this thing comes out in the United States. But I saved it from the TV and watched it over and over again until I remembered it all. To this day The show was hilarious and there were many famous characters from Frank Sinatra to Sylvester Stallone to Mr. T that sound was great and sounded like the characters they performed The puppet was well done, although slightly creepy. I was surprised to find that it was just written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor from Red Dwarf. Like others who wrote in the previous comment, I was robbed of this great item by borrowed "friends" and never returned. I'm sure I want to have enough demand for this program to guarantee the DVD release. But I don't think there are enough people to hear this. Oh well, I might try the e-bay ...
