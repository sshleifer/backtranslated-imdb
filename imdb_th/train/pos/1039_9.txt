I've watched this movie many times and watched today (on TCM) just because Geraldine Fitzgerald. She is a very low-performing actress and I have to admit that I have been interested in her since the first time she saw her (probably in "Wuthering Heights" 40 years or more). He deserves all the rewards he has received. He makes it clear whether or not we like it or not. Finally, adjust the method accordingly. Nazism must stop and everything that helps to do it is good. He gave his children about badness and they shouldn't be bad. But when he spoke when talking to adults, he would do this again without hesitation. Lucas gives a wonderful picture of a man who is in this situation and makes it clear that what he does is very difficult to do. <br /> <br /> Some people think that his victims are Nazi, but I don't think so - I think he's just after money. His Nazi colleagues knew this, and this is why they didn't use much for him. <br /> <br /> One interesting thing about this movie and in playing is the fact that Muller (Lucas) is a German, while resisting German hysteria. WWI is not unique in World War II, with many German anti-German sentiments and some Germans are buried like As happened in California with his ancestral Japan. It is a matter of courage that Hellman will write a good German drama at this time. (Perhaps she thought they were the people who signed the Nazi-Soviet treaty!) In the end, the US Air Force and the British were bombing German cities and without the confidence of killing innocent civilians. However, I think Dresden's bombing and the flames later occurred after releasing "Watch on the Rhine". <br /> <br /> The title is something that plays on words while "watching "Looking west, from Germany. In fact, Watch am Rhein is a German military marching song used in World War II. But the Nazis also have their own music that is used as well. But Muller is a German and he participates in his own "Wach am Rhein". <br /> <br /> Other actors do a great job here. Although Bodo is too much, having kids like him, I was surprised that he didn't give a secret to his father. In real life, he may do very well.
