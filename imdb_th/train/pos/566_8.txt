Attractive and attractive West from only a few people around you. Like other images of Anthony Mann, The Far Country combines the boiling story of potential with the expertise to know the effects of the scenery. Which both played in Mann's Pecadillo, such as honor, honesty, betrayal and of course death! The story sees a fortune-telling partner Jeff Webster {James Stewart} and Ben Tatum {Walter Brennan} travel to the Oregon Territory along with a cow with awareness of the prosperity of gold. They plan to make a neat profit in sales. Cattle in Klondike, when they arrived at Skagway, they found that Mr. Gannon {John McIntire}, a judge who had been appointed himself, was ready to find justice with Webster because Webster had broken all laws. The exact cause of this, all the way to penalize Gannon took the livestock away from them. But they stole them back and headed across the Canadian border to Dawson and Gannon and his men on a hot hunt Here, beautiful women and a city that is humble and lawless will fill the fate of everyone involved. <br /> <br /> Interesting from beginning to end, The Far Country has benefited greatly from anti-James heroes in Waiting for drawing and Mann The flowing direction of the Borden Chase script that is tight, the movie from William H. Daniels is the ultimate person who doesn't do anything at present by typing DVDs and movies. "Will he not do him?" Axis reeling the audience into paying dividends in re-watches. For the hardened genre fans, it is still necessary for the first look. The adventurous timers in the Western world are wonderful but dark. Of Anthony Mann and James Stewart 8/10
