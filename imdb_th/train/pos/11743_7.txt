Although this is not an anomaly But this drama is a suitable movie to be shown during Easter It reminds us of our spiritual self and shows that behind our buildings we tend to hide our suffering and our deepest experiences. There is a lot of fun in the drama, not least the rap teenagers who give good music and drama rather than low scores in the background. The performance was excellent and Timothy Spall was excellent again. The key point is very satisfying. If it is quite easy, Timothy Spall committed suicide by his long-dead wife, credible and reflecting the despair that occurred in a teenage girl who hurt herself. The resolution between graffiti boys and Muslims is delightful. But it's unbelievable The wonderful drama that left me and my husband felt that the evening spent well. congratulations!
