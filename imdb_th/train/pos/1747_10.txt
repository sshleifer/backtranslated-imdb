This movie is one of the best movies I've seen this year. I don't see the pendant in the movie. But it is quite good. It's similar to Anchorman in the humor department. But I think this is a movie that is better collected than it has a point. Is a movie that is well collected !!!! If you don't have anything to do or have a lot of humor, you will find that it's a really good movie I think, of course, that Ebert and Roeper has reviewed this movie correctly. I mean I don't like Ebert in most movies. But this is a movie that I will agree with. This movie has a good enough story to believe that this type of person went out there. There is something to say about the way they treat innocence in this movie. Yes, of course you will be laughed when you discover But still showing that you are waiting Steve did an excellent job in showing the people he did in this movie. But it's still funny
