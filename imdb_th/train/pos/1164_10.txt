I saw this movie when it first came out. Is the official selection for the Temecula Valley International Film Festival and I voted for the best picture. <br /> <br /> Justine Priestley is hot like a psychopath. This is not your psychological movie. Lots of interesting and original slogan in many categories The arrangement of "Fatal Attraction" for the younger series, which has a wonderful blues mix while the objects of Amanda's love marry the upcoming blues singer who has Little time for her husband <br />
