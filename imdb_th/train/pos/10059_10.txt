This movie is the best movie of all time. I can't remember the last time the movie pulled tears from me. With tears, I admire this movie. It has all the elements that a good movie must have: excellent conversations, music, performances, stories / synopsis, stories of friendship, courage, generosity and loyalty during the street performances that are famous in The King of Masks and little girls Sold as a boy in the flea market The little girl likes to be his niece and the King of Masks likes nephews. They are not unusual in reality. Every scene that they are together has no value. The camera works flawlessly and captures you. The performance inspired Xu Zhu as the king of Renying Zhou's mask. "Doggie" looks good and plays her role very well. Zhigang Zhao because Liang Sao Lang is a very good person. He plays the character of his very helpful and generous character. If you don't have this movie, try watching it once.
