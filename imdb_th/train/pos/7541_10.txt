This Showtime movie deserves a better rating than 4.5; I gave 10 stories and performances of two stars. After reading the opinions of the audience, I was surprised by the number of people who expected this movie to be funny. Yes, I see that IMDb is funny / dramatic under the category. Sure, it's misleading, right? Luckily I saw the movie before entering this website, so I didn't expect it. In fact, from the conclusion of what I heard, I was fully expecting to be a drama. I wonder if the disappointment that is not a comedy makes a lot of low votes. <br /> <br /> Another factor that may make a low vote is this movie. 'Character driven by characters' is very 'Driving Miss Daisy' is another example of a movie-driven character that is thought of. Someone's previous comments complain about boring experiments. Tom's work scene (Danny Glover) seems to be distracting from the true story of the movie. That is how he engineered a social climb of his family - or his private troops if you would However, they acted to build credibility and legitimacy as his right to move to Greenwich and move 'up' in the world. <br /> <br /> Tom's passion became a push. push He proved that he would not do anything to swallow into the white district. His shame when another black person moved the next door was not because of the skin color. It is because of everything 'Coordinator' represents everything Tom has left behind. In essence, Tom became the Oreo Cookie: Black on the outside, but there was a white color inside. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of this film is one of the screenplays that are written, directed and executed. The most powerful I used to be happy to see I realized that the focus of the film was not a clear event that occurred next to the door. (Don't want to disappear However, the storyline is very big. Do you know that life on that road will never be the same? <br /> <br /> Flick my favorite character: People face pain, dance, dance, growth, change and life. As a listener, I may learn something or be inspired.
