It's not easy to explain what a movie is. But this time I think I have met It reminds me of two movies: Trainspotting (Criminals, at least give some scores and make silly things in Schotland) and The Blair Witch Project (because of the filming style) <br /> <br /> It's about loyalty. Two friends, one of them, was leaving the prison, the other was not arrested. With stolen cars, they drove through the countryside of Scotland. But instead of running out of oil As they tried to find fuel, they found a farm in the middle. Farmers think they want to rob him and aim a gun at one of them. Moreover, everything will go wrong. One friend accidentally shot the farmer's daughter and they had to run away. The following is a hunt for humans through the fields and forests of Schotland. Both friends have to work for their lives. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this movie was filmed in just 12 days. Okay. That is certainly unbelievable because the largest part of it is usually in the same place, that is the Scottish countryside. But I still find it quite amazing Especially because this is not a really bad movie Maybe it's not the greatest movie ever. But they are still proud of what they have achieved I have a good time watching it and overall I'm happy with the movie. I gave 7/10.
