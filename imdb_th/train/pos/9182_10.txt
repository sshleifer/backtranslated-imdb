Those who love Jane Eyre books like me (It is my favorite all the time and I read it at least once a year) will love this version. Timothy Dalton is just a child who looks too good to be Mr. Rochester. But besides that, he also did a great job. Zelah Clarke may be too young to play Jane, 18 years old, but when I watched this movie, I didn't think of the age of the character. The dialogue from this film brought almost every word from the book which was very clever. Of course, this movie may look a bit long. But it's the only version I've seen, including the third episode of the story. <br /> <br /> I hope that the creators of this movie will take part in the newer Zeferelli version, because it will help the movie's mess <br /> <br /> I knew that the last time I watched this video that Judy Cornwell played as "Aunt Oh"! She is a versatile person that I don't know you. She played Daisy in keeping herself and also playing Miss Muscov in persuasion. In 1995 (another great adaptation) <br /> <br /> Updated: There was a DVD in a week. this There are many starting points (Young Jane at Gateshead and Lowood) and at the end they have returned a lot of things (I often wonder why St. John had a piece of paper when he revealed he knew who Jane was. Is - because the part that he tore out of her drawings was edited from the US VHS version!) Rosamund Oliver is in there ... She was completely cut off from the VHS as far as I can tell. Part of the famous Timothy Dalton Day, so nothing new there. But it is good to see all the dramas during the time after enjoying the VHS. Thank you to BBC (PS ... I will pay more for a special DVD version ... maybe there will be star interviews ... or performances)
