My main problem with this film is that it takes too long. In addition, it is quite good. Paul Muni plays a poor Chinese farmer who is married through a marriage. Luise Rainer is a married woman who is married to Muni. They live with Muni's father on the farm and they do not do well. Finally, when he received more money to buy more land, drought and nothing increased Every star headed north, with Muni behind in the first place. When they left and came to the city, they found no work and they were worse than before. They thought about selling their youngest daughter as a slave for money. But decided against it When a group of people began to rob the city, the soldiers appeared and began operations with people. Paul Muni worked well and Luise Rainer won the second Oscar for this film.
