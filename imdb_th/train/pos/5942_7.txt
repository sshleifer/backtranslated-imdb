I like Batman: DEAD END. I think it has a dramatic feeling and it makes Collora the right to make good movies. This example did not impress me. The story or story may be quite good. But because of the special performances and effects, I feel that this will create a good TV movie or TV show. <br /> <br /> At first, Michael O'Hearn wasn't really a superman. In his short appearance, makes Clark Kent the right Sorry I don't think SuperMan is that movie. Ken Suit wears a mask of his size. Batman may have the body of a bodybuilder. But Superman is not undoubtedly able to fit without doubt, but not so much. However, I am not interested in all his positions and his changes from Kent to Superman are not good at all. Now it may not be just O'Hearn's fault. Collora may need some credit for writing scripts and bad directions. <br /> <br /> Secondly, special techniques for flying are terrible. Superman flying through the sky If it was clear that this superman flew close to the ground with a telephone line and a building visible above him I don't think there is any full picture of Superman flying. Obviously, the safety harnesses and clothing that O'Hearn supports must be on his lower body. <br /> <br /> All of this is a good trailer. I might pay to watch movies if I ever did and be sure to watch on television. A collaborative story between Lexcorp and Wayne Industries envious of Lois's attraction to Wayne, Lex and the nearby Twoface to overcome Superman and the combined forces between Batman and Superman. It's a good story. I am sure that there will be more budget and approval for the movie Collora and the full company. Even O'Hearn can deliver good movies. Of course, one is better than shit, as most cartoons come out of Hollywood recently.
