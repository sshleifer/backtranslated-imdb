When I first watched this movie, it was a copy of the tape and the name was / was Caged Terror. I still own the tape and I agree that I watched it more than once from beginning to end! This film has a very low budget and the dialogue is often fun without intention! I received a few of my friends to watch this story and we laughed a lot from the terrible chapter. This movie deals with couples. (Remember that it was like the early 70s, so they were just too hip!) Who went to camp at the end of the week in what I believe should be in northern New York. They have a hilarious dialogue after catching and eating fish and the young lady regrets the death of the fish and they eat it! The man came back with something stupid about the way they eat fish, and now it's part of them, then he goes; "And that is a beautiful person!" Very heavy, really heavy! Lol! Anyway, Vietnamese veterinarians came with me, believing that one of them (Whether they are musicians In any way) they clearly attracted the attention of the girl and when they proved unfriendly The man was trapped in a cage, raised a chicken and had to see that his young friend had been harassed by two men. Actually, at the end of the night, she seemed to be beautiful, and when the morning came out, women and men were free to leave. Suppose this man learned a lesson about how to treat that person and the woman with a smile on her face! :) However, I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good laugh! It never fails to make me fun! If I find this on the DVD and replace my old tape copy, I will buy it again. Really is a classic camp! You must love this thing!
