Both aesthetic and visual Treat both eyes and ears The quintessential Victorian element of the opening scene is completely charming, helping to create a Christmas scene in which Dickens himself must be proud. Technically, production is visually stimulating and special effects are invented, imagined, and accomplished creatively in the original scene. The dance of many leading artists is great. Photography and lighting are considered the best, and sound recording is compatible with the overall high level technical skills used. Great movie for everyone in the family during Christmas and the most delightful discovery that will endure many times.
