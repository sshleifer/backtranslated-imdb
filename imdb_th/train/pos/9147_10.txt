As a big prince during the last three to four years, I can't believe that I just watched "Purple Rain" only. The new 2nd anniversary special edition made me buy. Wow, I'm waiting to see. But I didn't prepare before how much electricity it was. Prince's musical performances throughout the story are nothing surprising - he has this movement. I am very familiar (From repeated listening) with the classic "Purple Rain" album and all songs But to watch them in the context of the movie will change your perception about music and lyrics - such as COMPUTER BLUE, THE BEAUTIFUL ONES, when DOVES CRY and PURPLE RAIN have something that is hypnotic, vague about the scene in which you Man and revolution show The closing song that I love is a star and I want to show you what the true power and ability of the prince is full of in his mid-20th century (he's overflowing!) It explodes me. It makes Michael Jackson look lifeless even during his high years. <br /> <br /> The Prince shows you how to beat the girl of your dreams - take her to the lake. Enter and drive away. Things to understand past problems <br /> <br /> Some scenes are 1980s and have unintended fun. But this will add to the overall charm of the movie. Morris Day is the coolest cat on the blog (and hilarious) and when The Time shows THE BIRD, you'll see Morris Day and Jerome Benton lit up on the Minneapolis funk stage - I like Their dance in this bit, and how does Benton deliver the performance of the glass in the middle of Morris. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to see it again. There are many specialties - especially when seeing Eddie Murphy, a young man before Beverly Hills. Cop admits that he is "Prince Group"
