This film is released in theaters. With its appearance, you can see why it's not getting a good response. It was unfairly panned because the content was more than the actual movie. High level learning is not exciting. But it's a good movie that tries to talk about the horror in America: racism. <br /> <br /> Synopsis / Story: Most high-level learning centered on Malik. An innocent actor who has to deal with not fast enough and is a brutal professor. (Played by Laurence Fishburne) He is a friend of Fudge (Ice Cube) and a beautiful lady named Deja (Tyra Banks). After that, they meet with Skinhead at the campus. Mimi (played by Michael Rapaport) is a confused boy who became a close friend to university skinheads. When they set their views on him, he becomes a class that they have. <br /> <br /> Comments: Higher learning is not without flaws: Character development is rare. Okay by Omar Epps from Skinhead (My name is forgotten), Busta Rhymes is not suitable for this movie. A woman who turns gay after being abused by a man has an old idea before this film so you know that I don't like the part of this film with Kristy Swanson. In addition, this movie is not worse than half Lawrence Fishburne as Phipps Professor (Although I can do without pronunciation) but Fudge is the best work of Ice Cube and Michael Rapaport is doing well. Overall, it was one of John Singleton's best movies and one of the reasons I frowned upon the garbage he brought out now. The cinema needs more movies, such as high learning, Mississippi Burning and American History X, and fewer movies such as Baby Boy, 2 Fast 2 Furious and remake from Shaft that are pointless.
