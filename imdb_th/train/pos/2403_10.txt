I have to warn you that there are spoilers. But in order to start, I received "Spanish Judges" last February that I thought It talks about it being the latest copy. But as I saw, it didn't return. But in any way I have I think it's good I want to see this mainly because the great actor Matthew Lillard (I'm not surprised that critics talk about scars) even though it's a low budget. But getting enough money to make this movie worth Humans are good actors. <br /> <br /> A story about an impostor artist known as Matthew Lillard who "claims" has a product called a Spanish judge. If you don't know who the Spanish judges are or haven't seen an example for this, and this is the first review you read, I won't say anything. I think it will be a big deal that no one knows what it is. He needs protection, so he hired a pair of robbers, Max and Jamie (Vincent D'Onofrio and Valeria Golino), as well as a crook that uses the name of the piece (Mark Boone Junior). She and who, because she came from Mars, as she said So they (Mostly, Jack) called her "Mars Girl". Everything started well. But then it became one big game Games that are related to sexual desire, lying and betrayal. <br /> <br /> There are some things that act in it. (Matt and Valeria, including Tamara, not one of them) There are some scenes that they do better, and the score is probably better as well. Some scores are very good. The theme they use for start and end (before credit) is a good music option. That is my opinion. The fight scenes in the end may be longer and there is a little more violence. But what can you do? One more comment about Matt: Damn, he plays smooth and smooth people. <br /> <br /> I know this is a review. But I have to make changes to NeCRo. One of the inspectors: Valeria Golino is not a newcomer. According to this site, she has performed since 1983 for me and hopes to be known by others. She is well-known for the love of Charlie Sheen, an Italian who is interested in both "Hot Shots!" Movies. <br /> <br /> Although I think it's one of the rare movies I've seen and it's really good. (Which is why I gave 10 stars above) I will give you the grade of what I think When I first saw, <br /> <br /> 8/10
