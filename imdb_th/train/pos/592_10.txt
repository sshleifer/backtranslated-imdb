In Arlington Heights, Illinois, we never had a cafeteria in an elementary school (1961), so I rode my bike home from school to have lunch and always watched this game. I am 11, but I think it's something. Greatest! I draw a picture hidden on the blackboard and see if my family or friends can find it. I still remember winning a great car (Pontiac or Oldsmobile) if the contestant had the final hidden picture game. I also have a home version. <br /> <br /> I wonder why this game lasts a short time. I enjoy music and hidden pictures - the only thing I can do is the hidden lime as part of the bridge over the stream. In the garden <br /> <br /> The really good memories are related to camouflage.
