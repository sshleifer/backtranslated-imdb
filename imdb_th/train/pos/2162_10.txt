I was very surprised when I saw this movie that didn't look good ... I understand why you don't like this movie. Its pace is slow, the appearance of Japanese movies. You will find that this is not a problem at all. <br /> <br /> I must say that this is the best comedy I have ever seen. "Will we Dansu?" Is often considered a comedy masterpiece. Japanese It's different from Hollywood, like Austin Powers or Scary Movies, which guarantees every minute. It's a movie that makes you feel good. <br /> <br /> I love movies because it makes me feel "real. "The plot is straightforward but pleasant. I'm very happy that Sukiyama (the main role) found the meaning of life in dance. Before I watched this movie, I felt a little depressed due to heavy work. I feel lost However, this movie reminded me of the bright side of life. I believe I am in the same boat of Sugiyama. If he finds himself in his hobby, why can't I? It reminds me of "Exploring your own future" and discovering the happiness in my daily life. <br /> <br /> It's important to know that actors are not professional dancers. While some of you may find that the dance scene is not perfect as expected. But I like it because it makes me feel that the character "is alive" really learns to dance as the movie progresses. <br /> <br / Above all, this film encourages and warms. As a comedian, it works perfectly. It deserves 10 stars. <br /> <br /> And yes, Aoki is funny :-D
