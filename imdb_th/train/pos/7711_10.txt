Okay, so Robbie looks a little quirky according to today's standards and some performances are quite formidable and most special effects can be reproduced by 12 year olds with the appropriate computer editing program. And don't let me start about posters. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie after 40 years after being published. I grew up watching "Science Fiction" in the "Science Fiction / Adventure Theater" of local television stations on Sunday afternoons, so I watched a few SF movies from the 1950s. Someone and let him destroy a small model town, forever forbidden city, raise the bar and show that it is possible to create a science fiction movie with a real plot. <br /> <br /> I wonder how many SF movies that were created in the 90s will still be considered worth watching in 2030.
