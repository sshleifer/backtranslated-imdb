'Stanley and Iris' show the victory of the human spirit For Stanley, it's a struggle to know the book and realize his potential. For Iris, it must find courage to love again after becoming a widow. The beauty of the film is the dance that Robert DeNiro and Jane Fonda do together, start and stop before each person has the skills and courage to trust each other completely and continue. In the sense that it is good, we have a good view of how often life is reliable. Unlike other examiners, I found that each character displayed was consistent with the whole picture. The selection of actors was carefully chosen and added to the depth of the characters that the main characters received, increasing the meaning from the supporting performances. Overall, it's a great movie. The best thing I received from it was hope.
