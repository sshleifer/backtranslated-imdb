Farrah Fawcett is great in the powerful 1986 drama, in which she plays Marjorie, a woman who tried to escape from the clutches of rape. Well done for the Farrah nominated The Golden Globe 'Best Actress' <br /> <br /> When Joe raped her (Played by James Russo) enters her house, which she shares with her two roommates!) Marjorie must play according to Joe's terrifying demands. It makes the image annoying and shocking. <br /> <br /> When her roommates come home, they are surprised. (Minimally speaking) from the actions of Marjorie and the great performance by Alfre Woodard, who tried to convince Marjorie to do the right thing and make him become a cop, causing the movie to bite more nails. <br /> <br /> I found Diana Scarface quite annoying. But when Joe finally admitted that he came there to kill them all. It makes the movie absolutely erotic. <br /> <br /> Overall, the extremities are movies that are well thought out and made, and I have to watch it hundreds of times now! Well done for everyone involved.
