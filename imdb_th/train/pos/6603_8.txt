I have to mention two failures so that you understand that this film was a great success in the place where they failed: "A Scanner Darkly" and "Immortel Ad Vitam". If you are excited about the concept Of these two films and was very disappointed (like me). You might like the Renaissance It will take you into the world of the future of Paris. It's not a dystopian at all. They make animation very well, so I think it's a spin. But from what I can tell, it's not. It's just a motion capture. Facial expressions are amazing! Not since TRON, I have seen the fantasy world that is well displayed in animation / live hybrid. The black and white media is used to determine the direction of the image slowly. My favorite result is what they do with the headlight beam looking for it. The director plays with interest and confusion. But in the end you are satisfied by finding the posts that he wants you to find The overall result is a violent and full of little surprises in the city. <br /> <br /> The story is secondary. It is noir. There is a background for most protagonists that give depth. There are weather conditions, "scenes" so you feel like being in different places in Paris. There are some actions and even chasing cars. I have to see this again to get everything. I also recommend a very large screen to see because the "set" has small details and credits.
