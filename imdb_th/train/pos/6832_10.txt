A beautiful film, pure Cassavetes style. Gena Rowland gives an incredible performance of a great actress who is successful, very old, loneliness ... and alcoholism. She tried to escape his own subconscious, embodied by the demons of the death of a young girl. Self-acceptance of the human condition, although its overall difficulty is the true purpose of the movie. The parallel between the drama and movie scenes is baffling: it's like the stage becomes a solution for heroin. If all American films are of the highest quality, related to human relationships at the adult level, do not try to create a sense of standards and feelings ... one of the best plays of all time 10/10
