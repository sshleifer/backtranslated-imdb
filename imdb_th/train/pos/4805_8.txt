When I heard this story for the first time, I thought it would be the same as The Duchess (2008), but when I saw The Young Victoria in the first 30 minutes, I knew that this was not just a hard movie. Very amazing and the scene was beautifully filmed. <br /> <br /> The only thing that disappointed me was the performance of Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada) as the star of the movie that brought Victoria to life and from the movie. This Showing that she is a great actress. Rupert Friend is almost as sensitive as Prince Albert, but he has excellent chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Bettany is as strong as Lord Melbourne, although I expected Hope more than him Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson have a supporting role but are memorable. <br /> <br /> For me, this movie gives an incomplete feeling. Perhaps the author of the script may change many things in the script. I don't know. But that's what I feel about movies. <br /> <br /> But overall, it's a great movie about Victoria's early years from Emily Blunt.
