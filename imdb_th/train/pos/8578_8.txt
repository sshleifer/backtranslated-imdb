This film is one of the best American B-90 movies. If you're looking for a movie that is serious, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for action, laughter and tongue that is different from the police cheeks that fight gangsters, this is something worth watching. Everyone chewed a little scenery. But that's what this movie really is, and everyone is funny. Donald Sutherland and John Lithgow have excellent chemistry and need to make another movie together.
