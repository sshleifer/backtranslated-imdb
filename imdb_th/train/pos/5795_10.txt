This movie is my favorite all the time !!! You have to see Michael Jackson in this great movie !! I'm always above the moon. Watch it !! This is a movie that you really have to watch, and if you are not a MJ fan, you have to make this movie like Captain EO, E.T and Ghosts, Movie History and Music !! This great movie from Michael's Feathers is a must have !! And: Smooth Criminal is the most exciting, exciting and amazing song I've ever heard in my life !! Thank you Michael for this movie and I love you !!! MJ is the best musician to come to this world. He is a good person and he always brings a spark in your eyes when you listen to his music !! Please, if you don't know this movie, watch and don't miss it because it's too bad for yourself if you miss it !! - Highly recommended movies for all movie lovers -
