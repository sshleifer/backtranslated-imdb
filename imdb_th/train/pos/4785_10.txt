[No spoiler] <br /> <br /> When David Lynch's movie, we might have thought that it shows that his mysterious heart is like most of his feature films. But it is very straightforward because the name may be hinted Do not exclude being stuck in the normal space of Lynchian that cannot be understood, which usually occurs after viewing such a lost highway. It's a simple movie. But actually it's a great movie That is both from innovation and entertainment. It's an innovation because it's not Lynch. But that may be Lynch. He likes to distort our minds and combine them into movies that may seem important and far from themselves. As a very enthusiastic director, he might do this kind of movie to tease his audience because he knows what they expect. But he didn't give anything to them That will be a craft. <br /> <br /> The speed of the movie is slow. I almost say the speed of the mower ... Don't expect to be orgy. But this movie is truly entertaining for those who go with the stream of movies. Look carefully for those small details that Lynch plans throughout the movie for our entertainment. Looking for a great movie that makes this movie lively And listen to the scores of Badalamenti and the main themes that make the Iowa and Wisconsin animations show the scenery often. <br /> <br /> Tentsworth performed in one of his best films. One of the most lovable men in this movie He doesn't have to say anything to express his feelings and thoughts. His cheerfulness shone through him and his performance earned him an Academy Award nomination. I must say that his weak health in this film didn't do anything? He was diagnosed with cancer and shot himself after the film was completed. That knowledge is more important to this film because it is a show of respect to Farnham. <br /> <br /> All of the above are very good movies that are suitable for everyone who likes movies in the way they should. Doing anybody asking for homilies that are not clear and innocent But it does not destroy the whole picture because it is a memorable movie 9/10
