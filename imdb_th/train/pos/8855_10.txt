Sydney Lumet, although one of the oldest directors But there are still games! A few years ago, he shot "Find me wrong", proving everyone that Vin Diesel can actually do the job if he gets the opportunity and the right director. If he retires after this film (A true masterpiece in my eyes) No one can blame him. But he is still strong. His next film was announced in 2009. <br /> <br /> But stay with this movie here. The list of performers is excellent. Excellent performance. A slight difference in their performances, "real" conversations and / or situations that evolved throughout the movie are great. The structure (time) of movies keeps your feet all the time by mixing the timeline perfectly The correction looks natural / flawless, even though it is in the "normal" time, but at least it is a good movie (Drama / Thriller). I can only recommend the rest. Is with you! : o)
