An unusual straight actor, played by an actor and filmed by a director who clearly understands that content is serious. Not as perfect as expected from movies shot on a limited budget clearly, but this drama is relevant - one of the movies that when it repeatedly gets nauseated on Cinemax 2 or More Max or whatever they call it. Watching the blog for 40 minutes when you should go to work according to W / "Deathstalker 2", "Chopping Mall" and "The Assault". Warn that Wynorski is a talented director rather than a low-budget Brethern friend who has the ability. Truly moving into the movie When he really cares about the content (For example, don't look at Shannon Tweed with 3 or 4 names!) Actors with too little time to do (Mancuso, Ford, or Gary Sandy for chrissakes) make them play the best roles over the years. Come - for Grieco, he has the right look, although his performance will be one of the notes - it's clear that his character should destroy himself forever. This movie, but Grieco did not convey the truth. I checked IMDB and I saw that the author also wrote "Sorority House Massacre 2" & "Dinosaur Island" to the director - both filtered down in their rights. He himself But clearly "stupid" theaters like Roger Cormon, Jonathan Demme, and better than Jonathan Kaplan B-pictures of the 70s. Some people give the elements of exploitation But offered in relation to the drama at the same time - truly moving forward, not "Citizen Kane" and the last moments of the comic that would disrupt But is an average straightforward performer who is a character Such small success should not be overlooked when they come in, which is rare enough. (As I was warned when I tried to sit amid the amazement of Albert Pyun called "Heatseeker" the night before - what a low budget is not. As easy as it appears - but that's another story!)
