Anna Christie (1931) <br /> <br /> According to his own condition, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie was filmed a year later in German, along with all new actors, just being customized and Better than the English version (both are American MGM productions) Garbo is, if there is anything more than ordered. (Or more beautiful than the on-screen appearance) and her performance is more restrained And she seems to be more comfortable, probably for many reasons But we can guess that she doesn't make her first picture anymore, so adjust quickly. <br /> <br /> Without comparing one movie with the other, Ann Christy, someone This is still the only one that can play many words. The theme of the woman he wants to love without losing her independence is here. There are some scenes that are missing - the Coney Island part is short and bad - but overall it's a direct reflection of the first movie. Director Jacques Fayder (Belgium - France) has just done what has been done, which I think must be a disappointing experience. <br /> <br /> It's very interesting to see the whole movie. Two stories, since they were blocked, of course, the same way (not just the series, but all the pictures). There was a scene raised from the pre-storm movies. But still a short scene at Marie Dresser (From the English version) is walking with her friend on a board across the drunken canal as far as possible. But they are just shadows and when the next scene shows their faces, we see German actors taking part. join There is nothing to replace the dressler, of course. But for me, the German father is reliable and honest in his performance. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the content - immigration, father-willed, daughter turned to prostitution and problems. Of finding true love - with strong winds, especially in European topics (Garbo is suitable to play Swedish women)
