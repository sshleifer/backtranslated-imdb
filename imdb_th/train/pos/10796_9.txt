If you are a big fan of Chuck Norris & Judson Mills, this is a movie that will see it with many adventures. It is a wonderful track of the president of chemistry between the three main stars (Chuck Norris, Judson Mills, Jennifer Tung). Incredible story, my personal opinion, this movie, along with the original, has become a very good thing that the network should consider changing to a regular series if you've seen President's Man. This for you if you've seen the President's Man: A Line In The Sand, but you have not seen the President's Man, I suggest you do, you will not be disappointed either.
