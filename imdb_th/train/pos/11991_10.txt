Oops! What can I say that I haven't talked about this great performance? Nothing! There is no doubt that this is one of the best written programs I've ever encountered in live-action or animation. Newer things are way too stupid for my tastes and certain things. "Being an adult" I have to chase a child out of the room but not Talespin. <br /> <br /> The story is very engaging and rational. Some people can stretch one or two hours for various episodes such as Stormy Weather and the opportunity to dream of her is amazing while still entertaining for children and adults. Then there are pure funny episodes, such as Bluest of the Baloo Bloods and Stuck, which you focus on. I was able to laugh in tears in a few options. <br /> <br /> The view of the drama is very lacking today. (At least those who don't specifically focus on it), especially in cartoons For example, in the Stormy Weather episode, Kitkicker Kicker decided that he would join the air circle. But Balu believed that it would be too dangerous. In the biggest battle, Baloo yelled at Kit to stay away from Daring Dan, which Kit shouted "No! You can't tell me what to do! You * can't * me * Father *! "And buried his face in the pillow The next day he left for the air circle. This type of drama is rare in cartoons and will receive the most reception in movies created today. <br /> <br /> The characters are very deep for them. Balu is the way he is in The Jungle Book. Very positive or negative, a few degrees of laziness. Rebecca is a witty business woman who has ideas about getting money, while theoretically good, not useful in practice. Molly is a cute little girl. But you can't let it fool you Sometimes she may be a real madman. Kit Cloudkicker is a character that is darker than the rest. He doesn't trust many adults if they don't care about him and he tends to break the relationship. See his expression in Plunder and Lightning when he grabs the hook: He looks like he's ready to wear it through the pirates. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a drama that combines with real chemistry between Characters that make this list # 1 in my book The relationship between Baloo and Kit is very true, almost as a father and son. This shows well in the All's Whale that ends Whale when Baloo uses Kit's words that Seymour uses animals in his aquarium instead of favoring other adults. The relationship of Baloo and Becky is true because Baloo's inspiration for the work comes from the desire to buy back sea ol 'duck. There is no need to help Rebecca. But there is something telling me that if he gets the duck back, he still works for Rebecca. <br /> <br /> Sea ducks don't have to mention other planes in the series. The function of the plane will not change once throughout the series. (Such continuity is difficult to follow) and is different from Most "super-planes" of most other cartoons do not have a single weapon on the mango board!) and rely on it. It's a great skill of a pilot with skills to avoid problems. It's hard to think of a hero tank without a turret, laser gun or even a pistol somewhere on the machine. And the fact that they use their heads to solve problems that are rare in today's comics In addition, it's just a very cool design. <br /> <br /> This is the best cartoon. Of course, it's worth the ten stars of course!
