Yes, I have a copy of it on the VHS uncut in good condition that I transferred to DVD and if anyone wants to bring the memories of classic Christmas back, please emil me at dmd2222@verizon.net.i Search everywhere and I can't find anything. Here and I think I can't be the only person in this world that has this classic tape. There has to be someone else, and if they do, I fit them into a little more with this classic, so I think. I was lucky and I had all the Christmas muppets except that john denver made with the muppets again. I think it's called smokey mountain im holiday. I'm not sure but it's near.
