Short but long enough, Cat Soup is a memorable trip. One day, I just searched, even though the program according to my needs through the anime part and found it and decided to watch. I spend most of my time sitting with my jaw. All the time I was empty, thinking or having a fleeting person who screamed "Open and close !!!" but I didn't. And actually I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> Animation That is amazing Art is very strange and dark. Personally, I like it because of the amazing animation. But the story that seems empty behind it is equally interesting for me. <br /> <br /> A young boy, a cat, goes looking for his sister's soul. In the first part, she slept in bed and soon received money from visiting people from the people involved. Her soul was divided in half. Someone is dominated by a cat boy while the other half is gone. <br /> <br /> Then the rest of the film will be a little lost to me in good faith. I expect them to go back and their world is ... maybe broken down slowly? Perhaps her absence may be the answer behind this story. For the rest of the film, there are different steps that the world came in. At first there was a giant flood and later it dried up in the cold desert. What is God or fate as you will see?) Then I believe that they found the sister's soul in the form of orange flowers. After that the whole world disappeared. Hahahahahahahaha, not all. But it shakes my spine every time. <br /> <br /> Even though it's a random scene, it seems I'm sure there's a deeper message if you look enough and do it. Some research Personally, I like things that are trippy like this and love to spend time doing that to understand. But for some people it may not be their cup of tea It's very disturbing, so if you like the anime forward straight, this isn't the movie for you. If you have an open mind, I recommend this movie.
