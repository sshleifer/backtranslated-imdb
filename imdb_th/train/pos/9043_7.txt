I accidentally stumbled upon this film on TV one day. It aired in the daytime on a channel that was not famous for good movie broadcasts. However, this is nothing better than this. <br /> <br /> October Sky tells the true story of Homer Hickam, a boy who was inspired by the launch of Sput. Nick He and his friends start building rockets. His father was not happy with his son who had just discovered a hobby and wanted to see him become a coal miner as himself or go to college about football, scholarship like elder. Men may be a little speculative. But it's okay because it doesn't focus on different parts of the story. It's an important part. But this is clearly an internal action. Actions between characters are focused on The story is good. It has an ancient idea But it's okay It depends on the actual event so that you cannot release these ancient ideas. The characters are really good. The characters will be brought out and managed to make the action and quality of the movie higher. You will get to know these characters and you can sympathize with them. They can write well and believe. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that looks good. The dress and style of the 50s were fine and the pictures were well decorated and well lit. All of this makes the mood of the movie very good. <br /> <br /> The performance is really good. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a great performance while Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper are as good as John Hickam for the rest of the actors. Well as well This combination makes the actors strong. <br /> <br /> All I'm glad I watched this movie. It was the first time after seeing it, I learned that it was based on actual events. If I knew that when seeing it would be more interesting, October Sky is a good and interesting movie. It's a movie that I believe everyone can enjoy. It's a movie that feels good, not bad at all!
