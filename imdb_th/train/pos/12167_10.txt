What happens when some people have so many social concerns to stop working? How can a man be alone? When the mundane crap that we have to do in order to be part of the society too, what will happen? Frownland explores these questions. It was a shocking debut from Bronstein. The strange and uncomfortable tone of voice when we came to the mind of a man named Keith who made him confused. We follow him around as he tries to contact people and work every day. Most of us know people like this, people who say "sorry" too much or "I'm grateful" when nothing is appreciated. So we know that there are people here like this. But why people who want to make movies about them Well, because it's interesting and Bronstein and actor Dore Mann did a great job. This film is not about trade, as the movie will receive. A few friends who filmed it in a few years, they save money. It was shot in the size of 16 mm and the scratched film is inexpensive. Without this supplier, it may be difficult to find. I think it has been selected for the past year. Hopefully it will be on DVD. At some point I saw it at Silent Movie Theater in LA. There were 10 viewers among them. Crispin Glover. If that tells you about the strangeness of this movie Highly recommended
