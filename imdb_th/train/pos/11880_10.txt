"Scarface" has an important cult following, even now, 22 years after its debut. <br /> <br /> It has been widely criticized for being tacky. These are the people who compare Scarface and The Godfather movies. It's true in front of the technique. (Movies, filming, directions, etc.) Scarface is the way behind 'The Godfather'. <br /> <br /> But it's true, too, that Scarface has and other gangsters. The lack of movies is the raw, true rawness. Of thugs The Latin gangsters in this film look more dangerous and real than the Italian or Irish gangsters who are refined from other classic gangsters like 'The Godfather' or 'Goodfellas'. This is one of Scarface's major winning points and I believe. Strongly convinced that this truth was written as "Tastelessness" by most critics! I've seen the original Scarface in 1932 and have to say that these two films are too different and should be seen as two different films instead of praising the original "remake"! <br /> < br>> Al Pacino has been criticized for being very popular in this film. But how to consider it is the way the movie maker wants Tony Montana's characters to be true! He is an angry young man who decides hasty and angry every minute! He is not Michael Corleone who is calm. Here, he is Tony Montana. He is an uneducated, tacky and angry person all the time. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of feelings for this movie. The soundtrack is 80 all! I like some songs, including 'Gina and Elvira' themes, 'Push to the limit' and the title song. <br /> <br /> There are memorable and beautiful sequel scenes including the famous rave scene. Rebenga first met with Sosa and Tony visited his mother. <br /> <br /> About the show: Al Pacino was great as an angry Cuban refugee. It is reported that he said he enjoyed playing Tony Montana the most in his career. And he seems to have thoroughly enjoyed himself in all his scenes! One wondered what "Scarface" would be. Without Pacino, I couldn't imagine who would show Tony Montana and all the possibilities. The movie wouldn't be effective if he <br /> <br / > Steven Bauer shines as Manny, Manny's friend. <br /> <br /> Robert Loggia is great as Tony's Lopez boss, as well as F. Murray Abraham (as Omar) in a small role. <br /> <br /> Then there was an eye candy in the form of Elvira that played the role. Michelle Pfeiffer looks beautiful and plays well enough <br /> <br /> The director acted a little during any one period. I would say that it is only a small part that suffers due to improper handling. <br /> <br /> "Scarface" is one of the most fun movies and one of the best gangster movies ever Out. Enjoy what it is: raw images of nobles, pills and their groups!
