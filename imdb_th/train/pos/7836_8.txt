Refused her request When Attila King of Han pulled the Cream Hill through the ambassador Rüdiger von Bechlar, she made him promise through the oath in the name of his king that no one would hurt her.

Travel to the court of Huns, where she was greeted by Attila, who was promised by the oath to protect her. <br /> <br /> Canto 3: The way in which Attila encircles Rome and the way Kriemhild calls Her brothers: When Kriemhild sends the baby boy Attila back to his kingdom and asks Kriemhild that she will like her the most. She asked him to invite her brother to his kingdom. <br /> <br /> Chapter 4: The Way Kriemhild Receives Her Brothers: Kriemhild insists to be the head of Hagen Tronje, but her brothers are loyal. Their friends again Not accepting her request. <br /> <br /> Canto 5: The way in which Huns celebrates the summer solstice with Nibelungen: Kriemhild asks Attila to kill Hagen Tronje, but he refuses because of the laws of the desert.

Through seven dramatic plays The nature of the first part is the beautiful story of fantasy, adventure, romance and betrayal. The second part is a story that shows hate, revenge and loyalty. A stable screenplay with the perfect development of the characters, the great performances of the actors and the wonderful direction of Fritz Lang caused another epic before time. Margarete Schön was an impressive person with different women like Completely obsessed and flexible in her revenge needs. The costumes that Kriemhild wears are also impressive, and her performance depends on her face and appearance. I was a little disappointed with Attila's reaction after the death of his only son because I found it too indifferent. My score is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Os Nibelungos ?? Parte II: A Vingança de Kriemshild" ("The Nibelungen Part II: Kriemhild's Revenge")
