This is a must see for independent movie fans. But it's still good for mainstream movies I think we have the salary of the next Woody Allen or <br /> <br /> Trentin Tarrentino here. <br /> <br /> Very low budget. There are no special effects and it looks like they use ambient light. (Taken in digital video) - and although this movie will grab you The screenplay is rather strange. But the actors and directors pulled it out with complete realism It has a sense of humor, attractiveness and pathos and everything working together. <br /> <br /> There is no point in explaining the details. If you want to see independent masterpieces, <br /> <br /> Virtual lessons in low budget flick that actually works. See here. <br /> <br /> - Yes, it's still. Really fun <br /> <br />
