We are talking about movies that are low budget and understandable that there are some weaknesses. (No spoilers: one explosive expert and meaningless alcohol) But in general, the story makes you interested. Most characters are favorite and have some original situations. <br /> <br / > I like movies that surprise you with some people who aren't the people they want you to believe and then twist and change the story ... I applaud this story. <br /> <br /> If you See what I mean. Try watching "Nueve Reinas" (Nine Queens) movies from Argentina.
