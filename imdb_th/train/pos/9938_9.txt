We bought a DVD set of "Es war einmal das Leben" (German) / "Once upon a time ... life" (English) for our bilingual children because everyone loves "Es war einmal der Mensch" (German ) / "Once upon a time ... Man" (English) Series (Our parents used to see it as a child) and it exceeded expectations very high! This series has done very well, does not show its age, and our children of different ages like to watch it very much. At the same time, they learned things that our parents didn't know until coming later. This series covers everything about the human body from all sensory organs, blood, infection, antibodies and many more in the animation film 20-25 minutes. Some topics may find "reasonable", such as Digestion and reproduction are said to be tasteful, thoughtful, and child-friendly (when the reproductive process begins to have comprehensive content that the child begins to grow) while <br /> <br /> Children are often intrigued by the way their bodies work and at various stages, get an understanding of this in the context of the environment. The theme of the episodes switch between the outside world.

Similarly, the episodes in such a sense Hearing, seeing, linking things that happen within the body to the external world context and the episodes about breathing and oxygen circulation in the blood, covering the complete life cycle including (short) coming from oxygen (plants) < br /> <br /> This is one of the best children's programs ever - I will say it's a must see for every family with children!
