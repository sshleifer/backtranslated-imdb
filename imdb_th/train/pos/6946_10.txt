24 must be the best spy / adventure television series ever aired The whole idea of ​​a 24-hour real-time storytelling is dazzling. Filming style and pacing are what we have to see. And Jack Bauer is one of the greatest protagonists in the TV series for a long time. I rate this thing with The Simpsons and The X-Files. My favorite three series Presidency Bauer was summoned to his office to find out who was behind all this and at the same time thinking of the daughter's path to an unknown place after escaping from her bedroom So start the adventure in the best political style and the best thing is that it happens in real time, which makes this TV series a true original work at almost every show on TV. Seems to be showing We the same thing over and over again.
