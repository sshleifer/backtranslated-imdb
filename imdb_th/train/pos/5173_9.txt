I rarely see movies that I am obsessed with; This is one of them. It has a good show, dialogue, plot and beautiful scenery. I laughed out loud several times, especially the scenes involving the attack in the kitchen. The clowns made by the hand that hired my head have one floor. But I admit that I am a sucker for myself Stories related to a group of people over their 30 years of age returned to the summer camp they had attended 20 years ago. It was a farewell week of camping because the place was permanently shut down End of season While adult camps look different and they feel different about it and each other I recommend this interesting comedy to everyone. <br /> <br />
