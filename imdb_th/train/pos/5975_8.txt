All film critics and metal chiefs hate this movie. But i like it I saw this when I was a kid on TV and was fascinated by the scenes that Sammy had on the stage and played Trick or Treat by Fastway. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was normal in the 80s. Gangster and enlists the supernatural help to defeat the gangster. But go far and be destroyed. <br /> <br /> Matt from Melrose Place chooses Skippy from Family Ties so Skippy receives Tony Fields' record from Gene Simmons to comfort him. And Hell disappeared. The highlights that Tony sang (Lip-sync) and danced with metal music before shyt met with his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> There are many mistakes and things, but music. And the overall picture is enough to make my fist pump 8 out of 10
