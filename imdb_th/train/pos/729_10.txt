I love this movie very seriously. I never bored to watch it. The only line that I can't stomach right now is when Riff calls herself a teen lobotomy. But apart from that, everything is perfect. I have never been a fan of PJ Soles and it didn't help to hear that she didn't even know who Ramones was until she filmed this movie. Most people who watch this thing over and over again are Ramones fans and really .. That's the only reason I love it so much. I never get tired of seeing DeeDee making his pizza messy or Joey makes the teacher's name worse .. I like it very much. The special edition DVD has a good retrospective and is surprising that PJ Soles is not there. Maybe you will work on other projects. * Laughs * Okay, the best movies are better if you are a Ramon fan.
