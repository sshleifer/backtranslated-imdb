8 simple rules for dating. My teenage daughter has an auspicious start. Tom Shadyac, a talented person, is involved in this project. This means that the comedy will not be exciting, and that is what happens: The performance is still one of the freshest, most fun and witty programs in a very long time. All lines, facial expressions, casting, scenes, everything are perfect. There was no time I thought "People who are not as good as the rest" Each one is great. This is the perfection that we expect from Tom. For those who do not know, Tom Shadyac is the director of Ace Ventura (the first movie), The Nutty Professor (first part) and Liar Liar. He is the producer here, not the director. But can feel the magic in every episode. The family consists of: <br /> <br /> Father: Paul Hennessy (John Ritter) (D Richard Rich): Dee Nana Slight Over time, worked as a sports writer. Unfortunately, John died in 2003 from a lovely memory and careful consideration of the cancellation of the suit. <br /> <br /> Mother: Cate (Katey Sagal): Can't come. Falling in love with Katey when she plays Peg when marrying a child? Al Bundy is our hero. The audience gave us the respect and love he had never had, but without Peg, the parasite, Peg's lazy lifestyle would be just another Chicago father. Instead of being a mess that Peg (real life) made him Katey. MILF at that time and still be: brune now (instead of red haired) and like buxom. As always, Cate is a conservative mother and a beloved wife. I know it sounds boring. But good joke. She's good together. <br /> <br /> Ditzy Blonde Daughter: Bridget (played for perfection by Kaley Cuoco): almost never had a fool who played well, besides the gob about development Captured. Bridget may be the shoes for any awards given to this model. Bridget is a person who is centered on himself, not bright and looks cool. She definitely plays a stupid blonde role than IMO. The perfection of the high score of the show <br /> <br /> The overlooked daughter: Kerry (Amy Davidson): Brune and the geek. She doesn't get love. From life or situation Feeling being overlooked, being admired and almost abandoned She is Bridget's sister. (In fact, she is older than her) and both very different personalities and brains cause an endless collision for our fun. <br /> <br /> Son: Rory (Martin Spanjers): Is Second, the most funny character IMO. Before going through Ritter, then John passed away. The new character came and Rory was not the creator of the smartest verbal problems he had ever made: most of the characters are David Spade. <Br /> <br /> Those characters are characters A. At the time of John Ritter, unfortunately, Larry Miller is insanely hilarious. He played as a colleague / competitor of Paul. After the cost of blood transfusion, his life in 2003 (on September 11), the show began to disappear for a while. No one thought it would come back. But after that there were a few new additions This started in the second stage of the show and the new character was: <br /> <br /> The strict and confident headmaster: Ed (Adam Arkin): I saw Adam at Here and there is a talk show. This is the first time I see him doing anything. Impressive is the word I use. His performance was very impressive. Sadly, he was not brought in earlier. He also expressed interest in Kate's potential love after Paul passed away. Gradual progress to this point (Which sounds crazy at the beginning) has been praised by many builders It was done slowly, carefully and with great respect. Continuously paying to Paul (Ritter) <br /> <br /> Grandfather's attitude: Jim Egan (James Garner): Welcoming surprises beyond the series Animal food for infinite 'old' jokes mainly by ... <br /> <br /> Half of the 35-year-old unemployed younger brother: CJ (played for extreme funny height by David Spade): I know that Spade is a funny person. I don't know he's funny. However, the familiar appearance of the spade is felt in his character. (Which is different from the inseparable characters) which is easy to understand because he is a cartoon and he is acting funny This eerie feeling is like seeing some people borrow a lot of content from David Spade's presence in movies, talk shows and functions (awards, shows, etc.) and provide excellent imitation and funny style sounds. I mean, you know that he doesn't try to play other people or all new characters: he's a fool and a joke that we know, and he brings this delightful humor to the top every line. Which he uttered, cynical, everything he gave birth to all the classics. Spade is CRAZY-funny; Very funny. <br /> <br /> The humor and drama of both of them increased after the show returned. But the audience thought "John passed away. It will never be the same again." This is understandable because we are talking about a group of people. (American audience) who gave the word 'yes, dear' without charge, but caused Andy Richter Controls the Universe to be canceled shortly. When the quality of the item increases, the ranking of the program is reduced. Soon it is no longer sad. <br /> <br /> And I recorded the best thing for the last time: Married With Children fans are in the process of treatment. And what is the boy? I'm still shaking, just remember. It is very surprising that it is crazy for me to spoil, even if I do it under the pretext of "spoiler ..." legally. Enough to say that it's something you'll never forget I know I won't :-)
