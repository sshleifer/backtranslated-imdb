Great movie One to stimulate all 5 senses, not real historical reports and not all the information that must be taken as real information. Use true Hollywood meetings, such as playing shows and actors that are very interesting as 'heroes', such as Naomi Watts (Julia Cook - Ned Kelly's lover) Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom and actors (apologize to Jeffrey Rush) who is unattractive to play a drunken Victorian police officer and corruption This also instilled a very unreliable love story in the combination of Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts) to attract all love. Women love being especially weak. Even from the first scene when Ned rescued the fat boy from drowning and his father called him "sunshine" and had "twinkling eyes while looking down at me looking at my shoulders" Persuade the audience to go side by side with Ned Kelly, the underdog. Every Aussies don't like the underdog?
