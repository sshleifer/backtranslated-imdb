When talking about movies, I would be quite meticulous and I would complain about anything and everything that was wrong. While all movies are flawed, night listeners are very low. <br /> <br /> If you read the latest reviews (It's difficult because half of it is written in uppercase and doesn't have real information about the movie.) You may be convinced that this movie is not good. Unfortunately, if you read more than 3 lines in the same review, you discover the reason for insulting the postman: He / she doesn't like the fact that the director is gay. (Or whether the production team smokes ... obviously) br /> <br /> So even though I have never written reviews before But I think this film deserves the benefit of goodness, not the director's sexual orientation. Go to see the express checklist first: 1. Good plan? I certainly won't destroy it. But the plot is very interesting and not what anyone expects from the ad. This is a thriller, not a horror movie and should be approached like this. The story will surprise you even more because it's true. (And the plot is still honest with the event) <br /> <br /> 2 Great performances? Oh yes. Recently, Robin Williams was out of the chain of comedians and he played a very important role in how many people would write him out ten years ago. He again succeeded in his role in The Night Listener by playing as a radio host with more and more problems and getting involved in the case ... Okay, I'll let you see. <br /> <br /> 3 great directions? Certainly, now, unlike other posters that I call, I know something about the direction. I'm sutdying the art of the direction that the school is now 3 years. Of course I don't think it makes a difference (The only thing that is important is if you like directions) but I think I should create again that I use my opinion here on important things and Related ... Example: not the director's sexual orientation (Or the alleged drug abuse behavior of the LOL manufacturer) <br /> <br /> Patrick Stettner's direction is emotional and dark, and he permits angles and Light to help create feelings "Tension and liberation" of these desires, instead of a fast and busy camera and the sudden wounds we face today Some people can actually show the story through your camera while others feel as though they have to create a story with the camera. I really appreciate when some people today have the courage to use the camera as it should be, which is like the eyes that we all see. <br /> <br /> 4 Lighting, movies and editing? Excellent all around I've already written a lot and I can talk about these last three things for ten paragraphs. So I'll summarize it. <br /> <br /> In short, watch this movie. Do not listen to people who are motivated to destroy it, especially if they are so stupid that they reveal the 1/4 motivation of the way through their posts without knowing it. Enjoy the show! -Ben
