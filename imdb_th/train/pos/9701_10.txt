A wonderful and unreal classic show. The League of Gentlemen remains one of the greatest modern comedies of all time. <br /> <br /> With dark and strange humor. Strange to create superior formulas that are tired and boring, Little Britain, The League of Gentlemen are truly special things in a relatively quiet era in British comedy. <br /> <br /> Until the episode That came to that scene has never been What, like the League of Gentlemen before, on the surface, showing simple sketches soon, the show unfolds as a bright, scary universe. But is incredibly hilarious, which is full of all kinds of great funny creations What makes the program different from competitors is how to tell our story. Rather than providing a new hacked sketching service that allows us to distinguish almost no different from the next time, here we see each character or group through a variety of travels and stories. There is no visit to them as well, and every time they give us a surprise, <br /> <br /> In less than three series 'And the special Christmas day, the city plays the role of Royston Vasey, strange shakes, hilarious populations, and that's probably the main reason why acting is a pleasure to watch (And the reason that the show will make the series more easily) which is different from other current programs, such as The Catherine Tate Show or more importantly Little Britain. Favorites, which can be stored for additional entertainment, easily bend out before the series comes close, making room for fellow characters to grow more or allow more. The introduction of the new people of Royston Vasey <br /> <br /> Another thing that makes this program above others is that the writing team approached the script process with care and cunning.

With the third series having less urgency for them to make the audience satisfied and like a special Christmas, they follow each story with a clear storytelling that is different from the previous series based on Draft '(successful) sketches in the long section of the series <br /> <br /> The third series is both a refreshing change of style and a real practice. The statistics for the fans who have seen the first two ago. Despite comments about the terminal in the third series, the real fans of the league will appreciate what the third series has to offer, as well as enjoying the characters from the episode with more characters that drill down. Going to the fans who like the character of the wine that may not have crossed the path before. <br /> <br /> May require a little effort to change the style. But it is definitely worth it and in my opinion, the third series is the best and Also gives a definitive summary for the series. <br /> <br /> The performance is not without disadvantages and sometimes the characters and thin pieces appear outside the venue. But most of the genius writing is dark nature. Of performances and hosts of excellent characters (Which is often as close to real life) made for practicality and proving something funny should be about and makes more recently catch phrases driven and desperate attempts at humiliation, shame
