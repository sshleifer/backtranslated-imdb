First of all, do not go into the Revolver. It is expected that there will be another Snatch or Lock Stock. This is a gangster movie. <br /> <br /> I saw the gala the night before and this movie definitely separates the audience. Is it the type of movie that half the audience thinks of it? That is terrible and the other half will think that's what? It's very cool. Personally, I like movies that I don't understand. i.e.Mullholland Drive and the usual suspects, so I enjoy Revolver. <br /> <br /> Of course it's not perfect. I saw a big twist one mile away, at least partly, and although sometimes the left unexplained end was a good thing, Revolver left many questions without explaining the reasons without reason. Some scenes, such as animations and scenes that Sorter went into killing fun (Actually it's one of my favorites.) Although the scene seems to look like it seems to be there because they look scary, not because they are compatible with the movie. <br /> <br /> However, there is. Many good things as well I think the performance is great from all the main actors, Jason stratham, Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastore and even Andre Benjamin (which is amazing). This movie definitely made me interested in the action scenes and Be careful when Ray Liotta is held under the table. Wow .... You have to watch it. The script is very good and the soundtrack is the same as most Guy Ritchie movies. <br /> <br /> Although the steps below Of movies such as Fight Club, Mullholland Dr ive and usual suspects still exist, exciting and fast-moving action movies with a twist and rounds and many scenes that you will remember long after the movie ends.
