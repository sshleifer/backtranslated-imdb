The first time I saw this movie 25 years ago on a British TV and just returned again last week from buying a DVD from eBay. I remember the musical order, the color and the beautiful fashion sheets, posing and clothes. But the plot is weaker than Anna Neagle / Michael Wilding in Spring Park at Park Lane and Maytime, which has not been like that for the past several years. The comedic charm seems to have a lot of fun and is above his body. Worth to watch him alone Anna Nigle appeared slightly beside her and was too old for the role she played. But by the end of the 1940s, their films were well accepted with movies released to the public. Spring in Park Lane is the most popular in 1947 and is a major money maker. In his autobiography, Wilding wrote the great interest of Herbert Wilcox, director and filmmaker of this London series.
