Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman is the latest animated movie straight to the video / DVD movie that will be released (Minor Spoilers Ahead). The plot revolves around a new criminal, Batwoman, who seems to have personal involvement. For whatever reason for stopping the delivery of important weapons, <br /> <br /> Although this film is interesting enough, not as good as 'Mask of the Phantasm,' 'Sub-Zero' or 'Return of the Joker'. The main thing is that it doesn't attract attention. The emotional as well as other movies at the end of the film, we do not feel sorry for anybody like we do with other people, especially the 'Sub-Zero' No real tragedy that puts an animated film so special for us. Even Batman isn't a tragic character. (As Mr. Pin or Demon) not only that But Batwoman's alter ego seems to be "stiff", incredibly boring and boring, so the audience doesn't care what happens to her that makes her wear a mask or what happens to her at the end and the main reason is We do not receive special emotional appeal. <br /> <br /> Don't understand me wrong. It had a period of time, such as when the audience found out who Batman was and saw the return of the old villain that was last seen in 'Batman: The Animated Series'. <br /> <br /> If Batwoman's background is more interesting than this movie, it should be better than 'Return of the Joker' in my book. It's ranked No. 4 (from 4). <br /> <br /> For animation, it's like the cartoon of The New Batman Adventures from mid to late 1990. The score isn't as impressive as the Batman anime movie. 3 previous stories But still good. <br /> <br /> I would suggest buying this DVD because despite the shortcomings But remember that it's not as good as other anime movies. <br /> <br /> 7/10
