The great movies Lansbury and Tomlinson are perfect, great music, dancing, with a special mention of "Portobello Ballet". In the animation part, matching between animals has become a classic immediately. The climax with the attack of cold and fascinating weapons I recommend watching the 134 minute version that has been recovered or at least 112 minutes of video. Here in Italy, we only have 98 minutes, although the movie will be presented in the first release of 117 minutes, if possible. See the German video tape as well: It was created from 98 minutes running, but it Disappeared from referring to World War II and all scenes between the British and Nazi invaders
