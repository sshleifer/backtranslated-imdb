Okay, I saw this movie as a child and loved it a lot. My parents never bought a movie for me. But i think i will buy now I was an animated film maker before 2000. However, there are still reviews. <br /> <br /> What I like: There is a description of heaven and hell, one of the few that I have seen In animated movies With character development! It's easy to identify the characters in this movie (eg: Charlie is a selfish fool. Itchy is an insult, but believes Charlie is a relentless villain, etc.). King Gator too. I love men that are loud and annoying all the time. This song may be random. But it's very fun Finally, the details of the animation are beautiful. You can tell that Charlie is boring and has a beautiful background. <br /> <br /> What I don't like: True portrayal: The way Charlie interacts with it. "No wonder." Really boring. He rejected the place in heaven and still had to go back there at the end. I remember some songs, such as "... you can't make a dog better", "... make music immortal" and "... welcome to death" but I can't Remember most of them The song is not a catchy song that says exactly. Whippet Angel: She's annoying and that's the neck! AUGH! <br /> What the parents may not want: the image of Hell (depending on the audience) is very scary to appear during the movie. Carface is quite dangerous. Beer is also implied. But not really beer, dubbed gambling is an important element in the movie. Good people die. <br /> <br /> Overall: I love this movie, though sometimes it's forgotten. Scary children's animations are images that I like. This was created at a time when producers and writers were not afraid to give the children a little shock at this time. Today, this should be rated PG. Children under the age of 8 (or children that are easily disturbed) should not watch this thing. In addition, I gave 9/10 :) <br /> <br /> Look happily!
