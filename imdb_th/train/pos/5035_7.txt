McConaughey in horror / thriller? I must see this I was very surprised. <br /> <br /> The plot has been told in the past mode. I can't say anything more without losing both the apology. Just know that if you decide to watch, you will be surprised at least <br /> <br /> Every major player is very good. Bill Paxton works very well in directing those children and his performances are excellent. McConaughey's strength is strong and perfect for the bill. <br /> <br /> This movie challenges you to think of a crazy father? Is there a God? Does the demon exist? How far are you going to be wrong and "correct"? I still think. <br /> <br /> So I recommend "weakness" 7/10 and this is one movie that deserves and gives reward in seconds or for the third time.
