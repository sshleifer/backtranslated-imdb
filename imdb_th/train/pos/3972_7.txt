In the tradition of G-Men, The House On 92nd Street, The Street With No Name. Up to now, The FBI Story is one of the well-regulated films that shows the Federal Bureau of Investigation. While the director, J. Edgar Hoover, is 48 years old, still alive, it will be shown in other aspects. <br /> <br /> Book by Don Whitehead that this movie is based. From the straightforward history of the office From its founding in 1907 until the time when the movie The FBI Story came out, it is sometimes important to remember that having an FBI before J. Edgar Hoover will be a leader, some time is covered with movies. <br /> < br /> But Warner Brothers did not make a documentary for the flesh and blood of the FBI to play the role of John Chip Hardesty, played by James Stewart, a male FBI graduate. In law and instead of working Office in the early years of life, twenties /> <br /> In a real-life office <br were led by William J Burns Detective Agency of Burns. In fact, political action has not been reduced as it had appeared in movies. Burns is around the Harding government scandal. When Hoover was appointed in 1924 to bring professional law enforcement techniques and strict competency standards, he did so. <Br / > <br /> Through the Hardesty family, which is Stewart and his wife Vera Miles, we see the history of the FBI that opens. We also see many of their personal family history combined with Stewart and Miles is an American lover. Of course, we follow the FBI. In some cases, Stewart deals with the arrest of members of the Ku Klux Klan, a plan to kill the oil-rich Indians, bringing the famous criminals of the thirties. Participation with Nazi socialists in World War II and anti-communism Espionage in the Cold War <br /> <br /> There is a part of the prologue that Stewart told the class at the FBI Academy before entering the history of the office while it was linked to himself. Related to placing a bomb on an airline by a son who buys a lot of life insurance with his mother before flying. Nick Adams will give you creeps as an offender and the story is sadly relevant today < br /> <br /> Of course, if the story of the FBI is written and produced today, it will reflect something different. Yet, the FBI has a story to tell and it is not negative. <br /> <br /> The story of the FBI is not one of Jimmy Stewart's best movies. But it is the first movie I have ever seen The actors there were especially fond of me. If both the FBI were Jimmy Stewarts, I would feel much better. In addition, there is a good performance of Murray Hamilton as a friend and his fellow agent who was killed in a shoot with Baby Face Nelson. <br /> <br /> Vera Miles is not just Married to Stewart, but in fact she married the FBI as a movie. Mostly it's old But there are still good and interesting stories to tell
