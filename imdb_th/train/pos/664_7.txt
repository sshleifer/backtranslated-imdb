Tales from the Crypt: and All Through the House started on Christmas Eve when Elizabeth (Mary Ellen Trainor) killed her husband (Marshall Bell). Her husband dragged his body out and ready to throw it down. Go The radio bulletin board said that it was a madman (Larry Drake) dressed like Santa Clause, fleeing from a local mental hospital and killing many women with Elizabeth in her list. already But she has other ideas. Your advantage ... <br /> <br /> This story from Crypt is part 2 of Season 1, directed by one of the producers, Robert. Tzemikis and All Through the House are directing the program. The screenplay by Fred Dekker is based on the story that appeared in the comic book 'The Vault of Horror' and adapted into a film from Britsih, a horror anthology of Tales of the Crypt (1972), starring Joan Collins as an actor Kill the wife character here played by Ellen Trainor. This particular model is good enough. But do not do anything different or special & quite linear too, and can be predicted to be considered a classic With just 25 minutes in length, of course, it will move in a good rhythm. The story is scary enough & generally gives good entertainment. & I quite like the bad ending, this time with the opening and closing of the Christmas theme as well. Crypt Keeper (John Kassir) that is perfect with normal play. <br /> <br /> The director of Zemeckis works well and has a good winter atmosphere as well as the influence of Christmas. Not A lot of people have poker stuck in the head, someone's face is cut with ice, someone's arm is cut with an ax. But in general it is not that image The performances by the small actors are quite good. <br /> <br /> And All Through the House is not the best thing from the basement. But it is also a good thing, every thing is worth watching But after the comic book story We need the original movie version of 1972 or what you want
