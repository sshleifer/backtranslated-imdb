"Radiofreccia" is still a great surprise in Italian cinema. This film is made from the books of Italian composer Luciano Ligabue, who is the director of the film and wrote the score - of course. <br /> <br /> The film depicts the life of the northern Italian province of Emilia Romagna region. We were in 1975, the time of the first free radio - one of the men of this film created. "Radioraptus" The desire of youth, friendship, love, sex, drama and unemployment is one of the themes. But this film talks about drugs - Freccia, the main character is the victim of heroin slave trade. <br /> <br /> Without boredom and morals, the story flows very well. The naturalness of the actors is also strong and the method of governance. Apparently Luciano "Liga" Ligabue is not either Fellini or a professional in his first movie, a musician. But he succeeded in creating a good product Unfortunately, he will not come back again with his second movie "Da zero a dieci" - not good. <br /> <br /> In the actors "Radiofreccia" are not always famous for the single stars. Stefano Accorsi - one of the most popular Italian actresses Seen in a small role, another Italian composer - Francesco Guccini. He is a communist bartender and a great football trainer!
