I'm very happy now Seeing Flash Cyborg, Green Arrow and Aquaman (Although he was swimming all the way) made my eyes wide open. To see the majority of Justice League founders trying to reduce levels, Lex Luthor is what I have been waiting for. Sounds not interesting But the Justice League live performance gave me a reason to push everything I did during the past week. This is the excitement I received from watching now. I hope that they will make this episode a little longer, like a special two hours, because I feel that one hour of Justice League is not enough. Now before I get bored you (Unless I'm already with my tour) I just want to say Smallville is cool again. It lacks touch when the program starts to focus on Lana, but I'm sure the author will fall back to the loop :( Enjoy now, who knows that another good guy is going to catch again on Thursday 22 February if you miss the first broadcast
