Who doesn't have problems with unresolved parents? And any parent who doesn't have unresolved problems <br /> <br /> I know it sounds heavy But this is for laughing in the movie, making both comedians and dramas better. I tend to like Paul Reiser and Peter Falk and although I'm a little worried that their star's properties might be too big for a small movie Discovered that the son did about his father as a person And Peter Falk's monologue about being a diligent father and husband is the perfect balance point If there are no such scenes that can be played well, the movie doesn't seem to fit much, and the characters are less interesting. <br /> <br /> Well done, Paul and Peter!
