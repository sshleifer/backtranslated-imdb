Kate Beckinsale stole the show! cheer! Too bad, Knightly doesn't look as good as Jeremy Northam. Mark Strong works great. Bernard Hepton is perfect as Emmas' father. I like the last scene. (Which is an extension of the novel But write well) when harvesting there and eating bravely with workers and friends, high society Emma must show that she accepts now. She is a changing woman. It's too early, but it's okay. I'll buy it. Samantha Bond plays the past and is Emma's closest friend. She's wonderful as I imagine. I believe that when England makes Jane Austen the best American English literature for money and not for quality. See this!
