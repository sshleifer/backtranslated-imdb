In my opinion, this is the best performance I've ever seen. I became a big fan of Eddie immediately after seeing the dress to kill. But I must say that I think this is his best work. I will say that if you have the opportunity to see him, certainly it is worth it! <br /> <br /> Most of the time, after seeing a few stand-up routines, jokes start to be old. But I have to say that I've seen this program many times and I remember everything. (Yes, I know it's sad.) But every joke also makes me laugh. This is a really good feeling. <br /> <br /> Dress to Kill will never be old for me. I own and watch every time I want a good laugh.
