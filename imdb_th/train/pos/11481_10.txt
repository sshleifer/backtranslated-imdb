High school friends Andre Kriegman and Cal Gabriel declare war on their classmates and plan a terrible attack on their high school. As they began to count down to revenge for the last time, both began recording videos to explain their past feelings and events. Their mission <br /> There is another similar movie called Why did I bring it up? To compare the two movies of course I have to say, even though I like "Chang", this is a much better movie. You ask something different For beginners, this shot is very different in line with "Cloverfield", "Blair Witch Project" and "Diary of the Dead" make this movie better because it's more realistic. <br /> <br /> But the thing that made me win was the way this movie Willing to demonstrate "On the other side of the story" You will get to know these two athletes, unlike "elephants". Actually, I care about one athlete and understand their actions and why they do what they do. This movie makes you feel sympathetic to these people and that's a good thing because it's not always black and white. <br /> <br /> Speak straight. This is the reason I almost cried in this movie. The characters are real human beings, along with the reasons and reasons behind their actions. You understand them Not that they want to kill people for attention. Overall, this film has a catchy and haunting mood and is much better than "elephants".
