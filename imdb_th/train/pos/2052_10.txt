I have nothing to add to my conclusion. This film is ranked there and Top Gun is one of the funniest movies that I have ever tried. I don't think that it should be serious when watching because it's so fun. <br /> <br /> I don't think it will make Christopher Walken's reputation diminish either due to his low reputation. Pulp Fiction makes He woke up from the sleep that he had done. Michael Ironside. He is very funny while not trying to be a serious movie. Total recall, top gun What I think is amazing is the budget that this movie has. Scenes and actors and explosions, etc. are quite amazing, so obviously people like it quite a lot and are willing to risk a lot of money. Whoever he or she is, I like them because I love this movie! <br /> <br /> If anyone read this, look for information about McBain (and I seriously suspect that there will be too much) just know it's a hilarious movie and should watch with a smile on your face!
