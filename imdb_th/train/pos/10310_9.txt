Starring: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Aniston I was quite skeptical of the first time I watched this movie. I mean, what is the concept of nightmares? Jim Carrey plays as a god? Nothing is sacred anymore. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is almost sacred. But it is not sacred Yes, Jim Carrey has the power of God for a while. But he is not God confused? I'll make you lower. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a lucky journalist and doesn't feel successful with his life. He lives with his beautiful girlfriend, Grace (Anniston) and you can tell right away that they love each other. But the relationship was on the ground that was quite shaky. <br /> <br /> Then Bruce was shot in Ann Corman. Only Ivan Baxter has been stolen secretly. Obviously, don't please. Bruce shares his thoughts with the world via television in a funny and worthwhile manner to be fired. <br /> <br /> Later, complaining and catching God, Bruce can. Get face Soon after, he was tired of calling it, so he responded to the Omni Presents (heh) building. There he met God (Freeman), the chief electrician and janitor of the building. I found this very amusing. God is the Holy Spirit Boss, an electrician and Jesus Christ is a janitor. Think of the boss clearly. The electrician who makes everything work. The janitor who cleans the chaos that the world has gone from. BRILLIANT <br /> <br /> Next, Bruce is a little curious about actually meeting God. But when God gives his power to Bru He became convinced that he had entered the use of power that was inappropriate for personal gain and for use in the fight against the enemy. <br /> <br /> Because this is Holly. Wood finally Space wise up eventually learned his lesson and began to use his powers for the good of the world. In the end, he cried, asking God to take it out and pray that His will would be fulfilled. Not Bruce. <br /> <br /> Since Jim Carrey, this movie is quite amusing. During that time This film is not the perfect theology. But for Hollywood, it's definitely a good effort. Many words in this film may be a stimulating and challenging idea, and I applaud Tom Shadyac for his efforts in this film. <br /> <br /> So even though it's far from perfect. Thinking behind <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth a look or two)
