The first time I was my best friend and I sat down to watch this movie. We were watching it for Alex's fame. "Bill & Ted" We don't know what to expect except anyone and what it's about. <Br /> <br /> When this movie ends, we know that it is the first love it finds. This film, although not historically accurate But it is the best movie I've seen other films that show the history of this famous summer, and in my opinion, no one can compare. It's a bit turbulent in some details. But those parts did not abandon the elegance and romance of the story. I've seen other movies about this summer and I found that most of them are good. But no one is as cute as this movie. <br /> <br /> "Haunted Summer" has features of drawings. Colors and settings seem to be what we find on framed canvas and hanging in museums or on the walls of unusual houses. The costume is beautiful and although it is not the most comfortable clothes in the world, I want to find a seamstress to create myself for myself. The entire film is located on the beautiful Lake Geneva. (Which I hope will one day because I have watched this movie) and the peace that these historical figures have found. <br /> <br /> This film shows By fleeing from the brutal judgments of England, the strangeness that surrounds this adventure as well Yes there are drugs It is common in that period of time that drugs are not illegal. And eating opium (Liquid form of opium) is a drug as well as recreation. Shelley suffered from consumption. Lord Byron suffered the pain of Phan's feet. It is not surprising that there is a strong prescription that occupies that summer. And they are poets at the time when experience is the key There is no time for careful caution. Passion and experience are an important part of the romantic era. And from the ideas and discussions of science, religion and philosophy come from the creation of myths: "Frankenstein" <br /> <br /> Yes, in this movie we see Mary Godwin beautiful and liberated. (Not married Shelley at that time) played by Alice Krige, a beautiful and talented She is a control factor for everything that happens until she experiences as well. But she stood on the floor and touched things according to her own condition As well as the strength she inherited from her parents. <br /> <br /> The actors and actresses in this story are perfect for the part they play. Suitable music The direction captures the essence of the summer, as I read about it. This film is made from the excellent book "Haunted Summer" by Anne Edwards. If you like this movie, read the book. The author brings stories from what she can gather from the real journals of Mary Godwin Shelley and other participants of this story. <br /> <br /> If you are a person who loves history (Even a little inaccuracy Occasionally) and romance and gothic, then this is the movie for you. It shows the origins of the origins of monsters, which even today teaches us about morality. "Playing God" <br /> <br /> Of course you have to watch the movie!
