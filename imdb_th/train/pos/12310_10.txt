Just reading the original story that Pu wrote in the 18th century, this film is very insulting to the original spirit, although the story is greatly modified The language of the movie, the special effects of the rhythm, comes from Hollywood. But still has a Chinese core It is an amazing story that Hark Tsui has combined. The result is pure beauty.
