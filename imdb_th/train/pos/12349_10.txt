This film shows that you do not want a huge explosion, billions of dollars of computer graphics or actors and actors with high wages to make good movies. Akira Kurosawa, a teacher of all Japanese films, has drawn great talent. I recommend this movie to everyone who loves a masterpiece over time. And for those who enjoy Kurosawas previous work 10/10
