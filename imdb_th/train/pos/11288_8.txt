Considered by almost all critics as the best movie of Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan, I don't have any arguments even though there are two other people that I think is fun. One thing: It's the longest set I've ever seen in 105. The minute I saw only six people But this is longer than I am familiar with, and with the ending of the action that pulls out, I think the whole thing is a bit long. <br /> <br /> However, it is. A good mix of action, suspense and romance. The only thing missing is color and stereo. Traditional effects did not bother me as it was in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Some of the most famous films, one story: Skin! "Jane" never put anything that is stingy after this movie, while Hayes's code was established at the time when the movie Tarzan was created. Her costume shows that Maureen O'Sullivan is a big figure. However, the naked underwater scene isn't her - with long-sighted, underwater women without good numbers, no matter who they are. <br /> <br /> There are many actions here. Until the end, it wasn't too much too Although the ending continues for 15 minutes and is so intense that it is almost impossible to see it. <br /> <br /> The movie has everything except "Boy" (adoptive son) - You want to see. In the Tarzan movie, even O'Sullivan shouted Tarzan about ten times with her "lungs".
