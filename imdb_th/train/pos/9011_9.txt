I accidentally found this movie. But I am happy to be doing Kenneth Branagh's performance closer to stealing the movie from Helena Bonham Carter, but their chemical strength makes them more engaging in movies. This film reminds the great movie Branagh made with Emma Thompson. Carter's star turned here as a disabled woman who tried to make herself perfect. It was a good performance that I saw from the leading actors. Woman in a long time The description of the disabled is difficult to pull out. But basically, with only your eyes showing her pain about the situation in her life, she made it credible. If this movie comes out after the current movie stream with beautiful "ugly" women taking on the role (Charlize Theron, Halle Berry), I feel that Carter must consider Oscar. If you run across the movie late at night like I do, trust me, it's worth the lost sleep.
