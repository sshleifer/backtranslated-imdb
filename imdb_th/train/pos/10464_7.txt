For all of you who do not speak Swedish: the name of the Swedish [original] of this movie; "Rånarna" translates into something in the line of "The Robbers". This fact is the main problem I have with movies because it's not about robbers. It's about a young woman working for the Swedish police to research the robbery. An ordinary desk should be thought of, but this woman is going out on the field and holding his hand while the story goes, even if shooting a bandit ... Of course: We've seen this before. The fact that there is a very interesting rotation in the previous episode did not help much because the ending was a cliché that was two of the first three parts of the movie. <br /> <br /> What Helping to survive from being another mainstream This film is the fact that it is practiced expertly in all areas. The actor is as good as they are and doesn't do anything more than this, and the director manages to make it as excited as it is. Most stories /> <br /> One thing I like very much about this movie is the fact that it's a song that creates the right mood when it's needed. But not in the rest of the time which gives a good feeling to the reality of shooting and The car spreads over the entire film. Good touch! The fact that Michael Persbrandt is one of the few Swedish actors who often prints sad comics makes you hurt as you know that he will not just play as a heroine and as a supporting character in the background. br /> <br /> This is an entertainment movie that steals more money at 7/10.
