*** 1/2 from ***** While I'm not worried about the fact that this is the English version, as some critics have mentioned, it should be noted because it appears to be in the heart. Native Quebec However, this is a movie when I was a child that I was a strong admirer. Remember that now it is made for children, I rate it on a related basis. The story of the children in the winter creates a wonderful snow fortress and goes back to control weapons such as snowballs and other things such as empty hands and equal winter study time. If I have children, this is a movie that I will try and give them attention because the snow fort made me when I was young and I think even today children agree. Outdated and not fully understood In addition, the text of the film is a great metaphor and positive for children (and adults).
