DANIEL DAY-LEWIS works great in the role of Christie Brown, an artist who grew up with cerebral palsy. But having a successful life in managing his handicap to succeed and become a famous artist and writer However, this movie is a very difficult review to criticize or even watch. Fortunately, I have a caption feature to capture every word, which would be impossible if I saw a movie in the cinema. While I respect it, it is a brave job to deal with difficult things. I can't say that it is the type of movie that I want to watch more than once. <br /> <br /> However, my interest was held. With a retrospective story telling the current frame, which we see Christie as an honor for his success before we see his youth and his struggles in communicating with those around you for sure <br /> DANIEL DAY-LEWIS is amazing because people who have trouble falling in love with a therapist (FIONA SHAW) make their mother afraid that when love does not return the heart of he Keep apart There is a painful long scene in the restaurant where he confesses to her in front of others and then becomes angry after drinking too much. <br /> <br /> Brenda Fryker works great in While the mother took care of him His father and siblings, while struggling to keep the roof over their heads until Day-Lewis begins to succeed in his work She fulfilled Day-Lewis's performance as a warm mother and shared many painful moments with him. <br /> <br /> The story has many details of the family together under very unusual circumstances. the best Fricker and Day-Lewis won the Oscar, but HUGH O'CONOR and RAY McANALLY were great too. O'Conor is Christy like a boy and McAnally is a father who spends most of the time in a local pub. But love boys. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Elmer Bernstein's music is an added value factor, but not a movie for everyone.
