This movie, which has a low budget as it should be, is one of the best psychological thriller I have ever seen. If you accept that it has a low budget from the beginning, you can appreciate how the story is, how well the movie is written> <br /> All the elements of the great movie are here. The pictures taken with digital are beautiful in different places. The strange feeling of this film's dream is especially well captured in the scene with the dog talking. The scene is amazing. It is a small piece of work. But didn't do it wisely and because I have a lot of respect for this movie It is strongly recommended that anyone looking for something new and fascinating and different from the many repetitive movies that are there.
