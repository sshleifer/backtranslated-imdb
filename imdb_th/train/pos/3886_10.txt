Eddie Izzard is a genius with his dynamic humor. I can listen all day. His unique approach to life is quite reasonable. Understanding of his discoveries (such as Heimlich Maneuver) is a creative idea. Eddie Izzard gathers the heart of what we think I don't know when I laughed hard in someone's heart.
