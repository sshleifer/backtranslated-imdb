"Bruce Almighty" looks and sounds incredibly stupid, especially from the example However, I found that it was a more profound message that made me more like this movie. Bruce (Jim Carrey) was angry with God and received the sacred power from him to be a god for a week to see him. Can work better? Morgan Freeman plays a man with a symbol here as a god, and although it is not his usual type of film or is one of his best roles. But he did well with what he received from work too Although sometimes rough, the film also has a few laughs from Bruce, separating his soup in half like the Red Sea, and the reaction of customers to him, as well as the image of God, Freeman who placed and clever images. Sometimes it is too exaggerated and has some humor. But overall it's quite funny There are appropriate factors such as Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter and Steve Carrell. At the end of this film proved to be romantic and tear-twisting, and the message was clear that we should do what God called us to do and "It's a miracle." This film is far from perfect. But still fun and better than me and many people would expect, especially if we see more subtle messages of movies. <br /> <br /> *** from ** **
