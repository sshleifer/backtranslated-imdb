Brilliant film is the next best movie of The Drunken Master (Jackie Chan). I just bought it in the original VHS and I haven't watched this movie for 15 years but still good. The performance is terrible and the dubbing is even worse. But it is a feature that makes this movie (And many other traditional Chinese kung fu movies) excellent. The choreography is excellent and the story is basic. I never saw the 36th Sichuan Tower, but knew that it was the same movie. But Gordon Liu plays Sante, but Sante in Thr returns to Room 36, played by different characters. It has many funny values ​​and excellent kung fu.
