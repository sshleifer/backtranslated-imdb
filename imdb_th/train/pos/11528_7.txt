I used to see a woman with red hair when it appeared and couldn't remember that it was something to be preserved. The truth is that even if it is based on the true story, playing on the screen is ridiculous and unbelievable. The real picture advantage is to throw. The best players in the 30s and 40s have created a backdrop for Miriam Hopkins' clever and delicate work with low performance and the dramatic performances of Claude Rains that are normally the best in Picture. What a technician! He never won an Oscar, but he was in the good company of Chaplin Garbo and Hitchcock. Perhaps Lady with Red Hair has his best work in the movie. See and enjoy him. <br /> <br />
