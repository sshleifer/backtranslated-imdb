I'm glad that other people enjoy this movie, making me realize that it's not the most famous and doesn't make money at the box office. I think it's great and there are many reasons why - Bogdanovich directed with the lightest touch. The actor (especially Coleen Camp) is perfect and the Big Bad Apple never looks better in the movie. You've watched movies worse!
