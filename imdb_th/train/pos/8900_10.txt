This is a fantastic classic monster flick from the 50s! I like the look of the 50s like cars and music. Anyway, I like the way it drops. I love when everyone is in the horror, late at night at the theater and the drops come in and cause the party to fall. Another thing I like is that it happened the same night as Halloween II. <br /> <br /> When Steve and Jane are traveling, they see rain falling from space Inside the meteor is drops Whenever the drops are used, it will become bigger and bigger. They tried to convince people in the city about blobby monsters, but no one believed them until later. Is there anything to stop this creature? Blobby? I recommend BLOB !!!
