There is no doubt that it is a joke filled with stories "Full Moon High", showing teenagers Tony Walker. (Adam Archin), a teenager in the 1950s, along with his father (Ed McMahon) travel to Romania Tony is bitten and grew up with fur and fangs whenever there is a full moon. A particularly interesting aspect of this film is that he cannot last as long as he has the curse of a werewolf and he must follow the fate even if it takes twenty years. But in other words, the comedy is normal as soon as it starts The character of Ed McMahon is too humble with a passionate heart. (He thinks that everyone should listen to Joe McCarthy) Kenneth Mars's coach / headmaster is very stupid and there are many more. One of the most eye-opening actors is Demond Wilson, which is best remembered as Lamont in "Sanford and Son" - as a bus driver who has been very surprised. But perhaps the most fun scene is changing the president Then gagged with Gerald Ford. He really concluded! However, it's true. Considering that Alan Arkin - a funny psychiatrist - just won an Oscar on Sunday night and thanked his son, I wonder if he remembered performing with two of them in this film or not. (Apart from Adam, his son, a small role), quite funny, starring Elizabeth Hartman. <br /> <br /> PS: Director Larry Cohen seems to be at Better known for killing children "It's Alive"
