I noticed that the DVD version seems to have a scene or line missing between the post of the FRF and the launch. <br /> <br /> They have to prove that they can win the right to sit in the FRF other than Green team <br /> <br /> The other scenes are like the scenes that they failed to simulate. Kevin received Joaquin. <br /> <br /> I think other VHS versions other than ABC may have content. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I want to know that the DVD version <br /> <br /> The DVD that I watched was corrected for television.
