A good movie and one I will watch many times. Rich (previous reviewer) is right: there is much more going on here than it is clearly from the title board and I have to wonder how much translation there is. What's more in the original? Or the native speaker is expected to read more? Or - because the screenplay was written by the author of the novel, which is based on this story - is the story that has been popular nowadays that the audience is already familiar with? But may have to use more from the contemporary audience than the audience in 1913. Originally, that must be put <br /> <br /> Alpha video released a new organ score, but the song was not in line with the story's progress In any way, of course, it started with promise. But reduce the monotonous monotony like Phillip-Glass That doesn't reflect any action on the screen. After listening for a moment, I turn off the sound and watch: much better!
