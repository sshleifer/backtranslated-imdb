Is a very good start I was a little surprised to find a machine that wasn't very advanced: it should be something to do in order to match what we saw in the original series The actors are interesting, even though Vulcan women will meet with humans as well. She wants to go to school with Spock, who is an example for this competition. Unfortunately they can't choose Jeri Ryan. I like Ms. Park. Korean women (?) Doctors are possible. Have not separated other males except black people He is really favorite. Bakula wants to find his niche - in his strengths is the emotion and willingness to do everything. Of course he is big and strong enough to be a hero. Heaven is ok even if I don't like makeup.
