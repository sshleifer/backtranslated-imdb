This is a comedy that once was and compares this to the two remake games, THE MONEY PIT and we are finished, pointing out that the 40s movie makers have a talent for comedy which has disappeared as well. <br /> <br /> I am 15 years old when I see this for the first time and even at that tender age I can still laugh. Now, of course, I'm familiar with the frustrations of adults. I see a lot of things I missed when I was a child. <br /> <br /> All three main actors ... Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas ... have Complete interaction But the main content of the movie is in the disappointment found in achieving dreams. It has never been easy and without complications that are not visible like a single picture. <br /> <br /> All of this is a classic comedy that still stands above the effort to create it.
