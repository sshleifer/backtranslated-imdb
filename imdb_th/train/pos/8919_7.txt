Who would think of Andy Griffith's "Helen Crump" (Aneta Corsaut) with Steve McQueen in her past? But that is just one of many strange and wonderful things about teenage movies - the fight - the most alive in the 50s, which may be best described when Rebel Without A Cause matches what God knows from outside the world. The rebels are Steven McQueen. (Which will soon decide that "Steve" sounds less hypocritical). Good children who are fierce enough to be interesting The girlfriend who understands the great benefits is Aneta Corsaut mentioned. It's not good enough when the day they were interrupted by the heat of the teenage roaders. But they don't say much when they find gelatin. What is the person eating it that rides down to the ground on a hot meteor - right and left. But do adults believe them? Of course not. What do they know? They are just children. <br /> <br /> This movie is the most dominant. Actors use a script that is quite pretentious, with many looking into each other's eyes and supporters who "adults" may say "kids!" The third or more sentence But the true happiness of this film is that the imaginary creatures were executed and often created surprising surprises. And although it is obvious that it is cheap (Let's look at those tiny outfits!) The BLOB is a well-made movie - and has a small song. A crowd of 40 people (myself) will enjoy this movie as a nostalgia. But that would not prevent them from honking with the younger scenes that were sensitive in the 1950s, both made from milk and white. Excellent choice for watching movies in the family or "Adults Only" that are more complex Make delicious gelato cubes to watch movies! Gary F. Taylor or GFT or Amazon Reviewer
