A story about four teenagers growing up in California. Jeanie (Jodie Foster) is the highest-level leader - but wants to move away from her home where she lives with her divorced mother (Sally Kellerman). Cherie Currie is addicted to alcohol and bad boys and being beaten by her father Madge (Marilyn Kagan). There are too many parents to protect. Deirde (Kandice Stroh) thinks she is more mature than others. <br /> <br / > This is not a new story from I have graduated from high school in 1980 (when I watched this movie for the first time) and I was surprised by the reality. They get the conversation, clothes and the right attitude. Even the main song of the movie ("On the Radio" by Donna Summer) is a hit song previously. This film inspires me more difficult than other movies because I can understand and relate to the characters. I know that girls in high school are like this! This movie is a date (of course), but it's a timer that we will never see again. <br /> <br /> The performance is good in everything, with Foster giving the best performance. The relationship between her and Kellerman (Excellent) is real and very well done. Even Scott Bio (Who plays a small role as a girl friend) plays as a teenager more or less <br /> <br /> a very good movie - necessary viewing if you are aged 1980. This movie has a proper R rating (With the use of drugs and very swearing) but every teenager should see me 8 items
