This is the only movie I have ever seen Prince, but it's not important. And I think he's great in singing only boys. I'm wrong This may be his best performance. Great music That is the reason why it won the Oscar in 1984 for the best song for the movie. (Or something like that) now he has an Oscar and a Grammy under his belt Although the curse will approach the film (Just make sure there are no children or in the room) There is not much to say without revealing the plot You should go outside to get this movie. Your collection isn't perfect unless you get this movie. What else can I say except to go and get this movie now!
