Some people like "The Aristocrats" and others hate it. Often walking in the middle of the reaction to Eddie Izzard is not that extreme - if you can deal with the comedian Homo. (Who says he likes women) and has a vocabulary that allows us to say that using the word "f" in which his program is sufficient Will be a long beep if presented on a television network. Many Izzard fans are so dedicated that they do not see any flaws in their performance. On the other hand, I think this program is sometimes flat than Izzard's chest, but more often than not funny and definitely hilarious. He has a way to connect references from regular work early in the show and later on a regular job. He is not a storyteller. He is not a joke maker. He's not a dreamer like Robin Williams. He plays with some ideas, works, and something which is a routine of cable cars in San Francisco and Alcatraz is not perfect. However, he has a graceful way of moving through the falling and expanding things connected. I also gave this show 7 and may be persuaded to upgrade to 8, but is 10? No way.
