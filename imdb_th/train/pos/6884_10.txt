The miracle of this film is one of the movies that have a long-lasting effect on you. I have read reviews from angry people that I think are Republicans or ball strikers and words. Extremists talk about the power of movies that will confront people with the darkest secrets. There is no art that combines laughter and tears into me before and that is the miracle of the movie. The realism of Brett Carr's movies and performances should not be missed. The nature of interactive effects almost makes people leave the theater, whether they are free or questioning their identity. Cheers to the next level of cinema.
