I don't care if the bad purple rain reviews will get this movie! Great movies have everything, great music (Prince of coarse!), Romance and drama. <br /> <br /> This is a very sad movie. I don't want to say anything more than this. Have told this But I would say - this movie is very realistic, there are many romantic relationships that go through these problems. Appeared in the movie I see this as being very real and very true, making the movie more moving. My generation likes this movie more. Many of us love the prince very much and are involved with teenagers who have similar problems. <br /> <br /> Saying that it's not just movies for teenagers, Id recommend All age groups And it's not dark. This movie has great music, a band scene and sexy fun scenes between Prince and Apollonia.
