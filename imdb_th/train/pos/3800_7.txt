The world of dragon hunters is a world that defies 3-dimensional gravity. Asteroids, parts, buildings and strange flat plants float in the atmosphere while the ground goes to most characters that fall down. It's a world that reminds of Neverending Story when nothing comes to eat the world. <br /> <br /> Funny enough. The villain here is the World Gobbler too. This time, it's a huge skeleton skeleton with eyes. Flare Heroes are quiet warriors. But is an annoying and greedy partner who manages both entrepreneurial and useless animals They were joined by the most talkative little girl in the world, where my disappointment didn't die with terrible pain and hope to die soon. <br /> <br /> Great animation. The sound and sound are top marks. Unfortunately, the story is as simple as anyone can imagine. They stop the Gobbler world. They arrive at him almost immediately. They defeat him at the end. There is no real character development or distorted story. Not even what I expected from a movie with this plot. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: It's a lovely thing to watch. Children may enjoy it. Depth to this world (did not mean to)
