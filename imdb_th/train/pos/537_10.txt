For me, A Matter of Life and Death is just the best movie ever created. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, it will make the class worse. It is a stimulating thought provoking mirror to the post-war world and the relationship between people. <br /> <br /> Films are amazing and the effects of monochrome and technical mix to emphasize the work of the world Different perfectly The characters and plot development are close to perfection and attention to detail helps to foster the imaginative beliefs. <br /> <br /> No matter how many times I watch the movie - and I watch it. So much - it never fails to touch me. It makes me smile. It makes me laugh. It makes me think it makes me cry. Today it was as fresh as it was in 1946. <br /> <br /> If I allow one movie to be collected and watched again, A Matter of Life and Death will be that movie.
