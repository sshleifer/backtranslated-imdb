"The Mother" is a strange, low-cost movie with at least two uncomfortable content that is often not explored in the cinema: denying the mother's love for their son and daughter. <br /> Scary characters: May is an obnoxious old woman and I believe that it is impossible to feel any sympathy or grief for her. She confessed that she did not love the son and Lou. Her young She was unfaithful to her husband twice. She stole the love of her daughter, not protecting her from ungodly men who didn't love her. But just because she felt him with him She tried to organize her life after losing her husband in the worst way possible, destroying the daughter's delusion. Her daughter Paula is a fragile loser who accepts her life the way it is. Bobby, her brother, is the one who lost savings because his wife, who insists on having her shop, is a truly scary business. Darren is a comedian who doesn't like anyone, even him. <br /> <br /> The performance and direction are great: actors and actors have outstanding performances and directions that are very accurate. I like this movie But I remember that it is suitable for a specific audience. My rating is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Recome√ßar" ("Restart")
