When I was a kid, I watched many times and I remember whistling the song "Happy Cat" quite often. All the songs were really wonderful and memorable, unlike many children's musicals that were stuck in there without Real reason Extravagant scenes and costumes and performances performed very well, which is not surprising considering the actor Christopher Walken is a person who likes cats so much and doesn't want silly makeup or cat costumes for viewers to believe he is a cat that transform human And Jason Connery is so cute as the son of Miller, shy and shy. Corin falls in love with the beautiful and brave Vera princess. This is a really long and fun movie that is not like most fairy tales. Some of my favorites are when Puss makes Corin pretend that he drowned. At the ball when everyone starts dancing, dance as it is "International anger"; When Walken is in the dance kitchen on the table (He is also a good dancer!); And when Vera tells everything that Corin did when she was young, she pretended that she was Miller's daughter. I recommend this movie to children and parents who love magic and fairy tales. And it is a movie that you can watch together because it will not make adults stand up on the wall
