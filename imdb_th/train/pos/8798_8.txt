I will not praise the short film of IÃ±arritu, even if I'm a Mexican and proud of his achievements in the mainstream Hollywood. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I see that most reviews focus on their stories. he Favorite short films (not given), but we forget that there is a delicate bottom line that gathers all the circles and maybe it is not satisfactory for the American people. (Although that is not the main purpose of the manufacturer) <br /> <br /> What I'm talking about is that most short films do not show the suffering that the WASP people walked through because of the terrorist attacks in September. 11 But the suffering of others <br /> <br /> Do you want evidence about what I say? Look in the Bosnian short film. The message is: "You cry because people who die in the tower, but we (The Others = Eastern Europeans) are crying for a long time for crimes committed against our women and nobody is interested. We're like the whole world has done for you. "<br /> <br /> Although the story of Burkina Fasso is more funny. But with the same thoughts: "You are angry because Osama Bin Laden punches you in evil ways, but we (other people = African) should be more angry because our people are dying from hunger, poverty and AIDS a long time ago and nobody cares about us like the whole world has done for you. "<br /> <br /> Look at Sean Penn now: The fall of the Twin Towers makes men happy. (And alienated), so the message is power and greed (The symbol of the tower) must fall to allow people to see the sunrise and the flowers bloom. It is worth noting that this wonderful bottom line has been proposed by Americans. There is a lot of irony in this short film that is about to be overthrown. <br /> <br /> Well, Ken Loach (knows because of his ideology against capitalism) is very clear and unscrupulous to go straight to the point: "You are angry because your country has been attacked by evil forces, but we (others = Latin America) have suffered on a similar day, some of the worst things, and no one remembers our grief. When the whole world has done it for you, br /> <br /> It's like the creativity of this project wants to speak to Americans: "Do you see America? You are not the only person who became a victim of violence in the world. Be alone in your pain And by the way that we (other people = non-American people) suffer more than you long ago, so we live together with you in your pain ... and by the way we Sorry for You taste your own medicine. "There are only short Mexican and French movies that show sympathy and sympathy for Americans. Others are like slapping the face of the American state. That's not equal to the American people.
