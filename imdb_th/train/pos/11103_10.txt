"The Godfather" of the television, but apart from the acclaim and the gangster, both are nothing. Tony Soprano was forced to go to a psychiatrist after a panic attack. His psychiatrist knows that Tony is part of two families - in one family, he is a loving father. But still not perfect in the husband and in other families, he is brutally intelligent After the analysis, Dr. Melfi concludes that Tony's problem came from his mother, Livia, who is suspected of having personality disorders. Gandolfini is regarded as the main character, but Bracco and Marchand are not at all. Known for their equal and talented performances as psychiatrists and moms, respectively. Falco, Imperioli and DeMatteo were praised for their excellent support roles. Van Zandt (from E-Stree t) played his first and only role as Tony's best friend and was quite convincing and a fairly good person. Chianese, the only recurring actor who appeared in the movie Godfather, played as Tony's uncle and Nemesis, both outside and outside, many fans still enjoy the characters played by Pastore, Ventimiglia, Curatola, Proval, Pantoliano, Lip, Sciorra and Buscemi. Tony's children are "okay" but not amazing. (Except Iler's remarkable performance in the third episode to the last episode "The Second Coming"); Sirico and Schirripa are unreliable and unbeatable. But the performance was too strong for them to hold it. Although the show will continue for more than six seasons But there are still boring or unpredictable moments. <br /> <br /> **** (out of four)
