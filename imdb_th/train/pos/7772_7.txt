Drama and artificial situations There are at least two great movies with characters that have drinking problems: "The Lost Weekend" (1945) with the amazing performances of Ray Milland and "Days of Wine and Roses" (1962) with performances at The excellent Jack Lemmon of Robert Stack has a reasonable performance and the motivation of his character for drinking is shallowness and ancient thinking. In the end, remembering "Written on the Wind" is only fun and never qualified to be nominated for an Academy Award. My rating is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Palavras ao Vento" ("Words in the Wind")
