It's a relief to know that I didn't think of this program! The conclusion from the taxman is great. I remember finding it haunted and didn't watch the family, especially I had to be 10/11 at the time I watched. I think that for women, the age of part of the attraction is the blonde hair of lead and his tragic condition permanently. That theme was played on the flute that I remember - even though I didn't remember how it was. I think the preface shows that he played it - or maybe he played the flute on the list and especially when he was sad? Maybe I don't know if it will end or watch clips or listen to music. But at least now I know that it's not just me
