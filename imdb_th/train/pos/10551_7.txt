Typing ride, nothing last. "What will happen?" The festival is presented by Vincenzio Natali and starring David Hewlitt and Andrew Miller as two losers. One is having a relationship problem, canning from his job. (Because of relationship problems) and the police went out to pick him up (Because of his work and his relationship problems) another man is agoraphobic who refuses to go out and meet an annoying girl who demands that her mother claim that she was attacked when he didn't buy it Cookies from him Oh, yes, the police, too. After Scout's mother called them to arrest him, <br /> <br /> Today's men <br /> <br /> If you can, How can all this be lost? That is all the evidence behind 'nothing'. Two fools realize that scouts, girls, cars, lawns, roads, everything ?? Lost nothing except the white space! This is an interesting concept that I think. I still watch the time of this story. 30 minutes have gone in the movie and I still have one hour in the movie. Can 2 actors do this job and entertain us for 60 minutes? Although the actor tried for 60 minutes for a long time and had clearly died in the film's location But the two actors who are friends who have known each other for a long time and the director have a wonderful song that is fun to watch the dialogue and improve the performance of the second round. There are many supernatural elements. But their response to these elements eventually makes this film worth watching.
