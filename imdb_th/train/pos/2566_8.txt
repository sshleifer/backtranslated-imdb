Any movie related to positive stubbornness is a movie that today's audiences should see because the message and morals of the story are relevant as long as we have a world full of stubbornness. <br /> <br /> In addition, this movie is a love story that is really outdated .. The boy meets a young girl, a deceased girl ... The boy is back as a girl ... <br /> <br /> The weakest role reaches Ken. City Mith in the end is General Gen. Webster (Riccardo Montalban for the last second) ... My question will be how he used to be a 3-star general ... This character is scary. In front of him Soldiers' wives and subordinates are astonished that they show any respect. <br /> <br /> Brando's southern accent is too little and some scenes have a few holes. But overall I enjoy the movie every time I see <br /> <br /> The red button is great ... I always like to see comedians in amazing roles ... just like in In the case of Button, often comedians are able to convey the tragedy of a person better than the traditional actress.
