Orson Welles tried to knock my ass all the pictures I saw. The Lady of Shanghai is at the same level as his other masterpieces. The Magnificent Ambersons, the Touch of Evil, The Trial and Chimes at midnight. Go a little too fast However, it doesn't matter. You can't watch Welles movies and try to focus too much on the story. His direction is a good direction. Almost every scene from this movie can track other scenes that he directed. Check the scene in the courtroom. Usually they are stock scenes that I can't tolerate. To the point, try listening to the words of Welles near the end of the Compulsion in the Lady from Shanghai. Just pay attention to the level of detail in the courtroom scene. See the jury that sneezes and interrupts the trial. Or just watching the light in that scene I know that it is just a normal blind, and it has been used continuously in noir movies and crime movies of that time. The conversation is also amazing. Wales has the skills, skills that no one has done to create a crime movie with the greatest poetry examples. Whether he speaks to Shakespeare or splits the boiled wire, it has the power to stimulate the soul. 10/10
