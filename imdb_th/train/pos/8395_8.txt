*** Spoiler *** *** Spoiler *** This is the best Rainer Werner Fassbinder movie ever, and even though it is a great screenplay, Hanna Schygulla started the movie. With Maria (Schygulla) and Hermann Braun (Klaus Lowitsch) just getting married when the bombs continued to decline and Hermann was sent out to the war era. Today and Maria and her mother and sister have survived. Maria decides to take a job as a dancer / prostitute in a service club with the American GI, and she meets a black army soldier named Bill. (Greg Eagles) and they started to see each other firmly Maria heard that her husband, Hermann, died in the war, so she was serious about Bill. But one day, while closer to the bill, they saw Hermann at the door. He didn't die and when he entered the room, the battle took place and Maria broke the bottle on Bill's head and he died. Hermann accepted the sentence, and he was sentenced to a long prison term. So come to him and say that she will succeed in something and take him out. The war ended and Germany had to build a new one on the train. Maria met Karl Oswald (Ivan Desny), a successful textile businessman, and she used her charm to find work. Maria is determined to do well and climb the corporate ladder and become Carl's woman. She told him that she would not marry him, but he loved her. Hermann left the prison. But went to Canada to try everything that Maria had done since he was trapped. <br /> <br /> ***** Alert Spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> One day, Carl died and left Maria everything he wanted and Maria bought her own house. Eventually, Hermann returned home with his wife and they were ready to start them. They were married even though they had been married for a while. But Maria left the gas on the stove and the house exploded. Both were still there. <br /> <br /> There are many interesting things in this movie, one of the movies that can be studied and talked about. This story has a good length, as in the movie Fassbinder. The use of that color is very interesting. When the movie began to have brown and gray tones to represent the war that took place in Germany. But when Maria became successful, they changed into bright colors such as red and white. Germany's new building with all the construction sounds used as a backdrop, and the film still focuses on the exploits of Maria Fassbinder, not wanting the sound of a new creation to remind us of what happened in Germany at that time. Schygulla has never been better, and her performance is the key to the success of this film. With fewer actors, this is just another interesting movie, but Schygulla is so strong that her performance raises the film to a great state. Schygulla shows that Maria is very determined and intelligent. But at the same time, she uses beauty and femininity to get what she wants. She is not shy and does not feel guilty about this, and Fassbinder wants to show that Maria is a woman who sells her soul for survival. Schygulla was not nominated for an Academy Award. But she has a great performance which will be a proof of time. Fassbinder himself appeared in this film as a peddler and Lilo Pempeit. His mother played Frau Ehmke. I have heard many things about the end of this movie and Related to whether Maria intended to leave the gas or not Later in the bathroom, she was using water on her wrist and she seemed to be sad. This is just speculation and if you think I'm wrong, please email me. I think she was so excited that Hermann was at home and left it unintentionally. (Can you remember that she wears the clothes without reason?) When it comes to reading for her, she knows that Hermann and Karl are friendly, without knowing, and I think she feels everything. She does not have the advantage. That is the reason for the bathroom scene. So when the house exploded accidentally But I think the reason that Fassbinder had such an end was to show that anyone who sold their spirits would not have a business. Fassbinder was intrigued by the survivors. But he was incredibly passionate In his view, Maria cannot have both methods. Interesting movies
