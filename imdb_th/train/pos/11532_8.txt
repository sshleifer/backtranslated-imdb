This is one of the movies that I can't catch and it's good enough for me to record when it appears next time ... If like me, you will enjoy the horror movie in the 80's that is slightly separated From the norm (that's not just the sequel of the ordinary), I think you should enjoy it. Finally, when the bad guy appears, he is not what I expect to see! Overall, I won't go out of your way for this game. But if you like the genre, then watch if it happens and you have one and a half hours to kill. I guess I'll give 6.5 out of 10.
