I grew up watching this movie and I still love it a lot today as when I was a kid. Do not listen to critic reviews. They are not correct in this film. Eddie Murphy shines for you. You can sit with your family and everyone will enjoy it. I recommend this movie for everyone to see. It is a comedy that has imaginative imagination with powerful dragons and little bald children with God. This film takes you from LA to Tibet to a breathtaking view of the magical temples of mountains in Tibet Beautiful view! So please make yourself good and grab this! You won't regret it!
