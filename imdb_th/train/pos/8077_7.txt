Movies created for contemporary audiences People will see what they want to see, action, comedy, drama and charming scenes as well. This is not a movie that anyone can feel comfortable with when they are with the family. It is not for the eyes of the children. I have to move forward in many scenes. <br /> <br /> If it's just the entertainment that you are looking for, the music that I need to add extravagant production. br /> <br /> However, the film's message is not universal. It emphasizes the mind of karma. That is, if you do well, you will be good. And if you do evil, you will receive evil The result of goodness is good while the consequences of evil are evil. <br /> <br /> In real life, this is not always true. It is well known that most people do not receive justice in this world. While it is true that some of the wicked people meet with an evil end, many people escape. Then there are many people who do good, and on the other hand, they find a sad end. <br /> <br /> If you don't care about the message and everything you need is escape from the world. real This movie is an entertainer.
