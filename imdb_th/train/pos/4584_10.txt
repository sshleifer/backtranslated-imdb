I have never seen Chan's movies in all matters, but this is the best story I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There's nothing really special in the story. Do not go deep into that. What makes it special is fighting tactics, good performances, warm humor. This movie has a fierce beat along the way, and you are just stunned when you see it. Cool stunts (Of course by Jackie himself) makes you want to jump around on the couch and scream. It's great! Even my mother was impressed with this great movie when she saw <br /> <br /> I knew that police might be difficult to get booked. But I can assure you it's worth trying
