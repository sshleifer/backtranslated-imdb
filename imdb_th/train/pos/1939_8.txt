I don't know why I chose this movie to see it. It has a strange name and from the description it looks like something different. Every time, while it's good to try a movie that is different from the Hollywood hero / thriller, and this film is definitely different. From the beginning, this movie made me amazed. But I can't figure out why this is the end of this movie when I know that this movie is very good because the characters are true. I think that acting is great and character development makes you interested in them and hope that things will come out well for them. I think everyone who looks at this movie may relate to one character and it makes it look good and laugh well with the actors. <br /> <br /> When you reach the climax of the movie, you will feel like Staying well for sure and being left with I am sure that this will attract attention and should be given the opportunity.
