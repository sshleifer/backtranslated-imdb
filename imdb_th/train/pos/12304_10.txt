This is a great movie. I like that climbing down to get his ink and skeleton to chase him. But fortunately he dodged them, opened the window Xiaoqian is also very beautiful as well. And when he stuck the needle up in Wu's mother's butt And when he said that love is the greatest thing in the world while standing between the two swords is excellent too Then, as he eats his bread while watching men kill a lot of people You will then see him chanting poetry as he runs to escape the wolf. The romantic love scene, Xiao Qian and Ning look cute together. Add time to the giant tongue cartoon and you have a funny romantic horror all at once. Not to mention the excellent special techniques for the 90s.
