Gerard is a writer with a rather exaggerated imagination. He is also a homosexual, and Catholics tend to feel guilty of Catholics and have clairvoyance or it seems. In the journey to Flushing, he was 'seduced' by Christine. When he discovered that Christine's new boyfriend was a rough trade, he often thought from a distance, he decided to be stuck. In the end, forced love is rewarded. Then he realized that Christine's three husbands had died before that. Christine kills them or not, and he or Herman's girlfriend will be 'The fourth man' or not? Verhoeven's exaggerated poem is a combination of Hitchcock and David Lynch filled with OTT and religious imagery and red colors. Many times it looks and feels like a dream and we cannot be sure that what we see is real or part of Gerard's imagination. The fun is finding it out. The fact that Christine is a more likable character than one that Gerard or Herman's hypocrisy means that we hardly like to take root for a man above her. In fact, it's fair to say that Gerard's arrival cannot come soon. Great performances as well from Jeroen Krabbe and Renee Soutendijk and Verhoeven's best movies easily to the great masterpiece of Sci-Fi "Starship Troopers".
