Probably one of the most fun movies in the material world. Oscar Trey Parker and Matt Stone are hilarious and before you see this, I suggest you watch "South Park", one of the cartoons created Buy now. You will laugh every time you see. Pure rhythm of genius If you don't think it's funny, then you won't have spirit or humor. 10 out of 10
