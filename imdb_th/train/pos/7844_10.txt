I love this show as much as reading books and each chapter makes you want more. It makes you think about what will happen in the next episode and trying to maintain their friendship over the years. After each ending, it will have a bitter, sweet taste in your mouth. Know: One - acting is good. You can't wait for the next episode and it makes you think that actually happens to friends and two - The fact that the program was placed "in a lost place" and we will not see the ending in all things Obviously, the fox didn't know what they were doing. They claimed that they were losing viewers in the categories 18 - 49. They do not know clearly that people want to see if they get rid of such good items I have one question, although I want to add If they will bring the show back and continue for another season, how will each episode be performed in a year, and that story depends on what happened in the last twenty years? Your answer is most welcome. Reunite! Reunite!
