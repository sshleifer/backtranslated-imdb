I rarely write reviews, so I will speak my opinion. <br /> <br /> I love this series at first. Adventure, action, comedy, drama ... I think it's great. Anderson, Knock, Shanks, Davis ... I love them all. Davis seems to be the fifth most important person in the blog. Not a big deal. But when his character (General Hammond) debuted at the end of the seventh season and Anderson's character. (Colonel O'Neill) moved from the field to the quality office of the series falling from the cliff. I don't know if it's because Hammond is more important than what I know or what. But for some reason, after the seventh season, the series changed to **** <br /> <br /> The first seven seasons Although it's great The movie Stargate looks normal in the first time I saw it. But it turns out that although this is not the original intention But it's a great scene for the series I suggest you watch the movie first, then watch the first season of the TV series, then watch the movie again. (You will be appreciated by the second time. Believe me.) Then watch the rest of the TV series. <br /> <br /> The last three seasons of the series are not as good as Seven. first But that doesn't mean it's not good It means that they are falling if you lose the first seven seasons. <br /> <br /> After you finish this series, don't forget to watch the Spin Stargate: Atlantis as a worthy successor. Following this great series <br /> <br /> Edit on 7-18-08: I just found that Don S. Davis died a few weeks ago. It's a big loss.
