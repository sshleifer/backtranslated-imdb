If this film has been improved, it will depend on the best of Astaire and Rogers. As it is a good movie But for too long, with a boring subplot, Randolph Scott, who loves Rogers' sister, played by Harriet Hilliard (that is, the wife of Ozzie Nelson and the baby boomers you love). Scott is two sailors. Scott found Hilliard for the first time when she looked like a stereotypical librarian and later after Ginger Rogers asked her friend. At the same time, Astaire tries to choose where he and his old dance partner go out. The result is an excellent dance figure, with Astaire and Rogers as a team and separated: "I put all my eggs in one basket." "Let Yourself Go" and "I will be the leader. Iliad has sweetness. But slightly lethargic when Jane became a glamorous girl even though she sang two of her songs well "But where are you?" And "Get Thee Behind Me, Satan" - One poster doesn't care about that song. But I love the lively Rogers name and the young Astaire is a dynamo Of course! One of the best games Roger and Astaire made. In that they are a clear example of the 30s charm and imagination It is true that it will be appreciated and viewed over and over again.
