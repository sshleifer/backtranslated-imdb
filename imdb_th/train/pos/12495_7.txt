What's good about it: a truly creative and creepy little effect that will be under the skin of the most experienced horror fan. Do not rely on the soundtrack that was pierced during the "gotcha" period. Even if you have seen everything, there is still something in this movie that will cause your jaw to fall. <br /> <br /> Things That should happen about it: the performance is sometimes flat and unreliable, it has "shot-on-video" quality in some places (although most will get the ambience of commitment) and camera operation That is full of incompetent actions Meaning closely Although the effects are truly creepy But I think it might go well too sometimes The ending seems to hasten and defuse the moment that has more impact. The audience was left to think of many things for themselves, not a challenge from the filmmakers. But because they just missed it <br /> <br /> It's still a good indie horror movie just a few steps away. Higher than average Worth the rental
