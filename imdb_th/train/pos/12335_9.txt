Warning: There are repetitive plot spoilers and in many cases, horrible performances. Fontaine is excellent. But some people, especially Ivy's husband, Richard Ney, are very much made of wood. Ney is in bed, dying from arsenic poisoning, along with every hair Yet the movie was so juicy and wondering. Faithful to books than most movies of that time. Actress Joan Fontaine as a poison (And a woman who commits adultery, which is shocking at that time - I am not kidding) is a good rhythm She was just Joan Fontainey as usual. When the murderer should die, she dies by falling. "The most foot through the floor into the empty space"
