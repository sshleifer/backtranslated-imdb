This picture came out in 1975 and is the second time in the three-part series in the life of Sheriff Buford Pusser. Rob Svenson plays the sheriff Buford Pusser and Luke Askew plays the final Mobster Pinky Dobson, where we see Sheriff Pusser. In the hospital bed after he and his wife were killed in driving on Sunday morning after Pusser revived, he pursued a man who killed his wife. Pusser was able to complete his revenge. Prolonged or not a group of people trying to take him out before he could succeed. The only thing that distracted me about this picture is that this is true. How do you leave the city with this type of crime and haven't done anything about it? Since there are no real actors in this picture, I can't give 10 Mongoose stars, but I can give 8
