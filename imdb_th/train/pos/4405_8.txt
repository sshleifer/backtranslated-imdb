The war between the United States may be the darkest hour in American history. The war that caused the brother to deal with brothers and family to the family and left a scar even today is still not well recovered and in all possibilities will not happen. And in any matter about any war other than any historical significance, it is a personal discord behind the more controversial that creates emotional thrust that makes it relevant to It is a human element that shows the context that is needed to get a perspective, which is directed by Ang Lee in the drama "Ride With the Devil", a civil war in which he focuses on personal travel in the image of a wide war. up And along the way, including the examination of one of the most brutal chapters of the war, the infamous Lawrence Kansas attack by Quantrill and his invaders, who succeeded him in making a rather formal presentation from the perspective of The Confederate <br /> In 1863, the Union had a far greater influence in Kansas and even across the border in neighboring Missouri. Those who were loyal were finding it difficult. Users will resist the encroachment upon the particular. Help in what may be considered a normal coalition force And when things began to heat up around their own cities, Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich) and Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) formed their own band and joined the fight to damage the union wherever they could. Jack Bull and Jake don't like war and don't like killing But they are standing for what they believe is right. <br /> <br /> There are other people, even among themselves, men like Pitt Mackeson (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) who will use conflict as a vehicle for Personal benefits and nothing more than an excuse In order to show their own violent nature through unnecessary cruelty that has been done in many cases against innocent victims And for Jack Bull and Jake, as well as many others. Like them, it became a time when judgments, loyalty and morals would be greatly tested. The moment their spirits are angry with blood And they have to contend with their own demons in order to fight for unbeatable prices. <br /> <br /> As with all his movies, director Ang Lee comes close to his story through the tradition of examination. Culture Views and moral attitudes of people and the time he painted And in doing so, Lee gave a little understanding of his subject, in addition to the actual story, and eventually understood the motivations that pushed the characters and the drama they were involved in. Regardless of the traditions and customs associated with the relationship between his father and daughter (`Eat Drink Man Woman '), the impact of class differences (` Sense and Sensibility'), honor and code that warriors live and dead (`Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon ') or moral ambiguity caused by the lack of things above (` Ice Storm'). Lee penetrates his film with a thorough understanding of the human condition. This film is no exception and (as he did with all his movies), Lee presented his story with the help of an amazing movie. (In this film by Frederick Elm, who made Under the guidance of his poem, it is Lee's special touch, and it adds a feeling of longing and ponder to all that he has described as one of the elements that make his movie memorable. <br /> <br /> While Jake Toby Maguire started The feeling of youthful innocence with films that are effectively differentiated with the maturity that he later conveyed when the story developed and his character along with it. The most important thing is that Maguire responds with confidence and confidence in the events surrounding him, which increases the credibility of the film as a whole and reinforces the realism of the presentation: tolerance to death and news. Of those killed in various battles And fighting; The moral correctness that the person he met followed in even the most difficult times. Betrayal, which is because of the nature of the conflict, is almost normal. And loyalty and faith that he and his companions hold firmly All of this was something that Maguire had achieved through his performance, and it wasn't a little success. However, it is a type of practice that has been studied, which is often seen as an unfortunate matter. This kind of work is worth admiring and should be accepted. <br /> <br /> Skeet Ulrich is as powerful as Jack Bull and Jewel (in her first film). Such as Sue Lee Shelley. However, it was Jeffrey Wright, who featured in such a remarkable supporting role as Daniel Holt, including Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who brought the threat Like Christopher In addition to the number of roles that have a cameo (one scene), Mark Ruffalo left an indelible impression with very little screen time. <br /> <br /> The supporting actors include James Caviezel (John Black), Simon Baker (George Clyde), Tom Guiry (Riley), Tom Wilkinson (Orton Brown), John Ales (Quantrill), John Judd (Otto Roedel) and Kathleen Warfel (Mrs. Chiles). The civil war is a wide open wound. To the nation forever But hope that over time, it must be carefully considered by filmmakers such as Ang Lee and movies such as Ride With the Devil, which will help close the divide and promote healing In terms of recent events, it is very necessary around the world. The movie is a powerful medium. It may be education and entertainment, and in the future, more filmmakers such as Ang Lee will embrace and promote a sense of unity through a narrative of events and delicate attitudes that make us as we are 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
