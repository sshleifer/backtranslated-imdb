After being forced to sit with a true decorator (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl) - I enjoy watching "Fried Worms" for one time. I'm not guessing the ending! It's funny and fun, and doesn't use funny humor for my boys (6 and 10). Both of them both love it too - oh and my 45 year old "boy" has a smile on his face all the time. This is a family movie that is not acceptable for parents. The relationship with the brother is very close to real life. "He didn't stop singing just to annoy me !!" In addition, the way in which new children try to make friends and the reality of those friendships can happen correctly to the behavior of children. My mother has to do stupid things, but my favorite scene involves a father who is familiar with his new job. Happy!
