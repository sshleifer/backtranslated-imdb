My mother and I recently caught this drama recently laughing at our butt! I've only seen 10 episodes and I'm disappointed that I didn't pay attention to this hilarious series before they were canceled! The story is very funny, the character has a very good personality (or not much But they are still funny!) I'm TiVO. Every episode of what I like about Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth includes all the actors. Don't let me bored while watching! There are languages ​​that are not suitable for children and sexual content. But with a parent guide near you, you shouldn't have too many problems. There are some types of 'Friends' relationships that have attracted me to watch this program. I really enjoyed it.
