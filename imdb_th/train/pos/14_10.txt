This film has a special place in my mind when I catch it. First, I teach knowledge to adults. It's really loud for me and even the best students I have at that time. There are scenes that give you a glimpse of sudden emotions and scenes that make you smile by identifying the true identity of their characters and situations. <br /> <br /> Great performances by Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro Rated with their best work, Martha Plimpton's great work, young, inspiring stories.
