It may be because I have a lot of fear for hospitals and medical supplies. But this one is under my skin (forgive Pun). This brave piece of work is not afraid to rise to the top and is as satisfying as seen in revenge movies. Despise the screwdriver and sympathize with many "screwee" Some of my own memories still remember "Hellraiser" very well. But came out as a tribute instead of imitation It is a hard work that doesn't give the audience much consideration. But I enjoy being hurt from the movie once and for a while. This piece brings and does not show regret. I like this one a lot Do not watch while eating pudding.
