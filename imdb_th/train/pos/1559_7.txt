Smallville's special episode is probably the best episode of the broadcast since reunification. Here are several reasons. For example, it brings the series back to its roots. Welcome Lionel back from an unexpected long-term absence, with the Luthor Corp Plaza in Metropolis. This room has not been in Smallville for a long time, and when he saw it, brought back many memories from Smallville's past. Not to mention the conversation with Lionels and Lex is always admirable. <br /> <br /> Another delightful reward is Bart Allen (aka Impulse), AC (aka Aquaman) and Victor Stone (aka Cyborg). Steven Deknight not only reunited with the judges of justice But he blends them with the Smallville formula in a way that is unique, which almost feels like a feature length movie. <br /> <br /> From there you get Basic story. Green Arrow founded the league trying to bomb 33.1. Bart was captured. Clark rescued him and the factory was bombarded into the kingdom All is good and elegant, with a good combination of stealth, action, and wonder. Oh and Cyborg. There are new interesting upgrades for the Justice League :). <br /> <br /> The song may Is what makes it now work well If you remember correctly, the first episode that Steven Deknight directed was Agless from Season 4. This is a normal episode. But something happened outside Maybe it was a song or performance or the truth that Clark Sais end. "We can't find you. You meet us." Make people lose faith in the formula. But fortunately, Steve De Night has redeemed himself at this fair. <br /> <br /> I have doubts about the justice that made it short. The first 10 things are far beyond the reach of the Justice League. From The disclosure of Ridge facilities I mean, it would be cool if Green Arrow and Cyborg ride Oliver's bike. Clark and the impulse should run clearly and the sailors should swim through another path. But that was incredibly wonderful. It took 2 points out of 10. <br /> <br /> Second, the magic moment again isn't as bad as the first time. But when Green Arrow says "Go save the world". That makes me cringe. Overall, judging from performances, musical performances, directions and production values, the advantages of doing better than the disadvantages, and this is one of the best episodes in Smallville history and may be the 2nd best episode in Season 6> <br /> 7 of 10 ...
