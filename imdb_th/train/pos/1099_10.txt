Although recognized as the best movie to maintain the difficulty of building a house in the country (or buying) according to your specifications But not the first and last time in 1940. Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan are leaders in the comedy GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT here by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart and about fifteen years ago. Shelly Long and Tom Hanks are leaders. In THE MONEY PIT, the former is moving into a country house in the 18th century ... er want to work. The latter thing is to build your dream home - in the late 1980s, although both films will have their moments. But both are not as good as BLANDINGS, which is based on the autobiographical novel of the same name. <br /> <br /> Jim Blandings and his wife Muriel (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) notice the narrow corners of their apartments. He shared with her two daughters Joan and Betsy (Sharyn Moffett and Connie Marshall), although Blandings has a good income as an advertising executive (in 1948 he made $ 15,000.00 per year, which Like making $ 90,000.00 today) Each lives in a luxury apartment in New York City on that day - he felt that they should seek the greater good. He and Muriel drive into the country. (Connecticut) and soon found the ruins that both imagined can be solved like the dream home they want. <br /> <br /> And they both fall into the financial wormhole. Land acquisition and construction can lead to There is one thing that they are skeptical about the idea of ​​building a house like this: they fail to listen to warnings after warning with their brilliance. If their friends mock and Bill Cole's lawyers (Melvin Douglas in an extremely miserable role). For example, Jim buys land from a Connecticut dealer. (Ian Wolfe quietly drained his piece of meat) with a check before checking the correct price again for the land in Connecticut. The bill suggests that he paid more than five to six thousand dollars of land. There was a problem with the water supply that Blandings had never thought of, such as hard water and soft water - which led to the Zis-Zis water conditioning.

With their architects (Reginald Denny) unable to be left correctly with the decision of Muriel to create a new scene that no one planned. <br /> <br /> The increased cost of the project is a matter. One made Let Jim be enraged He was appointed to manage the account "Wham" ("Spam" has become a popular form of World War II in which the public began to use it as a meat instead. In its success against the armed forces), Jim could not understand. This matter (He was not alone - one or two executives fumbled before him). He came with the following "poem": (<br): <br /> <br /> "Little piglet <br /> <br /> He is pink and beautiful like a ham. <br /> <br /> He smiles in his music. <br /> <br /> When they give him an ax - <br / > <br /> He knew he would end up being "Wham"! "<br /> <br /> His secretary looked at him as though he needed a straight jacket when he read that jack. ! <br /> <br /> Jim is still more skeptical of Bill to Muriel's interest, even though (in this case) the bill is not perfect. But he is always close (Jim still forgot that Bill is a clear head and he protects Jim and Muriel from making many mistakes). All three have the best living accident when They were locked in a room in the second half of the house that was built like the one who went out all day. They could not open the door and Jim (in awe) tried to destroy the door by using ram to beat him. He divided the window and the door opened itself. <br /> <br /> This film worked very well.

The advertisement implies that the paint company has a variety of colors to choose from for your paint job. They are proud to call Loy "Mrs. Blanding" in introducing ads. You can imagine how Parnell is ridiculous to deal with the situation after Loy leaves him with the color team.
