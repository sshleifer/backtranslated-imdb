Couples (Janet and Richard) go out to camp in the forest near the giant swamp forest. After camping and enjoying nature, the couple stayed in what they thought was an abandoned farm house. Soon the prisoners escaped and appeared and after the inevitable delay of escape, they carried out rape of Janet and imprisoned Richard in a bird cage. <br /> <br / > This last house in the movie is like left. One of the least-rated horror movies ever. It was one of the more shocking early 70s. Moreover, I found this thing fascinating and beautiful in unusual tones. I love the evil of CAGED. Music gives a sense of personality to many movies and beauty. I found this movie quite creepy. <br /> <br /> Most of the shortcomings are related to the rhythm of the movie, which can be said that the film is rather slow and distracting. While I didn't care about walking because of the beauty and skepticism of this movie, I thought it would make most people The performance is not too good or there is no dialogue. At least in the first scene, this movie has a little more patience and not for everyone. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a good movie. Not the greatest horror movie I've ever seen. But it was definitely fun It's not the easiest movie to find. It is possible to find in the USED category of many stores if you look hard enough. It's not for everyone. But if you are a fan of the garbage cinema then it's worth checking out.
