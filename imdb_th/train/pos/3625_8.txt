This is the best picture about baseball since Redford languished The Natural in our own way. Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffith illuminate the screen with great stories and actors that look realistic enough Will draw you into life Gliff Griffith, actress, tea Australia, who was a native of West Texas, which is better than the people of Texas, I know. And Dennis Quaid is perfect? Play as winner, winner and humble person with psychological baggage as much as the average audience in the audience. It's true On-screen chemistry If you like baseball that is warm to the heart, you will love this movie. Ingredients for Americana and all apple pies are there. My popcorn becomes a la mode. <br /> <br /> And hey: buy a CD! Music contains many stories! Singing words and music makes the story move forward as it should be, an area that often disappointed me. <br /> <br /> Criticism: I will give baseball to others. But Quaid has something to teach us about personality and heart. St. Rita and nuns are good decorations. But they have never found their place in the matter that will be opened and closed around. They are a little long worth every minute of the final analysis. 8 / 10. <br /> <br />
