This is a great little movie with a good story that plays the most important role in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It's a fascinating and interesting story. The story is being told slowly. But this works well enough to create it. The character is good and is played by actors. Usually I am not a big fan of the Asian style of acting. But the performance in this movie is very good. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie is quite different in the way and style of other Western movies. In the way that this film progressed more than that in its own way, rather than the Western movies that were created in the same era. <br /> <br /> I only hope that this movie will have a slightly better visual style. For a movie that is considered an art house movie, this movie lacks certainty in certain scenes. Obviously this is a relatively cheap movie to be created. Not that it's a bad thing. But it prevents the film from being truly different and elevating itself to the top of the line. <br /> <br /> But oh well, this movie is about the story and the characters that were created well. . In this case, this movie will definitely not disappoint. <br /> <br /> 8/10
