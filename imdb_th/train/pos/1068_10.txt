I think Dark Angel is great! The first season was great and with a good plan with Max (Jessica Alba) as an escape X-5. The creation of Manticore tried to adapt to normal life but still "save the world" and was followed. Hunt from the mantle throughout the season, which makes the series more spice up. <br /> <br /> The second season, though, suddenly becomes strange when compared to the first time. The plot disappeared and the series lost a little charm, mostly because "Strange creatures" appear. Do not understand me wrong. The second season is good, but with a little "manticores", however, they can return to a new plot that is likely in the closing episode of Season 2, which I Hope to see more. <br /> <br /> So I hope they start to create episodes and with James Cameron behind this thing, it's not a mistake. So in conclusion I would say it's a great series. But I still hope for the third season!
