What can I say about the first movie? <br /> <br /> You can't rate this thing because it shouldn't be entertaining. But if you give a rating, you should give 10 points. It's amazing to see the animation from 1895. This is one of the most important movies in history I wonder how it will be one of those who saw the first movie. <br /> <br />
