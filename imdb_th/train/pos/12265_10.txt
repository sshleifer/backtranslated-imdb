"Tintin with me" first made me become a documentary film masterpiece. Photography and editing are truly remarkable. (Almost against Dogma) <br /> <br /> We followed the life of the Tintin Hergé drawer through an open interview from 1971. The Tintin series was painted on the background. Of the great ideological struggle of the twentieth century In the midst of these Hergé's own demons, fighting and drawing activities, they seem to try to tame and escape into the perfect world. <br /> <br /> Although there are beautiful photos Panoramas of the paintings from the album Tintin, including reconstructions and reading text from the album Hershey's story is completely told through interviews and archiving content and never passed the reconstructions. <Br / > <br /> Hergé is a true artist and suffering But the wonderful world that comes from his imagination will continue to make readers wonder.
