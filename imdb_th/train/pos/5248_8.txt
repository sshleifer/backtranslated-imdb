Okay, like many other movies produced by live dance. But Tim Meadows did a great job in creating a one-dimensional character for 3 minutes to become a character in a comedy that has moderate abilities. He dropped one of the surprisingly torpedoes at the right frequency. Billy Dee Williams was in there, even though his land days were long gone. Actually, it's not a great art work. But if you go into Wayne's world looking for Gone With The Wind, what are you doing wrong? Enjoy what it is .......
