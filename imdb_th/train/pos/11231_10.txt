I like the Star Trek Hidden Frontier. It's a great fan fiction movie series and I can't wait to see more. I just started watching this movie series last week and I wasn't enough. I advise others to watch as it's worth watching. I've watched each episode several times and are waiting to see more episodes. I rate it ten. But I think it deserves 12 loll. My compliments towards the staff of Star Trek Hidden Frontiers in a fantastic job. If you like Star Trek, I suggest checking this film on the trek.
