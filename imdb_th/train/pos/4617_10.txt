I am a fan of Jennifer Connelly since the phenomenon and after I heard about seven minutes in heaven I saw it as soon as I could. Movies are not just a joke, if you think that most of us are children and are going through not only But it's a great movie that is led by Jennifer, a phenomenon that attracts my attention And do it as a good proposal. I love it and have watched it over and over again and for those of you who enjoy a good laugh or love Jennifer Connelly, you can't delay watching this movie !!! !
