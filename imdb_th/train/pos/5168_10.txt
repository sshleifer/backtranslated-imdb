I'm a movie sucker like this A movie that will take you back and let you live again in your childhood. I am now grown and have many more responsibilities such as mortgages, children, dogs, wives and others. I enjoy my life. But it was not pure and worrying, as when I was twelve years old, Mike Binder's Summer India knew this and explored this thing like he was twelve years old. It takes you back in time when life is easier and more fun. It makes you go back in time when you are concerned about your first kiss and wonder if you can finish the race in the marathon camp. Indian Summer is a great movie and a movie that should be viewed at least annually. Times so you can sit back and laugh ... and remember <br /> <br /> movie stars Kevin Pollak, Bill Paxton, Diane Lane and Matt Craven (To name a few) as a childhood friend who was summoned back to Ta Makwa camp by Uncle Lung, advisor to their former camp leader, Uncle Lou. Perfectly played by Alan Arkin, he is the type that Is the master of the group He all knows and combines the true spirit of the father and the person who understands the simple things in life. He had a difficult time with today's children who needed a Walkman that was ringing in the ears when they were in a beautiful place like Tamakwa. This is a camp with a horse wandering through the leaves changing colors that God gave them. He and the water as far as the eye can see, Uncle Lou, longing for the old days and asking the former, who set up his camp, return to the camp to see if one of them will enter the camp. While they are together again, we will see their trials and tribulations and maybe new love may happen between them. <br /> <br /> When adults come back to their camp Shortly before they acted like children again while playing pranks in general camps, playing over and over again. They brought toilet paper from the toothpaste stall that was put in the sleeping bag and so on. All of this was fun and with actors like Pollack and Paxton, it was very funny. <br /> <br /> But apart from the hilarity, we have explored the true emotions of adults that anyone can do. In one of my favorite scenes, Kevin Pollak and Elizabeth Perkins saw the bay where they had been canoeing like children. Pollak couldn't understand how small it was. And in the end, Perkins told him that the bay was not smaller, they were bigger It is not the point of returning home. But it's done thoroughly All of us grow up, all of us move forward, and all of us are unfortunately unable to live like 20 years ago. The more things change, the more they remain. br /> <br /> Indian Summer is a movie with characters as characters, and it is beautifully written by Mike Binder who really participates in Camp Camp Tamakwa (eg Sam Raimi, the Stick player in the movie) and it is Lovely and bright memories. From his experience, he added fuel to the movie. There are many impressive scenes and many funny scenes. Both are perfect. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. I love everything about it and it is a hidden gem. <br /> <br /> 10/10
