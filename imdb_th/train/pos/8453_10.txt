I can write a comment that is large enough for one of the characters in Gundam Wing. Each of them can lead the series with their internal conflicts, but we get 8 great leads that lead. We passed 49 episodes of anime-like happiness. <br /> <br /> There are conversations that you can spin around in your head for months ... for many years, a new meaning from a writing masterpiece. Chapter (Although there is a general characteristic of having differences between subtitles and dubbing in English) it has many ideas and philosophies that make you think about your perspective. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the male Do not feel cold and cute female characters are the distinctive characteristics of this series. The relationship between Heero and Relena and Milliardo and Noin is a remarkable story. The apparent denial of the man was backed by internal turmoil that made love. (Words that have never been mentioned in the series) of women that are necessary for them in the harsh military environment Women are pursuing various aspects of men that we rarely see, which makes men who are all vocal leaders more suspicious than Heero. It takes 49 episodes to show concern. But he got there and when he did it, it was a big reward. <br /> <br /> There was a battle with a giant robot. Enjoy watching great sequences and great Hollywood fighting scenes. Those who do not participate will clearly see the battle of the giant robot as a stupid function cartoon for children when I try to recommend this series to my friends, but they are wrong. Many giant robots that fight Gundam Wing have many pathos, usually involving young rebels fighting for what they believe against oppressed societies. In each episode, Gundam Wing is impossible to be boring. It is an attractive and thoughtful idea that studies the potential of human body and mind.
