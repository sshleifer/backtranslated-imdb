The stack should receive an Academy Award for this performance. It's a crime that he didn't do. Amazingly, how did he make humans have many worthless personalities? <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone won an Academy Award that deserves from her performance. In fact, all the performances in this film are excellent. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a taxi ride, then take a plane and continue with an emotional ride that will keep you interested. You will be entertained! <br /> <br /> However, this is just a 100 percent diaper opera. You may call it the best diaper because the show wins over the material. Performed well, directed well But strictly in its soap type I will not call it melodrama (such as "Mildred Pierce" or "imitate life"). While not denying the great entertainment value of this film, you can imagine that talented actors and directors. How could this person succeed?
