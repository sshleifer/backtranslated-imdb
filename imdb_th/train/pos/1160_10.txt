It's fun. It's not Arthur Miller or T.S. Elliot. But this guy is funny. Kline and Fields are great. "God, you are very nasty" as she climbed in his window - wonderful! Kline is running into the goal after scoping Teri Hatcher - great! He knows who she really is ... TV drama, if everyone has <br /> <br /> The scene is nearing the end of the Chinese dining area, with my children and I roll on the floor - that scene just like The same is worth the rental price. <br /> <br /> Didn't solve any world problems or show weaknesses that seem to be the daytime of the TV (I hope).
