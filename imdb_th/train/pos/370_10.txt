I have watched this movie at least fifty times and after watching it last week for the first time in a long time, I still feel strongly about it. <br /> <br /> The story itself is incredible. Best performers including Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover and Margaret Avery Akosua Busia deserve an Academy Award nomination for Nettie's short but powerful portrayal. <br /> <br /> You will experience every human emotion while watching this movie. I laughed, cried and angry. As well as the best movies, educational institutions nominated But didn't win But this movie is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time.
