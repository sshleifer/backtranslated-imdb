The film is directed by Victor Nunez, the screenwriter (Ulee's Gold). Good and straightforward writing was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award by looking at Ruby's daily life. What we see is part of the life of Ruby. Young woman Ashley Judd (sister) won the Best Actress Award from an independent chapter. Ruby started to live on her own and created her own identity. She explores jobs, friendship, male friends, sex, searching for young girls in general. This film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. As an independent film enthusiast, I chose this movie because of Sundance. I appreciate this type of film because it doesn't contain Hollywood's luggage. <br /> <br /> Although the story is completely different. The next movie is part of the daily life of the general people. I like it. The story is very well told and all we have to do is sit and enjoy the story. The only thing I'm not sure about is the title. I'm sure there are not many insects and fly to heaven like in Florida. While I'm allergic to mosquitoes, Florida is not a paradise for me, I still think about Florida. I turned to boiling completely red. I recommend this movie! Favorite scene: Ruby and her friend Rochelle Bridges, played by Allison Dean, walk at the beach in Panama City, Florida. Of course, the beach is very white. I have been there. Quotes like: "The necessity is always a good excuse." "Everything that is fussing about finding men is not different now. Who will be and when and why?" <br />
