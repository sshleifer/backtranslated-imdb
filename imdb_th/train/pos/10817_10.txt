This movie is probably one of the most scary movies I've ever seen. The effect is terrible. You just have to laugh and the show has to say that it doesn't have Mel Gibson. But Gary Browning, who played as a police officer, was terrible. He became a good person. I don't know. But he, he made this movie by himself, is 10. You have to see if your horror / slash movie causes blood And funny at the same time Killer movie
