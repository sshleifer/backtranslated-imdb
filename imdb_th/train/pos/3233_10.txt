This movie is the leading Finnish film of this year. Although Tango Kabaree is approaching, the director Lampela has created a movie a few years ago, another story called Rakastin ep√§toivoista naista (I love the hopeless woman ) A beautiful movie of one afternoon in a small village / town. Actors may not be handsome or beautiful. But they acted beautifully. I hope that many of them will get JUSSI statues (OSCAR in Finland) next spring. I think this movie. Can make overseas as well
