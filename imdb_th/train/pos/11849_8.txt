If every animation is a great thing This film is classic because it is strong in two simple aspects: stories and characters. The characters in this movie have a beautiful metaphor. I feel every character and the relationship between man and animal in the movie works perfectly. Beautiful animations and 3D computer animations do not work better than in other movies. This is a great movie for children and for adults who want to travel the classic hero 8 of 10
