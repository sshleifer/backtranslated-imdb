Moon Child starring Japanese rocker Hyde and Gackt is a better movie than I expected. In fact, I was very impressed and it became one of my favorite movies. <br /> <br /> Located in Mallepa, the story of Sho Street Orphan, Sho Shinji's brother and Toshi, who rob and murder Living in this robbery, Cho met with KK's Hyde Vampire that was burned in the sun. From the actual events of Kei showing nature But no one escaped him. <br /> <br /> Time passed and implied that Keita's immortality never changed, raised, and both had greatness. Close bond Cho and K. then have to face the son in a fight with an evil gun and they quickly become friends. Both Kei and Hyde fall in love with Yi-Che, the son's sister. <br /> <br /> When crossing And again showing Sho that grew up, this time is the void of Kei. In addition, he explained that Sho and Son became enemies Simple All difficulties and difficulties focus on friendship and love. It's a truly impressive movie that is sad. But beautiful at the same time <br /> <br /> For the show, I think Gackt works great. Hyde did an excellent job for the first time. <br /> <br /> The image is beautiful. But this movie has short and scary images. <br /> <br /> All I have to say is that This amazing animated film and I highly recommend
