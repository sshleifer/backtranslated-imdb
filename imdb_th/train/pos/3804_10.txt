My 3 year old likes it very much. I love it. My wife likes it. So 10 out of 10 from our family. For the severity level? Not so severe that most of them are slap sticks. No one died. No blood. No torture. So it's more suitable for children than cartoons on Saturday morning. <br /> <br /> This film uses the idea of ​​CG movies. Where should I go? <br /> <br /> The first beautiful graphics, all the surfaces that are made amazing with true depth, don't try to be true. Moss on a rock, rust on metal, embossed on wood and stone, everything is all up. <br /> <br /> Creating a character model that is different from many CG movies is strange, not cute. Again Within all art The face may look less delicate in some other movies. But the character is a puppet more than human I think it's a good thing. It gives the truth that it sounds strange. It's easier to suppress your unbelief. <br /> <br /> Hair, hair, clothes, always at least like Pixar. Just know, in the opening scene, when Lian-Chu fights with a giant bullet, Gwizdo is in front of some farmers and they all have clothes with details that allow me to stop the movie temporarily to appreciate it. Value far exceeds Who likes cars and even walls? Space has been done many times. But the fantasy environment of Dragon Hunters is comparable to some scenes in the Never Ending Story and the Lord of the Rings. But again, it's an overview of art and has many good ideas. The scenery is as beautiful as the scene in Monsters Inc., where they drive through every door through its shed or Wall ?? E, where we see a huge trash tower that he has built a lot in this movie. Everything is great. But never lived It's just the background all the way! Interrupted that they walked through the area with wonderful waterfalls Chinese wall, an island floating in the sky Broccoli in the sky? That is what I believe that CG should do things that make you breathe out and do it over and over again. <br /> <br /> Good sound, a variety of music and not just But it is an epic, any sound, and the original of all movies. <br /> <br /> Animation is quite good. Give inspiration to draw cartoons, especially stretching and squeezing. Sometimes not like the real thing, but the 3D model is not the same. <br /> <br /> The character classification is also good. The gentle and uncertain giant Lian-Chu gradually grows confidently in the interest of the little Zoé. <br /> <br /> Gwizdo, the cunning manager of Lian-Chu, redeemed himself at the end, while Zoé didn't really change. But who wants the cute boy to change? At least I like Lian-Chu more than any other character from Sulley in Monsters Inc. <br /> <br /> The internal conflict is driven by external pressure, just as it should be in the story. The right fantasy. <br /> <br /> Most stories remind us of an endless story, especially when the world is broken. The monster has a good standard fare, except for those flocking, there is no emotional impact on Wall ?? E, which is the strength of this movie. But it is a fun game and there are no annoying musical scenes that are played in the past and have action scenes from the first scene This movie is something you want to watch in a fun and exciting time. <br /> <br /> All the movies are as loud as I mentioned all the visions that seem to be treated seriously. br /> <br /> It seems that the atmosphere is ready for more adventures and I hope that will be like that. <br /> <br /> Note the other side, the French actor who made Lian-Chu sounded like Jean Reno at First, but I'm happy, not him. But he is one of my favorites Nice to hear new to me by voice. <br /> <br /> I gave the highest score. It was a little surprised at the medium and low level by some people. I have tried to deal with some concerns made by two reviews with the lowest score. Approached this movie as an adventure and a European movie, not against Hollywood but different
