Lisa is the hotel manager or owner and she boarded a plane to Miami. She ended up sitting next to a murderer named Jackson, who told her that she had to change the room of her family or her father's death. The reason she had to change the room was because Jackson wanted to blow up. <br /> <br /> It was a very suspicious movie because Lisa tried many ways to escape the way Jackson set. The whole story is great and I think they should spend more time on the plane. May have more planes But other than that, this movie is quite good. <br /> <br /> I like the ending especially because it stopped the heart. I don't know what will happen and I'm surprised with it. For me, this movie just went out.
