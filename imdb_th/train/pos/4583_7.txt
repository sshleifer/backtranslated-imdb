I saw this in Cantonese VCD with English subtitles. I think this is a good story. But there are times when some of subcharacters Beyond expectations This was taken from the movie as well as the lame music score which made me angry throughout the movie. If the music score is better, I can overlook a few scenes that are exaggerated. Then the movie will be much better.
