Ted Mapes told me that he and Reed Hadley wear all the same size clothes except hats. <br /> <br /> Ted one of the greatest stunt actors on the team, showing talent Said that every time Zorro wears a mask, he is one on screen We can be satisfied that it is Ted. <br /> <br /> What to do! "Zorro's fighting force" is a testimony here. One of the greatest serials. It's very exciting and made out. <br /> <br /> Reed Hadley is a good actor and as everyone else commented, he did it very well. <br /> <br /> But accepted. It's an act that makes this movie great. <br /> <br /> And other things we can expect by having a great team like Witney and English, with great songs from William Lava (list Here) said he did not check But not right. Other authors mentioned here are not sure, and I don't know if they write any songs or not - like Lava) and with the villains from others. Big and dozens of bits. <br /> <br /> The main thing is the villain who played the radio by Tarzan, Jim Pierce, the son of Edgar Rice Burroughs's son. (I ask you to read his mini-bio) <br /> <br /> There is a chapter that slows things down. But the heck is only a few minutes (maybe 20) and when you wade through it You come back to excitement. <br /> <br /> Turner's classic movie deserves your thanks for presenting this great movie and we should ask TCM to bring us. <br /> <br /> And we should thank everyone involved that we have seen it as a play or continuation and not a new cut feature.
