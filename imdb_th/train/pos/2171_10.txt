The true classic, ten in ten! Every actor is perfect. The screenplay is a continuous scene of suspicious scenes. Scenes in cars and scenes in the mountains are amazing. Wondering whether this movie is available on the DVD or not because it has to be viewed in the widescreen version? Seeing this film in the late fifties, maybe three or four times, and never forgetting it, I remember it was one of the first Warner-like cinemas dealing with the process features called Warner Interscope Shelley Winters and Jack Palance deserve an Oscar for their performance. The only thing I can criticize is that there isn't someone directed, like Nicholas Ray, speaking to increase. Rhythm and tension
