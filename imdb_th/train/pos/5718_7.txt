I want to see Sarah Buffy on the big screen, so I bought the ticket first and then checked the review at IMDb. I'm worried about watching a bad movie. I enjoy watching movies Some of which are obviously scary. It's actually a joke like in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. <br /> <br /> I don't think this is a bad movie. It's not a great movie as well. Horror movies made quite well. It doesn't depend on special effects. In any way with the camera angle, music performance In my opinion, the performance is ok. Sarah works very well, quite reliable. Other actors are not as bad. I like Yoko. <br /> <br /> The scene is very good (and I don't care that the scene is the same as that used in the original Japanese) <br /> <br /> Scary moments are often predictable. But not always. I've seen some horror and didn't expect to be scared. But now it happens at least twice. Nice. <br /> <br /> The movie has beautiful scenes that are almost original, such as traces of junk, simple special effects for ghosts, cat boy eyes that make loud noises. emphatically Of the dead boy and his mother <br /> <br /> Don't go if you want to see Sarah in Buffy again because it's different from her Buffy work. Do not go if you just want to watch movies that are nominated for an Oscar. It's a fairly good horror movie. I gave 7 items.
