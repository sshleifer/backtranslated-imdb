This movie is another scary poetry. It's quite good But may use a little more I compare it with "The House of Terror of Doctor Terror" Although this name is suitable for It has four stories, all quite connected by the house. The first story is about the writer and his wife moving in. He created a killer for his latest novel and then he began to see the killer roaming in his house. This is a predictable thing. But it was thrown a few times in the end The next story is no longer predictable and you don't really know where it is going. This one has Peter Cushing qualification and may be a favorite of the bunch. This guy bought a house. But not the house in the middle of the stage But is a rather strange wax museum The third story started quite well and presented this person, Christopher Lee, with him as a rather strange father who seemed to protect his daughter extreme. The problem is when you know that what happens in the story doesn't end quickly. It dragged a bit to a very predictable conclusion. Then the final story involves the actor who bought a cloak from a strange little shop. The actors really get what they pay. Then there was a small story about the staff who saw all the time trying to find out what happened to this actor and then explained why these things happened. Although I am not satisfied with the explanation But I do not think it will explain the story of the mattress very much. I think they need a little more story for that. In conclusion, it's an interesting story.
