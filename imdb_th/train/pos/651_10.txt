** Possible spoiler ** <br /> <br /> I like this movie and there is no problem in being alert. It reminds me of me at the age of 20, except it's better. Like Veronica says two chicks at once It makes him feel rebellious, comfortable conversation, real life chicks, both of these rather than slow and tease us every step. I entered the conversation too. Even if they are fully b.s. sometimes what All the chicks I used to talk to, and tall in myself, are often filled with unreasonable tourism. Philosophy. It is a nonsense, bunch and rational as well as others. astrology The only agreement of this film is that men are almost women like women. And frustration In fact, the brown chick is the most masculine person there. <br /> <br /> I think it's funny that Veronica Chick has been clearly opened. She likes pulling a small blonde from Alexander. But Veronica plays her all the way. She's wonderful. She thinks Brown has something going on between them and then steals the boy-boy / man, which is only suitable because they seem to come from. Same age group Brown knew she had received it at the end when she placed her face in the palm of her hand while Marlene Deitrich sang in the background that the transcription of a million pairs in Paris tonight. But I only have this chapter. <br /> <br /> But eventually they got married. Alex and Veronica? mmmm? I can imagine that a tumultuous relationship ended with the collapse before marriage. They were too selfish to be able to give each other more than stepping on rocks. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. It makes me enjoy. It looks good and sexy.
