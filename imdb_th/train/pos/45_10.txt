Home Room is a great movie if you've played the drama in your life. It makes you want to see more. Wondering what Alicia's secrets will hide I think I watched this movie 6 times consecutively and never interested. Plus I don't usually cry with movies. But this makes me cry every time I hope to find another additional movie. Overall, I think it's a great movie. The more you watch, the more you become part. In the end, it was the part that really gave me when she cried when receiving her diploma because of her daughter's name. My heart felt like it was broken. And her new friend came to comfort her when she hadn't received it. I loved it very much
