This is one of the better comedies that has been broadcast on television. One season is hilarious like most seasons. The only reason I gave this performance a 9/10 is because of an unfortunate season. The only good part of the final season is the ending. The part that I like in this show is the scenes that intersect with the imagination of people who often show characters in TV shows or movies from the 70s. It's a rare item that I like every character. (Except the last season ... It's too late to try to develop new characters and faces. It's not funny.) The red feet in your ass comments don't have old days, or Kelso's stupidity isn't. Cheers to the fox for such a good performance for too long, even
