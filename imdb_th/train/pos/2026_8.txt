I saw the mini-series for the first time many years ago on British television and received immediate attention from the story. This thing surprised me because I'm not a fan of 'Jane Eyre' or 'Wuthering Heights'; I think the former heroine is a person who has self-righteousness and the latter works as a claptrap too. <br /> <br /> 'The tenant of the Wildfell Hall.' As well, however, the darker parts of the film are offset by the excitement of Helen's escape, beautiful landscapes and Yorkshire forests and Toby Stephen's sex appeal. <br /> <br /> Movie Funding highly successful Of all women at the time Best of all, they suffered from a form of dictatorship in a small country that was shown by keeping women in Markham's home. On the other side of the scale there is Helen who is unlucky to marry the wealthy man of the mansion. But with cruelty and humiliation, alternating with being abandoned for a long time She ran away and encountered a short period of freedom, but as a mysterious woman living alone in a rural community, she would become a gossip and speculation inevitably. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald Great - suffering Helen Markham, not only incredibly beautiful (Despite having a hairstyle that is not cluttered) with the most remarkable cheekbones, she also has the ability to play important roles in the movie as well. Tara is dignified and far away, while helping us see that Helen is still at risk of danger. Rupert Graves is Arthur Huntingdon who is infamous. But interestingly, after seeing him, I can't imagine other actors playing this role. Pam Ferris deserves a special mention for her role as Gilbert's mother who is as passionate as the younger actors. His daughter Rose and Simon Carter, who are unscrupulous agents who have a taste for good things in life. Finally, I can see this film for Toby Stephens alone. He looks good, cute, sexy and delicate. (But not in a nasty emotional way) I was not even sure that he was a good actor because my hormones prevented me from judging him unreasonably. <br /> <br /> If guilty of the movie This is the use of retrospective stories that I feel that both of them intervened. The flow of the story and a little confusing Other people who have watched this movie have had problems with this, and I found that I had to explain to them that some scenes in the past were true. <br /> <br /> I am grateful. More for those responsible For creating this film, not only will I fool the video. (Rare events) but it made me buy Anne Brante's great novel By nature, this is better than movies. But only a narrow distance. I recommend that anyone interested should watch the movie and read the book in that order. <br /> <br />
