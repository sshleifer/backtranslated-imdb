This is what I wrote to some of my previous friends: <br /> <br /> HOLY CRAP, The Grudge is, faithful to God, one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen! I'm very soft in my old age or Sam Raimi and Ghost Pictures. Do a career. KICK A **! (Can't wait with Boogeyman!) <br /> <br /> I was scared of sitting in a dark theater and hoping that I would have someone sitting next to me (except the protagonist in Grudge. ) I swear there are many unexpected jump scenes! I feel stupid but my nerves don't care! I was close to the whole movie since the opening and the music was amazingly scary. But I still think of that voice and I don't like it. <br /> <br /> Actually, I open my mouth a few times and cry "Oh" in one scene !! Oh yes, I still close my eyes a few times! To wise words: I think some scenes are a bit psychotic. My DH hates Event Horizon and thinks that anyone who wrote it was sick and psychotic. But I do not remember that this movie could not be compared. <br /> <br /> I can't say that I'm "happy" in this movie. B / c I was scared but very good and very scary. As well ... Oh! For being a 32-year-old mother, I think I might have a nightmare from this movie, especially because of that sound. Please go out of my head;) <br /> <br /> In summary, this is not a flick, like I grew up with (Jason, Freddy). This is the most scary movie. Perfect for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Two great movie trailers, Boogeyman and The Ring 2 !!
