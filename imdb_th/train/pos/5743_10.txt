I love this movie! It's all I can't do to stop crying while watching it. But it's really high I was impressed with the performance of Ray Liotta, but especially the ability of Tom Hulce to show Ray's twin brother who is slow in mind due to the tragic and terrifying childhood events. But Tom's character, despite being heartbroken, doesn't know about self-pity and is full of hope and life. This is a great movie. Don't miss !!
