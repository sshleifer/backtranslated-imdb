It was a lot of fun to see in the cinema. Back in 1996, there was a corner of misery from my movie taste which was very good. <br /> <br /> "The dentist" was Pan may sometimes be because people tend to have strong feelings about dental matters. Perhaps ADA launched a campaign against it because dentists report that they have to apologize for this film and for "The Marathon Man" (which has One scene that is comparable to many people in the "The Dentist") <br /> <br /> It is an amazing story that, according to the trivia story, the movie was filmed in 21 days. May take longer than some movie shooting and editing for "The Dentist" is a perfect picture Fast cutting increases the level of tension in the scene where the dentist "takes care". His wife has only two quick cuts that show what happened. The rest is our perfect imagination! Corbin Bernsen is a good choice for the role because he has a lot of experience in playing "off" characters in psychology and he sells the overwhelming aspects of the dentist. <br /> <br /> For me, the rhythm of the movie is Just right. The filmmakers revealed the absurdity of the wife in the right way. Every character in the dental office looks like they are real people working in the office. There were many tensions while they were facing impatient people waiting for the dentist's arrival. At the same time, the dentist is closing down on the top of a severe psychosis! Which is different from many types of movies. The script is very tight. All victims fall into the dentist's trap in a very calculated way. Two types of law enforcement are also involved in a small subplot that ends with the fear of the end of the tournament. <br /> <br /> Certainly not for the impatient person or the tooth lover. But the actual roller coaster ride And highly recommended for fans of intelligent gorefests
