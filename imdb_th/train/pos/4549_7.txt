"My left foot" is an impressive film that tells the story of Christie Brown, a disabled cerebral palsy artist and learns to draw with his left foot, one leg arm in his body that he controls Daniel Day- Lewis received his first Oscar as a great actor for this film, which I was certainly not sure deserved. But it is also worth noting. Day - Lewis gives Brown a real touch and humor almost occasionally. Brenda Freiger, as Brown's dedicated mother, received an Oscar with an impressive and impressive role. My problem with this movie is that sometimes it is too true. When Brown was in despair and had to help someone and do everything with his left foot, the movie might look difficult. This gives the feeling of being depressed often, which may sometimes turn off viewing. However, if you look forward, you will see hope and inspiration for those who have other problems and obstacles. We who are not handicapped and still think that they have problems are inspired by this film because if If there is a worse condition that we can overcome their difficulties, we can certainly do the same thing. Doing good, fun occasionally, but difficult to see, not for everyone, but not bad. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
