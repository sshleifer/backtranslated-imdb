When I first heard about Moon Moon, I thought it was a joke. After a couple of months, I think I think it's true. A little comment that I read that WEREN'T made by sangaling fangirls doesn't have much hope. <br /> <br /> When I get a chance to watch it My eyes to avoid being stupid. <br /> <br /> I'm a little more surprised and a good way. <br /> <br /> Yes, the boy. The moon has a period of cheese and camp. General gloomy - I think it is impossible to avoid when it involves Gackt Camui, a man who doesn't know his consciousness - but overall it's all fun. <br /> <br /> No, it's not work Intelligent movie But is a delightful and amusing story with fun choreography, touch points and fun actors I know very little Japanese cinema, so I can't judge the performance. But considering the fact that actors are speaking the language or dialect most closely with them at one time or another, and the two of them don't have any acting experience at all. <br /> <br /> If you can enjoy good action movies, good drama, good comedy, watch this movie. At least for rent because it comes to Region 1. <br /> <br /> In the side note, there is a homosexual / homosexual content in the film. I do not see even much subtitles. Don't let people who read things destroy you too much.
