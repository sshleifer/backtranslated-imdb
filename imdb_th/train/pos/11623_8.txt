(You will know what I mean after you see the red eye ...) <br /> <br /> Overall, the red eye is a thriller that is better than expected. It starts slowly and gradually builds up. But by the time it was over, <br /> <br /> It's hard to determine what makes this thriller ... exciting. In addition, just say that the director has a reliable role in pulling you into the action of what will be an infinite plot. I would rather forget that I was watching a movie. It says a lot. <br /> <br /> Other factors that I think are "Intimacy" of victims and bad people ... and over time, you will start a relationship with the victim. 8 out of 10 is like 7.5 ... but it's quite good!
