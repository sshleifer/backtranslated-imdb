My wife and I have watched this series at least three times. I can't imagine that it would be better. This is not the "complete" history of World War II. There is no library that can store such history. But is the best summary of that history Many details, many personal stories and still keeping the whole picture in perspective. <br /> <br /> Olivier's lectures can be written in great detail and of course, received excellent. The interview came from all sides except Russia because the producers were not allowed to talk to many Russians. It is very worthwhile to own this program on DVD. We value our copy. <br /> <br /> The manufacturer does a great job of providing pictures and action that is almost impossible. At all in the archive: for example, the movies of fighting and submarines are almost nonexistent. The episode in this story is very good.
