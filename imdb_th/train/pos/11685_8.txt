I found this movie very funny because you have a young black comedian (Chris Rock) and died and was sent back to Earth in the middle of a white human body. He didn't realize that his behavior should change and still act like he had done before. He listened to rap, singing along and playing as part of the stereotypical black people in the city. The true humor in this film is watching the problem that this behavior led him into the black community.
