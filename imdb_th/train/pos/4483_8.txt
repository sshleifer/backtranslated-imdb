Everything should be funny. Gene Kelly (while Joe Brady) shouldn't miss the steps and Frank Sinatra (while Clarence Doolittle) shouldn't miss the notes. The scenes with them are very good, showing that special abilities can be added to a rather uneven storyline. "I fell in love too easily." Sinatra's is an indication of his goodness and future. Kelly's "Mexican hat dance" and a Mexican girl is a delight. Kelly has been nominated as a great actor for sure. And there is a similar joke: Bushel: "Do you think the Navy takes so much time?"; "Do you think someone is singing a sailor to sleep?"; And "We have a little problem. We chose a little boy." A thoroughly entertaining movie, just something that will shake off the dust from the recently concluded World War II.
