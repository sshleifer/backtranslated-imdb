"Jake Speed" is a good movie with great messages. It has definite flaws. Sometimes it is a bit slow. It introduces the villain in the story. Its action is to walk in the rate of snail dancing. It has a Z-grade character (although I admire the work of Karen Kopins, which has the good looks of Sandra Bullock). <br /> <br /> But all this conflicts with "Jake Speed" is the inspiration. Really heartfelt thanks to Wayne Crawford's charming script (role player) and Andrew Lane. <br /> <br /> Why do I think it's inspiring? Because it told me "Hey, why not try to be a good person?" <br /> <br /> The story is "Stranger in a strange land." That is Jake. Good speed and courage. In the real world where bad things happen to good people Jake is more than a scout. He is more than a shining knight's armor. Jake Speed ​​is the patron saint of optimism in a dirty, mean and evil world. <br /> <br /> It's because of this "Jake Speed" Therefore need to be popular It has a good message that should be able to go out to Hollywood and continue to other parts of the world. <br /> <br /> Imagine a movie industry that pushes yourself to show good people and pictures. good person I'm not saying that we should watch Walton in every movie theater at the cinema. But it would be nice if more movies such as "Jake Speed" will be given a chance ("Due South" TV show about Canadians Mountie is a good comparison of what can be done to increase American entertainment better) <br /> <br /> Of course, "Jake Speed" has violence, blood and guns. But the overall message is that if you try hard enough to be a good person, you must overcome the power of evil every 10/14/99.
