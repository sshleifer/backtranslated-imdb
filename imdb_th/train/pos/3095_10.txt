So what is the reason? Is there a vendetta against this great performance or someone involved in that? Why is the best item I've seen in a year been canceled? I stuck. I saw this item last fall randomly and liked it immediately and watched it every week. Then it disappeared and I tried Tivo, but it didn't air. So I forgot for a while until I found various episodes on ABC's website. Now I want more. I agree with others - with the rest of the garbage on TV today. It is refreshing to see something well-rounded and developed like this. I watch Boston Legal for my unusual correction and the House for correction. Mystery problem - Fool. My wife likes Grey's Anatomy "its realism" and I love / hate acting. But it can't be far from me Too much drama Everything is wrong But once it has a drama that is true People are really real problems. Of course, there are some extreme things, such as the ex-gangster who plays well, the girl who runs from the crowd, etc. But these people (especially in NYC) are really there and I'm all about them I don't seem to be enough I just hope that ABC will remove their heads from the bottom of the bean count and continue to show. Get respect from having quality plays out there This may be one of the best shows of all time. If someone will leave it
