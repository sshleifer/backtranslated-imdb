I last (May 2008) found that this childhood favorite is available on DVD. Although I've seen high-quality movies for a long time since then (in the late 70s (I was 10 years old in 1978)), but the three low budget things are still strong. <br /> <br /> What is fun? Now I watch it with my 10-year-old daughter and she has the same experience that I remember from the latter: eerie music (she had to hold my hand even though she was raised by watching LotR and Resident Evil ) Forever changing the theory of who is the real villain and complaining about the drama from the era before Norway discovered the difference between stage performances and movie performances. <br /> <br /> This film is a picture Press the science fiction story (or series) ever made in Norway. And it is worth watching
