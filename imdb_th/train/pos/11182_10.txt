I am a big fan of most movies based on Stephen King's book - this rate is one of the most scary and memorable. <br /> <br /> I just watched it again, about a tenth. Time and I still find it a terrible and terrifying heart. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Gage is in the course of a clash with the monster truck is a striking and "unfair" scene Voiced by Miko Hugh, a little near the end is a touch of brightness <br /> <br />
