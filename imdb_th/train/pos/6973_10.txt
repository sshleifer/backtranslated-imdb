BSG is one of my favorite TV series of all time. I was lucky enough to start watching the episode when the series entered the final season. It's a marathon from start to finish for me and incredible driving. What is it! <br /> <br /> As soon as I noticed the pilots in Hulu, I knew I was in a position just named Caprica! Although some things do not increase when you compare the two series. But it still works beautifully There is no mention of the holobands in the Battlestar Galactica or the mention of the virtual world, but maybe I'm not enough to enter the series to explain why <br /> <br /> I recommend this to everyone who loves. Universe, technology and imagination. The choice of our world. This list is very interesting and you will want to see more!
