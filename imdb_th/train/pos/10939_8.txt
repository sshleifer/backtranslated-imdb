The Five Deadly Venoms is a fantastic action kung fu movie wrapped in a mysterious puzzle. There are signs telling the usual story of the kung fu flick: excellent choreography, terrifying scrubbing, "patterns", different battles and a variety of exaggerations. However, the plot is definitely better than the average. It's interesting and attracts your attention throughout the scenes that aren't fighting. Sometimes it can also make the audience angry, like when the character X receives a terrible injustice. <br /> <br /> Another thing I like about Five Deadly Venoms is the simplicity of morality and themes. Of movies Just everyone gets what is coming to them. Cowardly, greedy and corrupt The bad guys who are greedy with greed, selfishness are eventually destroyed by betrayal and stabbed back. Good people use teamwork, planning and honesty to overcome the chance and come out on top. <br /> <br /> Toxic stones!
