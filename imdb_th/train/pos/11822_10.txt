Dick Tracy is one of my favorite movies of all time. I have to accept people who have not seen You will love it or really hate it. It came out a year after the success of Batman. So everyone's expectations are so high that many people are disappointed because of the simple matter. But it depends on the nude cartoon ... what do you expect Create this amazing movie! Impressive make-up scenes, music, costumes and performances make this movie great. The film has a bloodless violence and a bad language. Directed, produced and performed, Warren Beatty is an avid fighter who fights Big Boy Caprice from Al Pacino and gangsters. Madonna stole the performance as a charming mahoney. This is one of the best characters that Madonna has played. She has the best thing I have heard! Madonna's fans will love it! One of the coolest things about this movie is that they use only seven colors to make them look comical. This film is a piece of art that people are sadly overlooked. In order to summarize things, this movie brings children out in all of us. It's a movie that will make you smile at the end.
