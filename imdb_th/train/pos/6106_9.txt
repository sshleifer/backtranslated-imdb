When talking about the erotic style, I was lucky to pass the first 20 minutes of the plot without having to get up or look for something else. This movie is different. Julie Davis (I love you, don't touch me). Directing two very strong actors, Kira Reed and Doug Jeffery. In this thrilling thriller, Kira believes that "Kim" loves novelists. The sweet romance trapped on the website of Doug's "man" temptation. Jeffrey is a handsome stranger. Kira loses control, restraining her role and as an actor, making things that may be another depth and confidence. I believe it will be her best performance. And the direction of Julie Davis is a wonderful gift for erotica
