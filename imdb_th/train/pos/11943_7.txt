I'm a big fan of Woody Allen, so when I see that this is playing in the cinema, I can't help myself. I want to see how Allen will follow his beautiful Match Point movie, because this is another movie he shot in GB (which is unique in Allen's work) with what appears to be a muse. His new Scarlett Johanson Scoop is much lighter than the MP and the humor is the most fun thing of Scoop. The plot revolves around the character Johanson (journalist student) who gets tips on hot matters from above. Burial She falls in love with the suspected serial killer (Jackman) and she must decide whether the truth is worth finding or not. Oh and all this is done with the help of the magician, the detective played by Allen. <br /> <br /> I must say that I enjoy Johanson's performance, but I have a little bias. I can watch three hours. Filmed with Johanson in the frame and still be enchanted She plays a sweet and cheerful lover who is a change in Allen's feelings about neurosis. She added appropriate body language for the cartoon effect. No need to say that anyone who sees this will find Johanson's character cute and boring. This is the pros. <br /> <br /> Allen is Allen ... He still plays the character. The same character as Chaplin and the homeless characters Something that happened in this movie made me wonder if I could see. hypochondriac Less on the nervous system again? He wasn't in his next picture and spent more time behind the camera at the end of the year ... Jackman also enjoyed the suspicious millionaire slayer. I can't say that Jackman did something special for his role. But he fits his character a little. <br /> <br /> In terms of the plot, I can't help. But felt this was fresh ... in fact, it had the smell of Curse of the Jade Scorpion. Johanson and Allen were more detectives However, I have to applaud Allen for his ending because it's smarter than your typical Hollywood movie. Instead of doing everything in black and white, things are painted in shades of gray. Being completely innocent has no connection to it and there is no clear fault. Although the plot will look old, Woody still has a knack for one liners. I found his allusion in his latest movie interesting ... coming with humor, laughing and cheerful. <br /> <br /> There's no need to say if you enjoy Allende's work. If you don't see anything else ...
