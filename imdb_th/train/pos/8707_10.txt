"Mechenosets" is one of the most beautiful romantic movies I've ever seen. The name of the movie can be translated into English as "sword holder". The main hero (Sasha) is born with a special ability: he can protect himself with a sharp sword that emerges from under the skin in his hand. At first he looked like a stupid superhero, one from an unconscious movie about unrealistic events and feelings. But it's not about Mechenosets. He is almost called against the hero. I think he is the only person who has lost his life and faith in goodness, justice and love. In his life, he never met someone who could understand and love him. (Except his mother) every step of his blood He avenged everyone for receiving gifts, which became his curse. Suddenly he met her. She doesn't need words and explanations that aren't used. She loves him what he is. She doesn't care what he does. The fact that he is on her side is more important than anything else. But soon she discovered his secret: he killed two people (Her ex-boyfriend and bodyguard) to protect her before her eyes Even after that, she could not escape her feelings. They tried to run away. But it hides Eventually they had a serious car accident. He was locked in a cage; She is in a mental hospital. They don't know anything about each other. But she believes he will help her He transcends many obstacles. But eventually found her They work again But they cannot be destroyed She was injured. She wanted to rest. But the police almost caught them He didn't know what to do. They drove to a corner and his sword began to cut trees around them, but not necessarily because she had died in his arms. Lonely people in the whole world again
