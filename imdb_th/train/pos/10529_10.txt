Whether it's my favorite Austen novel and Paltrow, not my favorite actress. Paltrow works well and Cummings Stevenson and those who play 'Miss Bates' are great. Details of the period are not separate. The feeling of the movie is really correct, but the real 'search' is Jeremy Northam. Like Mr Knightley, casting is not perfect than IMO. I hate Mr K in a novel But found that he was a man and miraculously humane in the movie The eyes that look good and the smile of Northam are not an obstacle to enjoyment as well! Highly recommended.
