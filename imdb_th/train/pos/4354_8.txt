I saw this movie at the Palm Springs International 2005 festival and from the 14 movies I saw there I would rank # 4, over 900 theaters, full of audiences and received applause. This is Peter Falk. Classic If you are a Falk fan and show a lot of chemical reactions between Peter Falk characters and Paul Reiser characters, the name of the movie seems to be too long and strange that caused the sound. I am surprised that this is not a general version. This is better than most junk that big studios are charged on you. May be too mature to focus on the baby boomer and senior audience Many people may relate to the situation in this movie. May enjoy revival for many years from now, when people look back at this movie and consider it a kind of gem I will give a rating of 8.0 to 8.5 at level 10 and definitely recommend.
