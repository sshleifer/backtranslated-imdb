When I was a child, I liked the computer animation, although it was very limited and the tools were almost none. This movie, when I sat in awe and watched amazing images and songs that were almost hypnotic, gave me the desire to create animation on my computer. This is a full agreement between songs and videos packed with one and two punches. If you know children who want to be involved in computer animation, this is a must have. <br /> <br /> I still rate this movie as one of my favorite 3 programs for almost 20 years. Come, I think that the initiative is still unparalleled with McMovies. Today, Hollywood is spit out. Now I want to see if I can make it again by myself; If imitation is the most heartfelt flattery, this movie deserves to be imitated. TON =)
