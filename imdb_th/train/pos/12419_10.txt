I love this movie like no other. Again, I will try to explain goodness to those who are not trained. But at the moment, let me talk about some amazing conversations, remember that it is all the tongue in the cheek. Aussie and Pom will understand everyone well. <br /> <br /> (Song title song) "He can drink beer. He can choose a stranger in his latest double-breasted gear." <Br / > <br /> (Another song) "All pommies are bastards, bastards, or worse, and England is the ** hole of the universe." <br /> <br /> (During a television interview about "programs Arty "): Mr Mackenzie, which artist are you most impressed with? In England? (Barry's answer) Flamin's bull! <br /> <br /> (While talking to innocent girls): Mr Mackenzie I think you have an Aboriginal servant in Australia? (Barry's answer) Abos? I never saw Abo in my life. The mother made a solid drug. (Like hard work) around most of our places. <br /> <br /> This is just a taste of the hilarious Aussie people. If you can get a copy of it, watch and enjoy.
