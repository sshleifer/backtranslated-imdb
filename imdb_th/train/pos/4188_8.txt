Samuel Fuller is the most interesting filmmaker because he has a political inconsistency in his film while "Shock Corridor" and "The Naked Kiss" represent hypocrisy and America's insanity and "The Big Red One" are powerful images of the horrors of war. "Is about the dangers of communist spies All of his films were created for a very enjoyable viewing, and although he was often an actor as a filmmaker. But the fuller is as good as the big studio contractors. "Pickup on South Street" is no exception, and despite the old style, the movie style is very interesting in the past. It is also a fast-paced, no-nonsense film that is fast-paced and brutal. <br /> <br /> Performances across the board are fantastic As a woman working for her communist spy girlfriend The thieves acted as Thlema Ritter. However, in a very satisfying performance as a police chair Fuller Corner has excellent staff, making the show more exciting and cruel. (This is a very violent moment) The camera moves continuously like Tarantino and his school will take forty years later. "Pickup on South Street" is a noir action thriller "Shock The Corridor "is still my favorite Fuller movie. But this is a very close second (8/10)
