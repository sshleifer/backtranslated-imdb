For those who are interested in knowing that humans are wrapped in a large red pod that makes me want Ruby, there are a pair of shorts. "Second Renaissance" I'm not sure why they are divided into two parts, especially since they are regarded as one of the DVDs. (And these shorts look like other than DVDs) but they provide information A few spaces. <br /> <br /> What makes this first part stand out from the second part and the rest of the animation is the way it shows between the robot riots and civil rights. Graphic images of fascist slavery, concentration camps and graves, combined with verbal references to trillions of people, marches and complex gods of humanity. In fact, "God" was never actually referenced by these shorts instead of being replaced. <br /> <br /> As far as shorts go in the collection, "The Renaissance II: Part I" is, by far the most effective way to bring out feelings. It is a sad and distressing view about the potential of humanity to become "The architect of its destruction" Some people may be closed by some short ideas. This is torn directly from the science fiction literature established earlier. But then again, that's basically what most of the matrix sets have done and it's the driving force behind success.> <br /> --PolarisDiB
