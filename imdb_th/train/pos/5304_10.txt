Pecker is a funny comedy movie. But distorted about a small town in Baltimore that has a boring routine by Pecker, a young photographer who takes pictures of "real things" without beautiful patterns, no beautiful men, just living hard This great film shines in the chain of art in the city. There is one scene that happens when a homeless woman who buys a product at Pecker's mother's fast-growing shop buys the exact coat like one of Whitney's artworks for just 25 cents instead of five hundred dollars This is just to show you that no matter what kind of money you have, you may not always have the taste again. John Waters sends you into a spiral of laughter and a never ending reality. You can have mainstream Hollywood movies that have special effects and stellar mountains, but give me "phallus" or "spray" (another great movie by John Waters) above. " Titanic"
