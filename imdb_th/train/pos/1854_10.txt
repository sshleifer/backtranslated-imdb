After developing important eyes for movies and good cinematic love, I went to watch Antwone Fisher with my breath as a symbol. While I'm a big fan of Denzel Washington - both his talent as an actor and his public person I am a fan who is honest enough to accept the time (very little) when he doesn't hit the mark in the movie or two. And I may be wrong about these things - after all, I'm not an actor But this is different. - Denzel will bring his career experience as a guide and guide to manage one of the most sensitive movies that people know - child abuse as his director. No less And develop a movie to point out that it will be successful in presenting a man's victory I don't want to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> And I can't. <br /> <br /> What I see is a movie full of promises that connect a diverse audience and provide an experience that There is no short-but-sincere experience to the life of a young man who is a young boy who lives in hell. But who can win This film does it - and doesn't have to worry about any color in the theater that can be proven. People need to know the topic in this movie when knowing that there is a truth presentation. Must use a filmmaker who has the ability to tell a reliable story when you do not touch And if he can attract more viewers and make the audience respond to emotions without regret, the filmmaker can do his job In any movie, black, white, purple or polka dot That is what makes a good movie theater. Bravo, Denzel, Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant and the most important Antwone Fisher - you definitely win.
