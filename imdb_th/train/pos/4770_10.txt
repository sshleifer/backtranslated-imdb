The only item I have watched since 90210! Why do they stop production? It is the only item that captures the essence of Hawaii and makes you feel that you are all part of it! The least thing they should do is leave it on the DVD! <br /> <br /> I went to see a similar program. But nothing near Actors have incredible chemistry and I look forward to each episode with many expectations. <br /> <br /> They made a big mistake by pulling that item. If anyone has information about where I can get the North Shore DVD, please post a few lines here. Thank you! Aloha!
