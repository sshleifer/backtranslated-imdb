I just saw this movie in Santa Barbara. My friends know people who work on this subject, so I think I will try it out. I think it's a very beautiful movie and can't wait to see it again. The actors are very good and I like all the songs! There is not much talk in the movie, which at first felt a little strange - but when I got into it, I thought the story and performance were really emotional and meaningful and thought it left a lot of imagination. I want to watch the movie again because it happened so much that I forgot many small things, but knowing that I left the cinema to think about this movie. It was shot beautifully and the whole thing was really unique.
