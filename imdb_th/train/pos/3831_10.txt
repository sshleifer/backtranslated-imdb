This is a free adaptation novel from Clarence Mulford; Fans of the movie Willaim Boyd may feel a bit here. (And the comments here are reflected) but I know about Hopalong from the first novel and never really interested in the Boyd movie when I approached them. <br /> <br /> Christopher Coppola chose wisely - he didn't think of "Western"; He approached Cassidy's story as part of what we once called 'Americana'; Or what the older critics call 'homespun'. I find myself more and more about the movie "Roughing It" by Mark Twain, which is the excellent "Roughing It" movie by James Garner. > Both movies remind us of the story, although movies about 'Old West' are often legendary for Americans. They don't have to be 'western'. They can only be movies. With the meaning of being American at that time in that place <br /> <br /> I never felt so busy watching this movie. There is no attempt to push the legacy of Boyd-Cassidy into our throat. There is no irony or no camp. So I realized that these characters were walking - or riding - in the West of America. In fact, I was able to walk a hundred years ago. <br /> <br /> Identify the simplicity of the movie - it. Avoid things that we have come in positively to call "style" - it's a favorite; And the actors' performances are well compatible with this story; Gosh, it feels like some of the stories that tell about the fire on the cow drive - no dress code that sees only strange habits and good humor - and sudden violence - which we expect from a good description of Adventure yarn I was very surprised with this movie, and if the audience placed the expectations towards him or her, it would be very satisfying. <br /> <br /> I would give this 9 stars, but I would give ten. Just because most investigators here miss the perfect spot; And I ask them to create memories about Boyd and give another opportunity to this film. <br /> <br /> Note 1: Critics complain that Hopalong shot the dead in this movie more than Fired a gun from his hand (ala Boyd's Cassidy); First, Cassidy does not shoot the dead in the novel; Second, if Cassidy is a real cowboy, he would have shot the dead - the gun problem shot from the hands of people is that they can get another gun - which is part of the film's subtitles. <Br /> <br /> Note 2: I admit that I am jealous of the Coppola family that they have a director "godfather" among them that can create opportunities for them to make movies that I can't do. But good movies are good movies And this is a good movie If it's someone's name, "Coppola", that's just that. America is a land of opportunity (Or until Bush came to work) - that's what every great American novel talks about
