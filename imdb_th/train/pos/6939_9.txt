I am very impressed with this movie. I have to rate it as one of the better classical Westerners. I said that for all things: acting, adult conversations, nonsense stories and great movies. <br /> <br /> Director Anthony Mann, who made many noir movies in the same era. this Western like this It has the same film noir. Mann and Jimmy Stewart collaborated with many westerns during this time. If you like this movie, I recommend the Mann-Stewart movie "Bend Of The River". <br /> <br /> In summary, a story about a man One person, "Lin McAdam" (Stewart), who owns this movie The prestigious Winchester 73 rifle, which is a weapon he received from a fair contest Then will be stolen and forwarded from the villain to the villain Every villain is an interesting character. <br /> <br /> Stewart's work is an interesting story, such as Shelley Winters, Dan Drury, Stephen McNally Mill. Lard Mitchell Everyone enjoys watching. However, it was slightly stretched out when looking at the rock that Hudson played as an Indian ("Young Bull") but you don't have everything.
