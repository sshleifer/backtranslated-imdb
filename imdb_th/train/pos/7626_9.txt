I loved this movie at first sight in 1979. I was still surprised that Kurt Russell showed how Elvis conveyed the precision until the moment he moved and expressed his face. Sometimes it is scary that he looks at the show and speaks like a real Elvis. Fortunately, with the release of the DVD, so all of us waiting for it will eventually get a full quality movie. I heard who said that there was something wrong or there was something left. But I think remember that John Carpenter only takes about 2 1/2 hours of work and this is shown on television. (Just two years after Elvis's death!) That he works well with this In fact, I have never seen another Elvis movie that came close to this movie. Highly recommended
