Bacall did well here - especially considering that this was just her second film. This is often obscured because it falls between two great achievements: "There is and without" (1944) and "The Big Sleep" (1945), which both paired with Humphrey Bogart. Depends on other movies, but I think there is no fault of her own I think there is something that makes her have a picture of a woman on the English crust. No accents I think the strange accents are annoying - Boyer is definitely not Spanish. It's hard to say exactly where people in that country come from. <br /> <br /> I like black and white movie shooting. Emotions are used for good effects - I especially like the fog scene. The light also works superbly to increase the attractiveness and tension. <br /> <br /> Bacol is very beautiful. Boyer was not suitable for the romantic male lead role for me, so he and Baal together were a little strange. Not a great chemistry - and of course there is no magic of Bogie and Bacall, but I still really like this picture. There is good tension and it moves well enough. I must say that I found that the murder of a little girl is quite brave for this movie. <br /> <br /> Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre stand out as a supporter of Paxinou. Evil in depiction One of her scenes that she laughed crazy about, while Mr. Muckerji was about to leave after revealing to her that the boy's murderer was quite annoying. Lorre also performed quite well in the flowing snakes of Conteras, a coward. Lazy to the end Wanda Benric is also very good at drawing other children - especially considering that this is her first image and she is only 16 years old (although she is much younger). It turns out that she is married to Auie Murphy, who proved to be a short and chaotic marriage
