I did not expect Val Kilmer to build credibility for John Holmes. But I found myself forgetting that it's not pornography. Actually, all the actors turned to amazing performances in movies that were not rated like this. <br /> <br /> As some people have previously mentioned, find two discs. It will give you a lot of background in the story that will be useful to appreciate the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people seem displeased about the LAPD crime scene videos included on the DVD. There are a number of reasons that may be included in one of those cases: John Holmes' trial for murder for the first time in the United States with the use of such images by prosecutors. If you don't want to see it, it's easy to avoid; It is clearly stated that the "LAPD Crime Scene Footage" on the menu!
