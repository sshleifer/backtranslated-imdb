Somewhat slow and tedious, the story of an old man and his wife living in a dilapidated building and interacting with a stereotypical character, such as a postman, a sibling sitting on a rich smoking man's balcony. Taking pictures of the magical river as well as the interior. If you like the Banana Republic shop, this is necessary.
