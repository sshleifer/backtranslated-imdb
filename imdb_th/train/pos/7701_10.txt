This is one of my favorite movies and is usually In the past few years I have become a sci-fi fanatic in the 50/60 era. Trying to gather all the better things that have been done since then. I love many things about them from their repetition that may occur with some technical correct methods. Great colors and various scenes It's a shame when they recreate these good old movies. They almost do everything - just look at the latest things that the world is still silent for. Forbidden Planet is one of the standard movies of all time, and now they're trying to make it again, and I Think about what new things will be! In my mind, something such as a great classic movie should be left alone to be what they are a classic example of a good effort in telling simple stories and getting people excited. process When they add the techno shit that we have now, it seems to be more dog meat from the Hollywood sausage factory - nothing special. By the way, I noticed that astronaut uniforms in the forbidden planet are also used for "Queen of Outer Space"! That just told you that the budget is a little lower, right? Hey, less money and better movies. Um ... <br /> <br /> A great performance in this movie from Leslie Nielsen in a serious role and Anne Francis, Walter Pidgeon (who is one of the people. Always my favorite actor) Earl Holiman and of course Robby the Robot! <br /> <br /> The special effects are great and the story is not beyond reach. This is a great sci-fi experience!
