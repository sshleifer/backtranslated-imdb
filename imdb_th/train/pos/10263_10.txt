"House of Games" is an impeccably made movie and one of the few movies that I have seen that made me gasp on the screen in astonishment that it ended up intelligently and unexpectedly. I saw it for the first time in the video a couple of years ago. After reading Roger Ebert's review, which announced that it was the best movie of 1987, I had my doubts primarily because it was not known as another movie in the year. that Boy, I was very surprised. This is one of the smartest and best-written movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The screenplay is quite a piece of work. But in terms of the plot (Which twists and turns and pulls out the carpet) coming out from under. You just think you have everything to think of) but still in terms of character development. In my second visit, I realized that Mamet's screenplay was not only successful. But it's a smart movie But still developing the plot, each story helps us understand their characters and motivation The focus of this film is particularly effective because it is inevitable. It happens naturally from what we know about the characters, and it is more than just a twist. The ending of Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna's performances add greatness to the movie. I can't imagine other actors besides Mantegna who plays Mike and Crouse. Show her role with a reasonable amount of restraint to introduce repressed criminal ideas. Their work, including the special screenplay of Mamet, was combined to create one of the greatest films in 1980. It is something that shouldn't be missed.
