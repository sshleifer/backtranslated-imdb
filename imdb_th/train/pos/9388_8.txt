Much for your fictional readers, Cage and Hopper have found and are lucky not to be in Lynch's movies. Because RED ROCK WEST is better than any Lynch movie, Nicolas Cage is an actor who has three players Zane, naive, is an insidious girl. Only the father of Hopper has the meaning. As always, RED ROCK WEST is even a boring actor. But one of my favorite thriller American; In a thrilling word with some twists. <br /> <br /> One noticed the gusto, awesome pace, excitement, great suspense, cute little Lara, Lara Flynn Boyle of enviable shape. nick (Although undeniable) Ugly with sharp features of birds, thick eyebrows and thin, rare cages hair showing a good overall shape ??) Hopper's complete routines, some relatively moderate periods But truly funny, playing the cage with the intended person of the Hopper. Lara's humility seems like a stray dwarf, a stranger in the starving noir movie theater, if necessary. Lara Flynn, glamorous, seductive, Walsh as her heartless husband and Hopper as the Lynch killer he did before. <br /> <br / > The cage looks rather dazed or dizzy or very confusing. Severe hangover But this may be his normal look
