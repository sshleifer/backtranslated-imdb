Today it is hard to find a romantic movie that is incredibly disgusting for a short time throughout the movie. (Eg Big Fat wedding Greek; Me, Myself & Irene) There are only a few jokes that are not intended in this movie. It's a cute movie with a cute character. I think the end is quite sudden. Feel like they should end up with the world series for real results. Slightly expressed to be desired But created according to the rhythm of the story If I knew that it was the movie of the Farrell brothers, I would think it was a waste of stomach and didn't look. But they seem to be able to make a movie accidentally Well, for them, I hope they pull the rest out and start making good movies regularly.
