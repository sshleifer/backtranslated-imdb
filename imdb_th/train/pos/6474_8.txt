I was pulled in all and couldn't wait for each episode. The show brings to life how people who are missing in the family must be emotionally equipped with the effects that are most closely related The only problem we have as a family is 'explain' all at the end. We can't clearly hear what is said and don't know what Gary has in the whole story? Why did Kyle call him and why did he go? Investing in the series for five hours, we felt that only five minutes had been cheated. I have already asked and there is no friend of mine who seems to be smarter
