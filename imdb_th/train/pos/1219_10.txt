Care Bears, the second story is much better than its predecessor. It has a deeper plot, better character development and music. (Especially closed songs) are both catchy and warm Of course, this film tends to be attentive. But it is a Care Bear movie This film is a wonderful picture that will show children because it focuses on friendship, love and concern. Don't talk about Care Bears too cute!
