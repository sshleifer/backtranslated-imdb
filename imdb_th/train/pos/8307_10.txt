Tressa's singing is great !! Tressa plays the female singer while Richard is in the club. When she stepped out on stage for the first time and began to riff and strut what she did, it caused me to shake. Her voice is white gold. She wants to make a CD. She had more boyfriends and she realized I like her performance that stopped dancing in five strokes, which she performed with Leon when she was young. How can a little girl be noisy? She is truly amazing. Good sound. Good. Good. Good sound. Good sound and excellent sound. Tressa. If you read this action, please get my advice and start recording CD If not just for the love of singing, but for your fans, I believe you can truly do it. Take a look at these solo studio singers.
