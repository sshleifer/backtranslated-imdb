Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) unexpectedly arrives at his son's house. His son Ben Kleinman (Paul Reiser) is surprised to hear that his mother, Muriel Kleinman (Olympia Dukakis), leaves his father, Racha's wife. (Elizabeth Perkins) His three sisters tried to search Muriel while Ben and his father watched the farmhouse sold. But that was not the end of the journey. Their road trip became a long-standing therapy between Ben and his father, Raymond de Felita of The Thing About My Folks (2005). Behind the screenplay and his excellent work, the dialogue between Ben and Sam is amazing and he has worked with the script for twenty years. Who can play with his father better than Peter Fulk? No one can say that I love the story of why Paul wanted Peter Falk to be a part. Peter is an actor who makes his father laugh and Peter makes me laugh in this movie. It's funny when they Go fishing and the way that older men dance the younger people in the pool game, then dance him with a wand. The film is often very funny and I find myself laughing many times. But it can be touched from time to time You can't tell a story better than what you said here.
