If you want to remember MJ, this is a good starting point. This movie has sweet songs, MJ is a robot and the story is confusing and confusing. I remembered many nights passing through this college documentary and pondering the horror of anyone who decided to ignite this green light. <br /> <br /> There are so many singing and dancing. Singing a lot while dancing. MJ kills it as you would expect when talking about it But there is more in this movie There is a clay with a fat child (clay). There is an anthropologist rabbit that Michael Jackson must fight in dancing. Joe Pesci (not made from clay) <br /> <br /> RIP-We love You're Michael! It's a sad day for all of us.
