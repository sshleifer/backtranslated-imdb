The first film is slightly ambitious, nothing is attached to the screen. It's a bad version of 'Back to the Future' that has zero charm. When acknowledged that Bill & Ted is nitwits, the jokes will be hammered on the audience for a long time before it stops. <br /> <br /> This is a surprise. This is your only spoiler warning ... <br /> <br /> According to today's standards, it's more fun. This is a disgusting matter when released, sad because it is considered more capable than the first. We received the photographer 'Face / Off' editorial 'Fugitive', the designer of the creation of Burton's first work and the designer of the sound of 'Matrix'. <br /> <br /> The writer created for the shallowness. their First outing with deep things Due to this destruction by the fanbase and the public, the director may decide that the style is too extreme. It is not suitable for materials such as 'Death becomes yours' and 'Catch-22'. This dares to be wise. But we like our movies "simple" so we don't buy It may be because of this different courage that causes the 12 producers to pull it out. What is good? <br /> <br /> - A good reference to Keanu himself; From the airhead to God. See Arnold Schwarzenegger. <br /> <br /> - He hates his creation as much as he hates his partner. They make him hate his own. The Evil B&T and "good robot usses" have the same vocabulary as their originals: less copies and depreciation of the language. <br /> <br /> - "duality" norms. There is no more obvious place in High and low angle shooting styles. They also use Roy Brocksmith from 'Tot al Recall 'to emphasize this point <br /> <br /> - norm "alternative" I do not know whether this started in the category (maybe' Ghostbusters') but it used quite well here Even though it has boiled down to 7 games per death - Battleship and Club <br /> - The self-reference of the film, even in the game of death (clues) is smarter than Tarantino or Brooks. Premier level at the end: "Bill and Ted: The Movie" Ironically, too, that death and Nomolos are evil in the sequels of 'Die Hard' and 'Lethal Weapon' <br /> <br /> I still have nits. Some, but nothing compared to the real thing Music and movies are different media, so there is no reason why many scripts revolve around the past - especially in the teenage market. Carlin is a great comedian. But in this film he wasted They can't kill cats. <br /> <br /> So even though it looks like a jukebox production But it was incredibly interesting From this movie, we got Beavis and Butt-Head "We are in heaven and we just dig three people" <br /> <br /> Final analysis = = Intermediate material
