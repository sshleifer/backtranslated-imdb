JUST CAUSE is a defective movie. But with good quality that is held simultaneously with intensive performances and creative writing Sean Connery is a war fighter against executions that lead innocent black men. (Blair Underwood) from the death penalty In determining the right things, Connery will enter the scene where he not only But must fight with time only But still a sheriff (Lawrence Fishbourne) Twists and turns and reversal. The role is vast - some surprising, some not - while the war-olds try to unravel the mystery The end of the climax is ridiculous. But just have a value to see on a slow night
