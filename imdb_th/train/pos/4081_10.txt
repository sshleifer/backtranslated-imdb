I have seen all of Miyazaki's movies and they are beautiful and fascinating. But this one is higher than the rest This movie made me totally impressed. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with Pazu and Sheeta and their sweet and caring friendship. They are things that make movies for me. Of course, animation is great and the music captures the feel of the movie perfectly. But the character is sparked in this movie: they are well developed and full of personality The English dub is good (mostly). It is pale compared to the original language version. The sound is better than everything. So I suggest watching (and hearing) movies in the way that it is.
