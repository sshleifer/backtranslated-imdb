** Warning - this post may contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I just received the Gamecube in September 2005 and the first two games I bought are the James Bond game. Good representative. Under Under Fire and Goldeneye Rogue are boring agents. The next game I plan to get is Everything or Nothing because my friend told me it's better than the two games I already have. I have to say that he was right. <br /> <br /> I bought this for tenner in HMV and when I got home I struck it with my Cube and played for hours at the end. It's much better than my two games and has a much better and more interesting story. The graphics are the best I have ever seen (but now the Xbox 360 has come out. Farcry Instincts Predator has the best graphics that humans know). The story is clever, crazy (Willem Dafoe, Nikolai Diavolo) and beautiful beautiful girl (Heidi Klum, named Katya Nadanova), tries to destroy the world with tiny nanobots. At the beginning of the game, James Bond must destroy the train. The bad thing is that one of them is hidden in Katya's chest. Then you must hinder their plans and save the world. <br /> <br /> The great thing about this game is that there are actors voicing characters such as Cleese voicing. Q. There are 27 levels, some of them. he Short and partial, quite long and tricky. <br /> <br /> Gameplay - 10/10 Graphics - 9/10 Sound - 9/10 Repeat Play - Multiplayer 7/10 - 8/10 < br /> <br I gave this game a total of 90%
