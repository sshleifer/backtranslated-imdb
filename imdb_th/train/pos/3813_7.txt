(And this is Christianity) and wondering whether it would be a rant against the illness of blind faith or the power of misappropriation of people who should be more innocent than you. Judging by letting the event happen and allowing the audience to decide and summarize themselves. <br /> <br /> And I can't help but laugh at the role of Sang Kang Ho, the man who The favorite of a widower's (booking before) and started when she went to church.
