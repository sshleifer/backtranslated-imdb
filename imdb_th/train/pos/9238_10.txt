Although others commented that this video is just a two-item editing: "Fire in Space" and "Living Legend". If you watch the original program, you will find that the dialogue from this video has been modified. I found this video version much better because the scenes and lines were added. I will say that if you want to watch the original version of the show to watch the video on the VHS, they have more than to give the fans more than the original episode presented on the DVD at this time. Another great video is Conquest for the World, which has scenes from Galactica 1980 more than the actual broadcast. Overall, I rate this thing as 10 because you are enjoying more than what the network wants to show during the time they give the manufacturer.
