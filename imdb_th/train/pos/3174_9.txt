Not many people find indie movies that leave an unforgettable impression. Cross Eyed is a rare gem. Director, writer, not only But only deal with the challenges of directing his work But also giving a hilarious performance as an evil roommate The script takes an interesting look, not just But the fate of struggling writers only But also incorporating a lot of humor into the desolate world of writers that you can't help Very funny thing Despite having a small budget, Adam Jones tried to make the film look serious. He wasn't busy when talking about making good movies. I can't wait to see what he comes with. This guy makes people laugh and think. That is special
