I have been watching this movie for a long time and I can finally see it in the Istanbul Film Festival. Probably because I was expecting too much from this movie and that's why I was a little disappointed. I'm not the best movie from Korea. But it is worth looking at it. <br /> <br /> The subject is good and this movie keeps you looking further without being bored even though it's long. But there are gaps in the movie and you jump from one point to another However, the performance of Jeon Do-Yeon is incredibly beautiful. It is one of the best performances in early movie history and I think this movie will not be good if she is not in the lead role.
