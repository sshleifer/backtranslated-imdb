*** Spoiler * <br /> <br /> My father recorded this film for me when I was 3 years old. Episode 5 I watched more than 400 times. I just watched it and watched it. And I still do today! It has a terrifying story. The mother of a lamb is killed by a wolf - a very emotional scene - and wants to become a wolf like him. After many years of training, lambs became really evil. He and the wolf travel to his old barn. But he can't kill the lamb, no matter how much he wants He became a wolf killer. But not seen as the sheep of his old friend anymore and unable to return to his previous way of life. <br /> <br /> Beautiful art, music is .. well, okay and the sound performance is better. Some things today <br /> <br /> All you just have * to watch this movie, it's a great masterpiece. Although rare today, <br /> <br />
