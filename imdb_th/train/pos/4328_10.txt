I bought a DVD of this model to compare with the current version of BBC 2005 (which is excellent) 1985 was adapted by Arthur Hopcraft, which adapted Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy for TV and those who died this year (2005). Especially visited by Rigg and Elliott and the musical movement (the song in the 2005 version is more complicated But can tell a lot) just accept other critics on two issues: Richard Carstone is a fan of Ada Claire, not Esther Esther doesn't have an uncle. Charlie Drake never played Krook in both versions and didn't play Toby Esterhase in TTSS! Krook played by comedian Johnny Vegas in the 2005 version of Toby, played by Bernard Hepton. /> <br /> Both of these versions have wonderful and admirable adaptations of Dickens's great novel. Now read the book! It's not perfect and the feeling may make you startle sometimes. But I challenge you not to cry - and laugh!
