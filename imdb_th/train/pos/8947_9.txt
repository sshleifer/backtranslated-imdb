Kim Novak is a wandering witch for human lovers and James Stewart is her choice. A comedy about the etiquette of Broadway plays; James Wong Howe, shot by Witch Color and played by avid actor Ernie Kovacs I love this movie But it seems that some people Kim alone makes it a winner in my book. Ha! Movie # 5 about me, 1958
