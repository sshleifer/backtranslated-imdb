Watched last night and was impressed with the love story, the development of the great character and the good karma that caused the show and the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Without giving too much plot. It starts with a normal Joe who travels to work at the office every day and becomes an inspiration for dancing lessons. Between the protagonist and the various characters he met on his mission to smooth on the dance floor, learn lessons about others and about yourself. <br /> <br /> The story has an introduction about what being Dance in Japan is a symbol of sociology, so it's not easy to learn to dance in Japan like here in the United States. <br /> <br /> This movie is lighthearted; You will laugh out loud at jokes, but it has the honor in a way that is hard to explain. All the characters in the movie are as serious as they used to be, and no one has diminished because "Incomplete" <br /> <br /> I think of social dance lessons with friends. It just happened. A friend asked me to borrow a video about learning to dance. This is synchronous or what? I think so because now I feel like trying to do it. <br /> <br /> Watch this great family movie. (Small children may not receive But teenagers will definitely) and smile for the real care that you see at the time and again. <br /> <br /> Why would they create our remake? Dance is a mystery that is as perfect as it is.
