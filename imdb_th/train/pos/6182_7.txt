The mystery of murder with musical numbers is long in the atmosphere and characters. But rather short on suspense and reliability From the stage plays by Broadway actors Earl Carroll and others, it combines an investigation into the backstage atmosphere. (The murder investigation took place on the first night of the opening of the theater.) The actors were impressive and varied: Victor McLaglen, who was funny as a police officer who led the investigation of Jack Oakie (the war maker Jack Lemmon or Jack Lemmon Was after the war, Jack Oakie?) As the offensive director who had to coordinate the scene as well as the chaos behind Jesse Ralph, who used to be like a house in a closet with a dark secret, Dorothy Stickney, who had only one person close to the end, while the girl shook madly in love with the lead man; Carl Brisson, a Danish actor who leads the man in the classic "Cocktails for Two", not just once, but twice. Kitty Carlisle Opera sends "Where did they come from and where they went?" And other songs by Johnston-Coslow; Gertrude Michael, the glorious person who separated from us too early as a brave actress who had a love for Brisson, was rejected; The ridiculous Toby Wing is usually here, at least at the center of the jokes that are laughing. <br /> <br /> When the story of the plot is out of hand, there are always interesting actors. The audience, the most famous sequence of this film, is the number "Marahuana", led by Michaels, but apart from the controversial history, it is one of the lesser musical presentations. All of the songs here have scenes as if they were able to adapt to the Proscenium theater area, as opposed to the Busby Berkeley fantasy scene.
