<br /> <br /> I've been watching this movie many times. At least a dozen Unfortunately, not recently, however, inscribed in my memory will not leave me as a scene in which Mickey Rooney - "Mears killer" knows that he must be executed and that it is near. Came in a time of truth, he danced and cried Get out of Hestia to feel comfortable and run the trick of the emotions that used to be. I have never seen such great performances from past or present live or dead actors. At that time, I knew that Mickey Rooney was right. "Andy Hardy" is and is a very talented actor However, I kept it my opinion for myself for many years, thinking that I must be alone in this view. About 15 years after I watched this movie for the last time on television, I had the opportunity to read the section. The old Los Angeles Times question-and-answer question was posted to Lawrence Olivier and the question is: "Mr. Olivier, you are regarded as one of the actors. Great At all time then you think. His answer was "Peter Finch and Mickey Rooney". I was shocked but not surprised. I blinked back to "My Morse Killer" and I feel very good to see this great talent in him, and now I get support from other jobs that I admire .. Of course, "Bill" The moment with Mikey Rooney, this movie "The Last Mile" should be published by all students. I can't remember many things over the years. But Mr. Rooney in this movie will not leave me If someone remembers this movie as I do? I'm interested to hear from you For this image carved in my mind alone, I gave it 10 on the face of his performance.
