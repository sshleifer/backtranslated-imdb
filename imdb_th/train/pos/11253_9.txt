This is a movie that is very long, which means that you may be bored before it is interesting. But the length of it will give an opportunity for the character to find a permanent attachment in your sympathy. <br /> <br /> If you feel guilty You will find it especially scary because it is a nasty story because it is a story that is found to be a hero among the wicked and the weak. If you can love the monster you will cry for the spy spy Magnus Pym, everyone, whether it's his country, his friends and family, people who have been manipulated and molded since childhood by the same person. > <br> There is no admirable character in the whole story, not a loyal character 'moral' that is sympathetic. But watching all things without using tissues helps make it stand out. <br /> <br /> I finally enjoy it. Worthwhile for movie enthusiasts who are stimulating about human characters.
