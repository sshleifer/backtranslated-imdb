I'm tired of people who are talking about Ewoks! Actually, they are not the best thing that has ever happened to Star Wars, but they happen so deal with it! In addition, they are cute and I don't care if they will sell in the market. Yubb Nubb! <br /> <br /> This movie makes me tear. It's perfect. The end may not be better. I'm excited about The Phantom Menace because it will make the focus of the whole story from Luke to Anakin. I like that he revealed at the end - it will not be resolved in any other way. So those of you who are complaining that Vader's helmet has been removed, take a moment to think about it. It is very effective. Vader, the man who hid behind the mask for 20 years, was eventually revealed to be a sick man. He is not a whole machine - he has a hole They are reliable characters. Hamill works great with amazing character development. Fisher works well as a female model. (I mean, come! She killed Jabba, even if the others failed!) Harrison Ford - Do I have to say more? <br /> <br /> Great music again. It is impressive and very important when you can choose the theme of the characters in different parts of the movie. The best climax is when Luke shouts "NOOO!" Last fight John Williams has nothing to do with genius! It's a really amazing person. <br /> <br /> Now, this movie is more meaningful for me when I can't wait to see it in the cinema. (Finally, I'll wait ???) and then see the original ending again. <br /> <br /> Cheers!
