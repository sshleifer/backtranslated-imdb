This is one of the better-made movies and doesn't disappoint me. The audio track, along with the camera work with the exquisite mobile phone, is very beautiful. The chance that the movie will not believe as well. But I felt that the rhythm of this image and that time was wonderful. Dakota Fanning was quickly becoming the raw material in the movie that needed a child with an old spirit personality and she never disappointed me with her abilities For Mr. Washington and Christopher Walken, they both challenged the darkest humanity performances that tried to advance to light.
