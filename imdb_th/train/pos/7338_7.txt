Fire And Ice is an animated film created in the fantasy world. This film is about a village destroyed by a giant glacier, the home of the evil Ice Lord named Nekron. The only survivor in this village is a young man named Larn, who travels to avenge the right. Killed by a glacier The glacier moved through the land of fire and the princess of the land named Teegra was kidnapped by the beast. Larn set out to find her and set out to search and kill Nekron Fire And Ice, directed by Ralph Bakshi, one of them. In my favorite adult animation He brought us some lively masterpieces, such as the Fritz The Cat movie and some movies he wrote himself, such as the movie Heavy Traffic. I don't like fire and ice almost as much as I have other work for Ralph Bakshi. Also found that this movie was fun It has some very good animations and the story is fun enough. The only basic complaint I have is that I hope to have more than one story for the movie because the story used is very thin and nothing more. I hope this movie will be a bit long because it takes less than 80 minutes. It is also a fun action adventure movie that is different from Fritz The Cat or Heavy Traffic that is suitable for children aged 8 years and over. Hopefully there will be a more developed story and it will take a little longer.
