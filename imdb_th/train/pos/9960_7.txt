I noticed that this movie was being dumped into the trash well before it was released in theaters and I had no high hopes as well. I think it's a "You Got Served" type of movie that has awesome dance moves and performances. I stayed at the theater and decided between this and the Meet the Spartans and chose this. For my surprise, the performance was not bad at all and this movie was quite good. The fact that having a lower score than you receive is absolutely ridiculous. Instead of listening to the junk posted here, I would suggest going to see the film's performance so you don't spend too much. I think you will be surprised by everyone's mistakes. When talking about dance movies, this is one of the best movies that has better performances than other movies. Go to the movies and judge for yourself. Hopefully the score will increase after coming out on the DVD and there are more people watching this movie than judging from the comments before the movie will be released. <br /> <br /> Edit over 1,000 people to rate it. 9 Too high, but at least helps to compensate for the ridiculous score of 1
