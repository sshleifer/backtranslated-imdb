This movie is great ... It makes me laugh. It makes yelling and most importantly, there are animals talking there !! Everyone, everyone will see this movie! It's one of my favorite movies and I love it so much that I have to comment on it !!! It's rox! It felt the heart and the wonderful story that made it a great and sincere movie! My favorite character is shadow. Because I think he is most interesting and charming I used to have gold like shadows. I miss him so much !!! He is my best friend and I know that when he dies he will be in a more happy place. But I miss him with all my heart !! This movie is the best I love and everyone should! Love your pet, no matter what they do, enjoy it forever !!!
