Freddy Krueger, a swindler dreamed of the return of elm street. A great actor Robert englund back in the sequel to the nightmare. 5 Dream children. I hope I get the correct number. There are many. In the best Especially for the cameo by Rosanne Barr (then Arnold), Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp (The first nightmare in the year 84) Alice Cooper (singer) You will see that Freddie is a tortured teenager who loves pain, family members (creepy), funny and creative effects. The actors also include Lisa Zane (Billy's sister), Breckin Mayer. (Traveling along the road) yaphet kotto (aliens, living and letting die) and Amanda Donahue (father knows best) one of the three people who saw this in 3D The first dimension in 1953 (I haven't been born yet) The second wave was in 1983. I like the movie Freddy. All of this is outstanding as being one of the better people who don't count on the very first one. Freddy became a monster. New in the 80s and 90s, followed by Jason voorhees, chucky, Micheal myers and leather face.can you imagine a movie that has all of them? I recommend this to all Freddy fans and fans that should be Freddy was scared of being cut off 8 out of 10
