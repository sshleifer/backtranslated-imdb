Other critics have concluded that this movie, Deane I just want to add in "Whew!" Comment. One reviewer talks about the obvious Coke drumming episode of Elisha Cook. This looks silly. I have to say that Cook deserves acclaim from his fanatical performances. <br /> <br /> Little that I hadn't expected: Cook appeared as a waiter in 1941, Barbara. He is a waitress in a nightclub in which Barbara is singing and the legendary drummer Gene Krupa is drumming the most. Is it too much to suggest that the lively drums in the prison of the next movie "Phantom Lady" have been highly inspired by Krupa's work as mentioned in Cook 3 years before witnessing? <br /> <br /> If you look at Krupa in the "Ball of Fire", I think you will notice the movement of the body clearly. One hope, of course, that he was not influenced by drugs at that time!
