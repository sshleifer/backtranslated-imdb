I know that there are some meticulous people who have crabs that are not the same. But sometimes separated, can stand on their own advantages. I like the new Iron Chef because it's close to the Japanese version. But at the same time suitable for the American spirit I love Alton Brown as a critic because he describes things with flair. The iron chef himself is very interesting. I know that the original seems to be the best chef in the world at that time, but Bobby Flay is the only American chef who has beaten them. Mario Batali seems to be the most fun to cook, comment and shine while create I watched the series and found that all players worked together well. However, the referee is not always the best choice. There are some exceptions, such as lawyers, turning into foodies. But most judges suspect that they are able to handle what they receive I enjoy watching the hustling chefs and the challengers are surprised. The food at the end looked amazing and sometimes inspired me in the kitchen. Maybe that everyone can ask if they really want to eat something that is served. The only thing I will change about the series is asking people to perform a little lighter. Sometimes the mood is too tense and that is not fun to watch when you expect more fun. I like this version with William Shatner (Iron Chef USA) because it's great like the original. But I can say that it is a fairly expensive offer. I hope he will be with this model and was a host - between Bill Shatner and Alton Brown. That will make me smile for an hour. As long as you don't expect the original Japanese version and can accept this series with your own advantages, you may find it an enjoyable hour.
