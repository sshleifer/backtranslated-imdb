Boys and girls were chased by local warriors because the boys killed the warrior's father. (Or by chance) and they travel through the nature of Africa's busiest area. <br /> <br /> The performance in this movie is not good. (Except that baby elephant) but it is a very good adventure and not very censored, with flesh and nude images (Which makes the movie look a bit brighter) <br /> <br /> I gave this movie with 7 because it's a picture of The nature of Africa and its actions
