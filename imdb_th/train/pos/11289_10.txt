There is something wonderful about the fact that movies created in 1934 can be head and shoulders above all Tarzan movies that follow, including Greystoke, a bloated and boring piece. When viewers pass through the scene of the first three scenes that are boring, Tarzan and his partner go out like shooting, action that is not relentless, humor and romance. Maureen O'Sullivan is charming and beautiful like Jane and walking with movies. Weismuller is also strong. Highly recommended
