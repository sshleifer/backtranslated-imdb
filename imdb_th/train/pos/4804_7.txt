I watched this movie on DVD a couple of times. The first time I watched the second half of the hour and then returned to the first hour. An all-encompassing entertainment movie. Thank God. No kiera knightley in this refreshing film and it makes us all understand the difficult life of Queen Victoria and the difficult choices she has to do There is nothing bad about the movie so there is no bad language or anything that has a nasty sexual appearance for watching the family. May encourage children to research a little story about Queen Victoria and possibly a lesser known character such as Conroy and Lord Melbourne
