In terms of bad comments - or car crashes - I feel that I have to go to the gear and send to make merit to the due date and service. I'm not sure that people will have a license to say that it's almost terrible automatically. <br /> <br /> It's hard for movies to be banned. This film is still suspicious of all lengths. For me, despite any shortcomings, there are a few movies that can be said to be not very large due to the simple evidence. Lasted both movies Yes, the suspension system is tight and some shocks occur. It's not just television movies. But an action movie There is no point where it stops or deviates or becomes a talkative person. It would be difficult to create a movie like this on the street always. There is only a duel or speed that I can remember. The best thing in them is the constant tension. <br /> <br /> The performance is not bad: judges are as good as ever and others. <br /> <br /> The script is good. But the jury decided that sometimes it may be - or seems to be a little bit awkward What seems unrealistic does not have to be like that. Your first decision is not always correct. But I think the actors are right in this movie. <br /> <br /> The most horrifying thing, especially for TV movies. Their only failure may be something that can be observed and again is a slow and clear speed. But we all know how the Grand Prix slows down. <br /> <br /> I like The BEGINNING saying, "Get inspired by the real story." So how much will you not go? You only know the basics is normal. "According to the real story" makes me think it should be true. But it may be my mistake. <br /> <br /> How to record: A good idea about the investigator to introduce a tow truck to lift the rear wheel. Just a few inches will do. Stunt drivers can do 100 miles per hour. Strange that they didn't call a car expert - or electrician or mechanic - to see what methods were available. <br /> <br /> I hope this review will bring the opposite back. Or at least neutral And help it become an unsuccessful success. <br /> <br /> The quality of the image is a little soft for the DVD. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: They will be pulled out after the baby. Life saving ideas are handled wisely in some teasing conversations that will fade away. I guess we know why At the end of the movie The suspension of unbelief went to the top window with his children.
