This is a horrible old ghost story. I show my friends at my movie club and they are hypnotized until the end! No blood or blood - just a good old suspicion. It started from the beginning and created and created. The ending is a real story that makes me unaware. <br /> <br /> Well directed and well done. It is also "Parts of the moment" - set in the 1920s, which added to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I'm very impressed. I received a book from Susan Hill from Amazon. The following movies are quite close. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that there's no DVD. My copy is VHS. This, along with "Haunted", is probably the best ghost story I've ever had. Which just shows that there is less creativity "In front of you" blood every day!
