It was only my second visit, many years later that I realized two things about this movie: 1) I really enjoyed it and 2) because its operation was sharper than the evidence. guarantee I laughed following the movie before it happened to me to renew my first protest - valleyspeak and loogies and airheadedness (even * good * - airheadedness looks) just not funny, especially when pulled out for strength. Long features But even though the momentum of the film begins to spread at the end, Reeves and Winter and Sadler (and Hal Landon Jr. in an unforgettable scene) show the incredible feelings of comedic moments and even gags. Funny with more scripts Failure to recognize that some inhabitants of Hell work as easily as someone who has etiquette. (Such as the challenge) and the combination of Winter and Reeves click very well until the combination of the Bill and Ted team (those who use the same scene separately in the whole movie is a disaster if they do not match). <br /> <br /> (Note on the side: I found that the first movie that only provides entertainment periodically - looks like a different sense of humor, there seems to be.) <br /> < br /> I give 7.75 good fun The surprises
