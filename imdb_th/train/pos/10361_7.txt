When you lift the jaw from the ground from the perception that they ... somehow ... manage to put this together quickly until released the same year the case ends. You will find it. Not half bad. The plot of interesting and interesting stories and fast pacing covers many situations and often leaps to the next page after saying a sentence or two. The most outstanding thing is acting. Great performances, Neill and Streep are flawless. In addition, it is a great story to hear Australians speaking in Hollywood movies and even those who do not speak naturally, at least try to use accents. Movies and editing are good enough. But they didn't go beyond standard The story of this movie is interesting and the fact that it is true only makes it more cold. While I didn't read the novel or hear what happened outside of this picture, I understand that it's quite close to the truth. There are medium to high levels of language and content that is disturbing in this regard. Sometimes it's a dramatic drama in a great courtroom. I recommend this to any fan. 7/10
