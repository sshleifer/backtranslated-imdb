B movies? Yes. DIY? Yes. First movie? Yes. But Aestheically A +, this movie has some bad sounds / editing / lighting / performances / other problems etc. However, this movie has many good things about this. First of all, the most annoying characters die first! Secondly, it was created as a parody / funny movie, B horror. The comments that our killer made to his victims left me and my friends rolling on the floor. Laughing. <br /> <br /> The problem is that many people try to use every independent film and expect it. It will be a masterpiece. Get to what it was, a group of children came out of high school, made their first movie. For what it is, it's really good.
