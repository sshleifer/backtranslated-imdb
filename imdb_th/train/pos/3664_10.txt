Picture Scene: The alien landscape is a mountain. Double moon shines bright red blood sky. The TARDIS lands and steps away from a middle-aged man in a Victorian coat and his companion Rose from the world. The tremor of remembering across his face "Okay, I never! It's the Saurious-7 planet where I fought with the Kraggartians at war. They tried to use the giant Skinkons to take over the world. "We can't go. The doctor. I don't like the look of this place. I always think that we're being watched." The doctor uses a finger that doesn't agree. "Don't be a fool, a girl. I wonder if the King and Queen of Cordaraby City can remember me from my last visit. Come!" He stepped out. The young woman struggled to keep up. Horrible red eyes look at them with hatred ... <br /> <br /> That's not the way 'Rose' began in 2005 and thanked Heaven for saying that I scoffed unfairly. The original broadcast of the United Kingdom, now 'Rose' can be considered a safe place by bringing 'Dr.Who' back to where it is one of the main programs of the BBC. Get to learn well Rather than trying to wear a new 'Who' shoe in an existing event, it's a new starting point for the series, starting with the Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) shop for her daily routine. One day she went to the basement to find a man named Wilson. Then the problem began. The puppet came to life and attacked her. It was only the intervention of a mysterious stranger (Christopher Eccleston) that she survived. <br /> <br /> A little story, though it may be more than a starting point for the series. Old villain (This is their first appearance since 1971) but there is no reference to their past. Finally, create a famous scene in 'Spearhead From Space' effectively when the shop window happens to be lively. While the Doctor Christopher Eccleston lacked the unusual version of the previous generation, choosing the modern leather jacket of the modern period doctor. But this made him able to reach out to new audiences. Hope - Billy Piper makes critics confused by making a big impression as 'Rose'. Well, Noel Clarke as her boyfriend 'Mickey' <br /> <br /> Yes, there is an emphasis on special effects. But then there must be - a scene that is shaky and unbelievable monsters in the past. On television in the 21st century. What's more important is this script? There are ten million people who adapt to meet a new doctor. <br /> <br /> 'Dr. Who' is back - back again!
