<br /> <br /> This film has Barbara Steel, who has me as a cuckoo. It was seen when I was seven or eight years old and created a permanent image of a female vampire who is yellowish and spelled. Steele is an icon of horror and other beauty and the view of the dead that walked before Romero Nights of LIVING DEAD LAMING DEAD included in my heart. <Br / > <br /> I do not see the connection Blank this movie with THE HAUNTING, which is clever but not clear about the forces that exist. LA DANZA MACABRE is a movie b without pretending that you fall in love with Barbara Steel and receive the consequences. There is nothing to attract too much overwhelming Claire Bloom's HAUNTING. The comparison with HAUNTING is quite superficial. <br /> <br /> And not this film doesn't have to be reworked. Only sixties, but many talented characters in Hollywood cannot understand the MACABRE formula for fear. The formula depends on one important factor: good writing. Low-quality classics such as CASTLE and Corman's Poe movie with R. Matheson and Out of THE PAST of Tourneur. Share the similarities of strong writing. It's easy. Get real writers like Richard Matheson or Steve McQuarrie and release. Let them plot the story about the current movie. In addition, Hollywood is trying to use traditional materials to change and stop using products that are clearly superior in the past.
