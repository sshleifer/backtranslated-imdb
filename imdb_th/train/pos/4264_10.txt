I accidentally watched this movie twice and found it very well done! The Second World War ended refreshingly and the so-called "Cold War" was about to begin. This movie may therefore be designated as one of "Propaganda" is the best patriotic film preparing Americans and secondly, people from still continue to form the "Western NATO block" of the country to face further threats. The film celebrates the power of America over the centuries as it continues to show itself to the current war that has just ended. Good and funny habits are ways to explain the discovery of the Americas by Columbus and the "espisode" of New Amsterdam and the purchase of Manhattan from local Maui Indians. At least .. must see (at least once for curiosity About fashion Propaganda all the time)! :)
