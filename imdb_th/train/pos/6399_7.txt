Although it's not the best movie I've ever seen, it's worth $ 8 (which can't be said for many movies today) <br /> <br /> This is a delightful story of True story, although the details of many real stories were twisted for the movie (For example, Billy Sunday's characters are three or four people in the real story together) Robert DeNiro is a good person and Cuba Gooding, Jr is also impressive.
