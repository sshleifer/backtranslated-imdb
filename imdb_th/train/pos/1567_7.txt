It's not too bad for ab movies, with Sanders, Barrie, Hale, Cowen, Hamilton, Gargan, Fitzgerald and even Willie Best. We might be Charlie Chan, Moto, the Falcon, Blackie, Holmes or Saint etc. Get a chance to use. One hour in the company of some old friends from ordinary to urbane, killing and being killed - always happy in my book. <br /> <br /> Barrie is a hard-boiled name to avenge and Clear the framed father and die her police detective by planning and proceeding with her string of assassins, a string of hell assassinations. Which will definitely have the opposite effect! Saunders easily joined the fun, just dancing in the right club in the right place in the right city at the right time with the lights that fell both him and the first killer. (At the right time!) And kill him> <br /> Okay's story and performance, the only thing I have is nearing the end of the hasty discovery and almost laughing who is the evil genius. Bad (Waldemann) - Do they almost forget his relevance in the story? That said, the list is stable in the series.
