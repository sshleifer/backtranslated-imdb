There is no knowledge about this movie before seeing it in Rialto Channel. I found it to be a satisfying, awesome and valuable movie. <br /> <br /> A great selection of actors. I love every character, they are a little exaggerated in the place. (But this is a movie) The way it looks and the joyful sitting of the main character happens until it turns out to be not as good as real life can do. I am especially interested in watching this movie when it starts because people are always joking about her acting ability. (I find it quite strange because she is always a strong performer in my mind.) <br /> <br /> I love the end that Andy's character says. "Sometimes I feel that he has never been here." Etc. It is completely that it is in that situation. (Which I can identify myself), then there is a beautiful classic piece. I think by Chopin, which is a beautiful way to end (a funny bar at the end, which may not be necessary). br /> I said "Well done" with the filmmakers - I saw 1,000 movies that were worse!
