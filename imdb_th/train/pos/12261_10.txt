Tintin and I recently aired a episode of PBS P. It is based on a tape interview of Georges Remi aka Herge, the creator of Tintin from 1971, which discusses his experiences in publishing his popular characters for the first time in the Catholic newspaper. His own comic book Impressive panoramic view of various cartoon pages and surreal images of Herge's dreams. I found Tintin for the first time on the sub-page of the children at my local elementary school library that read the secrets of u. A nicorn My mother was a CD member and I read all the properties of Red Rackham every month. In 1978 I remember seeing some Tintin comic books in a local bookstore after that. But for some reason And I think I'm growing faster than them. I have a Breaking Free book which is written and drawn by J. Daniel, published in 1989, six years after Herge's death. This film also covers the personal life of the artist when he leaves his first wife after he has a relationship with the painter in his work. (Which he later married) Her name is Fannie and she was interviewed here. If you love Tintin and the creator of this film, it will be worth watching for sure. Update: 9/4/07 - Now I have read Breaking Free. Tintin and the captain are the only normal characters that Appeared here and they were adapted to the anti-capitalist view of Mr. Daniels and Tintin showed that he was a witty actor with chips on his shoulder The captain here is trying to make ends meet with the wife and daughter he loves deeply. They and other construction workers vowed to strike after a fellow employee died from a faulty device accident. The whole thing happened in England with the accent that remained the same. Not what Herbert would approve But it's an interesting read. Oh yes. Snowy dogs will appear in the upper left corner of the cover. (Which Tintin runs through the police!) And the dedication page
