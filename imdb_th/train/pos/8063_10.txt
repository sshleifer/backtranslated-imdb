But what makes this movie a classic is the direction and shooting of surprises and the use of fog and light that is different from typical American movies and in the German expression tradition. And the Oscar-winning performance by Victor McLaglen due to the drunken Gypo that is unbelievable. In general, this film will take place in Ireland and Gypo transformed into a friend in the English rebellion movement to collect 20 pounds to give to his girlfriend. But having all that money, he started blowing it up all night, drunk and distributed it while the movement leader tried to follow the news informer. This film is one of the darkest nights in Ireland and has memorable characters. But throughout the world, Gypo is approaching him both psychologically. If I had to choose three directors for all of their movies to be on a deserted island forever and nobody else, John John Ford would be one of them. Is a truly outstanding movie ...
