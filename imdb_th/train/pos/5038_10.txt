It's true and unexpected. This is what the real horror movie is about. I hurried into the video store, grab the movie without reading all the clarity on the back and hope for the best. I was surprised and very happy. I really like actors and their characters. I think they all give great performances and make their characters realistic. The plot is well thought out, written and directed well. It makes you interested from beginning to end and never get bored for a moment. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie for those who like thriller, especially thrillers and those who are definitely interested. 10 out of 10 from me
