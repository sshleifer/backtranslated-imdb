I love this movie Not a true Ed Wood Jr. fan. I like to admire his "infinite enthusiasm" and accept his shortcomings. His movies are fun. But his personal story is painful. I hope and pleased to find that this film is about understanding his turbulent life rather than just creating him with praise after death. From the beginning to the end, the film evolved from a documentary into a legend, releasing actors and audiences unexpectedly linked, and with Ed Wood Jr. <br /> <br /> What we get is the person who Know Edwood Talk about him best from every point of view, both positive and negative, and show us their personality as much as Ed We get in-depth information about Ed's personal and professional life, whether it's love, drinking, sex, friends, enemies and even making movies. <br /> <br /> In a low-budget way It seems to be disrespectful. Ed, for example, if using the technique of movies released in theaters most from 1996, is not polite (like wearing a suit that is better than the president). Using humor and deep understanding when pairing each member with the background. <br /> <br /> Fans will be excited to hear Edwood's personal testimony and newcomers. are Surprised that this man is real The DVD is not full to find gems ("Crossroads of Lorado" and the gallery), but the real treasure of this film is an interesting and surprisingly connected story. <br /> <br /> Ed. Wood has a habit of defining People through fellowship with him (Better or worse) to the point that a woman will go down in history as "Pool owner" once for him and his friends to be baptized in the pool The ability to determine that person's heritage comes from all over the world due to the most amazing effects of this film. But gives an idea that is knowledgeable about men who are Ed Wood Jr., but also gives a comprehensive view of the community. Anyway, without having one member being interviewed on the screen all the time, the relationship at Edwood Created among various people in his life, it is clear and the audience is well involved. <br /> <br >> Even a hint in the B-list horror genre, but at the end we can see that even though It will be it compassion What started out with unrelated stories by random people ended up with a conclusion that every actor would be woven together into an unpredictable fabric that history would bring to the legendary unity. Of Wood's <br /> <br /> Conflict, Ed Wood Jr. cannot be abbreviated in one view This collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we will receive. Being part of a combination of themes is a respectable, provocative, thought-provoking, fun, sad, kind and fulfilling.
