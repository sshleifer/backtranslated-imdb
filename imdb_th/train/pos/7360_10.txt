Wow! This is a good movie! The performance is not good at all. But if you watch some moments in the movie, go back and watch it again. It's a genius! The man at the beginning of the movie walked with his luggage with three people. Wow! I never expected. Then he put the coke in the suitcase and ran away. I bet that those who smoke and those three are one of his friends who sell drugs later. And intelligent price: '' good shading, I want their '' '' pair .. if you think you can take them .. '' .. just bright! And fighting is the best thing I have ever seen now Look at the second man he is going down after he hit the head of the first man with the table. What is the hit! And in the middle of a movie, there was a man in the car that was shot once, then fell 3 people. He was good at aiming. There are a lot of expenses in hiring these people like him. In the end, it was great. It was very exciting that James Cahill walked up the stairs for 5 minutes and went down the stairs and shot Jason Peter after diverting his attention. Jason Peters fell and rolled over again when he died! I can't say more about how great this movie is!
