*** Spoiler *** <br /> <br /> This movie looks so exaggerated until I remember that my college campus had a former student who had been killed by the Nazis. Also: His name is Benjamin Nathaniel Smith. <br /> <br /> Look at him on Wikipedia - I've added a few pictures to his article. > <br /> It's hard to believe. This actually happened. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Omar Epps or Ice Cube, but Larry Fishburne, Kristy Swanson, Jennifer Connelly and Mike Rappaport are good people.
