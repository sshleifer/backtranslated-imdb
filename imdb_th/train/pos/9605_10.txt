Well, I'm not sure if this movie will be like I saw only a small clip, but I thought it would be good and I was right. I watched it twice on the day I received and it was mine. Favorite movies <br /> <br /> I think Alison Lohan really plays Beth. She is an insulting actor and the writer must do a lot of research to find out about bulimia. Although the ending when Beth was in the hospital, there were two horoscopes observed after the meal because iv was told as one house was okay and the hospital didn't help bulimics, as was said, which may be the reason why I Stay at home even though my sister My mother was like That would allow me to enter the hospital while I had a bulimia But this is a grating movie I recommend to people with or without eating disorders or for people who know that some people with eating disorders can release them in the life of a person bulimic and see the world that they do. A little movie and I recommend to any one and every type of person.
