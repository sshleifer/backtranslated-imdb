We found a documentary on the Gray Gardens last Sunday and "sucked" without warning. Everyone who entered the room became a television anchor and a haunted image of Edith and Edie who seemed to live in a room of a large dirty mansion on the beach. Eat ice cream and corn on the cob (which is cooked on Bedside table) - and the cat piss on Edith's bed and her unbelievable words that "I thrive on [the smell]" We have never seen the beginning and wondered what we are watching and how these elite women can manage where they are. Spelling! Must see !!!!
