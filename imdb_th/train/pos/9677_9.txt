This movie seems to be a movie mill for children that parents can see tragicly with small children who are mostly entertained. It looks like this movie and focuses mainly on children. But didn't stop at this level I watched this movie for the first time as a child and found it to be funny, fun and heartwarming and didn't see it again for many years. I watched it again at the age of 18 and found it almost funny. But it's warm and fun This film has been rated very low and has many messages in real life. This film is an inspiring story created for children who have courage in themselves. I recommend this movie to everyone of all ages.
