I've been trying to find out about this series for a long time! Thank you IMDb! I saw this thing since I was a child and never got out of my mind. Of course, when I was 6 years old, I was particularly impressed with the episode of Cyclops, which was very cold. (I talked about it so much that my brother made me a Cyclops from a plastic caveman.) What I still remember was an unusual atmosphere from the beginning - mysterious, strict and very genuine When I read the manuscript many years later, I had the same feeling. It was very difficult to capture and possibly impossible in Hollywood 'Odyssey' every time I saw it. But that is a tremendous release The characters in this series seem to be real and true - ancient Greek people - and not some Hollywood stars in the series. This is a real masterpiece! But - why not know each other better And why there is no VHS or DVD. I just want to have the opportunity to see this again!
