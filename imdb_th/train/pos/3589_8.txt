I enjoyed this movie and after watching it made me wonder how many 'Caitlin Rose's' in the world. Many other women who were sexually abused and tortured by classmates and were too scared. Can open their mouths about it? How can teenagers be intimidated and cruel because this film shows who is right, not the most important, the most popular and afraid of dealing with the thoughts of teenagers and influencing them so that The same offense happened. Tiffani Amber Thiessen gave a powerful performance as a rape victim and Brian Austin Green believed that he was a man torn between the girl he thought he was. Day and his close friend, this is a movie that has not been disclosed. Deserved to be outstanding and excellent, beyond just being a movie created for TV.
