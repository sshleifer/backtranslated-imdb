I love this mini series. Tara Fitzgerald acted incredibly in drawing Helen Graham, a beautiful woman hiding with her young son from a mysterious past. As a fire lover who loves love ... This film is just my cup of tea and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to escape from England in the 1800s. I must also mention that Toby Stephens, who demonstrated the attraction of Gilbert Markham, had enough reason to watch this great production.
