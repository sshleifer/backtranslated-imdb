It's a rare opportunity when I want to watch the movie again. "The Amati Girls" is this movie. In an old movie theater, I would like to see more performances. Is this an autobiography of the writer / director? It has an aura of truth. <br /> <br /> All actors present their characters with confidence and tenderness. Who doesn't want Mercedes Ruehl to be an older sister? I love her work since "For Roseanna" <br /> <br /> With most movies, one person stopped believing because we knew it was the work of actors, producers, directors, directors, technicians and sound Suspend such belief in "The Amati Girls". One feels like this part of the family! How do I want to protect Dolores when her family restrains her emotional life? And want to encourage Lee Grant while she criticizes Cloris Leachman's hair color, humor, not humor, belly laughs But instead of the quality, the feeling that responds better than the pratfalls, and so <br /> <br /> the love that is displayed in the movie family Italian means 'loved ones'
