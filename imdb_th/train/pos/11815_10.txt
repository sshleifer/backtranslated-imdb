While I was writing this thing, I saw more than 15,000 points. It had a score of 5.8. There was something wrong with that picture. Personally, I give 10 points. I can see 7 at the lowest or possible. 8 If ranked by people who watch this movie for what it actually is. It's a movie created by a comic book hero. This film has won more than the share of prizes, won 3 more prizes, 5 winners & 26 nominations .... That told me that it was better. 5.8 Great performances from some great actors, techniques Some wonderful specials and in my opinion, what if it wasn't a classic for many years? If you are looking for pure entertainment, don't forget to visit Dick Tracy, a movie that you can watch more than a few times. Al Pacino is great like Big Boy Caprice.
