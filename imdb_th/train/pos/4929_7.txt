I can't condemn this film because it works. There are enough elements of noir movies to consider as a noir movie. But I think it's just a category. <br /> <br /> There's nothing terrifying in this piece, and that's what the Noir element failed. Of course, this disease may be considered scary. But I have a hard time seeing that The hint of this film is dark: Blackie may be a human trafficking. New Orleans police are willing to arrest journalists too. The demon of the epidemic hangs over all people in the movie ... but actually <br /> <br /> There is no attempt to question Reed's motives as Marlowe or Spade and there is no attempt to bring humans into Blackie. The trafficking is real. <br /> <br /> The lack of depth is the thing that ultimately causes the movie to fail. <br /> <br /> The story is appropriate. But nothing to make this movie, you should go back over and over again If you do not remember many years ago and should be worth watching once
