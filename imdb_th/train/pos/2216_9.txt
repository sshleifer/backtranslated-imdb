Historical drama and stories of the era associated with people of color in the civil war before New Orleans began to slow down, but getting steam when you learned about the main characters and the actual actions can begin. This is not just a story about the exploitation of black women because they are free. They may not have all the rights of white people. But of course, they can control their fate better than their ancestors who were slaves. Each young man and woman in this story must choose themselves about how to live their lives, whether it is a bad thing of the system or living a positive life. I enjoy all the characters. But my favorite thing is Christophe, Anna Bella and Marcel.
