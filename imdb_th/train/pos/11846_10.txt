I like this movie a lot. The animation is very good and romantic. I like most of Bryan Adams songs and Hans Zimmer scores are great. What a lot of people don't know is how well it relates to the theme of Heart of Darkness / Apocalypse (What happens when something called "civilization" invades into someone else's house? Etc.). The opening scenes and songs are very exciting. This film lamented America that was once beautiful.
