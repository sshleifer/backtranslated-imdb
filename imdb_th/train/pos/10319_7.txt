After reading many other reviews for this film in IMDb, there was a consensus among the teachers that the film was not like a book based on it. At this point, I cannot comment, never read the adventures of any of the previous protagonists. However, what I can say with confidence is that it makes me feel that many examiners say they have to Through humor, of course; Come straight forward - this movie is so fun. <br /> <br /> Okay .. So I have to admit that this movie doesn't represent the character. But asking this to become Clear view ?? .. People who have problems with this movie also lament the fact that the Batman 60s series is not faithful to the original DC Comics characters? Or there may still be unrest in the same person that Flash Gordon in 1980. The film set off from the original series too. <br /> <br /> The point is, yes, this movie is an incredible charm! <br /> <br /> Former Tarzan Ron Ely plays the hero in this bar. (And is similar to Gary Busey in the boot!) And is supported by famous actors Have a ball and their role Also watch out for the short appearance but highly welcomed by the favorite Michael Berryman horror movie. <br /> <br /> The best scene? Too far to choose But watch the hilarious facial expressions adopted when the waiter and his people give the ultimate trend of ordering coke, lemon juice and milk on official occasions! The scene that is often mentioned at the end of the movie where Savage tackles the sea captain who uses various martial arts stuck on the screen! ?? There is no value. <br /> <br /> It's easy to say, this movie is not serious and it's more fun. Fun from beginning to end! (And you will sing John Phillip Sousa's song adaptation of the theme for later warranty!)
