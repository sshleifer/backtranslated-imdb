I have to start by apologizing because I think the first 75-80% of this movie is hilarious. Mostly because of Brad Pitt's performance. <br /> <br /> Everyone's performances are quite good. But Brad stole the movie The atmosphere is perfect in all respects. I'm not a big fan of Pitt. But this thing must be one of his best roles forever. <br /> <br /> Brutal, honest and brave. Every good word in explaining this film <br /> <br /> I have read previous reviews and the person said that the reason for the previous violence was unexplained, but they Thank you for not having to go into the graphic details to get their score. <br /> <br /> Overall, I gave this to 9 because every bar scene 1 or 2 is effective I think humor in the first half or more is suitable for this underrated movie.
