Frailty - 8/10 - is a name that is not sensitive and headlines "Bill Paxton Directs" This is an old image that is cute and exciting. In the end, it may end up being the cousin of the "The Shining" Southern Gothic --- but hey, that's a very enjoyable idea. It also has a distorted plot ... and a very vague moral message. This is the type of movie that many years later, people will wake up late at night using basic cables and make the bees fear themselves. See it. Too bad director Bill Paxton had to hire himself to star ... Oh well .... still a good demon.
