A truly remarkable movie, a possible concept of predicting a terrifying future. The world is too populated, the heat that exceeds expectations due to the damaged ozone layer and all our natural resources are used. In this vicious society, we have the wonderful Charlton Heston as a detective, noir style, who tries to understand the truth behind the murder, as opposed to the legend of Edward G Robinson in the noir movie that changed in the last performance br /> <br /> One of the pictures that will be with me forever from this movie is the crowd that lives along the path and the way in which Thorne (Heston) must jump through them every time he uses it. br /> <br /> The use of movie music is also valuable, even if there is no normal score. But the opening theme is good and the music follows us here in Simonson's apartment, and especially Beethoven in the euthanasia clinic is outstanding.
