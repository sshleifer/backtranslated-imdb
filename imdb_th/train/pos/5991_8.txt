The sequels of angels with dirty faces in their name only. Angels washed their faces and suffered from the traditional arrangement of the Dead End. In truth, with the appearance of Dead End Kids and Ann Sheridan This thing should be treated as a sequel to Angels With Dirty Faces, at least for continuity. <br /> <br /> Ann Sheridan's speech is the true light of this film. To paraphrase an ancient idea, Ann Sheridan can read from the phone book for two hours and I'll buy a DVD! <br /> <br /> The other benefit of this movie is the chemistry between Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately, the view of this film is far behind. For a better example of the Sheridan-Reagan pair, I recommend Juke Girl or Kings Row.
