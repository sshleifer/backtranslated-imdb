I saw this movie for the first time when I was born in high school, and this movie stuck with me over the years. It's not about soundtracks or movies or even bad conversations and performances. It's about educational purposes and the message behind it is the most important. It's not a sin to have children when you are a teenager and still in high school and it's not a bad thing as well, but it is a problem. This wonderful movie and if they do, they obviously don't get the message behind it all. It's about not getting a chance when you have sex. Every woman can conceive for the first time. It's not a myth. You don't have to lose your dreams. But they need to use your back seat in the future because you have a child to think first. <br /> <br /> This film has a clear message behind: just reject!
