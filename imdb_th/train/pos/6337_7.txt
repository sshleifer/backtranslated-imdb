I have a terrifying fascination with tornadoes for over 40 years since my fifth grade teacher, my native Texas, tells the story of the people he saw in his youth. Fortunately, I lived my entire life in the mid-Atlantic where tornadoes are rare and often not as severe as in the Midwest. But I have two encounters once in PA and another in NJ. Decades ago <br /> <br /> I like the family scene, especially the conflict between Jack and Dan Hatch. When a tornado approached, Dan knew what he had to do most, and he might learn this in school because I knew that the safety of tornadoes was important in the United States. However, the characters in the movie do two things that some people think should be done or safe to do in a tornado, but it really shouldn't be done or not safe. <br /> <br /> When the siren rings for the first time Dan and Arthur walk through the house and open the window. For many years, this is what people have been told to do. But the tornado safety website now recommends doing this. In addition, people also show that they are hiding in the tunnel. This method was popularized by the early 1990s video created by the T.V team during a relatively weak tornado in Kansas. However, in the most severe tornado, people can be sucked out of these passages. This happened during the outbreak in May 1999 in Oklahoma. <br /> <br /> The tornado in this film was popular during the fall season. (Then, again, in my intimate encounters occurred at the end of September) In addition, they traveled from the north-west to the south-east while the storm like this in the northern hemisphere from the southwest. To the northeast However, this is not all unusual. The famous tornado that made Joliet, Illinois, in the early 1990s travel in that direction. (Just as it relates to my other close encounters) <br /> <br /> I think this movie should be placed. This movie is based on a book based on real events. That occurred on 3 June 1980, but it is still an interesting story
