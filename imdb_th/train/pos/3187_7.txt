A few years ago I bought many $ 1 DVDs with two films, each one. One of them has the Three Broadway Girls (alternate names for The Greeks Had Word for Them) and one of these is Happy Go Lovely. Basically, it is a backstage comedy movie made in Scotland and is concerned about Incorrect identity associated with a dancer traveling from a millionaire limousine. Where is Vera Ellen a dancer and wow! Ceasar Romero is her producer who takes her chance after the leading heroine leaves because he thinks she is dating a millionaire that I just mentioned about cars. And David Niven is a rich man who, when looking for Vera Ellen, is mistaken for a journalist who should interview her. But Romero stalled What I just mentioned can cause confusion, but (mostly) makes sense if you are willing to check your brain while watching this charming movie with wonderful musical numbers performed by Ms.-Vera. Ellen Romero can be a little crazy here. But Niven has always been a favorite of all. The publication I saw was quite good considering the age and the fact that it was in the public domain. And Vera Ellen is quite good with her role because she is not an actor Therefore, in that note, I would like to introduce Happy Go Lovely for movie lovers who like old music plays.
