My wife and I brought our 13-year-old son to this movie and were very pleased with the amazing fun of this film. It has a special appeal for boys and men who remember their childhood. But women still enjoy movies It was refreshing to see movies showing that men and women were different in their emotional and social makeup. Children really did these strange things and often survived to tell stories and make their mothers. Stupid! We enjoyed this movie so much that my son and an 11 year old friend and I, a 23 year old daughter, went to watch this movie the next day. We had more fun for the second time and everyone was happy. It was clean and performed happily by the pre-teen actors, reminiscent of TV Classic "Freaks and Geeks". We all felt that it would become a popular song like "Freaks & Geeks" that didn't survive In the first season But sold all DVDs Try it out, especially if you have a boy and you will find it encouraging conversations about fun and safety! Women will love it because of the opportunity to say "The boy is very strange!" Don't miss ...
