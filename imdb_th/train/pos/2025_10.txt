Anne Brontes, the epic novel THE TENANT OF WILDFELL HALL should be studied and read throughout schools and libraries and people's living rooms. It is a magical story and tells the "real" truth about alcoholism and destructive marriages, and the mother struggles to keep her son away from her cruel husband. A similar current story that we see and hear and I believe that people can learn a lot from reading this book. Based on the true experience that the author has returned to in the 1840s, <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is a great book and moves very well. I'm sure Anne will be happy with the production method. <br /> <br /> Great performance and great location.
