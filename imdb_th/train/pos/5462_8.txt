First of all, if you plan to look at this, make sure to see the UNCUT version (although it is very interesting to go back and look at the scenes that have been modified due to censorship). This film is about a young woman who played by Barbara Stanwee, her own father from the age of 14, forced into prostitution. When her father suddenly departed, she could go out to the world by herself. After reading about Nietzsche's philosophy about life, she used sexual feelings to manage men, give what she wanted and left them in ruins and desperate for her love. In this film, she has become more materialistic and distorted, and the audience begins to wonder if she has any feelings about morality. Overall, Baby Face is a very shocking movie about most sex scenes. Expected to be seen in black and white movies Although there is no sexual expression on the screen But it's clear what happened to the camera. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy watching this movie and I believe that most modern audiences will enjoy at least if it is. Especially with shock movie I think while watching that walking is slow. But I think most movies at the first time see them. In fact, I think almost every movie I've seen since the early 30s had a problem with a little or some pacing, not "flowing" correctly. This may be just a craft for creating a movie. Perfect? Will take a few more years Compare movies from 1939 and compare them to movies in the early 30s, and I think you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Again, I'm very happy that I can watch original movies. It really makes a big difference. John Wayne's fans will be surprised to see him in this movie before he is famous for an unprecedented role.
