If you enjoy romantic comedies, you'll find the story of two 30-year-old singles who fell in love during a pleasant American League match. On the other hand, if you are waiting for Kill Bill Volume 3 or Sin City 2, you should stay away. The story consists of a man who has been assigned to meet a friend, a girl, a girl, a friend and a guy. There are even men who meet the girl's pet dog scene. That's all for the course in this movie. However, what I like about this is the plot that delves deep into the decision-making process that people do when they begin to realize that their romantic interest is incomplete. The storyline focuses on answering questions. How too many quirks and love, how much to brave those quirks? It is interesting to see the characters perform well because they are deep down. (If we accept) We all have strange habits. Barrymore works very well in her role and Fallon sorta surprised me - he is also good. I rate that 7 out of 10 is a romantic comedy. Add one point if you are a baseball fan or involve a lover. Add another point if you are a Red Sox fan and subtract two points if you are a Yankee fan.
