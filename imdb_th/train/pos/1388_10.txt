"The daytime ends" is an incredible picture. In some ways it is better "Close encounter with the third category" (I like the wonderful free flicks) Special magical effects But that's an important part of the fun. Jim davis gives great performance in this movie It may be one of the best roles he has ever had in a feature. Very good music score The story doesn't make sense. But that will make everything INTRIGUING the same as many of the best art "The end of the day" is not afraid to be delicate and vague. "The end of the day" may be an inexpensive indie movie. But it is not too much to compare with the actual European movies in the fifties and sixties (Which is mostly low-budget productions)
