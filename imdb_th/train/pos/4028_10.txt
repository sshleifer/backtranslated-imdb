I came to Pinjar from a different background than most other examiners posted here. I'm quite new to Bollywood movies and born and raised in the United States. So I don't have an extensive basis for comparing Pinjar and other Indian movies. Fortunately, there's no need to compare. <br /> <br /> Pinjar stands on its own, whether it's a masterpiece. > <br /> On one line, I can tell you that Pinjar is one of the most important things. Movies that come out of the studio anytime, anywhere At an attractive level, it is possible that India will be equivalent to "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" if promoted enough in the United States. This may be a movie that put Bollywood on the map of America very well. The American film continues to have a long-lasting love affair with "Gone With the Wind" and while Pinjar doesn't borrow from the plot, there is something similar. No less than that is great (According to US standards) takes 183 minutes. <br /> <br /> The backdrop of the partition of India-Pakistan in 1947-48 was an interesting scene for children. Women were imprisoned by the situation and pushed for problems. She had no hands to create. Put her in a position that cannot be prevented But will survive but will grow - and flourish. <br /> <br /> If the story is absent in any way, it is in Puro's growth exhibition (a supporter) as a person will show. Seen better - at least for Western audiences who are not familiar with Indian culture - if her character "History" has been fully developed at the beginning of the movie. But that will stretch the movie 3 hours to 3 1/2 hours or more Because this film takes less than a minute and things that make editing cannot be cut off Better that the audience must fill out some of the things that happened earlier than leaving the rest. <br /> <br /> I can use many words to describe Pinjar: "Pain", "Disturb "," Interesting "" heart-wrenching "comes into your mind immediately, but" upgrading "may be the right thing. Any story that points to the indomitable spirit of the human spirit towards the worst and the victory of Puro - while not immediately visible to those around you - no less than inspiration. For the strength of the story alone, I can't recommend this movie enough. <br /> <br /> Equally inspired is the depiction of Puro of Urmila Matondkar, often overlooked by young actors. The younger Urmila has a unique ability to create a completely reliable character in every role she plays. She not only acts as a part of Puro is still alive in the character selection of Manoj Bajpai as Rashid as inspiration. He manages some things that Indian film heroes are too little to do: sensitive. His expressions and differences are important to the role. He brought more dangers at the beginning of the movie by staring at him rather than the rioters who carried the sword together. <br /> <br /> If you see only one Bollywood movie in your life
