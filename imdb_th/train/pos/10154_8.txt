This is Michael Vartan's first film I have ever seen - I have never seen Alias ​​- and I want to know if a guy can do it or not. He is sure that he can and is a favorite in this movie. Henstridge is definitely beautiful, but she is usually more physical and action roles, so I find that she is good and cute in the different "sweet" roles of teachers. Some negative comments that I read are true. The film is full of ancient ideas and stories that are not as real as the movie, although every character in the movie says that they look good. I think there will be screen chemistry. However, I enjoy this movie. Good location, cute characters and good looks and supporting actors are quite good. If you expect to see great romance, this is not it. But if you want to watch a movie that looks innocent, pleasant and has a cute character, it is very good.
