Great movie, just without a doubt. Great stories and great performances, whether Amitabh, Akshay, Shefali, Priyanka, Boman or Rajpal, the Hindi film industry are going to be shameless with Mallika and Ko. This movie is completely rude. Bound to fail in our Indian society infection But the text and the concept of this film are absolutely fantastic. Anu Malik (boring imitation cat) can be avoided and Ismail Darbar or Himmesh Reshmmiya can be used as a musician. I think Vipul Shah should be touched. Gujarati is a little bit, especially in music. Anu Malik is the worst musician and he considers himself to be a pop star. But this is not a movie that must exist - he looks good in Govinda-style music only. I feel that good serious music with good Ghazals or sad songs may make this movie more memorable.
