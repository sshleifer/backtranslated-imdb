This film is not about the battle of cats and mice as mentioned in other comments. It's about a cat that lives 8 out of 9 lives and is now afraid to lose the last cat. The cat is scary and scared of death all the time. Therefore, the name "Fear Cat". The previous life of the cat scared of his cat, a ghost that came from different eras at the time and tried to kill him all the time But he is the most terrifying person in the ninth life, representing the clouds in the form of number 9 and spitting the verse now very old But still fun for children if you get a copy <br /> <br /> I watch this movie almost every day since I was a child: o)
