The film is directed by Renny Harlin, the magic of Finland. Stallone is Gabe Walker Cats and mice on the mountain with brutal terrorists. Renny Harlin knows how to direct action movies. Stallone wants this role to return to follow. Snowy mountains are a great place for action movies and those who are better in directing movies with snow, ice, cold weather and worse than Finnish humans. Action is good! The music in this film is beautiful. The bad guy is John Litghow, another star Micheal Rooker (like serialkiller), Janine Turner (Strong Medicine) The location is in a beautiful location and is a very exciting movie. Overall good movie **** / ***** <br /> <br /> Memorize Extreme ääliöt: Special Collector's Edition with special things Comig soon in Finland. Direct to the video
