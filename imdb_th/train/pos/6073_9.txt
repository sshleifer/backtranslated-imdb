My college professor says that Othello is probably Shakespeare's best drama. I don't know if I agree with him or not. I bought this video version of the film. First of all, I love Kenneth BRanagh. As Iago, he is perfectly sophisticated and works well in this adjustment. Surprisingly, he did not direct, but with the role of Lawrence Fishburn, showing that American actors can play Shakespeare, just as British actors can do. It's not that there are issues about England and Americans about this issue. In fact, if we all work together, Shakespeare can reach the masses that should be made. Apart from Shakespeare's other tragedies, this story is also related to the competition. Things that have existed since the beginning of time The relationship between Iago and Emilia seems to be better and shows the complexity of the unification, while Othello loves Desdemona. With all his heart, he is weak for jealousy and fear, causing her to lose non-Moore people Like Cassio, it was a great scene at the end of the movie. But I will not reveal the ending It's worth watching. I think they fix a lot of lines up to 2 hours, but they often fix Shakespeare.
