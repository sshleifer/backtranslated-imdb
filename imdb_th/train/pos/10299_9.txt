I'm a big fan of Jim Carrey. I laughed. ASS went out between Liar Liar and Ace Ventura. I liked him in his serious movie, especially the Truman Show. Of course he was very funny in this movie. But there are some very serious parts and he easily pulls it out He is a versatile actor. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the actors, I'm happy with Jennifer Aniston's performance. I think she is more than just two, three great tits and a wonderful ass. Morgan Freeman makes God very cool. For Steven Karel, his limited scenes are very funny, especially in the anchor scene. <br /> <br /> Overall, I have to give it a score. 9. Good performances, funny scripts and some situations that severe Very good movie
