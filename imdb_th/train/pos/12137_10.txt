This movie is really great! I saw it over and over again over the years. The reason for this film is easy to see again. Of course, the acting received from the young Bette Davis, she not only steals every scene she is But really much more beautiful and can take better pictures here (Not talking about sex) than she used to be in any movie she did in her home studio, made by RKO Radio Pictures). She wears very distinctive cosmetics and has a very attractive hairstyle. And oh, there is a cute big eyes (Especially in the restaurant scene that originated in London's Soho), her body was very curvy when she was still a child, picking up heavy items in the cheap rompers she wore for the scene of her big explosion With Leslie Howard and Oh Boy, she is the complete powerhouse in that scene Howard was a bit too worried. But he caught the hero's sensitivity. Frances Dee scored that Sally, the young, cute and cute, who really loved him. Max Steiner's score was both charming and angry. Great performances and thirty flavors make this a must-see item in classic novels.
