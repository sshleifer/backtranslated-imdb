Previously I wrote that I liked the "Titanic" crying ending (many times) and I was a 60 year old man. I also wondered why this great movie, which received many awards and admiration. From many critics, rated only 7.0 by imdb.com users. <br /> <br /> I look at the details of User ratings, while 29.0% of the total score, scored 10 points, 10.7% scored 1 point. The result is 10.7% of imdb users who do not have these reasons, causing the overall score to decrease to 7.0 <br / > <br /> In my previous comments, I blamed this unusual voting pattern. (Sudden increase in 1 rating with high ratings 10, gradually decreasing then returning course The only thing: hatred for Leonardo DiCaprio. Believe me. I have customized the chat room to be able to watch teasing by young people. (Most young men) who lost his reputation They definitely hate men and they will not be involved in giving him credit for "Titanic" (to answer other users: I'm not talking about someone who doesn't like movies and give 5 or 6 etc. Everyone has and has their own taste. But no one can convince me that the overall 7.0 imdb score for "Titanic" was drawn to that level with the number of ridiculous ratings. 1 Too much is a fair reflection of the overall animation. ) <br /> <br /> Let me illustrate my point by comparing the imdb user's voting style of "Titanic" with 5 randomly selected box offices and "bombs". Important (there are many but 5 people This will prove my point.) "Heaven's Gate" (1980) was quickly pulled out of the theater after a terrible box office show and the ranking of imdb's voters: 23.2% of the top 10 and 9.2% 1 point (overall score 6.1) "Big Top Pee-wee" (1988) received 4.3% 10 points and 9.9% 1 points (overall score 4.5) "Cat People" (1982) received 6.1% points 10 and 2.6% 1 score (overall score 5.8) "Blind Date" (1987) received 3.0% 10 points and 2.8% 1 score (overall score 5.3) "Jumpin 'Jack Flash" (1986) received Nancy 4.4% and 3.7% 10 1 rating (Total 5.2), these films have nothing in common with "Titanic" it? The percentage of all their ratings is lower !!!! Than "Titanic" and none of these designers have been nominated for a single award again. "Titanic" received 10.7% 1 vote! Compare with 5 movies that I just talked about. <br /> <br /> Are there other explanations other than Leo's hatred? <br /> <br />
