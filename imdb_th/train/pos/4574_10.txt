I would like to say at first that I have a cerebral palsy and I enter this film, expecting to have a cost for the show. I confidently left the theater that they wanted to be actors with cerebral palsy in this role, even though I knew that was not the case. In general, the performance was excellent, with a special nod to Brenda Friger and Hugh O'Connor. (I believe that it is his name) as a young Christie Brown. Christy is sometimes brash, arrogant and rude. In other words, human beings. This movie, along with Gaby: A True Story and the King Gimp documentary, is a wonderful picture of CP's life. It's not a complete picture. But is a good example of people with disabilities as humans Most recommended
