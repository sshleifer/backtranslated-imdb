Next to "Star Wars" and "Wizard of Oz", this is still one of the greatest fantasy movies ever created. It's a real shame, not well known as a former movie. (It may be because it is attached to a legendary story rather than a contemporary or sci-fi setting and is of English, meaning a small market for movies.) But it's great. <br /> <br /> Just like a great family movie, one can be an adult or even a teenager who will enjoy this movie. (I am now 18 years old) but we must appreciate Classic movies first I absolutely love this movie. It has an unusual musical score by Miklos Rozsa (probably my favorite classic movie score) which is a competitor to any score of John Williams "Star Wars". Fast speed. But not flashy, beautiful dresses, conversation and color use (Both scenes and movies) won an Oscar) and special effects that won the Oscars of the most advanced (Sometimes still amazing) and of course the heat of June Duprez looks like Catherine Zeta-Jones's rival princess. (She looks like Jones in style!) <br /> <br /> In summary, this Is one of my all-time favorite movies (next to "Robin Hood's Adventure") and deserves more attention It is a real adventure of enchantment, and along with "Robin Hood" is an island movie in my desert that I can watch over and over again without being annoyed. <br /> <br /> Stars: **** ( excellent)
