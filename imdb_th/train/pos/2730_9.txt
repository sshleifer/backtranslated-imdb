I saw this in the theater during the first release and it was annoying because I was sure it would still exist. It was the first part of the year 68 and this is still a march in cities across America and recently there was a big massacre in my hometown that I saw this. The freshness of the event near the house combined with the real story, the drama that was created to experience a very annoying drama. It made the life of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson a wonderful performance. I am familiar with the novel from the real events by Truman Capote and the screenplay and direction by Richard Brooks. Jones scored effectively. I just saw this a few times since It's true too Almost like witnessing a crime and riding along with the murderer I will give this 9.0 out of what is possible. 10. The society is sensitive to violence and crime today which seems to be slow and tame and can be viewed with less effect. But for people who are over 50 years old, mentally.
