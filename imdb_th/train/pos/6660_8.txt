"Gandhi is a husband and father?" There is always talk by people in India. 'Gandhi ... My father' is a story that only a few people know such details. A deep understanding of Gandhi's personal life. <br /> <br /> Overall, I like this movie and the Jariwala movies, Akshay Khanna and Shefali Shah work well. Most of the movies are background images. A good desktop ... is an admirable work. Traditional Indian music is a background score in some parts of the film, giving a good feeling to the incident. <br /> <br /> However, what I don't like is the style of lecture in many points. <br /> <br /> Overall, it works well by Anil Kapoor Productions. "Must see once" 8/10
