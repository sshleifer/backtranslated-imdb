While it is not uncommon and astray, like Takashi Miike's next movie, some stories are very good crime drama. <br /> <br /> The basic story is the story of Japanese police and Chinese parents trying to Destroy the Chinese villain The confusing thing is that his brother served as a lawyer for the villain and his gang. This movie is more complicated than many complicated stories, both of which make things interesting and distract from the narrative drive. It was complicated and wasted about an hour in this film that made the film less than a great movie. (It's a very good story) This is something that should be worth watching, especially if you don't mind. <br /> The warning of violence when it explodes and is disgusting. There is also a semi-graphic sex show. If not your cup of tea, proceed with caution. <br /> <br /> 7 or 8 out of 10
