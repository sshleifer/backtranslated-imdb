Sly's hottest and best action movie is a fun, wonderful movie with an interesting character, stable performances and the direction of Renny Harlins. Be confident in style. Stallone is not interesting in his action movies and he looks as part of the action scene. This is one of the best action movies of the year and is one of the most exciting and fun classic movies of the 90s. As a Stallone fan, this is one thing I look back on. With fond memories Many excellent action and cunning in the form of male action. Action movie lovers love this movie because it has many highlights that make this movie good. This film looks fantastic and has received great support from Janine Turner, Michael Rooker and John Lithgow ****
