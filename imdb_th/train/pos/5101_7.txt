John Travolta, honkeyton, the largest in the world, and mechanical bull ... What are you asking for! Yes, you may not get many surprises or deep meaning in this one. Even though I often find it very fun to see this narrow-minded romance, Bud (Travolta) and Sissy (Debra Winger) meet at Gilley's and fall in love. Hardcore scene, honkeytonk, enjoy dancing, riding a cow, a mechanism and of course there must be a brawl. It was a great soundtrack of the country in 1980. The story "Looking for love everywhere is wrong", "Satan goes to Georgia" and "Hello Texas" by Jimmy Buffett. Please share your cowboy boots and boots. scootin! <br /> <br /> *** (from 4)
