It's very difficult to rate this movie. As an entertainment value for the audience in the 21st century, it failed miserably. However, for students of movies and movies in the past, it was a "Show of Shows" jewel that was filmed to compete with MGM's successful "Hollywood Revue of 1929", which still survived complete with the scene of Technicolor. br /> <br /> The purpose of all the performances of celebrities is to show Studio's silent stars, especially in speaking roles and showing how they can change. However, Warner Bros. seems to have forgotten this story and has many performances and stars that they didn't do under the term contract. Such as Ben Turpin, Lloyd Hamilton, Beatrice Lillie and even the marching band At the same time, their greatest ability - Al Jolson - obviously absent. Despite having a high salary, he was not able to be forced to participate. Almost every performance was too long, and the film played like dozens or more of Vitaphone shorts. The ending is too long. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this movie is two numbers from Winnie Lightner - "Pingo Pongo" and "Singin in the bathtub", a few numbers with Nick Lu. Spartacus, John Barrymore, Shakespeare and Chinese fantasy "Li Poi" with Nick Lucas and Mirna Drifting This last number is only part of the movie that still lives in Technicolor and it is quite interesting. Players in these good acts are Warner Bros. stars in the long run, so the director may know how to play his strengths since he is familiar with them. <br /> <br /> This movie Act as an overview A strange spot in film history - 1929, which is a bridge year between the two eras - the silent and sounding era and the 20s roaring and falling Only two years later, the film will have a completely different actor, since Warner Bros. will abandon the quiet era stars and the stars they hired just to produce the first musical in favor of those stars. Causing Warner Bros. and feelings - James Cagney, Joan Blondell, Edward G. Robinson and others
