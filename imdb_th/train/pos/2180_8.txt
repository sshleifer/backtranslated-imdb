Louis Brooks gave a great performance in a well-built French melodrama. She plays the name of Lucienne, who falls in love with a man named Andre. She dreams that she will be in a higher position in life. She saw an opportunity in the European beauty pageant. But Andre is angry when he learns that she came in and asks her to withdraw. She tried to bring her work back only to discover that she was chosen to be Miss France and will enter the main page of the competition. <br /> <br /> This is a story of love, loss. And a passionate end-to-end decision. The film was filmed by director Augusto Gina and film director Rudolf Mate and Louis Nee. The filming style is more like a modern movie than a Hollywood movie in the 30s and shows. To the different styles of Europeans There are many shortcuts and travel shots, most of which are done with great skills and are full of life. The high energy of the first three movies is slightly reduced. But came back better again in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> The performance was very good by every employer, but Louise Brooks was especially memorable. Her silent screen, although this is a radio transmitter But because of her quiet style, there is a surprisingly contemporary feeling that she has not changed into conversations very well. The early scenes in the work are especially important, especially when Louis uses a remarkably expressive eye to convey the increased feelings of misery and distraction from being trapped in a life that You don't want I wonder if it has done better. <br /> <br /> This film was created for a great final scene, a powerful and stylish art photography. This is some of the best things in the early days of the film and the tragedy shows a greater tragedy, which is the last chapter starring Louis Brook. She is not only a great beauty that looks amazing in a swimsuit, she is an important talented actress who throws it away. We are all the poorer for that. <br /> <br /> This movie is less known than her German movie with G.W Pabst, but I think it's better. I think this crew is better than storytelling than Pabst, and while Prix de Beaute may lack the profound moral complexities of the Pabst movie, it's much easier to follow and combine tasks that are more agile. And not hurt that Louise's singing was done by Edith Piaf as well. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is the classic movie Louise Brooks that should be worth looking for.
