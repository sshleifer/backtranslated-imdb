This is a very funny comedy about the community in central London, discovering that they are not English. But is an annex to Burgundy of France. <br /> <br /> Movie features Actor Stanley Holloway (better known as Alfred Doolittle in MY FAIR LADY), as well as a host of other classic cartoons of that era. <br /> <br /> This story Obviously from the news at the time When the government of Canada "Official" provides rooms for members of the European dynasty This idea reminded me of the real-life case of Hutt River in Western Australia, where landowners "split up" from the Australian government due to disputes on wool quotas. (Never accepted by the government of Western Australia or Australia) <br /> <br /> This is a great script that plays a lot of political and economic problems, such as "Yes Minister"; Including being a slightly strange character as well
