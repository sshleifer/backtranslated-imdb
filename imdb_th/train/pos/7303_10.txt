I managed to see this classic for the first time a couple of weeks ago. Almost 30 years ago, I thought that the horrific moment would be quite tame. I was wrong. My spine Even the performance is excellent. Jamie Lee Curtis is great and the great Donald Pleasance <br /> <br /> The downside is that it is quite slow to start. It's all imitating, like Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream looks very tame. I can't say it's the best because I have never seen many of them. The only thing I remember was Starman. (I think he did) Halloween is a wonderful achievement of horror genre.
