Steve Biko and Donald Woods are long-time friendships. But attractive The first half of this movie is the strongest that we see the bonding that occurs between the two men and the way they help each other. But in the second half it was not as strong as it should be due to the removal of the Biko character, but it was also an interesting film with great performances from Kline and Washington in the movies that were placed on the map Washington was nominated for the Best Supporting Actor Award for the first time. Overall, it is a well-made movie that can be slightly reduced. 7/10 .____________________________________
