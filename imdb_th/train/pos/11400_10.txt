I feel the need to answer comments posted on the first page of this movie's page because some things are a bit wrong. <br /> <br /> At first I posted a quote from the original poster. But I'm not sure Is appropriate because this is an index "Comments" and not a message board (Although we used to use 'em before, before IMDb would add a movie message board), so I would fix this unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> First of all, you may not know this, but Gene Kelly became famous In playing "Pal Joey" on Broadway in the original production, when Vincente Minnelli decided to create Gershwin's "panorama", he wanted Kelly's character to be more complicated than the "goody two shoes" role he played in most of his movies ( Alan J. Lerner was instructed to create a new story in Paris based on the story of "Pal Joey". This made Kelly have the opportunity to play his famous role. From Broadway, although Warners would have a higher price than MGM for the right to "Pal Joey". In my opinion, the WB "Pal Joey" movie is the remains, but Sinatra is suitable for The role but other problems that sink into this film (Script changes and bad directions ============== ==================================== = <br /> <br /> You complain that Kelly's picture Not good, even claiming your art education to prove the point. But you miss the fact that Kelly's bad art is clearly designed to be bad and necessary for the story / character. The picture is not good. The audience knows well. Kelly is not ready for the show even though he knows, though. Milo has succeeded him to the point that he almost believes her. But the important thing is that the audience will not sit and say that "But he is a great artist. If he only has a chance! "You want the audience to fully realize his shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Then you complain that he sabotaged his interest in the program again. You don't understand the structure of The story rejected him because he didn't want to feel gigolo and because he knew he wasn't ready for the exhibition. His enthusiasm for the exhibition was not as good as "Joey "'s enthusiasm for" starting a nightclub ", but it served the same function in the plot. Remember that it's important in "Pal Joey" (drama) that Joey quit his nightclub after he realized he didn't deserve it. As well as performing arts If Kelly's painting is really good, it will undermine this point. ================================================== = <br /> <br /> Then you complain that Caron and Kelly doesn't have "chemistry". I guess it's in the eyes of the audience. I agree, chemistry between them is not as strong as they should be. But for me it's ok Compared to the "forced" love that is worse than the relationship between Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in "The Pride and the Passion" ===================== ============================= == <br /> <br /> When you say the last part of the dance Big, nothing related to other things in this movie. It shows that you don't dig under the surface of this movie as a symbol. Many elements in the dance sequence relate to stories and characters and through dance, the plot is modified through images and symbols. It's about finding love, enjoying love, then losing love (he looks around and his love disappears). The movement of the symphony was created to make each part of the dance scene reflect the steps. Separate of the Parisian art and also separating the phase of their relationship If you don't see that, it's not the film's fault. Of course, not "burden of shit" ========================================== ========
