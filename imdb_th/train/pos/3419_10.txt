Only "Welcome home", my 23 year old daughter from Iraq, in one year, Camp Anaconda Medical Support Unit. I feel compelled to buy this DVD. I want to hear the feelings of the vet that comes back again to try to understand her thoughts on arrival and not have to wait until something bad happens. Regardless of your war and peace, this movie is a great starting point for all Americans to start treating our emotional illnesses. The most important order of all movies is "Take Action" and the incredible movie emotion problem. I would like to recommend this movie to every veterinarian in an adult family and ask them to follow the plan by listening to the comfort and help the veteran war veteran that comes back freely. /> Fast forward My daughter saw this DVD. Get a story about her emotions and actually have a new contract for 6 years. She spends her time using sand. Local balan children receive first-rate treatment for various common diseases that normally cannot be paid for free with bodyguards and translators. She looked over her shoulder at her Iraqi tour. "We changed the heart and some thoughts back there." A wonderful DVD that you have to open your mind and see all aspects.
