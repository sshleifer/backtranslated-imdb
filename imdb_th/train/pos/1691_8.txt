This movie is funny and suitable for all ages. Of course family entertainment The actors performed well in the Big Bean West of Illinois. Where we have to assume that nothing happens because of the excitement (before the invasion) of the decade is a new ramp (And only) from the state, such places attract tedious and unlikely attention for the invasions of the Martians But these Mars are not perfect, even if they are equipped with a formidable weapon and are a fairly dangerous weapon ... their Martians die and throw a proper accent to make us the audience and the local people want to help. They ... get out of the world. JJ Anderson plays a duck that eats Halloween meat that is very young. Watch this movie for laugher and entertainment; Can't stimulate the mind But it is subtle and fun
