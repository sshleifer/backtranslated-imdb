I will talk about the movie quickly here: It is a very engaging story about the destructive properties of wasteful determination. An Italian woman who is unable to connect with her political fiancÃ©e in prison. (Due to inappropriate attitudes and independent ways of life) find love and passion for a new young lover whom she has sexual relations Anxiety, anger, tenderness and attention circling around in the atmosphere of the story equals tranquility that seems peaceful to both sides. This film gives an unstable emotion that permeates the political conflict that the audience has lost. (Unless you have in-depth knowledge about Italian politics during the 80s), I found this movie interesting ... The thing that destroyed it was quite an oral sex scene that the actors led by men ... It wasn't. Have simulated and made little imagination. There are other scenes of sex in the movie which I feel are necessary because they show the madness and loneliness that the characters live. But the oral sex scene, I feel the attention of the real story. It sailed smoothly until that point and when an embarrassing sex scene appeared (Which caused the hoopla to go back that day). It's like pressing a roadblock It was shaking and unnecessary and I was in a camp that believed that this movie would not be harmed if the scene was removed. And what is unfortunate is that this scene may cause people to not be able to see interesting movies, which I believe it should be worth watching because there are things going on under the surface, emotions and chaos in the next floor > <br /> Overall: Great movies are blocked by unwanted sex scenes.
