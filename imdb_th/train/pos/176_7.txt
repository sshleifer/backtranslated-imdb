Beware of spoilers. This movie, okay, Goldie Hawn and Chris Sarandon are the two best people there. Okay, that stupid foreign man that (Spoiler here) Trade with a biker for his clothes as a joke. The boss of this man is also good. But this movie is really belonging to Sarandon and Hawkins These two should have more time on the screen together. The chemistry is great. Bathroom scenes - Wow! Romantic, sweet, cute <br /> <br /> Hawn is a stupid cocktail waiter who saves foreigners and ends up at the White House in the middle because of the greed of politicians If you want to talk about Sarandon This spoiler is a romantic / political movie that is unusual and satisfying in terms of politics rather than romance. It touches on political problems and just skips on the romantic area. <br /> <br />
