Robert Stacks never lost the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor from the role as Kyle in "Written on the Wind" and Anthony Quinn's 12-minute performance in "Lust for Life". The stack plays an alcoholic son with problems in the oil industry. He lives under the shadow of his friend. Mitch is played by Rock Hudson. Both of them loved the same woman, Lucy (Lauren Baal), who became Kyle's wife Marylee, Kyle's sister. (Dorothy Malone) is a drunken slut who loves Mitch.

He falls in love with Lucy, loyal to Kyle. He wants to work in Iran to avoid temptation. I wonder if he will be very worried about getting there today, no matter how much he is in love. <br /> <br /> Hudson and Bacol have less exciting roles here. - Mitch Hudson is a good person Confused for the rest of his life, and Bacall was Mitch's wife who found herself in a nightmare when her husband started drinking again after years of sobriety.

The director has a gift for this type of movie, and although he has many imitators But he was never equal
