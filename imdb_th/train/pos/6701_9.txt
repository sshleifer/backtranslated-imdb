I like the first 2 seasons because many good characters disappear later. Like most programs, it is rather slow at first and will improve in the next season. But this is definitely the opposite. Jenny from Season 1 and Valarie from Season 2 is a friend of Sabrina. I'm not interested in others. Jenny and Valarie are her best friends. I think for some reason, the producers want us not to like her college friends for some reason. They are cruel to Sabrina. But my favorite episode from Season 1 is the cat showdown and my favorite episode from Season 2 is the Witch Trash. That's the funniest episode. I think it's funny that Libby is popular. But she always jealous of Sabrina and seems to never have a true girlfriend But always wanted to be with Harvey I just hope they can do better. I also like the way in the first 2 seasons. During the opening credits, Sabrina will say a few words while wearing a dress, such as when the pilot she is in the witch dress. I like the way she says. "This is not me" When you try to change yourself to something else, that's what I think. But this is a really great show It's like Andy Griffith's performance in a good way because at first But when it changed color and Barney Fife went out, it was better. But i still like to watch But the only reason I watched the next season was because Saab What I mean by the opening sequence is: Name of the opening episode of Season 1-3 shows Sabrina in front of the mirror, which wears many different dresses and outfits. At the end, Sabrina will say something related to the outfit she wears and then disappear. The opening sequence of the fourth season consists of characters in bubbles. Credits launched in seasons 5-7 show Sabrina at various locations throughout Boston.
