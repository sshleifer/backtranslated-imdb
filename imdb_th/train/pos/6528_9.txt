I have seen this documentary at the Cannes Film Festival in a small 200-seat movie theater at the top of the main building at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I really came in. I love the mix of scary fictional scenes. It is an amazing design set. The scene looks like they were filmed in the 1920s or 1930s. <br /> <br /> And the music is very good. <br /> <br /> I rate this experience. 9/10 <br /> <br /> * Front spoiler * <br /> <br /> The documentary tells the horror of the blues-man with a black and white scene of a black man playing guitar and singing. It's really wonderful But this thing is still mixed in the new band and that may be one thing I don't like in this documentary. It is a link to modern rock bands that play blues in modern ways too. I do not appreciate how to throw garbage in this great blues song. This is an incomplete musical taste that I encountered when watching Wim Wenders Buena Vista Social Club. <br /> <br /> The documentary film is a first-hand applause in this film. Today, there are documentary screenings for everyone and general tourists on Croisette's beach at the outdoor cinema. Although the sand, the quality of the projection and the poor sound quality may make it a difficult experience for thousands of people sitting on the sand that night.
