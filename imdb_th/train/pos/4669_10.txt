If there are more than two charming actors, Peter Ustinoff and Maggie Smith, appear together in a more glamorous movie in 1968. I don't know who they are. I first saw this delightful little satiric jewel 25 years ago, aged 16, and I think any year I failed to sit down to see it again. It is clever, quirky, orderly, witty, sweet, subversive and charming. The romance of these two social sets is both funny and horrific. - No more than Maggie Smith's attempt to bring the right card onto the deck. The whole scene is funny. And thumbnails And that was the last thing that pinned Ustinov's worrying face while he asked "Are you fine?" - Has anyone ever created the appearance and sound of sacrifice for complete honesty and openness? I don't want to know anyone who doesn't like this movie.
