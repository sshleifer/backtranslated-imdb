Not every movie's work will provoke you superficially. I am ambitiously failing in a market with a large audience every day. While this cannot be described as a failure But the sum of the parts remains ambiguous The quality that is unreadable makes me very angry to see it over and over This is a challenging and provocative movie that is not elaborately wrapped. Problems with movies are in the structure. Its invisible plot appears to be crooked, as well as the second ending being pinned on. Although everything has amazing techniques But the movie was too long by that unit The long-awaited climax of Leo's awakening reaches about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Great movie filming often comes with the cost of an appropriate script. Composite inventions are provocative and engaging; The character is projected on the back. But his hand in the foreground is not The world that appears is intended, betrayed and ridiculous. Keep an eye on the technically memorable and amazing assassination that will make your jaw drop. <br /> <br /> The songwriting is amazing. Anyone who chooses to release a videotape (From printing) in pan and scan format must never be seen before Where is the DVD? <br /> <br /> It can't be realized who will give this bad opinion. You should see it at least once. You feel that von Trier goes out more than he can chew. But this movie ends with more perfection I wonder if he was familiar with Hitchcock's international journalist, who was also a devious European who also acted as an American seduction and many Welsh films that were very happy in the techniques he had made in von Trier films. The karma of innocent people in a society that does not forgive after Zentropa von Trier moved out of this technical experiment into sadness. The melody that has not been rated too much, such as Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark
