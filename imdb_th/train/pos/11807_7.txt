After seeing Dick Tracy in the 6.99 $ bin at Future Shop, I decided to go without knowledge and be a big fan of Mafia and Crime. I was surprised to see a fun and smart movie. Stable performances throughout This movie moves together, of course. It has a strong performance again from Warren Beatty, but the prominence of this film is Al Pacino and Madonna. I'm happy to find that Pacino has been nominated in His performance as a great gangster who tried to destroy the city Madonna is great, like a girl in distress. She impressed me a lot and added depth to her performance. If you are into the attitude of looking for a smart movie that has excellent performances and good scripts, try giving Dick Tracy a try. I don't think you will be disappointed. And watch the cameo from Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Kathy Bates and Dustin Hoffman as well as others
