Kubrick once again proved his brilliance, now in a horror film based on Stephen King's book. The same story Jack Torrance is a man in his forties, married to a child and has a past of problems and alcoholism. Overlook hotels in the state of Colorado suspend winter services due to severe weather and have paid a lot of work for facilities managers. Convenient in the last five months And Torrance, who wants to be a writer, finds it perfect But the manager advised Torrance about the loneliness in this place during the winter, which could be dangerous and told him that some former caretakers were crazy and killed his family. Even before they arrived there, his son, Danny, who had a number of imaginary friends that illuminated him in the future (shining), knew that the place was not good. When they installed themselves in the hotel, things started within a month. Jack began to act strange, frustrated and depressed. At this point, we knew that something was about to happen. But don't know when and how to do it Something terrifying happened, such as the appearance of two twin girls talking to Danny and someone who attacked him violently. They are not alone in this place. Later, Jack began to see other people and felt good about them immediately as if they were his family. Among them, the famous psychotic caregiver Delbert Grady Grady told Torrance that he had to kill his family because they were "intruders" in the hotel. Following this command, Jack went for the purpose and many things were worth. The most feared I've ever seen happened here. The ending is exciting and the audience is still interested and shocked until the last minute.
