This film has a lot of funny movies, not dark and Gordon Liu shines in this movie. He showed his funny side and it was really strange when he was beaten up. His practice is "unconventional" and anyone who thinks that a knot may be deadly? Great tactics and choreography very creative! <br /> <br /> Add Johnny Wang in the mix and you'll have a great final showdown! Don't mess with Manchurian thugs. They are ruthless!
