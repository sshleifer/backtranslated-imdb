Has anyone noticed that James Earl Jones is the waiter who serves when Hagarie's wife reveals that she is pregnant while they are at a restaurant next to the lake? I watched this movie from a video that I put on television. When I watched this scene, I thought I could remember Jones' voice when the "waiter" laughed at the end. I rolled the tape again, then slowly stepped through that part as the camera pulled back and showed the waiter. Listen closely as the waiter laughs when Hagty looks up and tells him that they are going to have a baby and look closely or make the scene slower when the camera shows the waiter.
