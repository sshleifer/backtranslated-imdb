This is what makes me proud to be British. This is the most fun thing on TV. The league consists of Jeremy dyson, Steve pemberton, Mark gatiss and Reece shearsmith, which are cute horror movies. This story is the most complete. The characters are symbols and strange catchphrases. "Hello Dave" It's a funny movie that everyone has to see. <br /> <br /> The best thing about a gentleman's league is that it's always fresh and always pushing the boundaries. No need to rely on catchphrases (slightly different from England) to make jokes. The fact that the league is willing to kill the most famous and iconic characters shows us that they have iron balls.
