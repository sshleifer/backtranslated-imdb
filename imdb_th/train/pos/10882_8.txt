This is not a bad movie. It follows a new pattern of modern horror, which is a film in the movie which is a well-known actress in life in the first scene. This film uses the psychotic killer's original method when he loosens and manages to do something new and interesting with it. It is also good to see Molly Ringwald coming back to attack. <br /> <br /> So this may be an example of the type that became Cut all the points and be scary in some parts. I like it. I give it eight.
