Although Kris Kristofferson To be good at this role, who wouldn't want to see Elvis Pressly instead? With drug addiction and the collapse of a great reputation may cause Elvis representatives to be afraid to separate from this movie. It's a mistake. This will be the perfect movie for Elvis. Although the soundtrack is far from excellent But Paul Williams and Barbara Streisand performed well in creating the original soundtrack for parts / musicals. The love story is quite a drama about falling from grace and gifts. Redemption Like most tragedies, the hero of this story is dead. In addition, Gary Busey is perfect again in an incomplete role.
