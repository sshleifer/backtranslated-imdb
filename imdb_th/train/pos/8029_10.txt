I want to know what Beckett rifles use in the movie and the ability of the bullets that he thinks will shoot. If this is loosely based on Carlos Hathcock's attack, I guess it's 7 mm around. I'm also curious about the rifle itself. He also commented on the final Sniper movie about the rifle that Vietnamese men let him use, which belonged to his father. Beckett said he thought it was the best rifle ever. I want to know that the rifle is also I know that this rifle was built around World War II or earlier. I can't look close enough to watch a movie to identify myself. <br /> <br /> For Mr. Hathcocks kills, his longest shot is 1.47 miles and he has been confirmed 93 times and 14 confirmed. After his wounds were healed from being burned in Vietnam, he spent the rest of his career teaching the sniper skills in the USMC that they wanted in this field. His Jon's career still speaks of our brothers who trained in the USMC. I found his name from my friend who is a former Marine. Any information would be good.
