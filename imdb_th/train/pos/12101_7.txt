I remember watching this movie at the West End theater in Louisville, Kentucky. When I was a child, the scene where Dr. Carmus found the coffin of the gardener and the body That breath is the most scary part of the movie for me. But the intensity of the movie only I also wondered about people hanging from the tree at the end until I remembered a part of the movie that changed the name of the Blackwoods family from Blackblood. Is known from the hanging of many people Sir Thomas Blackwood seemed to pull him out of increasing the death caused by his family. I also noticed that when Foster entered the cemetery door for the first time, he was careful to observe the sharp object of the door where he found his end. I will not hesitate to recommend this movie to horror movie lovers.
