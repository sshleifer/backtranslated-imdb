This fun little noir has many top performers and memorable scenes. The big distraction is to ignore the integrity of the true accent. The Spanish characters in this film are played by French (Boyer), Belgian (Francais), Greek (Paxino) and Hungarian (Lorre)! And more than that, Bacall should all be English lords! Even though it is ridiculous But the performance is very good - especially Paxinou and Lorre, but the scene in which Boyer, Paxinou and Lorre meet and speak with a fiercely different accent is the real horn! And I guess if they are alone, they should definitely speak Spanish! It seems strange that Warner Bros. could not find a Spanish-speaking actor in Los Angeles! Of course, Hollywood always has a "old accent to do" policy - another favorite thing is Greta Garbo (Sweden) as Matahari (Dutch) who falls in love with Russian soldiers. Performed by the Mexicans Maybe they should get Novarro for "Confidential Agent" - he should have been a Boyer role or at least in francen (Which will save a lot of dark makeup)
