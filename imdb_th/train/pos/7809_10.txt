This movie makes me too much to understand it and will remain my favorite movie all the time, mostly because it has almost all the emotions that roll into 157 minutes. When is the hardest thing for me? Whatever I want to listen to amazing music and music from movies, I have to put it on my DVD player so I wonder if anyone knows who sings. In the film, And where they can be found while I watch everywhere I can think of for the last 5 years. The words I like from this movie are when the court supporters say "But your own words, let's face it directly. Isn't that violence?" Biko replied, "You and I are facing each other. But now I don't see violence !! "<br /> <br /> CRAIG ROBERTSON Fife, Scotland
