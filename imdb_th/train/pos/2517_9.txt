I received this movie from Netflix after a very long time, so I was expecting a lot when it arrived. My worst fear is that it must be stubborn, just like ... Do you know what the fans are screaming about? GACKTnHYDE = hao yaoi loved that thing, right? Scared of it. I was very surprised. This film can be surprisingly watched, although filming and music will make it feel like someone caught a couple of nuns every two scenes and performing in Gackt's part is quite good. , Acting as a friend, a friend / gang member, a virtual romance that everyone who saw him on stage would be surprised He is one of my two important beef beef. But the remaining actors (Including the child actors in the opening scene) performed very well in doing what they did, most of which were shot and shouted at But my second problem is still very low It seems to be too suspicious for me - like every scene where some people are shot, they fall down or die most sincere, or lie there for a long time, but Cho only ... photographed over and over again. So much as he spoke and made Hyde cry In conclusion, if you are a big fan of the actor or fan J-film, it's worth watching.
