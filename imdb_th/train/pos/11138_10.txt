Midnight Cowboy is not for everyone. It's raw, painful and realistic. But very entertaining The cast brought Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman to become an Academy Award-winning actor, giving an amazing performance. Joe Buck is a young immigrant from the small town of Texas to New York City to become a businessman. He didn't apologize for the career he chose. But it's not easy Women in New York, like wealthy women, played by George Johnson and Cass, played by Oscar nominated Sylvia Miles, are women who are different from Texas. Sadly, Buck tried to escape. From past life in Texas He was raised by Sally Buck, his grandmother, played by Ruth White, the best actress who died in 1969 from cancer. Locations in New York City are great to watch as well as The relationship between Fatso, played by Hoffman and the character of Buck, became a friendship between a man and a man. Men are struggling to survive in life in New York City without playing according to the rules, such as getting a real job. When the film evolved, Buck's past story came to the surface and it haunted. But it is not clear This film is not intended for children. But when compared to movies and TV shows, the current Midnight Cowboy may look more reliable. I can't forget the Brenda Vaccaro boys and parties that you can't forget. It is also the tear of the movie, so ask you to go outside as well.
