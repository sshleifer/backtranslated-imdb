From all breakdancing / hip-hop movies released between 1983 and 1986. Beat Street is definitely the best movie. The following story is a younger brother who sacrifices younger, graffiti artists and entertainment industry promoters. Wanting to be in the winter, they try to break away from the ghetto by using the talent "Street". Has always been and the characters have not been fully drawn But they are compensated by ground-based dialogue, credible stories, excellent dance sequences and timeless hip hop music It should be noted that the film was shot in the hometown of breakdancing ("This is not New York, this is the Bronx!") And the appearance by the father of breakdancing, dance band, Steady Steady, crew and rapper Afrika Bambaata. Rock Steady Crew presents the best scenes in the movie when they dominate the fight at the premiere dance club in the early 80's. That is Roxy. Must watch for hip hop lovers.
