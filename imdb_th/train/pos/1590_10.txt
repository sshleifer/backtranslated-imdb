I just started watching TV series. "What I like about you" and I must say that it is a pleasure to watch. I always like to see new programs. Well done. When considering a lot of items before you really feel them, I watched Amanda Bynes from "All That". She's a really funny girl. The best thing. About her comedy is that it looks natural and what I mean is something that one can do there, not rehearsing. <br /> <br /> I just started watching the program and fell in love. I just watched the race back again now. But waiting for the next season Every character in the show presents something to the whole story. Glad to see the old pages from other programs that I like to watch in the past, such as Jennie Garth from "90210", Leslie Grossman from "Popular" and Wesley Jonathan from "City Guys". The charm that makes you love him even if he does something wrong with Holly (Bynes). <br /> <br /> Overall, this show has the right ingredients to succeed. I hope to watch it grow
