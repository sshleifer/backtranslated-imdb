In the era of horrifying cartoons, I was quite shocked to see such good moral films, making it in the IMDB Bottom List movie list for animated movies. <br /> <br /> This movie conflicts. With the first story I will not deny that However, when I was in the target age group for this film, I didn't notice and it wouldn't matter if I did. Those who create it may use "new generation" to know that this is another way the Care Bear family begins. Maybe we have to decide for ourselves what the Care Bear family really started. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite movie at the age of 3-6 and it doesn't scare me or make me confused. > <br />
