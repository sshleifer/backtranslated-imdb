Everyone can say that this thing is worse than me. I love this show before I can see it for 3 reasons. 1. This story makes me amazed. 2. Jessica Alba and 3. James Cameron! Please ignore the bad comments and see the first season before you decide it's not good because I know that if you watch the first season, you will love and go out to buy Season 1 and Season 2 then enter. join The campaign to get the season created. <br /> <br /> I hate Fox, and I'm confident that many "Dark Angel" fans hate them too. They have one thing for Canning Good Show! Do you disagree?
