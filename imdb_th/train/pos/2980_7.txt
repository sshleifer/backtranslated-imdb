This movie is a joke, not a joke, but a joke. Enjoy this movie completely. You can't know what this movie will be and just enjoy the jokes and play related to this movie. I also found a funny starting point when he said "Need a beer ........ Chicken" funny story, but what makes this movie good is the fact that it's not trying hard to create serious agitation in this film. Many comedians. Try to have a serious aspect that you don't believe. But this is different and focuses on humor I must say that Yasmin bleeth very badly in the movie and doesn't add anything except the 3 main ones, random, remer and squeak. Very funny to watch and make the movie look good.
