The first love is extremely difficult to draw confidence in the theater: all the love that is generally associated with it usually ends with a pale imitation or a little bit worse. <br /> <br /> Lifshitz manages to avoid pitfalls and Presenting a story of love, disaster and redemption that is possible and sexy while touching the deep themes of human existence. <br /> <br /> The main story is Mathieu, 18, Lonely. Cédric, cheerful, go out But lonely on a holiday with his family When the summer is warm, they fall in love and when the holidays decide to live together. A year later, the relationship ended in disaster: Cédric's cheat and Mathieu, hoping to try to use his own life. He is still alive and in order to get a perspective on his life, he returns to the seaside town where they first met, this time obscuring the coldness of winter. <br /> <br /> If the story is told like this Never affected by the consequences: all of these things are not going to happen. <br /> <br /> Intricate storytelling is necessary to get a deeper feeling. Of the experience of love through the use of differences and worldly views. Fortunately, the timeline has been used three times. (Summer of love, psychiatric hospital after suicide and the winter of rebuilding) is color code: warm yellow and orange for the summer, cool blue, scary for the hospital scene and hot brown And blues for the winter shores. <br /> <br /> The main actors both performed in great performances while it was a pleasure to see Stéphane Rideau (Cédric) used to use his talents. Jérémie Elkaim (Mathieu) has been known for his extraordinary weakness in the movie Gael Morel. You must feel lonely and his unbelievable passion. Beautifully crafted gestures through conversations that are more than capable. <br /> <br /> The most touching form of classic movies in France: our difficulties in understanding what others feel. Our difficulties in fully communicating; Shifting beaches of meaning ?? The title of the movie "Presque rien" (almost nothing) points to these things and actually is one of the important scenes in the movie: in an attempt to understand why Mathieu tried to commit suicide, the psychiatrist asked Cédric that He used to cheat on him ?? "No? enfin, oui? une fois, mais ce n'était rien "(not good, yes yes once But it is nothing) Cédric still loves Mathieu ?? He took him to the hospital during a suicide attempt (we didn't see) and tried to contact him again when he left ?? But could not understand that he had lost him forever because of what seemed like nothing to him (Meaningless) is everything Mathieu <br /> <br /> While the film is darker than the poster, Pierre et Gilles is quite unlucky. It was not without hope: we saw the slow and painful efforts of Serikric to get in touch with the first life through the cats he had used, then worked in the local bar and finally contacted Pierre, which could be love. His next story. But the story ends here: a passion for teenagers over a year may begin again. Then what is it Nothing at all? Of course not when you live it ??
