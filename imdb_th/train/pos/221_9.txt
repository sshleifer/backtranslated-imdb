I remember when I first saw this film at Radio City Music Hall when it came out. I didn't understand humor. But this movie makes me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> With respect from George Burns (RIP) Walter Matthau deserves an Oscar for this film. His performances are amazing because he is 20 years younger than Willie Clark's character. His courtesy is number one. ("What kind of music do you know?" Sh * t! "And when speaking to Spanish speaking people at the reception:" No! Not! No En Chilada !! ") Absolutely hilarious. <br /> <br /> Glorious to Richard Benjamin, a male player straight to Mattau. <br /> <br /> I just want Let this be a DVD because my VHS recordings are getting old. <br /> <br /> I don't care to see remixes with Woody Allen because I can't match the original.
