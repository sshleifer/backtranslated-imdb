Write the words <br /> <br /> What you see is what you actually get! What the brave and wonderful Madhur Bhandarkar 'Page 3' is is to destroy the myth that is attached to the glamor and glitter that makes the pages of our newspapers and their lives. (Read the party habits) We followed with a fanatical passion inside. <br /> <br /> Phenomena, page 3. Unfortunately, it's a mystery. How precise the control of the printed words, and when they start encroaching on the first page, must be debated again. Bhandarkar cleverly avoided. He was only concerned with the mechanism of this unusual existence. And in doing so, he combined the elements of this lifestyle together, like Robert Altman (although I do not compare Bhandarkar with Altman's genius) but Bhandarkar uses many characters to motivate him. Whether the Wannabe NRI page, page 3, door intruders, new riches, upcoming themes, politicians, politicians or novelist novels are erotic. Every character is recommended with a purpose and each has a separate character - even if their parts may be short. And in that place put the appeal of the film. <br /> <br /> Konkona Sen Sharma plays the role of Madhavi Sharma, a talented young journalist who covers page 3 for Nation Today. Initially, she is satisfied with her work. Soon she starts. Saw the ugliness of the weaknesses that were covered with feud and cosmetics, but Bhandarkar resisted the temptation to make this movie a moral treat and avoid focusing on the characters The gear Therefore, this film is not only about Madhavi, but also about Deepak Suri (Boman Irani) equally - Madhavi's editor who accepted his role as a backlash of large machines. Anjali Thapar (Soni Razdan) - Breathing society Do not leave. Abhijeet (Rehan Engineer) - Gay makeup artist and roommate Madhavi Pearl (Sandhya Mridul) - a shameless air service provider and Gayatri (Tara Sharma) - aspiring actress. It seems that it is an impossible task to absorb a lot of characters (and others) in one story. But fully credited with Nina Arora and Manoj Tyagi for a tight screenplay. The dialogue by Sanjeev Datta and Bhandarkar has been written with attention to detail. <br /> <br /> Any storytelling, no matter how good Which may not be smooth without a true performance. Fortunately, 'Page 3' is full of actors and non-celebrities. Konkona must pass the role that is easily supported by her author. Ditto Boman Sandhya Mridul has the role T best But almost beyond it Atul Kulkarni is broken, but with letters Sometimes the director seems to be eager to combine as much as possible. (Pornography, homosexuality, etc.) But the context in which they are used doesn't make them look hurry. <br /> <br /> Finally, Bhandarkar's efforts are to make our look worse. But he took another step He took us into the photo and revealed to us the horrifying reality of this human group, which seems to have a strange life in a different and distant world. These people are the same people who soak up the New Year's happiness while the fellow countrymen who are just a few hundred kilometers away are destroyed by the ferocity of nature! Intelligent writing combines songs with skill, acting that is truly talented and sincere, which makes this film valuable even if lacking expertise and poor production values. 'Page 3' is the right way.
