First of all, let me say that I don't like the fact that The Rock won a very gay position. Next, I felt that Regal should be able to regain his position in Europe. Jeff Hardy was a crappy champion. Rob Van Dam had an Intercontinental position for too long. The best double champion is Booker T and Big Show in my opinion.
