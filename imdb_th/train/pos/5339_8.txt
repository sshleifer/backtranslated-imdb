I just saw "behind the door of the bedroom" and this is the first softcore flick that has a solid story behind that I've seen at the moment. <br /> <br /> We started with two lovers, neighbors. - Vivian and James Fenway (Julia Kruis and Eric Carrington) and Lillian and Gabe Harris (Nicole Sheridan and Chris Gustafson) Vivian appears to be a housewife. James is a lawyer working for Lillian County lawyers working in real estate and Gabe is a surgery. Successful plastic doctors Is there all that? Now let's see each other. <br /> <br /> Enter Abby, play beautifully by the porn star Chelsea Blue. She rented a house across the street from Fenway and lived by herself. At the beginning of the movie, James looks out of his window and sees Abby participating in the play with her girlfriend, Gigi (played by Monst Alexander with a lush green film) and secretly begins to suspect it will. How about you The next day, Abby will get to know the four of them and seem to be a lovely woman who just had a way of life. She passed away at Vivian, who seemed to be shocked and said to her, "Oh. ..I ... not like that. "Everything seems okay ... until the plan starts moving. <br /> <br /> First of all, Abby appears at the office of Gabe naked by asking Gabe. Should you get a job? This is where we receive a movie quote: <br /> <br /> "Tell me about Gabe" "What do you want to know? "Is Gabe married happily?" "I'm married." "There is a problem ... let me guess. Your wife is at home and doing everything you ask for. But she is a good woman. "" Yes. "" Are you not a bad woman at all? "" No "" Is that door locked? "<br /> <br /> Do you know what will happen next? Go ... Abby took it with Gabe there in the examination room. After that, she performed a little in front of her for James, who came and wasted time having sex with her. What James didn't know was a teddy bear on a piano with red eyes that flashed as a camera that tape every festival. (It's very clear) Abby has sex with Gabe again later, and this time, Jiji joins to make it in three ways. Now Abby has something about the two men. She asks for $ 100,000 from each person to buy her silence. Not only will she destroy James's running route only But she can destroy Gabe's training. <br /> <br /> While Gabe and James struggle with their mistakes, Abby finds time to seduce Lillian - "who" is experimenting with women in College. That's a long time ago. But you don't know how to see her work with Abby. She looks professional. <br /> <br /> While Gigi walked along the plan, she seemed to envy everyone. The sex that her girlfriend is having "It's just a business," Abby said. Confessions and apologies must be followed, as well as shocking information about Abby's true self. - Looks like you're doing things. In the same way that Gabe and James use this information to fight Abby's blackmail. <br /> <br /> Now it's about sex. The sex scene is quite good, and considering all the women involved in this movie, except Julia Cruz, has a very long porn background. I wouldn't expect anything. Nicole Sheridan, four scenes, is the best movie with three ways. A few seconds Monique Alexander naked once But she is a relatively small character. Julia Kruis is the main character and is naked several times. I think that since she is surrounded by an expert who has no experience, she does not need to have many sex scenes. <br /> <br /> To summarize, "behind the door of the bedroom" has a wonderful story that helps. Raise the overall rating of the movie. I think it's interesting. <br /> <br /> Woman: A- (Nicole Sheridan in this movie - better than her proposal on Fred Olen's comedy Ray, at least she can Doing some drama Chelsea Blue is a stealer scene - she's not that bad. As an opponent, I'll give you yourself. Julia Kruis is your normal self. I hope Monique Alexander will have more time in Sex movie: B (very stable and strong sex scene. Nicole Sheridan's performance is almost unbeatable. Chelsea Blue looks good in her scene as well. Not scorching <br /> <br /> Story: B + (I like the dialogue and the story. The main character of Chelsea Blue is good for the genre and I'm impressed with Nicole Sheridan at the drama.) <br /> < br /> Overall: B (This is a good softcore flick. I'm glad I can watch this because I'm surprised if Chelsea Blue wants to do more of these things. She welcomes every time. Nicole Sheridan as well - although she may be Funny better time I don't mind hardcore women who can make Softcore movies.)
