William Shakespeare will be proud of his plays in this particular version. Not only the best movie version Kenneth Branagh's small village is a genius, not only because it is written by Shakespeare, but also has the courage to do everything, even if it takes only four hours. <br /> <br /> We all know the story of the Prince of Denmark and His plot to avenge the death of his father, so I won't go into the details of the story. However, I will tell you that the best part of this Hamlet version is not an amazing scene or an amazing photograph. But is the interpretation of the actors of each character I wonder if you will find Polonius better than Richard Briers' delicious pictures. You can not go wrong with Julie Christie and Jack Lemmon. In addition, Derek Jacobi is a regular in Shakespeare's adaptations. Of course, we have to talk about Kenneth Branagh. He impresses the audience when he comes into the scene with his first trip to Shakespeare. Of course, Olivier's appearance is attractive. But I think Brank's performance is great. When you watch him on the screen, it's almost as though he knows exactly what Shakespeare wants to play. The way he was not nominated for an Oscar was all a mystery. At least this movie was given a little nomination and was a strange choice for Screenplay. I guess they know good writing when they see it. <br /> <br /> All you will never see. With Bard's best plays to say that the excellent technique is exaggerated If you love this drama and become a fan of Shakespeare, you have to watch this movie. Even if you are not really interested in Shakespeare But the picture will keep you occupied throughout the duration of the movie You may not think you will be able to get to know the whole story at once. But soon you will find that temporarily stopping this movie will make you want to watch more movies.
