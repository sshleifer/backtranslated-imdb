This movie is excellent. <br /> <br /> I'm enchanted. I should say and be surprised because it's unique. Continuous actors, effects ... everything! gorgeous! I mean, it's a love story. Yes. But what makes it stand out from the rest is that it has been told in a fun and wholesome manner. <br /> <br /> For me it's a representation of modern fairy tales. ... just amazing. <br /> <br /> I'll buy this copy as soon as it enters the market. <br /> <br /> This movie is a must see ... !!! ! 10 stars for that!
