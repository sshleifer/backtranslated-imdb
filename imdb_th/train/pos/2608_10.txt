Rosan's last season is a crazy roller coaster ride. This last episode did what the previous comment said it told us as much as we thought we knew the characters we didn't do. Rosanne returned to the first season and told us that this performance gave her meaning in her life. She spoke in this last episode that she changed activities and people as he saw fit. Scott isn't really with Leon. But he actually exists Mark and David marry the opposite wife in real life and Dan dies when she makes him live. When an incident occurred in her life, she changed it in her writing. We all don't want to be able to do it. We all don't have the time we need, we just use the eraser and change according to our preferences. This is what she did with all episodes. And in other opinions, I will say that I do not feel that being deceived by my family is true in my heart.
