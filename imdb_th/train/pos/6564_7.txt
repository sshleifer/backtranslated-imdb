Jake Speed ​​(1986) is a joke of Indiana Jones and other adventure films that were popular in the eighth decade. Whey City Crawford is a Jake Speed, an adventurer who always struggles with evil people, no matter where he goes. With his assistant, Desmond Floyd (Dennis Christopher), they trot around the world to look for some action. (And the appropriate story) Both met a young woman named Margaret. (Karen Coppin), her sister, was kidnapped by an evil white spit dealer. (John Hert) Can you find and convince Jake and Desmond to save her brother's life? <br /> <br /> A charming and cute movie that doesn't pretend to be something that is not. I have to give this advice That is, if you enjoy movies that are fun and for those who do not do everything worthwhile, <br /> <br /> recommend
