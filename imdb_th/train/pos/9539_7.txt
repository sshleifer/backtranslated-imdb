For fans of Troma or Cyberpunk, mixed with a little blood flow, this movie is for you! There is a lot of blood shed within the scope of this film. In addition, the effect can also create an impression and horror. The plot is ridiculous and refreshing, not bound to what we are expecting viewers from today's movies. <br /> <br /> Still outstanding as a little alien that I find cute. In summary, it is a good movie for fans. Another type of advice is movies such as Tetsuo: The Iron Man and Versus. Of course, seeing this movie, you should already have two knowledge.
