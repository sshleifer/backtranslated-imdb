If The Lion King is serious about a young lion growing up to avenge the death of his father, The Half King 1 and a half are the opposite, all filled with fun and joy. The king of the king tells the story of a lion and a young lion 1 and a half coming from the perspective of Timone and Pumbaa. The perfect companion is made up of meercat that left the house because he couldn't dig a tunnel without burying him. Stewed with odor problems This movie is a little short, but Disney makes a good time with various sketches starring Timone and Pumbaa while they "watch" movies with us. My favorite thing is that singing along halfway through the movie makes sure you see a big bug! Disney has already advertised half that "The rest of the story", although it is not It is just a different view of The Lion King without serious things that spread throughout the second half of the original Disney. Credit Nathan Lane, such as Timone and Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa for audio work without effort. Movies may not work. Singing them fun and they make us laugh. They also give us a reason to avoid hot tubs that are dirty.
