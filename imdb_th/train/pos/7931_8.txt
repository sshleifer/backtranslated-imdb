Men, if someone expects to get a great zombie movie after reading that title, you will be smart and you should be disappointed. For myself, I expect to have flakes, zombies, cheap zombies - and that's what I get. I'm not disappointed at all I think it is an interesting little movie. The zombies are what they should be because all the zombies have been rotated so they are dead zombies. Obviously they did that because it would be quite expensive if they made the full Zombie FX. I understand everything. I don't know who will make this movie seriously. It's called "HOOD OF THE LIVING DEAD". God's love! You will watch "Redneck Zombies" and any Uwe Boll movies and expect it to be fantastic or not, of course! Why is there some mental retardation in the IMD that is groaning like a schoolboy about this movie, I won't understand at all. Oh, and yes, there are worse movies, so stop saying that this is the worst thing you have ever seen. 'Let you know that you are full! Have you ever watched "ZOMBIEZ" ???? Or "Feardotcom" ????? Or "House of Death" ???? These are the worst things I have ever seen. If you can't see that it's just a low-budget zombie movie created by a zombie movie fan, that's something wrong with you. I just enjoy it Lift a finger from me and I want to see the sequel.
