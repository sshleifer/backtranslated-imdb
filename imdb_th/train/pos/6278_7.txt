I saw this on a flight across the United States and was a little skeptic at first when people said that there were so many characters in that you didn't know them. However, I didn't find this at all. This film is fast But this is because of the nature of the director and the star. The chase scene is great and yes, it might be predictable. But not that it is true of most movies The main villain has deteriorated slightly. Christopher Eccelston is unbelievable as it should be. But he said it was a good movie
