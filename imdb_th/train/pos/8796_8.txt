<br /> <br /> Everything involved seems to be the main issue from the beginning, with this set of eleven pieces by eleven directors. That is what may be the number one priority for people like Bush Blair and the company may not be like that for many ordinary people. From the opening scene where Iranian teachers try to impress her little students, the most important thing that happens with the result is that children are not impressed by the death of their neighbors and things that affect them closely. With them more clearly than anything that may have happened in New York, USA, wherever they are. This article is in almost every documentary format. Stating that not all things are equal to every human being, while some world leaders will try to prophesy. <br /> <br /> While it is obvious that the WTC attack is the worst event by any person, One gets the impression that politicians and television cameras tend to blow things out of all proportions. Of these parts The same international reaction will occur if there is an attack at Lagos or Jakarta speaking, or even in Rio de Janeiro. I would rather not think It seems that the news will be distorted, depending on what happens: TV broadcast time occurs in an earthquake in Italy more than once in destruction in Mongolia outside more than once. The farther distance seems to reduce the size of the disaster. <br /> <br /> This eleven series will help things in a better view or maybe I should say that some parts do. Because each director who is fully independent has created his own story Such views that it is impossible to judge all the advantages But individually for each of the eleven minutes. <br /> <br /> Should not assume that this is an anti-American movie: that is reading a variety of messages that are too simple to express through various parts. However, it's not an American style. The eleventh part uses different attitudes and general links - if any - that is the downfall of the WTC attacks. Must be seen in a different perspective. Then people like George Bush will begin to understand the world in which they live. <br /> <br /> The clearly stated part is my faith. I have been protected for two years: America is not studying. Know the lesson And the lesson is that the United States must share this world with the rest of humanity, not possessed by the brutal economic persuasion Instead of learning that the United States cannot stop everyone and everywhere, their political leaders who have received help and support from Blair (And even Aznar) was even more proud and repressed, which was not good for anyone in Afghanistan. Or Iraq today The idea of ​​the White House is totally undeniable: the United States and England invaded Iraq and caused chaos, so they should eliminate what happened - not confirmed in the United Nations and other countries to delve deeper with helping hands and find it easy. <br /> <br /> The situation is serious. (Or even Israel) is only caused by the severe situation from the Islamic people, which many years ago have prepared for the extremists who are crazy about The uselessness is to make a woman die or just wrap them from the top of their heads to the dusty ground. <br /> <br /> The world is busy because of the greed of the rich countries that don't seem to see. Or understand anything from a multilateral perspective This film in eleven separate pieces correctly portrays this dismal and dumb gesture.
