I walked into this thing, expecting to not like it; I think it will be very valuable and serious and quite plodding and boring. <br /> <br /> Actually it's better and I find myself really enjoying it. I do not know anything about Queen Victoria more than what most people know - married Albert, who had died and she was mourned with him forever. Seeing the situation in which she grew up was amazing In fact, I found myself wanting to see more stories, and I think we might see some sequel. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this movie is amazing. The costumes and costumes are incredibly extravagant without being too flashy. That show is something that everyone has to share. <br /> <br /> Say it. It's great!
