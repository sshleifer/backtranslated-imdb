About 1986, I saw this movie accidentally on TV one night. I was 6 years old. It was like my unintended view of a terrifying ending as Don't Look Now. In 1987 I went to Venice Holiday next year with silence, hoping to be a god that my parents would not know. <br /> <br /> Will I imagine if my parents knew that I watched Les Valseuses as a child? ? I may avoid this with my father today and my mother may not agree with the afterlife. I don't know if they want to see it or not. From stalking the traps of a woman on a flat building in the first scene until moving down the mountain road with eyes full of eyes, I'm not sure that this movie is a garbage that ignores the sexual revolution. or not A sexy movie that will let you watch as if you have never done yourself. <br /> <br /> It is intense. It has a harsh view of sex. Even babies who are breastfeeding mutate become a very greedy sexual act. But the situation is very emotional and (God, I am very British) Arousing! Do they suck her breasts for their own benefit? That is exploitation And why do I have to be wood? <br /> <br /> Friends are looking for an experienced old woman. I don't know. It ended with a truly horrible suicide. I explained to my friend JB Nelson, who has the ability to annihilate the Cannibal race and he goes eeuurrgghh! There is no mother's love for this movie, quite the opposite. The boy's attack began. Why are they shooting women in the legs? Why did you come back to them? Women need to be punished or not in order for them to learn the right things from men. <br /> <br /> I'm thinking of two movies, one story, which I hope I will never see another, making me hope. That it will not It was a cruel world. Swept Away / Madonna What an unreasonable insanity he was infuriated that women were punished for being a slave to men. Once upon a time in America / Leone God, why do noodles do it? Destroy the path to joy that we follow him all his life. So finally being close to finding love with Deborah Now they are both destroyed. Why Sergio? Why <br /> <br /> Les Valseuses do not have rape But with both sex and many nudity both sexes Very honest, no lump There is no dream, there is no perfect smooth movement of Hollywood, jokes, yes, but here there is darkness and jealousy, and too tricky to be called a sex comedy. Forget to continue shooting the nude hairdresser in the Cos legs. You will come back and you will ask her up with your son. Avenge her son and she will learn how to shed from him. <br /> <br / > Two things I can't do are rape movies and prison movies. Les Valseuses is not a rape movie! God, nobody wants to see now! It's a great movie!
