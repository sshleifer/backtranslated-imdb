I was lucky to see "Oliver!" In 1968 on a big screen movie in Boston when I was a kid. Later in the summer of 1969, I was glad to see this film still playing in a prominent cinema in Leicester Square, London, after receiving the Academy Award for Best Picture of the Year. <br /> < br /> The success of "Oliver!" on both the stage and the scene reminds me that not every talent begins at Broadway and ends at Hollywood. The legendary story of Charles Dickens, which is part of the legacy Wan Wan Of people who speak English, was taken to a London stage by Lionel Bart of Britain. His charming musicals became popular in New York and around the world. The film was adapted from England in the summer of 1967 and was released in 1968. The scene and the amount of music is incredible. The song "Who's to Buy" needs hundreds of actors and British film directors deserve His true Oscar for seamless integration Some Canadian and American talents are also part of the excellent production. But in most cases it is a tribute to the work of British film studios such as Shepperton. Good performances! Other film studios at Elstree, Boreham Wood, Bray, Denham and Ealing have given many films in the world a treasure over the years.
