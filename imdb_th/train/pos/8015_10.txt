I saw this movie for the first time in a movie theater when I was 8 years old and it still made me crack. The Muppets were very cool and they approached the acting business innocently My favorite scene is when I start a whisper campaign on behalf of Kermit at a fancy restaurant. This is a smart and funny movie for children and parents as well. Kermit lived a long time, Piggy Miss and the rest of the gang.
