I saw Dick Tracy when I was very young. I don't know who the actor is and I don't know if this movie is different from the preview. I love it for sure. <br /> <br /> Warren Betty, a star as a detective, Dick Tracy, a detective in the 1930s, who hunted the biggest gang leader in the city. This time, Big Boy Capri (Al Pachino) killed a very powerful man and went to occupy the city with his girlfriend, Breathless Mahoney singer (Madonna), who watched Tracy. It will be even worse because new criminals come in and the worst part is: this criminal has no face. He or she is not very known. In addition, the famous villain came back from the comic book collection. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is very colorful and creative. It's fun and fun to watch as a child. Warren Beaty is like the James Bond of the 1930s, the way he played Dick Tracy. <br /> <br /> The actors in this movie include: Charlie Korsmo, Glenn Headly, William Forsythe. , Dustin Hoffman, James Caan, Ed O 'Ross, Tommy Lee Jones, Mandy Patinkin, Charles Durning. <br /> <br /> Dick Tracy is a movie for all ages and is a fun movie for families to enjoy. Take my word for it
