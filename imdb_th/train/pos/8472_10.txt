I totally disagree. I think this is a great movie for children from Gilligan's Pond and a contract that shows that almost nobody knows Dana Plato Plate. Not scary and doesn't mean I won't destroy the ending. But it's unusual in the way it does. I mean, the children's characters are great and I don't know what to expect at the end. PTSD There are many more things related to these children than you say, the fact that these children are fishermen, experts are at the center of the plot, especially at first. I think the watch in less than 95 minutes
