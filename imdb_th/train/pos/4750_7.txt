In standby, Vern and Teddy talked about who is stronger, Superman or Mighty Mouse. My friends and I often talk about who will win the fight as well. Sometimes we are ridiculous and compare people like MacGyver and The Terminator or Rambo and Matrix. But now it seems that we are talking to people like Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee and Jet Li. It's a pointless comparison. But it was fun And if you go from what we see from Jet Li in Lethal 4 and Black Mask, you must at least say that he will get along well with Chan. In this movie, he meets God in martial arts. <br /> <br /> Black mask is a story about a man created with many men. Their only purpose is to win the war that others lose. They are invincible in some ways. Now is the place for movies. But what was done was an amazing choreographed fight scene. <br /> <br /> Jet Li is a miracle. He can do things with his body and shouldn't have any human being. And that is what makes him look very fun. <br /> <br /> In addition to the martial arts in the movie, Black Mask still has humor and because of the chemistry that Jetmee has with actor, police, officers. together But be honest If anyone reading this review, they want to know if this movie is a kick in the action department. And the answer is yes, resounding !!! Many unattractive actions and full of blood You will love this movie.
