HLOTS is an outstanding series that is something that NYPD Blue does not have in the HLOTS. The plan is true. Interactivity is true. The relationship is true. When the HLOTS reverts back to a loose end movie, it's good to have a whole gang Came back together, even some of the people who had left appeared The set has week in and week out Homicide, Life on the Streets, the best drama network !!!! 5 stars !!!! Give a thumbs up and everything. Thank you NBC for giving us. Finally, we don't get!
