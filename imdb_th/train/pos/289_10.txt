I love all movies of Michael Landon Jr. and Michael Dell Midkiff from Michael Landon Jr's casting as "Clark Davis" can't do better. Dale Midkiff has a way to pull this character out. br /> <br /> This movie makes me obsessed from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The death of the baby girl Missie & Willies with the clarks' rhythm. Visiting is just the time of God. The way in which they deal with death and the way Clark helps them do that is about the love of the father. <br /> <br /> Even though there are 3 movies earlier [Love Comes Softly, Loves Enduring Promise & Loves Long Journey] I feel that you can watch this movie and understand it easily. Still have to leave and want to watch 3 movies earlier because of the history that every character has behind. <br /> <br /> Michael Landon Jr. is a great director. <br /> <br /> Hope to get many people More movies from him in the future
