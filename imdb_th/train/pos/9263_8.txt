This is a delightful and unexpected movie. You start by tracking young people who hope to get into the right football game between Bahrain and Iran. If Iran wins, they will enter the 2006 World Cup in Germany. The problem is that young people are women and girls. (Or women for that matter) are not allowed to participate in football matches for "Sitting with men" The following is a great comedy that is played with complete skill by small actors. This film explores the irrationality of restrictions on women's freedom. (And for the story of a young soldier who had to arrest them) The operation of the camera is the easiest and in some ways tells this story as being a stage play. But it is a small size that makes its movie bite Great cinema? May not not be; Great entertainment - of course
