I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 10 years old. Unfortunately I couldn't see it until the end because it was broadcast late at night. Now I bought it on DVD because I remember I liked it. <br /> <br /> This is not a normal horror movie. It has horror elements. But I would rather be considered a fantasy. I like it, but I hope there will be a bit of horror and horror. Especially the scene where Anna's father came into the paper mill trying to kill her briefly. <br /> <br /> Now it's the plot. This movie is about a sick girl named Anna. While she was sick and had to lie on her bed because she was less advanced, she turned to drawing pictures about the house - the paper house when she slept, which often happened strangely immediately. She found herself near. House in a large green meadow She realized that the house was like the house she painted and all the new details appeared in her dreams. One day she pulled the boy into the house to have someone talk. While she forgot to draw her legs (Because he was sitting behind the window) the boy couldn't walk Later, she was told by a doctor that a boy had such a strange disease and she realized that when the boy she had finished, she brought the boy into a disturbing dream. She also noticed that it became increasingly difficult for her to wake up from her dreams. When she misses her father in a foreign country, she pulls her father into the house. She made a mistake and her father looked very angry in the painting. She tries to make him Yang. But realized that she could not change anything that was already pulled And the next time she slept, the horror began Her father is mad and blind (because she draws *** on his head to mark him as And try to get into the paper and kill Anna and his friends Her dreams became a terrible nightmare. They tried to escape and kill her father and eventually Anna woke up. Than Anna found herself in the hospital where her parents sat beside her bed. The doctor thought that she was in a coma. They told Anna that another boy had died and wanted to travel in the ocean to overcome those tragic events. Anna pulled the observation tower and noticed that the same observation tower could be found near the hotel they traveled. She ran to the observatory and met with the boys. (I just don't mention his name because I can't remember and don't want to go back to the previous html page) and can say goodbye to him and forget those bad dreams forever. Br /> <br /> There is something I don't understand the movie The first is the ending that I don't like. I think it's too long while the main part of the movie is too short. How did the boy fly the helicopter and speak to Anna as he should die? Why do you have to put an idiotic radio on the wall? I hate that scene. It's so stupid. It almost destroyed the main horror scene. <br /> <br /> My favorite thing is the scene with the photos of Anna's father, the first true horror and horror scene. I like boys Excellent actor He is better than Anna. I like the way Anna tries to take her father out of the painting while she is asleep and she is looking for it in the trash. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good movie I give. 8 in 10
