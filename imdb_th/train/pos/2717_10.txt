I don't remember many details about acting. But I remember how much I was passionate about it and I was determined to not miss any episodes. Unfortunately, we don't have a VCR now, so I never saw the series again. However, I can clearly remember how I felt while watching and I was excited every time I arrived. Sam Waterstone is my favorite actor today. (I think I almost fell in love) and he is still one of my favorite actors to this day, mostly from his appearance in the series. I am happy to buy / steal / download this series. I think I will use great effort to look again and come back again in a long lost childhood ... Any ideas? No one knows the site that is dedicated to the series or there are episodes on the tape from the first broadcast.
