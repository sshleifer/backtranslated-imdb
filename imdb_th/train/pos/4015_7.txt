One of the more satisfying Western all'italiana, Johnny Yuma has a lot of fresh WAI created during the heyday of the genre and is recommended to be used with fans of this genre or unusual movies. br /> <br /> Johnny Yuma, in fact, most of them are not scary. But this does not count against it The success of this film depends on how well it can meet the expectations of the audience. Previously, the satisfying experience was rebuilt. But there is a slight twist (or principle) that continues to pay attention Quality of practice is also important. The weariness that is exhausted will be less successful than the sincere effort to entertain or stimulate the audience. <br /> <br /> According to these guidelines, Johnny Yuma is successful. There are many elements from previous movies. The setting is a world of semi-brutal twilight, brutal, shared by the best of "The Gothic Family" Western made 1964-1968, such as Tempo di Mu (1966). The plot is a combination of the plot of Fistful of Dollars (1964) and Ringo's movies, which is not surprising. That the screenwriter Fendiando di Leo is involved with both. Di Leo is one of the best screenwriters in popular movies that came out of Cinecitta during the 1960s-70s and his work helped the film. With continuity and consistency with the music genre most (Including other personalities, actors, directors and screenwriters) in the FOD plot. The helpers arrived in the city, moving the tense situation and then experiencing death followed by resurrection. (In some movies, such as Quella sporca storia nel west (1968), it is quite crucified.) Catholic acts as a narrator and is an interesting symbol, especially when clearly popular from Their populist and filmmakers and movies, the plot of Ringo, was fully developed by screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi in the movie series starring Guliano Gemma. A master who is selfish about the interests of his own community through the medium of relationships with members of that community. Uncertainty) <br /> <br /> The relationship between Carradine and Johnnie is based on Manco / Mortimer from the Fistful of Dollar (1965). The two scenes of the gun belt exchange are conversations. Wise and understanding between the two Many movies, including Da uomo a uomo (1968) or even El Chuncho, would you like to know? (1967) Use this relationship between an old man and a brother (father / son, brother / brother, advisor of Anglo / Enemies and Peasant Revolution) is an important dynamics in the plot. <br /> <br /> There is also Is focused on deception and delusions, labyrinths and mirrors that come back again in the early nineties. The precepts and pueblos of Almeida are called labyrinths, the protagonist characters and the main characters play the game. Moving the cat and mouse <br /> <br /> Another thing that is different from Johnny Yuma from WAI is the quality of the director Romolo Guerriri together with the clever mechanism of the script to pass the plot. The Conversations are not important to WAI and are often unable to understand without reason. (I think there are exceptions such as cynical criticism in Django (1966) or Faccia a faccia (1967) <br /> <br /> The psychological depth of the character is created. Almost all through the photos are outstanding. juxtapositions And is a description of the situation, narrative, including, seeing that the presence of Samantha is deadly during the scene strike? Watch from the roof or from the background of Samantha and Pedro's actions of safety and confidence in their power through the aggression of the ranch, hotel or even the bedroom. (Again, is the theme of FOD) In ​​the end, please note that there is a focus on finding information. There are many elements borrowed from FOD, which are ultimately based on the mysterious novel Red Harvest, through unintended contact. Posters that want conversations that are falsely looking out the window t or understanding the identity and movement that is distorted. From the ripples caused by the actions of Pedro and Samantha in this ridiculous and ridiculous reality, in which this narrative ends with /> <br /> The model was seen over <br severe in intensity. Of course, these films are less violent than many Western Americans. What is different is the mental severity of the violence and the causes of non-violent claims. But is the meaning that has changed Johnny Yuma is different and interesting in use and depiction of violence, and this is another interesting aspect of the movie. <br /> <br /> What I find is very interesting. Most about this category is the link that is given to an anonymous person. Anonymous viewers in Italy and Spain who have repeated these stories are important and interested. The artifact may not have real value in itself. Some of Hin Lek Fai, from prehistoric sites, pottery fragments made from shells or parts made of leather and metal rust But it is a reference to the existence of an anonymous, meaningful life, just because they exist. While Johnny Yuma has real value, my most interest comes from connections and mysteries. <br /> <br /> The top western spaghetti lists are http: // imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849907 <br /> <br /> SWs mean http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849889 <br /> <br /> For those who are crazy about only (Bottom of the tank) http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?
