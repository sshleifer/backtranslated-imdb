I have never seen such a great performance before when I saw Daniel Day-Lewis playing Christy Brown on the left foot. In fact, this scene, his role is not over yet. He plays as Christy Brown, or at least as crippled as he did throughout filming and requires surgery because of the damage caused by his superior performances that caused him to return. For me, it's a remarkable thing and through all the pain he endured with acting in that role, I believe it is quite true to say that he put on the Oscar's most precious performance in history. He excelled in this difficult part, which I believe that no one can do better or have more impact than him. Although I cannot say that it is the greatest movie of all time, I can say that he played an impossible role and then continued to perform until it was no longer acting without a doubt. That the greatest foot is made. May be a man for that matter
