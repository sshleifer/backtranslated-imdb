Before movies like 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,' 'Suspiria' and 'Halloween' will change the perception of horror forever, there are gothic and less violent eras. Movies such as the Hammer Horror series and 'Rosemary's Baby' are things that viewers are afraid and excited throughout the 60s and early 70s. I can't tell you how many times I rented this movie during my childhood. But I do because there is something about this I don't want to limit myself to slasher movies and zombies in the 70s and 80s and movies like this from famous builders. Great and creepy music score Strong performance from the protagonist Great movie Great excitement, good old style and chills, especially in the first and last article. Some moments and hallucinations Move slowly But continuous steps This house is a terrible and terrifying home. An excellent production design and scene decoration that makes this movie a true old-fashioned Gothic horror. Depends on the emotions and feelings of coldness rather than the exciting and lonely stories of excitement Feel like you've done before. Many Clich√©s The second story, 'Waxworks', has a great show and it's a moment. But is the weakest of the four in terms of fear and suspicion Low budget shows sometimes really. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: After watching this movie for the first time in many years, I can see why I rent often. It's not a masterpiece, either way. But is a good example of the moment when horror movies are created with style and class See this thing by turning off the lights. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5
