**** Excellent <br /> <br /> *** Well <br /> <br /> ** Fair <br /> <br /> * Poor <br /> <br /> `Go side by side The page makes my day! '<br /> <br /> The fourth picture in the series, directed by Eastwood (Who is rumored to have directed the Magnum Force for the most part) and he brought the violent society back from the two movies. However, this film still lacks impact and confidence. The film was released in the early 1980s, Regan's time, and the young Republicans. The location of the woman being raped, the villain's revenge does not attract this time frame. This plot is probably better for the executor, which actually makes it a good movie. Something that needs an immediate impact is the plot like on Wall Street, but there is Dirty Harry in the middle. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars
