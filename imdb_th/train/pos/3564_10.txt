{Possible spoilers occur ... You are warned in advance} <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite musicals and movies! (Another is Damn Yankees with Gwen Verdon, Tab Hunter and Ray Walston) As we know, sometimes the luster. (Not to mention the song) of the program will disappear from the transition from one screen to the other. This is, of course, not the case here. <br /> <br /> The scene is sacred, bright and colorful. But love them and Michael Kidd's choreography is absolutely amazing. (Very glad to know that they used the original Broadway choreographer) <br /> <br /> All actors "Bounce at the ball" (that is, with superior chemistry) for perfection. In this film, Frank and Marlon are absolutely convinced that the owner of the oldest permanent crap game founded in New York and the most notorious gambler who bet even the last minute - like his fever as high as 104 if he does G antibiotic Jean Simmons sweet favorite role of Sarah. (Although it is true, her singing pipes are not as outstanding as Isabel Biggly or Josie de Guasman) - the mission doll that has all the hearts of gold and last but not the last. (On my list) is Miss Vivian Blaine. She performed the Broadway role as Mrs. Adelaide - the lead singer and hot box dancer who wanted to end her engagement with Nathan for 14 years. marry Yourself from the coldness in the mind that he gave you Nicely-Nicely Johnson and Benny Southstreet, two more unbelievable gamblers than these people. <br /> <br /> Branded by the usual good and even though he didn't hear Robert Alda's voice or the year Peter Gallagher, you forget - because he has this feeling Of the determination to bring everything he can to his role as Sky Masterson "Luck Be A Lady" makes me feel chills every time he sees him showing numbers Special fun is hearing him saying "Father ... I ride an apple in my ear." <br /> <br /> Simmons is charming and delightful in the role that suits her look, voice and How she carried herself You desire for you not only to win Sky (or eventually, believe him) but to help people overcome gambling, drinking and other sins and live with God. Her interpretation is that "If I am a bell" is a wonderful thing to say the least! <br /> <br /> Sinatra is a man. He was perfect for the role of Nathan Detroit - and here he sang some parts that Sam Levine from Broadway actors never did. (Excellent actor But disabled people are deaf ... I enjoy adding "Adelaide" ... hope that some men will sing like that to me Frankie's cool and simple gesture is beyond the scope of this film. But most importantly, you want him to marry Adelaide. <br /> <br /> And when talking about Adelaide, Vivian Blaine is perfect in this chapter. From the accent to the beatings of "Adelaide's Lament". And she is my favorite part throughout the story She really makes you feel Adelaide ... especially when she cried before and then came again during "Sue Me". I haven't decided that I like "Pet Me Poppa" better than "Bushel and Peck. "... maybe I like them equally, no matter how, she is great with them, including" Take Your Mink "(I regret that they left "hollanderize" from the movie ...) She is a wonderful person, not to mention hilarious and part of my favorite movie. <br /> <br /> About this movie is their jargon. It's a mixture of high slang and road. They don't use "as", "I'll" or "That's". It's "It's", "I'll" and "That's". Overall, the Guys & Dolls is one. In movies and musicals that I like forever and it's something you should take to watch every time it happens. My only complaint? No, "Marry a man today" is now a good song.
