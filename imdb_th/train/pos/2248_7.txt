Surprising rental at a local video store, I am pleased to find a worthy media statement to challenge Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers" and almost disturb I think it is good that my viewing was in late 2004, which looked at Republican machines doing wonders in watching most of America's television. It raises the question of whether "Are we really deceitful?" <br /> <br /> It certainly distorts my view. In addition, there are questions about theology that are far more provocative - the story of Christ. The word of mouth and the overwhelming dependence on things that are exploited as television produces the Messiah? Will the story of Christ be exaggerated? Can it be completely invented? It was something that this movie caused a sharp feeling.
