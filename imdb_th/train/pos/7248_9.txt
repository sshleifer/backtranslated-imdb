When I saw the Exterminators of the Year 3000 for the first time, I didn't expect this movie. Although it's not as bad as I thought, Roadwarrior is an Italian version with famous Italian actors, including Venantino Venantini. The background of this story is Elisa Briganti and Dardano Sacchetti, who is also responsible for the story of zombies. You can also see other links to Italian horror movies: Luca Venantini plays Tommy and you can see that kid in Paura nella citta dei morti viventi (City of Dead Life, AKA Hell Gate) as John. Robbins As the role of Mary's brother The movies that provide entertainment are somewhat boring.
