This may be the lowest value movie of its kind. I do not remember seeing any ads or advertisements for this ad, which may be the reason why it did well at the box office. However, Frailty is an excellent and truly original horror movie. I ranked in the top 10 favorite horror movies on my list. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with photos and news articles telling us about the killer who calls himself Then a man walked into the police station and told the chief officer that he knew the murderer was his brother. The two of them left to go to the place where the victims were buried, which may solve the problem. During the journey, the man began telling the story of his brother and we went back in time when the event began. Fenton and Adam are two brothers who live with a strict and religious father, one day claiming to receive news from God to ask him to kill the demons that seem to be human. He received a list of demons destroyed by God and asked his son to help him carry out this sacred mission. <br /> <br /> This is a very scary and suspicious movie. Your seat High tension, innocent (or demons?) Killed and religious experiences are questioned. At the end it has a few people. If you like this genre, I recommend Frailty to you. I own a DVD and one of my favorite horror movies of all time.
