Moonwalker by Michael Jackson is a true adventure movie for everyone in the family. <br /> <br /> Before the true story of the film begins, we get the Bad Tour (Man In The Mirror) and it starts. Start up Great movie After that, we received the collage of Michael's service provider as well until Moonwalker came out in 1988. After that, a few music videos (Speed ​​Demon, leaving me alone, etc.) The story begins. <br /> <br Basically, Michael and his three friends (who were children) were chased by the villains in "Mr. Big" because they discovered his evil plan of bringing the children away. Around the world during the chase We will see a group of amazing fx videos of Michaels for Smooth Criminal, which is absolutely fantastic with its dance sequence, etc. But then one child was kidnapped by Mr. Big and Michael to save her life before she was addicted. <br /> <br /> In the movie, we see special effects not only But remarkable for those standards But still impressive today For example, see Michael turning into a robot / spacecraft to protect his friends! that is cool! <br /> <br /> The movie ends with Come Together's performance (published later in Michaels, two albums of HIStory) and you let this movie feel amazing! <br /> <br /> I recommend this to everyone in the family who wants to spend the night happily with sweets and popcorn in front of the TV. And now some parents may stand up and say: "But Michael Jackson is the alleged assailant!" Yes, he is true. But come, we all know it's not true! Wait and see ..
