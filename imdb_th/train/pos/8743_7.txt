Good movies with strong performances This film is a movie about two American girls who are addicted to 6 kilograms of heroin in an airport in Thailand. They were both thrown into prison and one of them was a signal to confess. Bill Pullman plays a lawyer who tries to take them out. All they have to do is find Nick's drug park in one of the two girls' bags. Until now, for non-traditional stories (It has a lot of similarities with the better Return to Paradise) <br /> <br /> Taking pictures of the beautiful Newton Thomas Siegel makes this movie worth 7 out of 10.
