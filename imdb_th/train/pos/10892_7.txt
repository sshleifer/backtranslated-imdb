What did you like about this movie? Every year you will know that you will receive a movie about one or two whirlpools during Christmas and most will be terrible. This movie is a new concept that is fresh and pulled out quite well. Very funny. The rich man paid the family to simulate a real Christmas for him. What is good about having such money if you can't do something that is fun with it? It's a win-win situation. The normal family has six numbers and the rich will experience Christmas as he imagined. Only in the case of <br /> <br /> Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) is difficult to manage unbelievably. It's a fun and funny movie.
