This is one of the three 80's movies that I can think of being sadly overlooked at that time and unfortunately still overlooked. One of the others is Clownhouse, directed by Victor Salva. The film looks horribly overlooked due to Salwa's legal / sexual problems. Another thing is that Cameron's wardrobe makes me feel bad - not good, but not as bad as the comments I've seen. Paper House is worth your time and I think it's one of the very quiet movies. That will be stuck in your brain longer than you think. I mean 10 years after I saw it and I still gave it a pause while some things I might have seen six months ago. In ether
