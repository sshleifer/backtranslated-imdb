Just like Tarzan the Ape Man (1932). There are more things, more animals, more diverse African tribes, and scenes that require thought. If it's good with three or four lions, forty would be better. Tarzan fights with crocodiles, crocodiles spinning in the water like a needle rolling around and around the jaw. Bounce off, Tarzan can kill it with his prevalent knife. Tarzan kills lions and rhinos and more animals. His friends are true chimpanzees. People wear large monkeys and elephants. In fact, they used friendly and trained Indian elephants better than elephants in Africa, with headsets attached to their heads. Human story: Other white men are worse than others, appearing to join Holt to track ivory from the elephant tomb. Tarzan will not show the way to them, so the bad guys shoot the elephants so that they can follow it until death. Tarzan approached each other and the bad guy shot him. But of course he still lives and returns to help Jane Everyone died. Holt and the bad guys and "boys" everyone. People are very costly, especially African people, and there seems to be no difference between the dead black people working for white people. Travel through the forbidden countries and black people who kill them. This must be the last Tarzan movie before the Hays Code will make Jane wear more clothes. There are many underwater scenes that Jane swims, and even though the light is blinking, the movements and glimpses are very attractive Obviously one of Weismuller's friends from the Olympic swimming team made a nude scene and not Maureen O'Sullivan. However, she moved through the movie wearing the Weismuller loincloth in the same way that she was wearing. (Including bikini shirts) showing the beautiful eyes of the thighs and hips They still don't need to talk a lot. They slept together and went out with cold animals and away from the city. No wonder they are happy.
