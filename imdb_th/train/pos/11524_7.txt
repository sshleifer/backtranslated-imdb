This is a quirky little movie and I have to admit that there is something quirky as well. <br /> <br /> It follows the adventures of a young man who decides that he wants to become Las. Famous Vegas Illusionist and part of following his dream about others' dreams and all about the travel of the entertainment industry. I think this movie is charming and it has a moment or two of magic that makes everything valuable. <br /> <br /> Alan Archin is a great person as a magician who doesn't. Used to be Funny and impressive relationships. <br /> <br /> Not for everyone. But if you like movies about traveling, I think you will like this.
