I want to know why John Amos left the show and how he died from the show. I can't relate to everything. But sometimes they go home with the problems they face By the way, have they ever made it out of the ghetto? I think that when Jesus was a favorite We have to see them having a good experience once. What they do not very often I hope they bring the show back. During the daytime so that people can actually watch I don't think the new movie or program will work. Especially without the original characters They are what makes Good Times GoodTimes. Here are my questions and comments. Thank you !!
