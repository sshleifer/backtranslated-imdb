This movie is one of my favorites because it makes me think about all the choices I have made and how my life will change if my choices are different. It plays with the theory. <br /> <br /> The only thing that doesn't sound like Larry Burrows (James Belushi) is difficult to understand what has happened. <br /> <br />
