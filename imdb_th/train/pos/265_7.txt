A series of insignificant and seemingly insignificant random sets in her sister's dormitory causing Miss Lemon to stir up rings, light bulbs, backpacks, light, headphones, shoes? There seems to be no touch or reason at all. Lemon asked her employer, Hercule Poirot, a great Belgian detective to explore this matter. But what Poirot saw was a terrifying thing that you could imagine. And the fear of Poirot was confirmed when a student living in a dormitory, if found to be killed It is up to Poirot to bring the killer to justice. <br /> <br /> Hickory Derry Dock is a strong device. But not exciting in the long-running Poirot series I appreciate the integrity of the script for the original story of Agatha Christie. I realized that it requires some freedom. But I appreciate the effort, however. Is the important issue of mystery there? Little thieves, hostels, students, ripped backpacks and of course Poirot's ability to see horrible things happen before it actually happens. With some exceptions, the student's character is almost like I imagined. Damian Lewis and Jessica Lloyd stand out in the group. Like the porridge that I like David Jetet, I always get the real kick from Phillip Jackson and Miss Lemon of Pauline Moran. It is now considered true because Miss Lemon has more screenings than usual. Finally, I enjoy using the mouse that is currently an observer of activities in the hostel. It's a little fun playing in the name of Hickory Dickory Dock. <br /> <br /> I know while watching Hickory Dickory Dock again. What the influence of Agatha Christie has had a great influence on the Italian mystery movie or Gialli's 60s And 70, for example, the murder of Mrs. Nikolaus. If you have to collide with the graphics of the scene, you will have something that matches Giallo's early 70s. In fact, the entire plot of Hickory Dickory Dock may be used in Giallo. It's complicated and interesting enough to work.
