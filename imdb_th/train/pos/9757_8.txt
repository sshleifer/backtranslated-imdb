Richard Willaims is an animation god He was prevented from directing this film by the producer. The final product is an uneven movie which has a very complicated story. But for some amazing moments of animation (such as "Greedy" Emery Hawkins), Joe Raposo's repeated songs didn't help as well. It was built on the widescreen, so the VHS doesn't show in every glory. Still worth seeing an attractive animation
