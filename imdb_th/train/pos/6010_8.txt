"Zabriskie Point" (1970): This is a special interest for me on a personal level because it happens under the same circumstances as my colleagues in my own life? Anti-cultural movements of the late 60s / early 70s both on and off campus We follow two unrelated young people in separate stories. One is a young man in Los Angeles bored with an endless revolution in the classroom and lunch room on his campus, and a young woman drove to Phoenix to meet her father and employer. "Establishment" This film is full of the symbolism of our Italian director. (Michelangelo Antonioni) and the mental confusion of those who were righteous in that era "We know everything. Who is the" revolutionary "? What does it really mean? Do you dress like and walk around praying? Do you "fly under the radar" but notice when you arrive? Do you maintain the plan yourself and do business with changes without having to ask for approval from the group? "Zabriskie Point" is definitely a "period piece" - filled with slang, uniforms, movies. (After all, this is the movie by the man who made the amazing "Blow Up" of 1966) and the invention of the era. But it is more It presents an alternative for the cultural revolution and performed by Antonioni (who seems to support it). The youth are involved in themselves too much to see what is needed for intense success. For this reason, it becomes a powerful and scary movie that is suitable for everyone, anytime, anywhere.
