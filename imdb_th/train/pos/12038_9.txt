Yes, true classics! This is what the British drama is about realism and the use of special effects. (And the budget is inflated) The least. I saw this drama last time when the final British ground television show in 1994. Anyone who likes a horrible plot should be truly watched without a name. Big but a great actor Not known and is a great drama like this, which should not be aired anytime soon. I recently received The Woman In Black on the VHS, so now I can really enjoy the great British drama. time You should try and enjoy it as well. <br /> <br /> Mark R. Horobin
