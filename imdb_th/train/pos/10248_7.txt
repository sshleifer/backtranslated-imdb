I heard this story for the first time after buying the "Snuff" flick in 1976. I was informed that the demons' experiments were so much better, so naturally I went ahead and ordered the Guinea Pig box set. I was really interested in hearing that Charlie Sheen tried to ban this movie or the second movie, so my interest was sharp. <br /> <br /> Devil's Experiment is a short film that does not have no character development. Only 3 people tortured a woman for about 45 minutes. They tortured her in various forms, such as hitting her in a circular motion and forcing her to drink alcohol, forcing her to listen to a high pitched voice for 24 hours. Burn the worm The fire threw the courage at her and pushed the needle through her eyes. <br /> <br /> I have to say that many of the movies are fake, like the dance scene. But actually it is doing as well as making money for you The scene in which women are spinning in a circle makes me feel dizzy. Or the scene where she was forced to listen to the sharp sound for 24 hours was painful to think The worst is the eye scene. I did not shutter when watching but thought "Damn, which looks good for a low price movie". I enjoy flicking. But I don't know if I can really recommend this thing if you haven't seen most of the horror genres available for 7/10.
