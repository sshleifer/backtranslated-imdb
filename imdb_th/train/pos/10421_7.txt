This is the most handsome movie. The color photography is beautiful because it shows the extravagance of the Metropolitan Opera House in bright colors. Other indoor scenes in different mansions, etc. are equally great. For any song that can speak more than Lanza's voice is at the 'highest level' while he sings many well-known and beloved songs in the world. The great Dorothy Christen is happy when her soprano sounds harmonize with the sound of Lanza with delightful harmony. Of course, Hollywood uses the tradition of freedom with the story of Caruso's life. There is little value in the story that is related to the real event. For example, the facts related to his death were all invented and had no relation to the truth. There are some very good websites that tell the true story of Caruso and have many pictures of him. These websites can be found using good search engines. There are also many books related to his life history. But the character story doesn't make this film beautiful. Lanza's voice, Kirsten and the chorus members are real stars of this movie. Fun. I know I'm sure.
