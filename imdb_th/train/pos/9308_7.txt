If you are familiar with seeing Gabriel Byrne in a serious role, such as Tom in Millers Crossing or Keaton in The Usual Suspects, I suggest you watch this movie. Even if you are not a fan of Gabriel Byrne, especially all the actors in this movie give a really great performance. If you have about eleven bucks (that is close to nine quid) I say order online or rent from your favorite movie rental place. Guaranteed to make you laugh, whether you like gangster movies or not. Mad Dog Time / Trigger Happy is one of those movies that you never forget and find yourself watching over and over again. You will talk about it very much, your friend will ask to borrow it.
