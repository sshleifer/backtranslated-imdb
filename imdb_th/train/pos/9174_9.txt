There are many movies and TV shows of Jane Eyre that have various aspects to guide them. But I think this is something that people will still discover and fall in love for decades from now. It's just classic (And presenting the story more than others do). Timothy Dalton is the most important part of his position as Rochester rarely disapproves of the mark; His performances are very active and colorful, while never getting lost in the complexity of Zelah's character Jane. Clarke has a better brain than anyone else in the world, but she creates the perfect foil for Dalton (who is right for her tower!) The difference in her performance is better.) There are some technical flaws and a few moments when the production value should be improved. Although this is the best production according to BBC standards at that time, but it's a really delightful performance. Don't miss this one!
