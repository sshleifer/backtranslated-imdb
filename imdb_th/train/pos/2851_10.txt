Japanese indie movies with a sense of humor and philosophy in which the three main characters run through the characters, almost the whole story, chasing each other due to strange situations and comedic coincidences. As they are running, we will see what happens in their hearts and how they can be where they are now. The act of running is a metaphor for the lives of people. Unfortunately, these In some way, what they are pursuing is not what they are chasing. But for the meaning of their lives and escape from personal problems and broken dreams Running makes them feel truly alive. The adventurous that had to run away from the great big changes ended when they accidentally entered the midst of the big, violent and ridiculous things that were funny in a clever way. One of my favorite movies of all time by intelligent director Sabu
