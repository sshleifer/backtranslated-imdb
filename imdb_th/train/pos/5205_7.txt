Many American students and their tutors decided to visit Ireland to study ancient religious practices. Despite being repeatedly warned about the dangers of straying from the beaten path (By the local creepy Irish people) they do that and wind up with their internal organs that are courtesy of the humane human family of the infamous Sawney Bean family who follow the plot The ridiculousness of this movie made the wood from Scotland and sat on the Emerald Isle) <br /> <br /> If you think that porn stars and horror with a low budget are equal to nude. The performance then thought again: Evil Breed was full of adult actors. But in reality it doesn't have nearly as much nudity as we expected from the 'talent' involved, and the performance, though far from bad Oscar (except Ginger Lynn Allen, we know can do 'French' is great, but Irish is lousy) <br /> <br /> Evil Breed opens in a great style with the brutal murder of a couple. torn half This man had his arms and legs cut off and grilled on spit. It was a bloody beginning and a good omen for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, after this promising start Twenty-one asked to become a human being and was subjected to a fair amount of time in the form of many terrible falsehoods about the druids of the local Irishman Gary (Simon Peacock) and the bad. Worst of all Modern postmodern dialogue about the meeting of horror movies (very clever!) <br /> <br /> Then it seems that this movie will not be better than this. Director Christian Viel decided to be serious: Men One of them received a knife darted through his head and had a sex scene in a shower that had a lovely blonde Gillian Leigh (not a porn star).

And strangled his intestines Ginger Lynn kicked the mutant box; Jenna Jameson was torn open and her silicone breast implants were bitten by human beings. Confused. Men were executed with cheese wire. And Taylor Hayes is seen as a bruised and naked blood with a dead fetus between her legs. (Obviously she was arrested and used as a breeding ground) <br /> <br /> All of this is a terrible thing. The less interesting thing is worth it and get the Evil Breed, the last rank at 7/10. <br /> <br /> NB The production and the studio are very busy, resulting in Christian Viel finally leaving the project. The shot was repeated again and the gore was severely cut for release in the United States. The good news is that although this film is not projected as it should be and is cursed with a horrible ending. But DVDs from England (The version that I watched) seems to remain the same (only 13s are cut from all movies).
