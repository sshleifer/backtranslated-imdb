I remember I was a kid when I saw this movie for the first time. It was my first horror movie. (It may be the reason that I still remember some parts of this movie.) I don't remember much about nude scenes or other things, but I remember that the male had a bomb with a male bomb above the tree. And the males fall down with trucks, Kenny Johnson and Kevin McParland). I still remember the last scene when Jennifer McAllister ripped the killer's stomach to pick up the truck's keys It's a movie that makes you crawl and it's worth watching. But where do I find it? How do I download?
