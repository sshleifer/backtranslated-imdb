Freddie started with a scary story, a joke in the 6th episode of the Nightmare series. <br /> <br /> For two years, actually 11 stories since this story happened in 2001 and Freddie. Kill all the last children in Elm. The road except one John Doe (Jacobb from Episode 5, even the movie Doe gives a hint of who he is), which he used to bring the children to Elm street. Not only Freddie will get his wishes His daughter returned to Elm Street when she knew what had happened. She and the other children decided to kill FREDDY once and everyone. We also saw Freddy's creepy background. <br /> <br /> Rachel Talalay, who has been fighting for the nightmare series for a long time now, many people hate this movie But I like it. It tries to present what Freddy is doing with his notebook ... COMDEY and makes the series more funny than scary. So this movie is a terrible story to say. Not nonsense in the series 2 episode still holds. <br /> <br />
