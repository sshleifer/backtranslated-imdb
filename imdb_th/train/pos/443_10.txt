I saw this movie for the first time in the early 90's when it was first released. The room with the view is just newly released. Enchanted April, there is much more for you! I found it to be more real and more earthy. The more believable characters for 'normal' at the end of this movie, I felt like I saw the first BBC production of Pride and Prejudice. Longing for characters to find what they are looking for. You will understand that Italy is far from everything they used to know. They are so degraded because they are at risk and leave boring and depressed things. But in the summer of spring in April, everyone's life is relaxed and unraveling. (Consistent with Victorian daughters) and gradually re-created for everyone's satisfaction It's a little gem! Why is it not known?
