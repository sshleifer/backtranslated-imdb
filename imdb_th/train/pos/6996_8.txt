This movie is a great movie about what affects all of us. I know that I meet myself many times. Thank God, Will Smith has stepped into the social problems of sending messages while driving. People don't do hours and forty-five minutes, not enough for this cause. Personally, I want to leave my mobile phone after watching a movie. I'm glad to see other people in the theater see the message and leave their phones with empty popcorn bags. I decided to disable all messaging on my phone and would encourage others to do the same. If you care about your family, let them see this important public service announcement to send messages while driving or they may kill seven people. Thank you for showing us how
