I enjoy this movie a lot as a child. In those days, I thought of the stupidity of baseball stupid, funny and the movie "cool" because it was about sports Many years later, I can look back and see that the film was well designed. This film opened my eyes as a small child to fight with other children, manage and real world problems. Such exposure is mostly lacking in children's movies today, which I don't think is beneficial to our society. Of course, the baseball comedy seems to be stupid. But they pulled the children in /> <br /> As an adult, Al's performance To the actors playing with both children and Danny Glover, which everyone works perfectly
