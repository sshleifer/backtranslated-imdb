TIllman Jr.'s drama about the first African-American diver (Gooding Jr.) that challenges all his abilities and achieves his goal despite being a bitterly strict trainer. The screenplay is not too bad sometimes. But the direction and performance are very good, and this film inspires and succeeds in what should be done. I like DeNiro as a leader, although it is not always with his professional work. (Taxi drivers, godfather and others) It's as good as his other good performances, such as in the King of Comedy or Angel Heart. Deniro is always confident and confident. Good work. Gooding Jr. That is not bad. Of course, it's one of his better performances. --- IMDb score: 6.6, My score: 9/10
