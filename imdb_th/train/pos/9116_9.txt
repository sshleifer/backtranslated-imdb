The idea is a very clever name. This movie has a strong tongue in the cheeks giving a feeling to it. But it's so clever that you don't know how to read! These guys are performing comedy that is full of humor or other things happen. The little dialogue of this movie is not very delicate and this is the power of this movie. If all the sounds from the movie are actually closed, it will not delete anything from the movie. The physical act or the art of acting is so strong that the story is complete. <br /> <br /> I'm blessed and happy, followed by blessings. I first said that this movie is part of the "black" film festival. After watching the movie, I was impressed with the work. But I asked myself what to do next Where else can people see this event? No association of art cooperation that is not intended here. You can see the design intention from start to finish. Using African music, handsome style, everything seems to be planned and for a reason. The character development is amazing. The casting that I think is the strongest aspect of this movie. The character is easily defined within 2 minutes from the actual movie 6 minutes. <br /> <br /> We need to watch more movies of this type. Actually, there must be more support for developing short films across the board.
