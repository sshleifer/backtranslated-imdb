Speaking of art, this is a beautiful movie - movies, music and gorgeous costumes. In fact, this movie is better than directed by Akira Kurasawa. In this case, he only wrote this movie many years ago after he died. <br /> <br /> So, as far as writing goes, the conversation is Well written and sometimes interesting. However, the story is quite depressing. But it's not interesting in some ways - it's the story of a group of women working in a brothel. It is interesting that even though prostitutes are seen as more acceptable businesses in Japan But women are still long for a better life This made me think of a lot of Streets Of Shame, even though Streets Of Shame's characters are less pleasant and one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> So overall, it gets 7 - mostly. Since everything writing is terrible, the weakest link in this movie is the story of the great Kurasawa.
