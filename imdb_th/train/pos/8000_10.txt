... Do not read any summary of the story, because in the story, the story may look a little brain-dead and pointless. This movie is a great story.

"Incredible" is a small word used for actors with Can be like that This film is based on real facts and some characters are not characters, the truth that increases the shock I have during and after the movie. If you like both actors and movies that are quite crazy, you haven't watched your favorite programs ... Believe me, in the end you will have a strange and unexplainable feeling. This movie is great, looks for hire-purchase or whatever ... don't miss it.
