I accidentally met this movie when showing all the movies I wanted my sister to record for me while I was on holiday and I'm glad I included this movie. It's related to the problem that most directors embarrassed from my problem with this movie, that it was made for TV so I couldn't buy a copy for my friend. <br /> <br /> Is an impressive story about how People with eating disorders do not have to shy away from everyone and have friends who are fasting. To my attention that although bulimics can maintain a relatively stable weight But it has a serious impact on their health that many people do not know
