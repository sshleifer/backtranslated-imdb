I watched this with everyone in the family at the age of 9 in 1964 on our black and white TV. I remember my father remarking that "This is something that can happen - Adam and Eve." I remember the scene clearly when Adam found Eve. Her eyes were black. I asked my father why her eyes were black and he said because she was tired and hungry. When I didn't see it now in 45 years, I still remember clearly - the transmission of TV signals with planets in the home, the explosive scene, the head office with the last scene of the two walking away. show But it has impressed me over the years
