This movie is very old. I never knew how children watched Ray Millland. In 1936, I remembered that he played in the movie "Lost Weekend". Ray plays Michael Stuart, a banker. Very rich In this picture, there are three girls who are not satisfied with their parents and they know that their father is going to marry a blonde girl who is a gold digger looking for sugar daddy only. They hired a man who caused a lot of wealth. His name was Count Ariszted (Misha Auer) who was constantly drunk and innocent. Deanna Durbin (Craig Craig) makes everyone surprised when she is booked in the police station and tells the police chief that she is an opera star. Penny begins singing the best soprano voice I've ever had. Heard every police department and The prisoners began to clap, which was a fun and entertaining scene from this movie. This is the first film to be released by Deanna Durbin, and she succeeds overnight and becomes a great movie star with Universal Studios after leaving MGM.
