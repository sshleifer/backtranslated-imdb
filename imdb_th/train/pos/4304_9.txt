I remember watching this movie at about 7 years old and at that time it shocked me. I've seen movies with violence before. But I have never seen a movie that has the effect and reality of violence before This movie is not only But shown only But also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness The thing that this movie does and fail to do is to be true. Attempts to show that racism is bad (and actually has racism in Asia against prejudice -) and comes from a position that has better moral The Grand Canyon comes from things from a raw and real perspective. In fact, it ends up on the ground that is higher than the error. Especially when you compare the ending The end of the collision is a small end that is expected, which connects everything together. While the Grand Canyon ends with a quiet note where you don't know what will change in your character's life But that is because life continues as well. There is no proper end. No matter how good you are ... there is no ending of the chapter to start another chapter.
