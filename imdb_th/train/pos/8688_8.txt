The Columbo story has a very high standard, which is actually the first episode filmed in a series that has been running for a long time. Originally received the second broadcast (after "Murder By The Book") <br /> <br /> Robert Culp made him one of the three. Appeared as a guest in the murderer series and played as a private detective agency owner who blackmailed his wife. (Patricia Crowley) of the rich, highly influential business people (Playing sympathetic by Ray Milland) after he forged the report After discovering that she has a relationship The wife later rebels against the blackmail pattern. But was killed in anger .... <br /> <br /> A very satisfying episode in many ways, especially when the plot was set up and later developed and It is also because of the rare ingredients of Columbo that the crime is an unintentional killing. All that was improved when the widowed husband used the murderer to help Columbo in his investigation: a feature that facilitates many good quality scenes, especially in the first scene of the three main characters. br /> <br /> Directed by Bernard L. Kowalski, who has the right flair and high level of performance, this makes the sound of the entire series (since "Murder By the Book" ends with a bad feeling). Chard Levinson and William Link, the creators of the script by Columbo, have precise, well-structured and well-thought, and supported by a continuous and meaningful production sequence that represents Unpredictable predictions Finally, the final scene of the drama will be a clear example of that Columbo is one of the earlier steps of the murderer. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a very good investigative work for Columbo and clearly shows. That the production team has worked positively And creative to create a polished Columbo story
