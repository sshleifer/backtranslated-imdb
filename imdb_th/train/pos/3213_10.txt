It's a perfect example of "Less Is More ..." Kurt Russell (Sgt. Todd). There are only 72 lines and some words like 104 words. What a challenge! As with black and white photographs, when your eyes need to fill in the gaps, facial expressions, physical expressions, gestures, all emotions are combined to create a strong impact. This is one of the top 5 movies that I can't live without, right with the classic movies like Road Warrior. If you like this, check out "Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior" and "Braveheart" both. As well as "Gladiator" with Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen in Soldier as well. The "Thirteenth Warrior" starring Antonio Banderas and "Blade Runner" starring Harrison Ford
