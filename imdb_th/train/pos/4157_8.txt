This first anime movie is a fairly good movie that I saw once in the science fiction channel when anime is popular in America and not a disaster. The ratings that swim for adults claim it. In the cartoon network I am quite straightforward to think that it has little to do with it being less popular and more, with the fact that people would rather now buy DVDs to watch uncut episodes on the internet. Although this movie might not have everything cut and the audio work is ok for the dubbed movie. But I want to see the original Japanese version Americans often use annoying sounds for children in what is dubbed This movie has a boy who takes a train named Galaxy Express in the hope that he can turn it into a planet with technology to turn him into a robot. He wishes to be a robot to avenge his mother, who was brutally murdered by the hands of a robot that hunted humans for fun. During his adventures, he became friends with various workers on the train, including women who resemble his late mother, a beautiful woman named Matel, who, like most women in anime movies, has secrets. That might be really good for our young hero or not really good He went from a planet to a planet with a train stopped and he ran into the space pirate named Captain Harlock, who starred in his own comic cartoon series. In conclusion, riding is very good with a strange and unexpected ending. There will be a sequel of this one. But it's not as good as this But the ending is more final than here
