This documentary (now available for free on Video.Google.Com) is a great demonstration of the power of the common people to overcome injustice. Everyone must see this thing. <br /> <br /> Chavez was elected in a landslide election in 1998. His platform was a diversion of the amazing wealth of the middle class, 20% to the poor 80. % He banned fishing nets from foreign countries in the waters of Venezuela. He sent 10,000 Cuban doctors to the slum to treat the sick for free. He overruled illiteracy and set up a new university for free. <br /> <br /> But it was a 30% tax on oil company profits that caused him problems with the Bush administration in 2002 while Irish film producer Kim Bartley And Donnacha O'Briain are interviewing Chavez in the presidential palace about his social program. When the camera rolled, Chavez was arrested and flew out of the country. There is a national TV announcement that he 'resigned'. <br /> <br /> But the poor of Venezuela didn't believe in the media. They went to Wang in their million and demanded Chavez return. When faced with such overwhelming numbers, the soldiers turned to coup leaders and planners fled to the United States. Chavez was rescued by a military helicopter and returned to ecstasy.
