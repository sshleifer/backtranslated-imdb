I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 6 or 7 years old and didn't think it would be something special. Over time I watched a few times and it began to grow with me when I began to understand the morality of this film which I will come later. For a while, I left this movie alone and didn't watch for a while. When looking for old classic movies that had to be watched a few weeks ago (now 15 years old), I dug the VHS of returning home. After watching this, I was left on a natural high ground which I couldn't really explain. This film gives an overwhelming feeling that you never expected. The nature of the three different animals of the film, together, to find a way back home, send messages to the home, no matter how different you are, you can find a common ground, which is what you need. The character of the chosen character is excellent. In which you have an old knowledgeable golden dog, taking care of or guiding the 'chance' of a fun love, if the young bulldog is a little clumsy with a clever, intelligent cat But have confidence This movie follows all three friends or companions on an impossible journey in a real way. It creates magic when you begin to believe that this journey may happen. <br /> <br /> I don't want to sound like a soft tissue catcher when talking about movies. I'm sure I'm quite the opposite. But the highest part of this film is a shadow that is undoubtedly back when Shadow tried his best to escape and had a chance and cheeky. He told him to go out painfully. When both animals returned to their beloved owners, there was silence until the shadows would yearn over the horizon to the fear of everyone. There is a fine line between heartwarming and repetitive garbage. But this movie is pure magic, even at the age of 15. This movie may not be the Lord of the Rings. But for Disney to produce such great movies using animals and to elevate themselves in As it did, even at this age, it deserves 10/10.
