I'm not sure when I heard this story, I thought Disney was just stupid. I was wrong. I found it very good. I mean, not The Lion King, but it's great to see one side from one point. It's very funny. In addition, it is not one of the sequels that are full of Disney animated animations. It is like The Lion King animation. Do not give anything But you know what I'm talking about I'm still having fun that is great with most actors returning from the original. It is a very good movie in every subject.
