I never bothered to watch this movie in the cinema, even though I often remember names. I finally watched it this week and it was delightful. For some reason I expect it to be very bad, so I am completely surprised when I sit down and stick with it and find myself drawn into me. Read other user reviews. Talk about. Her battle in the ring But the wonderful thing about Diana is that she is a real fighter in life. All you have to do is find her place, who you are and the ring to help you get there. It's a very clever story and I'm surprised that this is the first time Michelle Rodriguez has done a great job. Adrian and her coach are quite good. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite rough around the edge, but it doesn't matter much. The story, intentions and performances are completely over-flawed. (Which often comes with indie filmmaking anyway). An interesting depiction of a girl who finds herself and succeeds over her situation and Keio. For Michel Rodriguez!
