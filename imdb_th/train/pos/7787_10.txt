This film captures the essence of growing in a small town in America for young girls on their own. The realism and small differences presented to the characters of Ruby Ruby by Ashley Judd, with the story capturing what can be described as true to the life of begging from Florida. From the screen door to the lack of resonance of what life is really on "red v-neck" provides a difficult choice for girls. Heaven is not easy at all. But she slowly overcome obstacles and deception and learns to be her own woman with the strength that flows from within. Ashley Judd's winning smile and an infected walk spit warmth and command respect and admiration. Careful in character development, similar to "Ulee's Gold" in 1997, starring Peter Fonda and directed by Victor Nunez.
