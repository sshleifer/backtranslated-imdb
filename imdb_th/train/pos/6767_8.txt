As a young teenager at that time, Airwolf was a new generation that wanted their "Cowboys and Indians" to have amazing equipment and loud explosions. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the show was Knight, based on the driver of the sky: similar comic book technology, the main character that is lonely and reflects the concept of a man who makes a difference. <br /> <br /> But in other ways, it's important. Important Unlike Knight Rider, Street Hawk, The A-Team and the action of the time for one more evidence of the series was created not want to help people in need. But with the acquisition of Airwolf's Stringfellow Hawke for selfish reasons (Useful in trying to find his brother, MIA) and then there was a dark border made by reference to the series in the 1980s Cold War context, along with Soviet intelligence and Central American dictators. Speaking about the enemy within, of course, the A-Team has cited Vietnam and the status of the team as a continuous refugee. But generally it is done with a light touch and hardly the center of the plot itself. With Airwolf, the interest is the key to the tone and direction of the show - although this is diluted (not good. ) While the series proceeds. <br /> <br /> By understanding the post-Cold War problems Many stories, illusions, and plans, and what Airwolf did was unbelievably clear even though using current technology. But that's not Airwolf. It's fun. Roaring. It tries to tell interesting stories without relying on any big action scenes, and it does not coat everything with confidence that no one dies miraculously. Sometimes it fails. But often it is admirablely successful - and on a TV budget to boot. <br /> <br /> For readers in the UK, DMAX (Sky channel 155) has just begun (January 2008). Every day, set up your Sky + box for this explosion from the past - we may get a fourth season that has been rebuilt. (And much inferior) that my knowledge had never appeared in the United Kingdom before
