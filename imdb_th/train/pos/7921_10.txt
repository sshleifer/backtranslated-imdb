It's funny. Look at it !!! <br /> <br /> Ok, they want 10 lines. So: This is a 50s / 70s werewolf movie forgery. There are many words about politics. Feeling like an early film of Clouseau (probably because Alan Arkin), but using less slap sticks If you like Naked Guns movies, you will like this too. (Less sluggish in this film) <br /> <br /> Actually, humor is from light sexuality (unavoidable in teen comedy) to intense social and political satire. The change of Moon High School from the 50s to 70 is really funny. The order in which the president's image was changed is great! OK, probably not great, but still hilarious. There are many histarical starting with the cold war and inflation. Late 1970s <br /> <br /> Anyway, just watch movies if you have. chance
