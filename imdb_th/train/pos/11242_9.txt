Anyone interested in pop music and not familiar with British music trends in the late eighteenth decade should be sure to watch Breaking Glass at least once. A movie about the pursuit of a girl that will make her known in the music world, capture the perfect moment, from open sex discrimination, difficult economic times, social turmoil to the transformation of pop culture. Pop And references to new futuristic / romanticism, music and fashion styles created every day in the United Kingdom in the late seventies are still being discovered and recycled (Nothing really new since 1980) This is an amazing time and Breaking Glass. Both tell personal stories and explore the cultural landscape and do very well.
