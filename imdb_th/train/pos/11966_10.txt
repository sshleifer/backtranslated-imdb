This is a great series. You will laugh. You will cry. These wonderful people will be part of your family. The way this family cares about each other and helping each other through their crisis is a good example of how we should live our lives. There are many good things they do and many bad choices. But they never turned their backs on their families to work through problems Michelle, the youngest daughter, is the most lovely thing I have ever seen. Stephanie, a middle-aged daughter, sick with middleweight children and with help from everyone in the family, it is better. The older daughter DJ is growing up, whether her father wants it to happen or not. One thing that they share is to think of Danny's mother (father), Joey and Uncle Jessie. They love these kids a lot and it's clear at all stages
