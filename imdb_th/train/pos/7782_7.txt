The photography is beautiful. But I had difficulty understanding what happened ... There are many symbols ... 2 goldfish - do they have any meaning in Thai culture? There are not many plans, not many occurrences, and it's just zigzagging. There is no real beginning, no real middle and no real ending. <br /> <br /> It's hard to get into a character that you never felt like knowing them ... It's hard to know which scene is imaginary. Movement is chaotic and discontinuous. I don't know what the Pang brothers want to do. Maybe if I am Thai, it will be more reasonable ...
