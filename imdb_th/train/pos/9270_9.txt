I have to point out before you read this review that there is no way to command the Iranian people ... if you want to read something more than hope you see me and politicians in general. .. But if you're going to be offended ... I can't help you. <br /> <br /> Not in Iran because this movie was banned there. (See trivia on IMDb for this movie) It's a shame because this movie is very good. It will not be suitable for "Grbavica". This film will be awarded at the International Film Festival in Berlin. <br /> <br /> So right. (It's a runner-up or second place if you want) Why? Because it is a movie about oppression Not that this is a complete problem of women. It is a matter of government trying to make people disappointed. The comparison is clear that the government feels that it is necessary to ban movies. But by banning it, there is nothing to fix and / or they can make this film disappear! <br /> <br /> Other reviewers have a great summary: "Comedy about tragedy" which is quite good!
