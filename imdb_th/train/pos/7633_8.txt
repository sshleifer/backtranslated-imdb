Reading the external reviews of Roger Ebert and other famous film critics made me reluctant to accept how much I love this movie, even though I have a Japanese version of the dubbed video. <br /> <br /> Obviously, many critics seem to think that it had been deleted earlier, which had previously used the most famous evidence in the story. "It's a wonderful life." For me, excellent evidence is a great proof, no matter how many times it is used, and I am happy to see more movies using this particular location. The opportunity to receive a new perspective in his own life through a bit of "the magic of heaven." <br /> <br /> I think people and critics who are more intellectual are not drawn into it. subject But I didn't go to the movies to criticize them with my notebook in my hand - I went to see the movie to throw myself in and let them take me to the place they wanted. <br /> <br /> If You have a sentimental feeling like yourself. You will receive good returns when you see this picture. Great performances throughout and this film has been very well chosen. Choose a great song as well. Michael Caine is great as a sympathetic bartender. Jim Belushi works well as an ordinary "ordinary Joe" who suspects that his life will not disappear as he should. are Linda Hamilton is always excellent as the goal again as the beloved wife, Jon Lovitz, to entertain as usual and even have a surprisingly moving moment in "Mr. Destiny". <br /> < br /> Not "Mr. Destiny" is not "It's a Wonderful Life" but who says it must What will be In my own sense "Mr. Destiny" is a movie that is good, funny and lively. I've watched videos that have been dubbed in Japanese many times and I'm sure I will see it many times. If so, make me a "lowbrow" either! I'm just glad I didn't read the review of "Mr. Destiny" before seeing it. <br /> <br /> I think I should have courage in my judgment and let the nine or ten stars. star But I can't help but wondering myself after reading all the reviews!
