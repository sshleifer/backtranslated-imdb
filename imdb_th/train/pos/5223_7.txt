It seems that this movie will make many people dissatisfied. First of all, there is not much to see at first. (I just accidentally hit) and then judging by the comments and ratings of many people who do not have much fun. <br /> <br /> Well, I do. I tend to tolerate Gere for the look and charm of He and even if I don't consider him to be a great actor But I know that he did very well But this performance is totally different He's not beautiful in this, and he's not charming. His character is completely different from what I saw from him until now --- old, ugly, broken, accidentally. And the gear in which I was, until his best performance ever pulled it out beautifully I think it's a sign that how well the actors do their job. If you can't imagine who did it instead --- think of Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter or Washington as Alonzo on that training day. It's good that Gere came here. <br /> <br /> The rest of the actors are good people as well. I guess I would not have played the role of Danes in this role, mostly because I think she looks too good, but she actually works great, with Gere in a great style. Strickland offers good support. Most easily in the part that requires a lot of time from her I think she is the owner of the important scenes with Gere and Danes, and that is a success. <br /> <br /> So the rest of the movie, other than the great performance? The story may not be as surprising as some of its 8 mm aspects, but adding stories. "Veterans in the rookie" for those who are foolish and (like Silence of the Lambs) add a sense of urgency through trying to save. The young woman and the imminent retirement of Gere's characters, all of which are the backdrop of the development of the two main characters because they help each other to create a new station in life. That is something that must be accomplished within 100 minutes, but well done and we take care of the characters and what happens to them. <br /> <br /> The direction and shooting is enough. I can do without moving and cutting modern video camera. But then I was an old curmudgeon and actually it wasn't that bad. Actually, I thought it helped the atmosphere of this movie. Might have guessed that, in general, not a happy person <br /> <br /> worth seeing
