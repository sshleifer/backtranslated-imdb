This is one of my favorite Govinda movies of all time and the best movie of 1994. David Dawan worked very well in directing this movie. He made it funny and added a family drama. Gwinda is excellent as the King of Babu and gives a great performance. Karishma Kapoor is an actor that I hate. This film is a little less annoying. But still annoying. In some scenes, Kader Khan is a pundit in the show and also gives great performance. Aroona Irani is great as a mother and gives a great performance. Comedy, action, drama, family and romance
