For movies that are sexually explicit and movies, it doesn't have the right to be as sweet as it is. The story of Betty Page, a good Christian girl from the south, whose mother didn't allow her to date until she got married, which moved to New York and ended up being the most successful person of her generation from Gretchen. Her face Moll couldn't adjust the image she took. (No one is allowed to touch it, fun and respectful) with pornographic trials.> The page is an inspiration for every comedy artist since not only because she has bodies that have to die. But because she invests every image with a naive sense of fun that is sexy and simple at the same time Rather like this movie. Actually, the film in both black and white techniques and glorious colors is a lovely way to spend a couple of hours.
