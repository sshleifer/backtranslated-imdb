Before losing everything shown on the TV can be predictable You can predict who will die or who will find something, but in Lost you can predict anything. Everything is a very surprising thing, and it's a mystery, not because it has many secrets. But because there is nothing like before all the great things I truly stick to it. LOST is a classic art. It gives you what to expect every week. It's a genius The surrounding area is excellent. It's quiet and warm on the beach and very scary in the forest. The characters are all intelligent works, especially the characters on the island. The shipwreckers are amazing. But we cannot predict their death because they have many more things to do and many more to say
