This film has done very well in many levels that I am afraid that the score will be as low as (5.9 / 10 (576 votes) according to this writing). The film has an incredibly special effect, featuring real epic. Interacting with complex characters and incredible battles. The only complaint I have is the description of the HK DVD version I received (some lines are not translated - ???). <br /> <br /> I don't understand when I read and listen from various sources: "It has a confusing plot ....", "I can't follow the story ...." or "The characters come from nowhere ..." Since the first time I watched this movie, I understand. And then following it, knowing why the character was there and I really liked it! I've watched about 8 times and every time there is truly enjoyment. Oh and this is not just my opinion because I have shown this movie to many American friends. (People who have never seen Hong Kong movies before) feel the same way. Not one of them that doesn't follow the story, and each person announces love in this movie. Oh man, why can't we have something like this out of Hollywood? At least Lord of the Rings has a good marriage of special techniques, character development and stories. <br /> <br /> This is not from a newbie in Asian movies. I own many Asian movie libraries and have to say that this movie is one of my greatest DVDs. When you watch it, you will be impressed with the special effects and the wonderful feel of this movie. You will be attracted to the world of fantasy and you won't want to leave! I've seen both the 1983 and 2001 versions (both made by Tsui Hark) and the year 2001 is better than comparing IMO. <br /> <br /> In addition to the subtitles, I still have more complaints about this movie. : I don't want it to end .... I beg you, Mr. Hark - can we help each other?
