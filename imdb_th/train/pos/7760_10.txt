Director Douglas Sirk scored again with this grandfather of all incomplete family movies. This lush and worthless fairy tale is a masterpiece blending all the elements of Sirk's diapers and bringing them all together in one film. "Written on the Wind" has been heavily influenced by the 80s television series " Dallas "and" Dynasty "because of the long version of the soap at night later. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall plays as Lucy Moore, the New York City secretary who marries the baron. Kyle Headley (Robert Stack) Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) both love each other with a quiet love. But a sexy secretary They all returned to the Kyle family's mansion in Texas, where we met Marylee (Dorothy Malone), who won the Oscar Yipee! Sparks start to fly - from love to serious controversy. This is a camping trip. Mitch not only But must fight with the feelings he has for his best friend's wife only But Lee tries to sleep with everyone because she can't have one of her true love, Mitch Kyle, knowing that he is inefficient, but Lucy is pregnant. <br /> <br /> This is pure soap and pure melodious entertainment. How do you not love it? This film is one of Universal's most popular movies and is one of the best works of director Sirk. Some of the dialogue is hot and the metaphor can be seen in every way - the core of The wind was great. The performers were excellent, although Bacall was exhausted even though he received the highest charge after Hudson The loss of the Oscar of Stack of bad news destroys him. He thinks this is his best performance and obviously no one is willing to lose. And he showed great work as a whimper It's a very amazing movie! This film proved what I had thought for a long time - Sirk is a master of classical melodies. Where is his Oscar? <br /> <br />
