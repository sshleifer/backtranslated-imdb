I just watched this movie again and was still disappointed with the number of insulting people who chased it out, like the New Age pap, a great movie that takes time to develop. But never do, and in the end, meditation affects and real life more than movies that most people overlook I was furious when movies like "Prince of Tides" and "Bugsy" (although I like the latter) were nominated to get the best picture that year (let alone "Silence of the Lambs "win!) and this thing is completely ignored Except for one nomination for the best screenplay On arrival again I think history supports my initial reaction!
