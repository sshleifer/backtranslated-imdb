Ashanti is a 70s movie (precise 1979). It reminds me of The Wild Geese in some way (Richard Burton, Richard Harris and Roger Moore on a mission in Africa). It's a very good movie as well and I enjoy. <br /> <br /> David (Michael Ken) is a doctor working in Africa and married an Ashanti woman named Anansa (Beverley Johnson) who has practiced medicine in America and is a doctor. While they were studying one day, she was snatched by the slavers who worked for the Arab slave traders Suleiman (played by Peter Ustinov, perfectly everyone). The rest of the film is David trying to Bring her back. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is an absolute great actor and plays a role that is committed and ready to do everything to get his wife back. But rather hopelessly with guns and action He helped the first Englishman who campaigned against the slave trade which no one had accepted. (Rex Harrison!) Then the helicopter pilot (William Holden) briefly. Then the Arabs called Malik (Kabir Bedi) Malik got a score from Suleiman. (He has strength throughout the charming character) and rides with David to find him and get Anasa back. - This is a wonderful scene that David failed to climb the camel. <Br / > <br /> Then there are many adventures. There are also many moral questions. The progress of this story can be predicted from this point a little, and there are a few freedoms that plan to move things faster, but it's quite forgotten. The question is whether David will go to Anasa before Peter Ustinov will sell her to Omar Sharif. (Yes, of course, Omar Sharif is there!)?
