I love the good times with the rest of you. I love reading intelligent explanations and not understanding. The writers on this program are great and the actors have more abilities than they have set to answer Strawberry22 (the most elaborate commentary of good and other positive reviews) ... What happened is that James was killed. In an accident (I believe I remember it was a truck accident or a car accident) and was the most sad episode (when it first aired and I was a small thing ... It was so sad for me ..) <br /> <br /> Florida and children get out of the project and even become neighbors with Willona (Wilnona) and that's how the last performance ends. <br /> <br /> Every child Achieved dreams and found opportunities in And their dreams It was a wonderful ending and I cried because I was happy with them and the list seemed very real until I believed in their fate. I hope that the ending of this band will be true for many people. <br /> <br /> Great performances and many other great performances followed by Benson and Jefferson. This is a great time for African-American television and the best writers are great at that time. The TV LAND is great for memories and I love it because I can't stand the garbage that we watch. Today, someone ... quickly brought back in the 1970s and 1980s ... Your smart audience is dying here and we need better content. <br /> <br /> Love Love the original sitcoms of the era 7 0 and 80s (as they sing in "ALL in the Family" ... that is the day ......
