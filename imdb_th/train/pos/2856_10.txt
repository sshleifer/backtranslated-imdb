This is one of the better movies every time I see it. It is filled with many original and informal ideas that you will always find new details, just like in the follow-up movie of Sabu (I haven't seen "unlucky monkeys" but others are great). Failure, opportunity and humanism play a great role. Cutting and editing is an invention and art, in which movies are not "art" images, but are movies that provide high entertainment. When compared to "Run, Lola, Run", you have to remember that "Dangan Ranna" has been done for many years before and is shown on German TV since 1997 ... so it should be an inspiration for Tom Tykwer's film and not Other ways, along with other reviews, I have to add that I really like the show and the ending. This movie has lots of fun in many ways and it can send messages without being annoying or pretending.
