Today, the upcoming modern movie is normal for the 1980s. "Foxes" truly gives meaning. Jodie Foster plays her character straight out. Ever since she made "Taxi Driver" four years ago, she has a strong character in this film. She is Jeanie, a high school student with a lot of courage and seems to be out of any situation where she is in Scotland. Bobby plays the role of Brad before Chachi at "Happy Days". He considers other young girls underage. Cherie Currie is Annie hanging with the wrong crowd following her police father. Jeanie and her other three friends decide to stay on the forest side until they move into a rental house where the party goes away. Exploring life on the other side of the path can be fun or dangerous. Annie is rescued by Jeanie and Brad all the time she's wasted. The reality came back hard that she was killed in a car accident. And another person is married to an older man Growing up is not easy, sometimes we have to explore life as it is. In fact, you have to watch out for those around you. For me, I am my own person and I will always be like that! Great music, great story, this movie is a gem! 4 out of 5 stars!
