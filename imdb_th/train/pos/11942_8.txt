At the funeral of a famous English journalist, Jostrombelle (Ian McShane) His colleagues and friends remember him stubborn while looking for a scoop. At the same time, the deceased Joe revealed the identity of the London Tarot serial killer. He deceived the harvester and appeared to be an American student of the Sondra Pransky newspaper (Scarlett Johansson), who was on the stage in the magic show of magician Sidney Waterman (Woody Allen) in London and told her the murderer was Hugh Jackman, Sondra, drag Sid to investigate the evidence that Peter is a killer However, she fell in love with him and asked if Jo Strombelle was right in his lap. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is a new comedy of Woody Allen outside Manhattan in London. Again His ridiculous and witty lines are excellent and I laugh at the fate of the heroes in the country where the driver "In the wrong way" Sid Waterman is a very funny person and Woody Allen has a great shape as a comedian. However, in his current muse, Scarlett Johansson, who I am a big fan of, has too many performances and is annoying at various times, including changing her accent to a hysteric style. Her character is very stupid and promiscuous and I'm quite disappointed with her performance. (Probably the first time in her film work) but supernatural comedy is still a hilarious and rewarding entertainment My score is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Scoop ?? O Grande Furo" ("Scoop ?? The Big Scoop")
