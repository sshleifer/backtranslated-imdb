I agree to create good expectations before watching because some friends talk about it. (And they are not crying!) As you have to see and it is something to watch! Don't expect to see anything that causes an epidemic. <br /> <br /> Freud's psychoanalysts are interesting in many parts of the movie. But there is too much distortion and it is not stuck in the end. <br /> <br /> The good thing is Kieslowski Blue's analysis, the majority of David Lynch, Hitchcock's and maybe a few more that I missed (I just remember ... Dogville) and I usually don't miss things unless it's too clear or loose in the air. <br /> <br /> In addition to repeating that makes it too long, the documentary is fun. In terms of observing the introspection entered by our unconscious mind, therefore, the commercial success of Most of the excitement and excitement is studied and used as a basis for this theory. <br /> <br /> I like the powerful tone of the lecture and the efforts of Mr. Zizek to revive Freud's theory, which is very long. Special in North America. Again is the way to stay on top and I believe that it's not a waste of time for me to believe that most humans have gloomy gratitude for death and blood.
