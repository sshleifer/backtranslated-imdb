This is one of the movies that they promote too much if you watch T.V. You may not be able to watch movies. Almost all comedy scenes were wasted on the preview, except for the scene that had just happened when Jennifer Aniston was a funny scene. It's normal for Jim Carrey and it's really funny. Do not go to watch this movie that is expected to be surprised. In conclusion, if you like Jim Carrey or the comedies, this is something you shouldn't miss. See something else and you'll be satisfied.
