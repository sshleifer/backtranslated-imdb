I have to admit that I did not read the original story of James R. Even though I had read many of his other supernatural stories, I had seen the BBC Christmas Ghost Ghost earlier and in my opinion it was more than most of them Equal to The Signalman <br /> <br /> I can't blame the view from the hills - the direction and the 'mood' is perfect, just like the light show and of course, the story and the writing. I thoroughly enjoyed it and hope to get more quality from the same director and production team. I understand that the BBC plans to make more. (No need to depend on the story of M R James). So it's a delightful story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
