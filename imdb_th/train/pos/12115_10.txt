Other comments about this movie made it sound scary. Pictures from talk are new - I think the script and the performance are good. Davis is still young and very refreshing. She still didn't find the style that we expected. But it was good to see her like this - still learning the craft. <br /> <br /> So the old idea came from this film and it seems that this movie makes some routes in 70 years. In front of my score is to see and remember how old this movie is. Open your heart wide and you may be shocked that the character that has the problem in this picture is in 1934 and the way we watch the beginning of the last century is something shocking .. I love it and hope you think of it. It's by other people in a negative sense and one comment.
