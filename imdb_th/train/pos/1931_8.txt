The Connecticut community pool is a scene for the movie "under the Radar" that is charming, funny, fun and attractive. Although it won awards at the major film festivals, "The Big Bad Swim" was not released to the hordes of cinemas across America. But distributed on DVD and shown in selected cinemas. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that "The Big Bad Swim" never had Hollywood marketing advertisements. How many Hollywood HAS have come out this year, such as "I Know Who Killed Me" "The Big Bad Swim", a truly independent movie that truly has its own swimming. <br /> <br /> However, in "The Big Bad Swim "The actress Paget Brewster is loved and believed as Amy. A wired math teacher reaches the breaking point, not only But was abandoned by her husband only But is about to quit her job and end up in a new life TV drama actor Jeff Branson - Hot - plays as Noah, a fragile swimmer and is determined to help students overcome fear and find him able to learn from the students of Jess Weixler is beautiful, sexy (I just saw you in a bank advertisement). Playing the role of Jordan, the swimmer is the one who works. Her character is a catalyst for change in the group. But is the most easily understood of the characters because there is no "back story" or motivation why she did what she did Jordan is young enough to stay at home with the ubiquitous brother and the video camera that serves to spy on her. However, her parents were not involved in her life. In any way which looks strange There is no drunken mother or insulting father here to explain why ordinary women that are attractive from the Connecticut suburbs choose to be pillars dancers themselves. <br /> <br /> Despite this quirk, "The Big Bad Swim" succeeds in large part because it is a happy movie. Feel good. <br /> <br /> As anyone expects, it's a metaphor for life. Finally, it is better to jump with both feet and go to swim instead of sitting on the deck because life has happened to you. <br /> <br /> Bad Big swimming is a very good movie. Dorm film, something I have never seen in a great movie and men like women.
