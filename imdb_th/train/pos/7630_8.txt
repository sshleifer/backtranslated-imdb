Kurt Russell, who began his career when he actually kicked Elvis at the World's Fair, may never have acted as a king in the biographical film that was rescued by a carpenter, sheared and shocked the carpenter. There are times when you feel that you are watching Elvis until something makes you come back to reality ... Maybe Don Johnson's memory is unlucky in Elvis and Beauty Queen? All of the performances here are excellent: Season Hubley as Priscilla, Pat Hingle as Colonel, even Shelley Winters. Bring the nervous level and hysteria at the appropriate level to Momma Presley's performance. Kurt's father, Bing, is playing here. Elvis Vernon's father and has good performance from Robert Gray as Elvis's friend and bodyguard Red West. <br /> <br /> Must see for Rock and roll fans
