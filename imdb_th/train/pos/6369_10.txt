I love this movie! I'm biased to see because I'm an avid Disney fan. But I really enjoy myself Action will stop running at the beginning of the movie and continue! This is a bit of Disney's departure. They don't spend much time on character development. (My husband points out) and no music numbers It is a strictly action adventure. I thoroughly enjoy it and recommend it to everyone who loves Disney, whether it be children or adults
