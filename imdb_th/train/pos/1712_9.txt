This film is a disaster at the box office and the reason behind it is the innocence of the movie, the sweetness of the story. Music is good, the story is simple and very old. But the presentation of the story is very good, the director tries his best. Abhay is fantastic and impressive, and he shines again in his role. Soho looks very sweet in the movie. The remaining actors are okay. All music and songs are very good. Himesh is impressive as a singer here. Don't miss this movie, it's a great movie and a good feeling for us. Abhay works best until the day I give 9/10 to Ahista Ahista.
