Who would have thought that such a small, vague movie might be a compelling story? I'm really impressed It's a shame that a lot of people don't see it. I always like Hans Simmer's score. And what the director launched by Bernard Rose! But I wonder if I should call it a horror movie. It may be argued that it is a fantasy or drama as well. Okay, I love the ability to interpret with Everything and everyone in Anna (played by Charlotte Burke) dreams of real conflict in her life ... houses, trees, trees, markers, lighthouses, etc. It's a lot of details, like these things that make movies good. For repeated viewing I hope that I will find another small movie that is full of emotions and psychological meanings, not long ago.
