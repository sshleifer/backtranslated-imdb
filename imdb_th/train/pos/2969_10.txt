This movie is about two men who do sports at the point of trying to get 2 hot chicks. BASEketball becomes a nationwide sport. Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) is the team captain who loves But hated when he lost the NBA to other rival teams, he met the girl of his dreams, Yasmine Bleeth and they finally kissed each other. The first time I saw this film, I wet my pants. It's very funny. Definitely a must see for every funny fan. If you love South Park, you'll love this! May not be able to watch with children, it is not suitable for little ducks Some buds give it 6 1/2 out of ten. I give 11 out of ten. I like random rocks. I have to go bye. Thanks for reading this.
