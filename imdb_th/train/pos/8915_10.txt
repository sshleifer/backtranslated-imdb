THE BLOB is a terrifying horror film, not only because of the terrifying images of the characters that are almost dissolved in the flesh. But because it has real social content It is a horror movie that feels good in many ways. The intelligent story is overwhelmingly helped by strong performances from all the actors. Steve Mac Queen and Aneta Corsaut, two romantic actors, bring depth and surprising feelings to the trial. They misunderstood But young people who have a very good meaning and are easy to take root for them. <br /> <br /> This is a pro-social movie and a terrifying children's character, causing most problems, not being bored. Of defects of malevolent characters Steve McQueen's rickshaw rivals almost seem to be enemies early on in legal proceedings. But quickly joined the campaign of McQueen to help the city from an angry intruder when he saw the seriousness of McQueen. In this way, the character situation that at first seems to be a comic, suddenly develops the depth and realism of Humans <br /> <br /> The initial suspicion of the authorities about the children's claims in the forest has been proven wrong.

"The Blob" is the perfect tonic for depression that is generally Come along with watching "Night of the Living Dead" (1968). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Most were made from this cheap movie. But with innovation (and efficiency!) Visual effects. They are undeniably smart. A trick that challenges a lot of gravity that we see Blob's performance is done with a tiny set designed to rotate. In general, the camera will be installed in a very "locked" position. (The lights must be installed in the same manner to allow the light to remain while the room is facing this way). These scenes are usually taken one by one when the room is slowly opened. The silicone drops will flow out very slowly. And its actions must be accelerated In some way, this is similar to stopping shooting movies. But take advantage of silicone drops instead of puppets Even today, the effect is amazing and bizarre. <br /> <br /> A great movie with a sounding name that takes advantage of the BLOB is something that shouldn't be missed.
