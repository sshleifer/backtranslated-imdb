I like this movie, reminiscent of my marriage. It is very clean. You can see it with the family. Very good. The music is ok as well. I think the director, writer, is great. The film shows that marriage progresses over time. They have lovers in different lifestyles and relationships in their lives. This film shows a relatively parallel process in the same story. Some conversations are quite good. This film shows a very complex human emotion, not too much. Also shows that perfect after all is not perfect Demonstrates the dramatic change of managed marriages when it is new This film is very well written and directed.
