In old ads for blank audio tapes, the tag line is "Is it true or is Memorex?" May have said the same event now, which is a collection and compilation of the song "The Cage", the first pilot of Star Trek. It goes to the planet, forbidding Talos IV to allow Capt. Christopher Pike, his first captain who was burned and paralyzed back there. Why choose Finches? Because there will be any contact with Talos IV.

Background music and all the stories are excellent, and Meg Wyllie as the goalkeeper (Talosian leader) is great.

This is one of my favorite episodes, and no matter how many times I see it (I still have video) It doesn't disappoint me. Meg Wyllie looks alien and I don't mean mercilessly.
