* Possible spoilers * Even before doing (and better) in 'Midnight Express' and 'Return To Paradise', Brokedown Palace still records with me. <br /> <br /> Here We have stories of two young women who Traveled through Thailand and arrested for drug trafficking. Is it Alice of Claire Danes? Is it Kate Beckinsale's Darlene? Is it a handsome stranger that they meet on their journey? There is nothing really important for this story as a matter of friendship and trust and the limits they can stretch. (And lawyers who are better than him) and we have a small story that attracts the attention of the audience. <br /> <br /> Brokedown Palace is nothing special, or notorious for whatever reason - it's not a concept. Traditionally, it does not show exciting violence that leads to crowds wanting to talk about it. "Horrible truth" or "difficult truth" - it's just a good story With some good performances Bill Pullman is the weakest with his impolite and lazy way - I was bored with the characters. <br /> <br /> Kate Beckinsale, while appropriate, nothing exciting. She performed well But it is not an absolutely memorable performance. <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Kim is in a good condition by creating a favorite and determined character that really does nothing to work with. <br /> But don't make mistakes - this is Clare Danes movie. I have been a fan of her work for a long time and this has not changed. She is passionate about every scene that she appears and does not belong to her. For this film, it may become boring. I admire her performance in the scene between her and Darlene's father. <br /> <br /> The film has a great soundtrack. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
