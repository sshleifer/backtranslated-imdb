This short film that won the Oscar can be classified as the greatest category of genre. It was a picture treatment about a boy who bought goldfish, loved him in a bowl and went out. The school released unprotected goldfish and opened the window carefully After a while, a nearby orange striped cat poked into the window and headed slowly towards the bowl. Apparently the fish knew that something was happening and was very excited. When the cat came close to the fish bowl, jumped out. The cat caught the fish and released him back into the bowl and came out through the window he entered while the boy didn't know what had happened. This amazingly realistic photo shoot with Cousteau makes these animals behave in such a remarkable manner. I just hope that this movie will be open to the public. I saw it only once in 1959 when it first launched. But it still cannot be forgotten
