Complex, annoying and unbelievable. Fay Grim is hard to sit, but Parker Posey is the only actress who can use this story. She is funny and witty at the same time. Supporting actors contribute to it. <br /> <br /> I never even told your plot .. It involves the character from Hartley's Henry Fool and trying to tell the story of espionage. International <br /> <br /> This film works well if you still understand it. In a completely absurd sense It's even more ridiculous when you plot. (I disobey the temptation to close the DVD twice) <br /> <br /> Faye Grim needs an adventurous movie actor who is willing to handle things that are not cookies. Finally, it has a challenging explanation.
