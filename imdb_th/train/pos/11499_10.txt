Since it was only a toddler when the program started broadcasting, I just picked up a DVD set and I hope there will be a lot of filming episodes. This program is a TV show "X-Files" in the 70's of poplular 90 - but in a funny / light way, but don't understand me. (From the imagination of the course - this is the early 70s television) <br /> <br /> Some of the stupid plans, like the performances But that is the charm and charm of this series. Whether you like drama, crime, mystery, comedies or sci-fi / horror themes, this series brings everything together. Each episode was overclocked at about 50 minutes or more (1 hour with ads) and 50 minutes passed quickly, making me always want more. Great classic performances that are in my book!
