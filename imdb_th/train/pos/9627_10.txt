This is the shortest funny conclusion of two cartoon geniuses. Since the time that they walked in until the time that Hardy had just fallen from the roof, this made me laugh lately. I highly recommend that all fans of Laurel and Hardy should see this short. I also recommend all Ghost Series. If you are looking for a laugh, watch this movie and you will be happy.
