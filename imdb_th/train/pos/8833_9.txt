I was fascinated by the name, so during the small race of insomnia (Energizing with my curiosity ...) I live and watch it. Then I checked my TV program and watched it again! There is a clear perception that happened to me when I saw this movie - despite the politics, culture, culture, etc., every teenager was the same. Children's characters from Belgrade may be sent somewhere in the Midwest of America at the same time, and language differences will not be possible to separate from those teenagers. Of course, they show pain and enchantment as well. Politics: Music, sex, idols, movies, music, drink, sports, music ... Actually, the same thing that made me grow up in 1970 in Southern California. <Br /> <br /> This is a bitter story. But the happiness of the children makes it so much fun The characters, especially young actors, also believe. I will not say that this is Yugoslavia "American Graffiti" but I would say that it is suitable for other themed movies in the 50s.
