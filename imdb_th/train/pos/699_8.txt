I saw the nightmare of Insomnia not long ago for the first time and I must say that I found it quite good. If you are a fan of Dominic Monaghan, you will love it. Does the hole movie happen in his heart? The performances from others are quite shaky and slightly shaky, and some scenes may be reduced. But it ended in the end The specialness of the DVD is as good as the movie, if not more for those dome fans. It has many straightforward moments from scenes, scenes and great interviews from directors. Everyone who has gone through independent filmmaking will love to watch Tess (director), Dom and everyone in a very small private scene trying to fight the less creepy movie It's very fun and I'm glad to have it in my collection.
