I read the book for the first time when I was a child and watched a movie late at night. About a year ago I checked out on IMDb and discovered that there was no copy. Then I entered the website and found the website that provided War Films service. I was very happy that I ordered the copy and sat down and could confirm why I wanted to see it again. Enjoy the movie really. I suggest you read it. Get a copy of the book and watch the movie. This book is no longer printed. But I followed the copy via E-bay. Author Alan White is a commando / paratrooper during World War 2, participating in a secret operation, and this is his first book. It is written by people who know and truth. I believe that books and movies are accurate. I did not give only ten movies because the nature of the ending of this movie is not as good as the book. There is a plot of two lines that are different from this book, which is strange because the book is not about the large nature of the war. But about the people in the war This film shows the extraordinary good things. I have a copy of a book for my son to read. The movie that will let him look in that order. <br /> <br /> If you can follow it in books and movies And I just hope it will be read and watch more, which is one of my best war movies!
