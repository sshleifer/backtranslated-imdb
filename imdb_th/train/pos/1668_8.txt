Artemisia last night At first I didn't think I would like it. But when I saw that I didn't feel like sleeping and nothing else, I still watched and felt myself still interested in pure virgin Artimisia. Her love with the old Tassi made her feel a memorable feeling. Although this film depends on the level of love and not truth. But I love it more than a general biography or drama Great play, great camers, great music and messages. I love it and I need it more! :-)
