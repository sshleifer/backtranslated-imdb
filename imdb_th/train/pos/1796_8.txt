I went to the cinema with a female friend. In the evening, a chick flicks without any apologies for being like that. But I can say with relief that it is not mixed with estrogen, which is painful for men who look red. Except for one example, at the very end of the movie, I watched with interest and didn't have to turn around or look at any melodrama. For their part, they would definitely love this movie. <br /> <br /> Ann Lord is an elder riding on a bed and spending her last few days on this planet as comfortably as possible in her home with her two daughters. Her side. With memories that were not received from the past in the past, Ann called the name of the man that her daughter had never heard of before: Harris, while her daughter, both considered quietly the importance of need. The mother's courage to reminisce and resolve her bad relationship with this mysterious man all the time, Ann goes back to the day when the fate she met with Harris. Therefore, losing the optimistic, youthful outlook for the future that we all cannot avoid. <br /> <br /> Both Ann and her two daughters - married one child continuously "commophobe "- Fight the main question of Does true love really exist and may be more important if true love can withstand the test of time? Are we all fortunes one day or not to realize that love does not last forever? Do we all know that crystallization for imperfection is just the actual result? The deep truth that Ann-age still struggles with is the answer to these questions about her death, not disappearing with her two daughters. <br /> <br /> An interesting evening movie - movie. Mostly used in Ann She recalled the story in the past and for this reason I thought that the film was filmed as if it had been used too deliberately for everyone to shine. (And makes it clear that this is not true But happened in the past) Claire Danes is beautiful (looks really high, but in reality only 5 '5 ") and has a charm in a climactic scene, in which she can finally sing. <br /> < br /> <br /> You can't talk about junk about the actor, which leads to Claire Denes and doesn't let it go: Vanessa Redgrave, Patrick Wigan Lonson, Meryl Streep and Glenn Close, play other important and secondary roles in movies. Br / <br /> Day can not say anything negative about this film, even though the struggles of Hugh Dancy to make his characters emerge from the one-dimensional as it is to lose it all in the end. Of the rich who show off their bravado But secretly scared that can not be compared to anything that may not have a way to explore the character very much - he was ordered and stuck with them. <br /> <br /> Finally, gentlemen, female friends of You will definitely cry and while you are not likely Feeling almost affected in the evening, definitely not wasting time watching the evening. Catch it in the cinema or grab it as a rental to redeem for points when you want to watch Die Hard 4's upcoming Rambo performances.
