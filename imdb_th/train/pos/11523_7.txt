This is one of the most fun movies I've ever seen. I watched it on DVD and the disc does not have any special features or even menus. But that doesn't have to be something that I'm interested in. <br /> <br /> I usually judge movies on a case-by-case basis, depending on other things, if it's a large studio or a small movie. This is a movie that is smaller and I am willing to forgive a little. Who said that I believe it is one of the most original and imaginative names that I have seen. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the performances of all the important players. Alan Arkin has the most fun role The character that Claire Forni shows may be unrealistic for some people. But I know people who have emotional problems that are personally looking at life's decisions easily. That allows me to receive the difference that hurt her, can come out through the veneer of your humor. <br /> <br /> This is not an obvious children's film. But it does not participate in sex and free nude pictures Although there are some adult languages But sometimes it's funny (Especially the character of Alan Archin, who cannot be sworn in correctly) <br /> <br /> Watch from the cameo from a well-known actor
