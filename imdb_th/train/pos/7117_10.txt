This movie is a great movie. Everything about it, in my opinion, is the most important thing from acting to directing. I know Mr. Garfield was blacklisted in 1950, but most of his other films are in the video if not DVDs. Why is it like this? Friends recorded it from TCM for me, but having it on DVD should be good. For the special features that they may say, marine historians talk about fighting, and if Mr. Schmid's wife or son is still alive, they may be interviewed as well. However, this is a great movie and I highly recommend it if it is brought out. Hopefully it will not be colored. Making color, it's my idea to just destroy all the effects of the movie. The fight scenes are as realistic as the year 1945. The movie will be released. Mr. Garfield has done a great job in drawing. Mr. Schmid, some actors, may be tempted to do too much for Mr. Schmid's disability But I feel that he understands I sincerely hope that they will come out with this movie on a DVD one day to commend the courage of Al-Schmid and other Marines who sacrificed for us in World War II.
