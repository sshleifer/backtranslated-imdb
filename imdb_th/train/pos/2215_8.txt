I bought "The Feast of All Saints" and it wasn't a horrible movie. But there are many better things It has many historical values, played by very talented actors / actors and is not an everyday event that actors can perform such roles and believe. There are some parts that are moderate and slightly confusing. But I won't say that this movie is scary. When you think about that, catch the New Orleans 1800s and create something. It's difficult and difficult to get an actor who has a lot of meaning for those parts. But the only big problem I have with this film is that most actors who play people who are mostly independent are African people, white skin, smooth, not very universal in casting other actors in the pattern. Old creole that still exists The selection of actors may be more diverse when talking about Creole, although many people who know that being a Creole color are quite selective. Actors that look white, on the one hand, may think more than actors. Should be able to write better and overall I find that acting is very reliable
