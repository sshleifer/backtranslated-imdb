Jake's Closet has the emotional power of Kramer and Kramer combined with the imagination of Pan Maze. Even the initial effects seemed to nod to Pan's maze. But this is a story that happened in the present day, not in the war sixty years ago, and in this way it has more resonance today Jake's wardrobe is about a boy who is the only child during the summer vacation, especially with his family. It's a horror movie like The Others and The Sixth Sense. Horror movies for people who are thinking. If you are looking for a slasher movie, this is not your cup of tea. But if you are looking for stories that touch and wonder with good performances, this is the movie for you. In the screening I saw, I swear that there was a time when all the viewers screamed. I would suggest catching this movie.
