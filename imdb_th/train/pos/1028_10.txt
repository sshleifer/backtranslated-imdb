I have to say that from the beginning, when I watched the movie Stargate, my movie wasn't blown away or whatever, it was like a typical sci-fi movie with many potentials, although this film wouldn't be like that. Like other sci-fi movies like Star Wars or Aliens, if you are a sci-fi fan, you'll agree that one of those two names is amazing, even though I'm not a sci fi fan that is hard-core like Some people Remember one line from those movies. I'm not a big fan of wearing a Star Wars shirt. In fact, if you see me, I'll look like a normal person with you. Ah, out of this point exactly. Is something you don't have to be a sci-fi fan game that is hard to enjoy this great series, which ended after an amazing season of 10 seasons with no quality down to near the end of 2006> <br /> Even though I don't like movies a lot, I look forward to the first season in 1997 and let me tell you, special effects are just one of the things that are vague about the chemistry series between characters. Will Special impact on me as good if not better than most sci fi show today. I have to admit that I will not enter Sci fi if not because Gates and my father brought me to Saipan when I was 6 years old and glad he did. I don't want to do it. I have never seen a great performance like SG1, which in my opinion has set the standard for almost all series and movies. In general, if the new sci-fi series doesn't improve or as good as SG1, it's not worth it. look In general, this is the best sci-fi showing up to date, and if you don't watch it, you don't know where you're missing!
