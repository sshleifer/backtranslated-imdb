It's time to pay tribute to Charton Heston, who was great after his recent passing, but this movie is not a movie. His other films of the past era were Ben Hur, the commander of Ten Omega Man and Planet of Apes. His work was better. <br /> <br /> This movie Built in year In 1973, there was too much population that the human race was controlled by officials to eat food products produced internationally called "Soylent Green" which is produced by human meat. This bizarre and unbelievable movie is ridiculous at the time of its release, and assumes that the population of India, which is approximately 2 billion people on that stage, will be unknowingly eating meat. br /> <br /> This character is an international secret conspiracy that the world powers have prepared to meet the nutritional needs of overpopulation by using humans. People <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for the producers of this film. thanks to God. Cannibalism was practiced by indigenous groups in New Zealand, Fiji and Borneo until 40 years before the film was created. But has been abandoned for a long time from human civilization. <br /> <br /> The stupid prophecy in this movie is women. Became a semi-sex slave after turning to the radical feminism that occurred in 1972 when the film was created. <br /> <br /> This movie is very stupid and stupid like now. Performances by Edward G. Robinson, the deceased and excellent But there is still no valid reason to return to watch movies other than academic reasons. <br /> <br /> This is one movie that I don't want to introduce baby boomers or Charlton Heston fans. Other reviews All of this film, I have read all the sounds that refer to the dystopian society in the future, which the central form seems to be related to the United States that has an ecological disaster. Only <br /> <br /> The only advantage in this movie is that the world doesn't have a large population.
