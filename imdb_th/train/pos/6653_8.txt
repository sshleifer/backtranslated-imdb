Feroz Khan and Gandhi, my father of Anil Kapoor, is a good movie that explores the confusing side of the family of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and the struggle of the eldest son Harilal Gandhi and the larger father life society. And most importantly, the devil in his head We draw one line for Gandhi, the father of the nation, and fight with any son and father. <br /> <br /> The performance is good. Shefali Shetty, Darshan Zariwala and Akshaye Khanna - in that order - add colors and things Pathetic to the terrible story in the heart of Harilal, who wants to hug only once. The direction of Feroz Khan and the canvas for production is extravagant and attractive. However, the screenplay may be more stringent. I've seen this drama many years ago on DVDs that violate copyright. (It was called Mahatma and Gandhi. I think) and it is much more interesting. Although the background score of the movie and the time when father and son are just a great treat, <br /> <br /> This movie may be good. It is the dividing line It has enormous potential to be the only difference between the story between father and son or just Gandhi or even both. The plot disappears and when you expect the best of emotion, nothing comes to you. <br /> <br /> It compares appropriately to other people of Gandhi. Such as Gandhi of Kingsley or abstract like Kal Hassan Hayram Movies about management to find its foundations; However, there is one suspect that "What will happen if ..." Worth watching 7.5 / 10
