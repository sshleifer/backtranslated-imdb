Envy is not a joke as I think it will be in the first place. But after some reviews that I read, I found it more fun than the people who provided props for now, actually not gagging minute movies like Zoolander, but Ben Stoner and Jack Black work together Dee and Walker Christian are as good as ever, so the story of Jack Black's character who created a spray that caused Pooh to disappear. Jack Black Ben Bender began to see jealousy. It's not good at all, and both Ben Stiller and Jack Black have more fun and better movies under their belts. But if my girlfriend I laughed my ass a few times because of ben stiller's big fan id. Having said that, this is a little still. But still fun to watch
