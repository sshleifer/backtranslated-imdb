This is my favorite series of Scooby Doo when I was young. I think each episode has more advantages and the villains have many creative ideas that are put into them. (And even scary and credible as well) Some of the best episodes are "I dropped my throat in San Francisco", "Twenty thousand screams under the sea", "The Ghoul, Bat and The Ugly" and "When you need star-level creatures". These please do This series is a slightly mixed bag, although there are other episodes that do not seem to be the same for them, such as "Rocky Mountain YIIII!" And "Scooby Chief's Ransom" as well as previous series This has been well collected, an interesting and interesting story. As everyone says, although it is much better without Scrappy Doo, the characters are boring and distracting with the stories that have been told.
