Soylent Green is a classic car I waited for someone to repeat it again. It seemed like they would re-create the classic sci-fi. (For example, the world war) and I hope the director / producer will do Soylent Green with animation and computer technology today. It will have the potential to be a great picture. Anti-Utopia movies may not be widely accepted. The human race is like a cockroach that has no influence from the outside to get rid of it. As human beings, we have the option to place kibosh in the creation of inferior species if they are freed from their hands. But nothing will control the breeding of humans except ourselves Despite the disease, war, abortion, contraception, etc. The human race is still multiplying like bacteria in the petri dish. Malthus' classical economics argues that any species, including humans, will multiply more than 6 billion subsistence methods and growth .... that is obscene.
