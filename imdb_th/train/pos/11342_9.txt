I watched Pufnstuf every weekend when I was about 10 years old. It was behind the Bay City Rollers. I saw it on Family Channel one day and taped to my three year old daughter. I forgot everything I loved since the children. The magic flute, the broom, the zoom, the makeup of Witcheepoo. <br /> <br /> This show is definitely a minimum technology. The mayor is a model for the mayor of McHece and everyone is an animal that is annoying eyes, but kids like this. They like to see men who work puppets rather than sitting in front of computer animation. High level with slapstick (soft), but without adult themes such as sex or dying people and children accepting Jimmy's plans. Kids think that it will be orderly. Will carry a smoke bag around and convince someone in their house to be burnt and I love that every time my daughter sees the water in the sky, the old song but you are very familiar with it and my daughter likes it It's very She used to sing "Different, difficult, different, lonely" in my daughter's car. Watch this program at least once a day for about 5 months and still be one of her favorites. <br /> <br /> I saw Pufnstuf 2000 new. In the works I hope that they will try to keep the original flavor and not do anything, such as moving characters with computers, etc. I think the new generation will like Pufnstuf.
