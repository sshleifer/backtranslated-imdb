If you have any clue about Jane Austen's production, you will now repeat in each of your novels: Marriage, Marriage and Marriage! In my opinion, every movie created from her novel is a bit boring. But I like Austen's characters because they have personalities and general words that they like to repeat like in Emma. What made Emma Dee was Gwyneth Paltrow. She excelled in her leading role. The fact that each character in the movie does not seem to be able to think of anything except to get a good match and the marriage soon makes hilarious movies
