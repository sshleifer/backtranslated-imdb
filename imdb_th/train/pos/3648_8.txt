"Pandora's Clock" is a thrilling movie between a virus movie and a catastrophic movie. This film, which aired in two parts on NBC when debuting in 1996, is about a plane infected with a virus when a passenger is carrying this disease. The US government discusses whether the plane should be destroyed while the pilot (Richard Dean Anderson) and the virus expert (Daphne Zuniga) try to avoid the disaster. I'm not a fan of movies and TV dramas, but I like "Pandora's Clock". It's one of the most exciting moments of Jane Leeves. <br /> *** (out of four)
