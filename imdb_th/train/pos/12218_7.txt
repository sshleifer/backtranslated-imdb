Japan is experiencing serious problems. The devil has disturbed Edo with a worldly form and convince them of impurity. Moreover, the birth of Ashura, the queen of the devils, is approaching. The only thing that is against this terrible threat is the Demon Wardens, a formidable warrior who may be as bad as the devil himself. <br /> <br /> Izumo is a retired demon warden five years ago Took over the theater instead of killing the demon after accidentally killing innocent children (In the fight that reminds the bar scene from dusk until dawn) One night, by chance he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman named Tsubaki. Their fate blends (letters) and they are bound by fate to be lovers and enemies. <br /> <br /> If you think it sounds like a fantasy epic / Swordplay, your typical Japanese, you will wrong In fact, there is nothing normal about Ashura. It is a hodge-podge of various types of movies that are mentioned as well as comedy, drama and romantic Director Yajiro Takita (Oni Chi) shows respect fairly. (Although funny movies are forced in some scenes) and the result is a fun popcorn movie. But it's really fun. <br /> <br /> Of course there are bugs in the movie. Some humor seems to be planned and out of place. And acting is not the greatest thing But seriously, do you watch Fantasy / Swordplay / Comedy movies for a fantastic show? No, we watch them for the action and crazy CG images that all Ashura has in Spades. To avoid misunderstandings, the movie isn't all actions. But it is spaced unselfishly enough that there are many fencing and green blood tanks for the average audience to be happy. <br /> <br /> Bottom line; This film is unusual and is not an epic battle. But did not try and it has interesting images and good fencing action The reason that this movie works for me is that it's never too serious about myself and if the audience does the same thing, they are happy to show the fun and ridiculous fantasy action action scenes. <br /> < br /> My rating 7 from 10. A fun popcorn movie
