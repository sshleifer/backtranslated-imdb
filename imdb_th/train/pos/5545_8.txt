**** Including Spoilers **** <br /> <br /> Now I'm a horror fan for decades. When I thought I saw all the great people appear again to surprise me. I have never seen this movie before. It is a way out of the beaten path ... not only the route to the swamp ferry as well This is a horror movie created in 1940 that dares to try something very different. A cute girl (Gulp) is afraid of change and rescues men, including those she loves from monsters! Is a twist This woman is completely contrary to most women in the movie. At that time, there was no screaming in her own shadow, not fainting from the fear of stumbling upon her when she ran. Far from other villagers, not only that But the place in the swamp forest is rumored to be haunted. Heck, she still snaps on the grass, outdoor swamps ... like the 1940s Ripley model. There are no gator snakes or scary Corner. Brave this girl Books about women movies should first be sure to include the work that is overlooked. <br /> <br /> See this thing if you are a fan like me of the classic B / W horror film in the atmosphere. In the 30s and 40s, be sure to wear your cast iron turtleneck for protection.
