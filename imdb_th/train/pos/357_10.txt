This film has a lot of fun with great actors and great direction by James Eves. This movie provides entertainment with a highly charismatic performance from Stephanie Beecham and everyone. Was selected completely James Ives has a good eye on casting and guiding like a conductor who knows when to cast an action scene and then to the top. He did this with elements of humor, twists, excitement and blood. This is the return of an old vampire movie with a lot of blood, blood and screams. This film works with great speed and the characters lead you to a great adventure. But what makes the work better is that this film is not serious about making too many cheeks.
