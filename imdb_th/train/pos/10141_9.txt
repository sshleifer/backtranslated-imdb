I'm ready to sweep now when I see that 'Master' doesn't have any horror movies under his belt .. But this is the best episode of the season. <br /> <br /> The performance is easy. good!! I do not know how he debated. But we have real talent right now! And while you can see things from one mile away, at least enjoy and manage to get me involved for 56 minutes. The lack of things in this series <br /> <br /> In particular, I like the bit at the end, not the twist towards speaking. But just a little funny that he became as always. Hubby Chicken Peck <br /> <br /> Really great effort. Just as I said in other reviews - this is not a true expert who has done a lot of things. But now they may become experts in the future
