I just saw this movie and enjoyed it a lot. It provides insights about creating indie movies and many related jobs when you have a low budget. But wanted the actor / actor name to be able to get other people to come and watch it Greatly in the search for Michel Bates, the actor "NAME", played by Alan Bates, is the perfect casting decision for the movie. My favorite actor is Sandy Ryan, played by Debra Cara Unger, a beautiful and underrated character with her own special performance again in the film inside the movie. If you enjoy thinking when watching a comedy, this story will suit you. Low budget meets the budget that is reduced with high laughing content.
