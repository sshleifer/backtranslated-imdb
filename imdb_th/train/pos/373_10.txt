This movie is a remarkable work. I saw it at the theater when it came out. But I was only 13 years old and didn't "get" ... I saw it again when I was 20 (in the video of the course & now I own it) & blown away. Steven Spielberg created a great movie that helped. You wrap it from beginning to end. I also read books. But there is something about movies that make life lively, casting, acting, music, dressing, scenery, everything is great. You laugh. You cry. You are a cheerful person ... It presents all the emotions that are possible. It is one of his best works and should not be missed!
