I started riding horses fairly recently, and as everyone who used to ride a horse should know, I fell in love with horses and their world. I rented the spirit with the intention of just trying to wrap my life to the full extent of the horse-related material I could and I was amazed at the results. Giving good feeling With animals talking and patterns every five minutes. <br /> <br /> What I get is an amazing movie, full of beautiful scenery and animations and incredible stories that have great potential for warmth. <br /> <br /> The spirit is a wild mustang in the Old West, where the whole world is falling around him when he discovers a human being that is slow to occupy his homeland. The story unfolds with a variety of characters. Some humans, some animals, all are well written and most are happy to watch on the screen. <br /> <br /> I want to recommend this movie to all. Happy people And those who appreciate history and animals <br /> <br /> One thing I forgot to mention But that I feel is important that the animals in this movie do not talk about This is a really good holiday from the movie Lady And The Tramp animation that everyone today is familiar with.
