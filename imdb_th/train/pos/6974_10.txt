I just watched Caprica again and thought I might write a review! I saw this for the first time after I saw the ending of the series of Battlestar Galactica (a big fan of the show made me stick to everything I could do in the show universe) so I didn't know what to expect. What ... but I came out with a smile, even though I had to admit that ... <br /> <br /> The story began quickly on the world of Capri and we were introduced to the characters. Interesting Come on ... I will not give too much. But I suggest that you look at this story. <br /> <br /> I must say ... Esai Morales is one of the actors that he pulled out of the boy Joseph Adama .. (Admiral's father in Battlestar Galactica) I found his point and I believe he is the father of William Adama from BSG ... <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz fits his role precisely ..! Special Note It is good to see Polly Walker outside Rome! Don't sit down and watch Caprica with the expectation that it will be a Battlestar Galactica because the story is quite straight forward and everyone can watch ... without seeing BSG! <br /> <br /> This performance is A well-written drama for those who love drama with a sci-fi kick!
