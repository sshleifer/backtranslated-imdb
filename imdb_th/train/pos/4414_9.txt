Cuban Blood is one of the sleepiest movies that has many stories about life in a traditional way. In fact, I watched it while cruising around Cuba with a cruise on the western Caribbean Details about the life of an 11-year-old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. There was not much time in the revolution until the end when the socialist regime came and took possession of the boy's father's property. Most movies are about the age of children and the relationships that occur in small towns that everyone knows. There are some powerful scenes that everyone can relate to. Class A movies with good acting and directing This is a movie that tells a story that doesn't have special effects or great outlines or real twists. It is a movie about people and their lives, mistakes and triumphs. Good movies that look worthwhile several times a year.
