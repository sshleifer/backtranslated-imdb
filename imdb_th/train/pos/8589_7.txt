I will be honest. In the end, I checked this movie, not because of celebrities - even if they look reasonably and interesting, especially the three leaders - or even interesting stories of violations in the Presidential Secret Service (some Like me) was notified via a special DVD of this program that had never happened before. Suppose that is true. That's amazing!) I got it because it was directed and Color options pendant none other than Detective Meldrick Lewis !! Ok, Clark Johnson, one of my favorites from "Murder: Road Life" and an experienced TV director I can say that he can do as well as he can with projects that can be viewed. But it is quite good even though there is a possibility One Air Force helicopter and shot for Prez (David Rasche, all remember "Sledgehammer"?) His relationship with the First Lady (Kim Basinger, apparently one of the hottest women we have ever imagined) is not helping him to stand for sure. He had to get rid of the real mole in service and avoid the hounds, such as the hunting of his best friend's past and fellow agents and chiefs (Kiefer Sutherland is almost complete in "24" mode). Other important services (Martin Donovan and the fox are quite difficult to buy as gigs, Eva Longorria) and shady foreign characters and you have a political thriller that is worth buying. Standard side If the results are not good, <br /> <br /> The line summarizes the best way to explain how this performance is played without having to make spoilers. Special DVDs for me seem more profound and interesting than movies. But the movie itself is entertaining enough to give the most attention
