"Silverlake Life" is a documentary and it is simple and straightforward. In fact, it is like a movie in the house, and if you want a lot of brightness, look at something else. And it was not torn But I mean that in a positive light It shows two men who love each other and the suffering of AIDS affects their quality of life every day. It's almost difficult for me to say that this movie is a quality movie, because it doesn't dress until I have to find other ways to respond. And the most sincere I have ever seen These two men are incredibly honest because their lives are reduced to the most basic parts. It makes the production of hollow wood and AIDS look modern and without heart. These men create this movie for themselves, which is one of the best reasons to create something. The scene in which Tom sings "You are My Sunshine" to mark and say goodbye to him is true.
