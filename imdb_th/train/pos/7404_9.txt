Just saw the Australian premiere of [Xizhao] at the Sydney Film Festival. The notes of the program say that it is - perfect happiness - often done, impressive, amazing, dramatic and meaningful. I do not agree more I just hope that the rest of the festival film will be based on this entertainment standard and I hope to see many Chinese movies that are planned to be released in Sydney in the coming months
