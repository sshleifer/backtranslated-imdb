I'm a big fan of this movie. But not for normal reasons, I think Travolta and Winger show at a higher rate than the average. I think those scenes represent places and times. I like the soundtrack and Charlie Daniels. Amazing! Because the interior scenes were filmed in real clubs and Gilley's had low ceilings - probably 10-12 feet tall and the smoke should be simulated. "Smoke-filled bar" hanging under the ceiling 2-4 feet. The camera can shoot through the smoke and focus on the actors, cows, bars, women, dancing, low light. ! It's great! Sure that there is extra light But in order to maintain the atmosphere of the bar, it must be a low-light image. Ray Villalobos (camera controller) stands out! He got some pictures that he didn't hope for success and their effects brought to reality in the movie. Thank you Ray - great!
