I'm going to go out on the limbs and protect "Shades of Gray" as a great clip scene that shows the life and death of the commander William Thomas Riker, who fought the final deadly disease.> <br /> The scenes from the previous sequence were used quite well with Riker's emotions, such as when he recalled his romantic episodes, such as "11001001," "Angel One" and "Up the Long Ladder". Sadness is highlighted, such as the death of Tasha in "Skin of Evil" As well as the dangerous elements that dance with the pulse in the "Heart of Glory" "Conspiracy" and "Skin of Evil" mentioned above. Riker also shows courage under fire by telling funny stories such as "My ancestors were bitten by a snake one time ... After 3 days of painful pain, the snake died." Now focuses on Will Riker's psychological test under severe intimidation. And yes, I am biased in my opinion in the announcement "Shades of Gray" is a stable episode, because at the time of the original broadcast, my face was covered with sweat, wondering if Riker would pull out of life and live If you want to see the amazing adventure of the outerspace galaxy beyond the final ... <br /> <br /> Of course, in the following years, I seem to have a strange opinion now ... but if If the prize should be "The best episode in the history of television." Then I believed that it should now be highly regarded in that respect.
