I am looking for the name of this movie for many years. I am 14 years old when I believe that there was a television broadcast in 1983. What I remember was that it was the only teenage girl who survived a plane crash. And surviving Amazon women I remember people looking for her (family) and she knew how to take care of herself --- she told the story and I clearly remembered about her knowing that there were insects under her skin. I can't remember anything else about this movie and want to watch it again - if this is the same thing - and if any one of you has a copy, you can email me at I'm curious to get a copy to see if it's actually the same movie that I remember or not. It aired on Thanksgiving (US) in 1983 and I'm experiencing my own problems and this film has a huge impact on me. thank you!
