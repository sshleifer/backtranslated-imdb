I saw this movie once or close to the year that it was released 36 years ago (1969), although now I can only remember a bit. But I want to see again The parts that I remember, whether right or wrong, including mustard gas in the trenches, and Suzie Kendall, a German spy who gave shameful sexual help at the back of the truck to receive military information The music score is particularly memorable and the excitement in the league of Gone With The Wind and I want to hear again. There must be some commercial or copyright reasons that make this film unusable. Who knows why I wonder if it involves a lack of quality or interest.
