From beginning to end I laughed hard throughout the story. It's amazing that "The Groove Tube" may be a grandfather. But the most formidable of the comedy, the panic story is the way I enjoy watching TV without being bored with turning the channel only to sleep for 73 minutes. Strange, strange, uninterrupted humor! Just thinking that ridiculous laughing will all help you enjoy life more easily! It's a better way than Comedy Central, or performing at an important time! Make yourself a favorite and leave these soft romantic comedy movies in the waste basket! Tell your box office manager that you want "The Groove Tube" on the big screen!
