I like to give Kolchak a higher level. But the show quickly changed from horror / suspicion to ABC's stupidity. They moved the show on Friday night at 8:00 am then known as "Family hours" should not be on Fridays first. I am a second year student in high school and like the first episode! It was the first time that against the police, women in NBC ABC had a big problem on Friday night. Bad seasons for them, including Barney Miller, Baretta and SWAT debuting in January '75. Kolchak should be popular. Darren McGavin begged to leave the contract to end the show. Unfortunately, the writing does not depend on Richard Matheson in the original TV movie. McGavin also made Kolchak his own as an actor. Jackie Gleason plays Ralph Kramden and Caroll O'Connor when Archie Bunker arrives at INS Placed with a hand-held typewriter and sending calls, clacking, seemingly strange and ancient today. They were very lucky with Simon Oakland copying "Vincenzo" from the TV movie.
