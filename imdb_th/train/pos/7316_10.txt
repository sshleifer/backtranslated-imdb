This film is one of the best movies of all time in horror movies. The awkward atmosphere is outstanding. The music is as good as the movie and the killer is creepy! Excellent actor RIP Donald Pleasance. You are great like Dr Loomis. He makes this movie even better. Without him, the movie lacks important components. Jamie Lee Curtis is also great as our beloved scream queen! Her innocence made her unaware of the true evil that followed until she found that her friend had been killed without a reduction in the house, which is certainly one of the best movies. She gave a great performance. I love this movie because it scared me like hell when I saw it in the early 80s and I still watch it until today because it's a great movie that just brought you into this world every time! The fact that it is a simple form of a madman in a mask that has escaped from a mental hospital and is ready to kill everyone in the eye without them having no idea what he is there is just. Shocking The movie is an event, even if the novel is really easy. We all know that there is evil in this world and the madman with a knife is definitely not uncommon. Death at any time Of course, Halloween shows that it is the most scary way. A horrible horror movie and that's what makes the movie fun. It's just a simple story created in a wonderful and scary atmosphere. In addition to the wonderful story of Psycho, both of which I like, I believe there are the most terrifying themes available for me. Halloween and Psycho are the best movies I've ever seen and I will watch them forever My life and not bored with them Halloween is one of the best movies of all time.
