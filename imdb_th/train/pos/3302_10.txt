Perhaps all the Indian films that have been refined and most successful - Pakeezah are not in the general trap associated with Bollywood movies. (Such as tastes, jokes, imitations, wholesale and imitation of western movie themes) Pakeezah is a native of the subcontinent and is almost genuine like a butterfly. The character develops in a good direction, although sometimes it is not refined from the current standards. The understanding and confidence of the milieux who speaks Urdu during Pakeezah's time is the master of speaking and how to talk. That convey the subtlety of the era! The show (especially 'Luke' and the livelyness between the characters) is a pleasure to see, although the differences may disappear with contemporary audiences or those who are not familiar with the traditions and customs of Indian Muslims. /> <br /> Combined with a captivating screenplay, it is a beautiful musical score that has been improved by supporters who show outstanding classical Indian dance. In the case of the most romantic tragedy, the heroine must die. But she does not take her away from the audience, where the audience does not feel that he / she is a truly memorable movie experience. Pakeezah is the pinnacle of Indian movies produced and should not be paralleled.
