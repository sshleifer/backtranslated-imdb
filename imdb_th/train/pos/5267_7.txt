Obviously, Ruggero Deodato first knew that his story would not work if he approached him seriously, so he decided to camp. The result is a movie that can watch both epic swords and ridiculous magic, or a fun comedy! And I think I will go the second way, a short time that is cold-blooded, well done. (They bark together in one scene!) And there is a charming, lively and hospitable performance from Eva LaRauru. Who tagged with "boys"? There are also other places where you can see the internal organs of the dragon that are light like disco? (***)
