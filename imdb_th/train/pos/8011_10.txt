This is the best Muppet movie I've ever seen! I know the imagination of the Miss Piggy meeting as a baby is the cause of the Muppet Babies. The song will stay in my head forever, just say that because the stupid jukebox shows the song Hey Dude is still in my head Sorry, closing the topic a little However, what I like is that animals after the credit say "Goodbye, bye, bye! bye! bye! That makes me laugh hard. My favorite thing is to play the ending. I was surprised that the character Sesame Street appeared in the wedding. I'm just glad that this movie is very fun. I borrowed it from the library and now I bought it because I can't keep a copy of the library forever. In conclusion, I announced that this is the best movie I've ever seen! In my case it's better than Austin Powers in Goldmember, which is my favorite movie!
