This is one of the best music concerts that everyone will see and hear. I grew up when All My Lovin 'was a brand new and will be heard again today by the original artist today. It is Sir P Mc's power meter that will spell all groups of this age. Let us see life on the road, not just for the band, but everyone down the road. I saw this guy living in Aussie 1975 and can guarantee that his performance on this DVD is no less than 30 years ago. I have a large 5.1 surround sound system that can do this well and recommend it. Everyone, especially the Beatles fans. This is the closest thing you can get from the Beatles concert today. Singer, songwriter, lead singer / rhythm / guitar, bass, piano, ukulele, genius. pure There are only a few entertainers who can stand alone with one tool and hold the crowd in his hand. If you need a perfect music note, buy a recording studio from a CD. If you want to listen to raw music based on the intent and nature of the crowd with the excitement and emotions of the crowd - this DVD is for you.
