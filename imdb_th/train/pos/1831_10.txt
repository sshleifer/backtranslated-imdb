This movie is quite bad. Vipul Shah's latest movie is very good. This story is terrible, even though it's a good story and is handled in a great way. Aatish Kapadia, who adapted this movie from Gujarat "Avjo Wahala Fari Malishu" 2 and a half hours of viewing has many flaws in this film. But it is still a song that is quite entertaining and doesn't work well But they are still good overall, not the movie you want to watch. It's still a story. That will apply to the account and it is good if you are a type of movie relationship that is quite good with shortcomings and unnecessary humor
