Lupine travels to Morocco to find legendary treasures. His only clue is an interesting gem that the old man gave him. It is a great place for Lupine with the desert and interesting new feelings. <br /> <br /> One interesting thing about this movie is that Jigen has a smaller role than usual. One of their classic dynamic miss each other. But it is a change of pace In addition, this method Lupine can focus on women ... <br /> <br /> Fujiko's rule in this matter. Throughout the feature, she is attracted to Lupine and our audience. Then there was a young lady Lara of this particular tale and she was quite satisfactory. This one has more nudity than other Lupine anime, which is a fun difference that <br /> <br /> There are many fun guys who are the most evil ninjas in this story. Including the fun scene with Fujiko. Of course, the Zenigata Inspector is in the form of a battle as well. <br /> <br /> Quite good. The story is normal and has some weaknesses. But all in this movie is really delightful. Enjoy.
