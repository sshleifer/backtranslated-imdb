This is indeed a movie. "Warm heart" received the George Peobody Award, which is the winner of "Roots", so may tell something that is the essence of this film. I am looking for a way to order this movie on the internet. Since my former father, Eugene Logan, the co-author of this movie died many years ago, so I have no chance to get information from him. I like to have His only daughter, my daughter, watched this movie and told this wonderful story to his great grandson. My eldest daughter is seven years old at the time of broadcast on television and I look forward to seeing it again. One of my friends said it was her favorite movie. I won't 'destroy' this movie for you.
