Hey, what happened? I am a man and Mike alone. "Sunny Sakura Killers" Kelly, you know ...... You can't write a review of Sakura's role because we don't have As far as I know, stories are created as we go. I have the best time in my life to create this movie and get so stinky that I am all out. I did not fight that I imagined Every time I set up a movement, the battle director continues to change them. But even then I had a blast and met a really wonderful person. Especially the purple female ninja that seems to fall from the movie creation scene
