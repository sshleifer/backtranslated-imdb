I saw that this movie was Jane Austen's movie that was stuck and always wondered about the rendering of the film of the complexity of her novel: Uh, this move has precision, cleverness, prudence. Discreet, cunning, serious respect! br /> <br /> "Emma" is one of Austen's most amusing and funny novels, with situations and characters that pervade overall. This film honors this delicate sarcasm, regardless of the comic elements (Miss Bates, among other things). What makes me participate in fiction and movies makes it clear that it is an in-depth knowledge of human life as shown by The English novelist and the modern appearance that women, men and their relationship has been handled and it is surprising if think The 18th century female novelist who has a quiet life can understand the depth and truth about life like her: most and still make me fascinated. We can feel this modernity throughout the movie: just change the costume and use more current language. But the situation, feelings, thoughts are very modern I think of the interest in other people's lives or jealousy, which has now ruled the relationship of women and still has difficulty in revealing and expressing feelings of people, especially love: every The situation is universal. <br /> <br /> The performers are talented and have excellent performances and great performances: Gwyneth Paltrow is perfect for this role. (Today she may be too old) Toni Colette is great. And I will envy them for the wonderful outfit that they can wear! And then the English countryside is amazing, in which every situation receives a miracle and a dream dimension ... a fun and deserving movie
