This deserves 12 out of 10 live performances filled with characters and real stories. This show must come back to see me every time, and this is true quality. <br /> <br /> The New York Performing Arts Center plays around with the concept of splitting six degrees and being intelligent. Bridget Moynahan and Jay Hernandez are amazing and cute Caseman. The scenery is amazing and has a beautiful wardrobe. <br /> <br /> We need more performances that make the audience feel like they He is a wise person who is not a senseless drone. <br /> <br /> If it doesn't come back Six degrees will miss a lot.
