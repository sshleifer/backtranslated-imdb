This is Joe McDoakes, my fourth person that I have seen and far as the most fun. In this chapter, Joe uses a voice lesson from impersonating Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman when he goes to Warner Brothers' studio (the company behind this series accidentally). He asks Jack Carr. Ridge for advice that makes the couple confused He then met the actor George O'Hannon (who was McDoakes) who spoke in his usual voice, not far from Geroge Jetson, his next person, and went to the set. I will stop there and say funny. I found all things and was amazed with the nearest movie star hijack. The last scene honors the horn, especially in that note. Go to YouTube if you want to watch, so you want to be in Picutres!
