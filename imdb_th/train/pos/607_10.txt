Maybe I like this movie a lot because I feel depressed and it's a cute little fairy tale for whatever reason. I think it's perfect. Wonderful story, clever, beautiful effects, great performances (especially De Niro, excellent). This movie makes me more happy than I have been for a while. <br /> <br /> It's a funny and clever movie. A joke about the history of the kingdom of cruelty, the prince and the consequences. How to immerse yourself in magic has a witch effect and a smart little touch all makes me indulge That's what makes it so good. It is a movie with special effects that have more complex stories than most fairy tale movies. But there is a lot of interest with the little things. <br /> <br /> I feel like I'm moving forward and watching it again.
