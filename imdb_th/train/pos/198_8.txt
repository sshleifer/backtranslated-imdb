Oh, it's great to watch Silent Classic once in a while! Director Vidor is a delightful person and creates a length (at least 1928) that is himself. A story about success in life and how to change. Marion Davies plays a girl who leaves friends in a small comedy studio to be part of a larger "drama" studio. She became a big star and as a result she was alienated from the real world. For a moment she rejected the past. (Poor) of you! The pendant is definitely hilarious, the main character scene. (Marion Davies) sees ... Marion Davies in the studio and concludes that she doesn't look special ... It must be one of the first films - the movies of here and for true mania It's great to see cameras and materials since then. Must see if you ask me !!
