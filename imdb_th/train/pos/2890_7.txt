Disney Classic Animation 12 is a sensible movie that is told through a simple story. Even if it's a little day But deserves a place in the classic Disney program. <br /> <br /> It's not in Disney's top work. But is satisfactory One of Disney's "simple" works, but still has some magic and charm. (Which is well known as old Disney) This is an important movie because it helps Disney to escape from the delicate situation. If this is a failure, there is no way to have Disney's classic animation anymore. <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" is like going back to class. Disney's first animation Bring the fairy tale music back It's not clear what will happen. But I think it is somewhere in France because this is the story of Charles Perrault. <br /> <br /> There are many favorite characters like Cinderella, Prince Bruno (dog). , Jaques and Gus (two main mice), Fairy Godmother (for a fairy that you are sure to joke), birds, kings and grand Duke <br /> <br /> Jaques are very intelligent and amusing. I love his voice. The quality is really like a mouse. Gus may not be wise. But he is a funny person. <br /> <br /> The king is hilarious, but I think what makes him so funny is his short temper. Grand Duke is a very cool and funny person. They are two of my favorite characters in this movie and responsible for the most fun moments. <br /> <br /> The Prince is one of the most charming in Disney. No doubt that Prince Philip from "Sleeping Beauty" was inspired by this prince because they look very similar. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Lady Tremaine (stepmother) should not be satisfactory. Because she is cold, jealous, bitter and cruel, her daughter (Anastacia and Drizella) is not much better than her. However, the stepmother is not annoying, like an ugly and selfish daughter. The main character Cinderella has no connection with them. Cinderella is gentle, gentle and cute. However, I think her beautiful pink dress is much better than a fairy dress. <br /> <br /> Lucifer (cat) is very dangerous. The way he walked his nose in the air and the arrogant and insulting facial expression made him funny. Ironically, he is very much like a stepmother when it comes to personality. He always agreed with the stepmother's attitude towards Cinderella. Lucifer has the right name for him because he is an evil and meaningful cat. However, there is nothing annoying for him. <br /> <br /> A simple soundtrack. But pleasant, even if not in the best of Disney The best song in this movie is "Bibiddi Bobiddi Boo". <br /> <br /> There are many talented actors such as James MacDonald, Marion Darlington, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton and Luis Van Rooten. <Br /> <br /> Despite being simple But the movie has good art, including good details, even though it doesn't have anything "outside of the world". However, the king's palace is a truly magnificent and magnificent masterpiece.
