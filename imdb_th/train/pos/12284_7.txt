Could not understand why Jeremy Irons needed to show the most hustling accent, speaking through his tightly clenched teeth and from behind his neck In fact, it is quite frustrating for me, and distracting from what he might have good performance (very annoying). No other actor or actor who seems to have a clear accent and while I get Ranking Jeremy Irons is a good actor. I will not study this movie as one of the best. However, this movie made me feel thirsty while there were other comments that made this film, which I found very interesting and intended to read now.
