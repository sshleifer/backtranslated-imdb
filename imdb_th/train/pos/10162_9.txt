Ah, I love this movie. I think it has everything. It made me laugh out loud dozens of times. Yes, I am a woman. So I wrote this from the perspective of the girl. I think it's a shame, just score 5.2 in the ranking. People vote too much? It's above other romantic comedies, just because I'm a girl. I don't enjoy the chic flicks. On the other hand, I like other genres. Romantic comedies are usually shallow and not as funny as they should be. But as I said, this movie has everything in my mind. One great script, good liners, good performances Although Eva Longoria Parker's character reminds Gabrielle from a very hopeless housewife It's great I will keep this movie on a rainy day, the day I feel low and want to laugh a couple of times.
