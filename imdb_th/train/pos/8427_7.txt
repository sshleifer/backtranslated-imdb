This is one of the most bizarre movies of the Zat么ichi series due to the extremely unusual pacing and the role that Ichi played in this film. Interestingly enough, this is Zat么ichi's first film produced by the new production company Shintaro Katsu. Now instead of just a blind swordsman, Katsu is responsible for making movies. This can easily explain why this movie looks different from the previous 15 movies. As far as Ichi's role, this movie is very different because he is not in this movie as usual. He is a simple fool, and in fact, for a while, hurting others instead of helping! <br /> <br /> "Zat么ichiR么yaburi" begins with Ichi talking to an old woman trying to take advantage of the invisible in this scene. Ichi says that he was blind since childhood. But in the previous movie, he said that he was blind when he was 8 years old. This is a slight mistake and has a fanatic like me only to notice. <Br /> <br /> This movie happened. In a period of at least six months and tends to take a year or more, so you can see what I say about the strange rhythm. Most movies in this series take a few minutes. Ichi day or several weeks, the city has a boss (Asagoro) trying hard to be good because he knows the reputation of Ichi the blind. The boss is quite charming and surprising that Ichi was captured by the wicked. At the same time, he met another boss (Chu Chu) who was a poor guru. Raise ush to warn people to abandon violence and even Eiji is under his teachings - stop the sword for months. Chusu's teachings are similar to the teachings of Taoism from China - not using violence and accepting life as is. (Good or bad) <br /> <br /> After a month out of this city and thinks everything is going well, Ishi knows that as soon as he leaves, Asakoro shows the true colors of He - a woman who is a slave, oppresses the poor and is around him. Eiji is responsible for this while he helps Asago and counts him as a friend. Asagoro now captures Shushui and many innocent people because of the evil boss's actions. <br /> <br /> When Ichi came back, he didn't automatically accept Asagoro, good or bad, but tested him wisely. The bit that this scarecrow was inspired and led to the final scene of the story that Eiji killed the bad guys and freed Chusu. This ending is very good and happens in the rain. The final scene with Asagoro and the rock is excellent, even though the head-cutting is common in today's special effects standards. <br /> <br /> The advantage for this film is that even though there is a bad rhythm. But it is different and not wrong for the previous 15 (which often seems very similar). In addition, it will end very well. Minuses (in addition to pacing) is that some people may not like to see the wrong Ichi. And the scene with Ichi and the other blind men included in the relief cartoon falls flat ... very, very flat. They have no good tastes and are not ridiculous ... that is the flatness of it
