If you have a heart and compassion for people, this movie is difficult to watch, at least in the second half of it. <br /> <br /> It's in that part that we see cute little children being hurt. And then those who are mentally retarded (Challenging the mind) went out to the end after he saw the cruel actions of this child. It's not a satisfying content. <br /> <br /> However, it's a good movie and the performance is also good. The story will be with you for a while. <br /> <br /> "Dominic" is a mentally disabled person and played by Tom Halsey. I think this may be the best chapter of Halsey. He was taken care of by a medical student, "Eugene", played by Ray Lee Atta, who became a star in the following year with Kevin Costner's "Field Of Dreams". <br /> <br /> Dominic appears "comic books and love fighting He is a "slow" type that you can't help but love and take root to live a happy life. When he freaks out, there are many good reasons and ... watch this movie well. It's worth your time But be prepared to go into a real emotional roller coaster and may cause you to be upset in something you see
