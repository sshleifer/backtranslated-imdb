I think this movie is a good reason. It is strange that Olsen's twins are now 13 years old and have fans and all. I enjoy them a lot when they are small children at Full House. However, the casting is good and the movie is quite funny. I feel confused between places changing with their names. It is an old version of It Takes Two.
