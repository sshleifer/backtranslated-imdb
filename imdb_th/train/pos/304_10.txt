I watched it many years ago. I remember that it was a very mysterious situation and a mix of depressing things like Dorothy's fate and the personal future of Bogdanovich. <br /> <br /> I turned to see the VHS copy of I and then I checked more and more. Today I am waiting for the DVD version, regardless of the price. <br /> <br /> The country and the music are easy to listen, being chosen well from the first moment. Come rather blue <br /> <br /> Every character is great for me with funny situations, great performances and many conversations that make this a cult movie for me and the many people I meet on. Internet or movie club This may not be a disaster. <br /> <br /> I think the name is hope for life! You have to be happy and laugh as much as possible. <br /> <br /> I know this is probably the only comment for the movie. But the truth is that I like it very much. I think this movie is me and I won't forget it.
