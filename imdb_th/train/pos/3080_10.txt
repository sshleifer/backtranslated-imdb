I have complained to ABC about canceling six degrees. If someone did the same thing, it would be enough to make a great performance come alive! Just log in to the official website and the rest is easy enough. I do not understand why this show was canceled. It's a great actor and actor. All concepts are watching! I am amazed that my favorite program ends only after one set. Why is this six degrees more phenomenal than many other TV programs! Until I heard that they were stopping it from a friend, it didn't happen to me that this might happen.
