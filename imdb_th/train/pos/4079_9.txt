I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 8 years old on TV in the UK (called "Laupta: The Flying Island"). I liked it a lot and was heartbroken when it was repeated again later and I missed it I am fascinated by stories and characters. But the most important is the song that is haunted and beautiful It will be the original English version that I saw - sometimes called the "Streamline Dub" error (actually dubbed by Ghibli itself and published by Streamline only) which is not sad to use. Box <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I feel that Disney's distribution has been partially damaged. The voice acting is ok. But the conversation doesn't have the same raw energy that is dubbed "slender" or traditional Japanese, and I think James Van Der Beek sounds too old to be a leader. They made pointless changes, such as changing the main character's name from "Pazu" to "Patzu" and adding some dialogue. But the worst of all, I felt that they had destroyed a lot of scenes with intrusive music - the opening scenes of the original airships were quiet. But is spoiled due to the moral needs of Disney who play music when no one speaks The nuisance of many Disney movies <br /> <br /> The film still delivers the latest animated movies and I can't recommend enough. The plot is simple. But charming and the film shows the witty, sadly missing from the most modern mass market
