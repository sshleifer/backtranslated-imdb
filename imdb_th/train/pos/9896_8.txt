I meant to see this flick in the past few months. I'm really surprised how good it is. <br /> <br /> The story surrounding the high school teenager who threatened a boy named Marty. They continued to persecute him until one of them made a terrible mistake that caused Marty to be horribly burned. <br /> <br /> A few years later, a reckless teenager was invited back. Going to their own high school, the party, although not a careless teenager, held this party. <br /> <br /> Later in the movie, the teenager began to die in the most horrible way. I can tell you that they are scary as well. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, you find that it's a dream and nothing happens. But Marty is in a hospital with severe burns. Although the murder will not occur But the fire and the joke happened. <br /> <br /> The performance was terrible. But that's ok. <br /> <br /> I love the story. I really sympathize with Marty. It's like Tamara (2005). The gangsters get the things that come to them in the end and you feel satisfied with the victims who get a sweet revenge. I encourage everyone to pick it up if you are looking for 80s slashers. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie with 8 stars out of 10 great songs!
