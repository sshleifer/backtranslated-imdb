The question of who likes the version of "The Ghost Train" depends on one thing and one thing: your reaction to the performance of Arthur Askey. <br /> <br /> He always steals almost everything. The scene he entered and not always in a good way Sometimes you want him to settle down or retreat a little, so many characters of the plot are qualified and developed. (Which they can do to a certain extent) but everything still points to the character of Askey's Tommy Gander. <br /> <br /> Personally, I like this movie. I tend to babble it into the vcr during the strange moments of the early morning when I can't sleep and can't find the energy to watch anything else. There is something about watching old b / w movies in a quiet dark place before dawn that I find interesting ....
