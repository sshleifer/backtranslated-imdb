I felt the duty to watch the adaptation of Timothy Dalton / Zelah Clarke in 1983 of "Jane Eyre" because I just wrote an article about the BBC "Jane Eyre" in 2006 for TheScreamOnline. <br /> <br /> So I approached this way as I would do homework. <br /> <br /> At first I was frustrated. The light in this model is not good. Everyone / Everything is washed out with bright white light, which in some scenes will shine the shadow on the back wall. Characters <br /> <br /> And the sound is not well recorded. I feel like I'm listening to a high school drama. <br /> <br /> And the makeup of the pancakes is too heavy. <br /> <br /> And the scene doesn't convey the full gothic mood of the novel. They are nagging. Too fussy, Martha Stewart too I just don't see Bronte's Rochester performing in country agreements, such as Martha Stewart Orchester Welles. 'Rochester lives in a cavernous cavern that is suitable for fictional Gothic emotions. <br /> <br /> And ... with all objections. ... Not only is "Jane Eyre" the best, it is probably the best adaptation of any novel I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> "Jane Eyre" despite the technical flaws. Feeling back to me, read "Jane Air" for the first time. <br /> <br /> Actor The forecast for production, said it is close to the book, too. For me, people who see the value of this book and do not want it to be less or less "words" or "Christian". The honest sex of this novel that Bronte wrote is the best asset. > <br /> Bronte wrote a good book. It has a reason to spend 150 years plus while others who look sluggish, have sex and are simply gone. <br /> <br /> For a long time, my girlfriend "Jane Eyre" I was biased towards Timothy Dalton as Rochester Rochester is famous for not casting; Jane and Rochester are famous ugly lovers in literature. And Timothy Dalton is nothing if not handsome. <br /> <br /> But Dalton gives a fascinating performance like Rochester. He just blew me away. I have never seen anything like the full dedication to the text, dialogue and love of Rochester. Dalton brought the face of Rochester's face to shake life on the screen. <br /> <br /> Rochester is a little scary. Dalton is awesome For example, Wales was also scary when he shouted "Enough!" After Fontaine played a short piano, but Dalton was horrified more than once here. You can't tell if he will hurt Jane or himself in despair. <br /> <br /> Rochester's dishonesty, his humor, his anger: Dalton's vulnerability indicates <br /> <br /> This is important - the actors at Rochester must show that he spent more than a decade in his life with the utmost despair and loneliness. The ugly secret destroys life. <br /> <br /> There are no other actors that I have tried in this section, indicating the black hole of despair, just as Timothy Dalton did. Toby Stephens, current girlfriend's favorite, doesn't even try Dalton hits it from the park. If I saw Timothy Dalton performing Rochester in a single bar, I would say "That person has a problem. Don't even look at him." He is a radioactive person with pain. <br /> <br /> Selah Clarke, not only But overall, the best Jane I have ever seen, she is one of the few people that the manufacturer is willing to show in the book. Not only people who know "Jane Eyre" from the 2006 model year, Bronte can * not * describe Jane. Elegant and strong with curved and exquisite eyebrows Rather, Jane Charlotte Bronte is a poor, ordinary, unclear and slightly unattractive person. <br /> <br /> Selah has a small mouth, set eyes and a little nose. She is "a little. "Truly, she is not a fashion model. And she is the best Jane. This book <br /> <br /> Some people explain that she is cold or boring. No, she is faithful to this book. Bronte's Jane is not a red hot mom. She is a deprived and excluded teenager whose inner interest comes out in the same time as Zelah did. Here, Jane's book is the person you need. Look slowly, carefully, patiently, carefully. If you want to deepen her, you have to watch Zelah here to know who you really are. <br /> <br /> I want to see more lights. In a key scene in Zelah a single scene. But that's one scene in five hours in <br /> <br /> In spite of being close to this version of the text, like all the other versions I've seen, everyone will openly explain the Christian theme in "Jane Air." Christianity is not a narrative in "Jane Eyre" which is important. <br /> <br /> Helen Burn instructs Jane in Christianity to make her read books that overthrow life. It is Christianity and is Christian God who The poor little mind bending unclear Jane has equal value, she must live the ideals and rejected her marriage proposal on the matter. That is not clear here. <br /> <br /> In any case, Charlotte Bronte wrote a great novel, complex and rich, and altering it from what I saw mine and honor. The best novels of any adaptations I have ever seen, and it says a lot. <br /> <br /> Other versions that do not honor this book until the end are a fascinating job in many ways. Do not care what Charlotte Bronte talks about child abuse or the hypocrisy of culture created from the look and money. Modifying most of your books will be what people are waiting for through the scene. Between Jane and Rochester. <br /> <br /> This model, like Bronte's novel, recognizes that everything Bronte wrote - about Jane's experience at Lowood and her relationship with St. John - part of What makes Jane relate to Rochester is explosive and memorable as it is.
