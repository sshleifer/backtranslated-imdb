I like it a lot because it is a fan of the original series. I always wondered what the story behind - it didn't make me dissatisfied. I like the fact that besides Eric Stoltz I don't know anyone - this is refreshing like BSG. It introduces me to all new abilities - can't wait for the series to start broadcasting. Well done with Ronald D. Moore and the team - a great job. Special techniques, conversations and performances are all happening and I feel tied to the emotions in the story. I know that there are people who are meticulous there, may not agree with my assessment. But I feel that Caprica is superior to most sci-fi produced in the last decade.
