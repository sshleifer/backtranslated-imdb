Hardly ever heard as much as I was concerned. But during the movie, she convinced you that she was a psychopath or at least something wrong with her. Her character is the meaning of "Emotional disturbance" looks like the movie ends quickly by allowing things to not be resolved. But other than that, this movie is really great.
