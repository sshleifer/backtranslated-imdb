This is the best Chinese movie I have ever seen and in my opinion is better than Hero or Chrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The movie is a unique combination of many genres: it's a beautiful love story, action movies Funny and horror at the same time And the most amazing thing is that it succeeds in all this! <br /> <br /> This movie makes me top 5 of me and should have fun with all movie lovers. The action sequence has a traditional unrealistic jump and even flying. But the method of shooting differs from the style of the hero in large numbers and the flight always looks good and always makes sense. (The ghost can fly) <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. You won't regret. 10/10
