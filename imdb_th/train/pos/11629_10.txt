Red Eye is an exciting movie by the creator Freddy Kreuger, Wes Craven Wes Craven, showing the story of Lisa, a general hotel employee. After attending the funeral of her grandmother, she decided to fly red eyes. While waiting, she found this man named Jack Rippner (that is, fffrreeaakkyy?) And they became friends. Ironically, the couple sat next to each other on this plane. Then this is when the horror begins. This movie is exciting and for those who are weak, who don't like horror / horror movies, we can tell that it's possible that they will pee on pants. This is a great example of creating a bone shake. Wes Craven did very well with this film. He chose the right actors, such as Rachel McAdams, a smart and sexy girl who knew what she was doing and was careful of everything when she starred in the horrifying Cillian Murphy movie, which can be comfortable with acting His amazing as a bad character in this film and his face can open your eyes. Wes Craven did a great job and I hope he will make a lot of movies. Maps like this
