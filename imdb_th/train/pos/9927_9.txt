Domino is a great movie. It's about a young woman named Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) who became a bounty hunter due to the boredom of her life. She joins with two hunters (Mickey Rourke & Edgar Ramirez) and the adventure begins. The script is good. Very grounded and realistic with the tone of the movie. The only problem I have with this movie is that it focuses on the things that they do instead of the characters of Domino. <br /> <br /> Even so. She expressed anger and dedication in this performance appropriately. Mickey Roque tracks Oscar's work - worthy of 'Sin City' with fierce performances. Edgar Ramirez did nothing but speak Spanish every time and stared at Keira. Delroy Lindoi gave good support. Mo'Nique was himself even though she surprised me in one scene. Excellent chemistry with Kiera Knightley in her scene. <br /> <br /> The best thing about movies is direction. Tony Scott's fast-paced style brings movies to life. The movie is the best thing I've ever seen. Must use leather regularly and add acid All black colors are darker than that of white, which is brighter and it has a glowing green color. Exhilarating action scenes <br /> Overall <br />: If you like Sin City & Man on Fire, you'll like Domino.
