It's a surprising thing to find a cable TV. If I read a short summary of the TV program before watching the movie, I will pass. Thinking about a movie about a popular hit movie that wants to let businesses fall in love ... sounds boring. But this movie works From the beginning of the movie, it was clear that the man carried weight on his shoulder before he could say a word. The look and feel of this film is completely dark, but it's not disgusting. <br /> <br /> In addition to the killer family aspect that gives a touch of true sense, Macy's character is still tangible With his marriage and the control of his father, Macy expressed the sadness of repression and talk before bedtime with his youngest son. The boy shows his acting skills well beyond his age and the interaction between father and son is very natural, personal and loving. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. And I don't want to believe that I accidentally found it on television late at night
