I have to admit this movie made me move until my tears ran out. However, I always think about two things, and instead of writing a compliment to define the movie is impeccable and flawless, I like the risk of getting closer. <br /> <br /> First, the first thing : The movie has an undeniable impact on the audience, just because it starts and continues as a slow movie that does not disappoint you with the real scene from 9/11. This intelligent because unlike a stone's WORLD TRADE CENTER film fortunate to have focused on the attack itself. But in the fallout, which is similar to the collapse of a nuclear explosion, is difficult to see The psychological impact of the massive devastation that occurred on 9/11 and the damage to the American people is almost obvious in this film. I think Binder manages the intelligent observations of the American Po society. The post on 9/11 and Sandler in my opinion jumped from the average comedian to a really talented actor in the movie BLOOD DIAMOND. The character Di Capr io said and i said: "Ah, these American people always want to use their feelings" I don't want to insult their suffering But I'm sure you want to compare Since 9/11, the whole world is facing the 9/11 memorial and memorial memorial, Hollywood industry and writers such as Safran Foer, more than the 9/11 in their work. Now, many cultural products related to 9/11 changed 3,000 people to become the biggest tragedy of this century. The number of books written about the subject and the number of films directed on this subject, and I say this with great respect, blowing the importance of this terrible crime is disproportionate. <br /> <br /> The truth is: those People die every day due to unfair actions and horrific crimes caused by bad or lost people. We have a war in Iraq in Afghanistan, in Birma and many other countries in our daily lives. We forget the poverty that African people suffer and we tend to pay attention to them at a lesser extent than the American victims. At 9/11 just because they are black and because their lives are not so much Same as our Western life Africa has no money and the potential to remember the national tragedy that America can do. So what I am saying is: the reason we feel more than 3,000 victims, 9/11 and their families because we have received warnings from 9/11 all the time. It's not a day to go through without newspaper articles, movies or books that Mention 9/11. <br /> <br /> In summary: I endorse by Charlie Fineman, but I'm not sure I have the right to Feeling better about him for the Hutu people who lost all their families in the Rwandan Civil War. <br /> <br /> You feel saving.
