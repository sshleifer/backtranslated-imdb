The first thing I think when I see this movie is: It's not really a movie. At least it's not something we naturally imagine. When we hear the word "movie", it's totally symbolic. Everything in it has meaning. Figurative So if you are not familiar with symbolic expression, you will find it strange if you are not familiar with philosophy, religion, spiritual life. You will think it's just a fairy tale ... chaotic for me "The Legend of Zu" Perfectly transparent And i like it It tells us in the picture about the struggle between light and darkness, the fight that is as old as human beings, and everyone who searches for feelings in this life must face it. This film was clearly created by Buddhists. I'm not a Buddhist My religion and the world and human vision are different. But as far as we are all human beings and have the same human nature, we need to have experience together and be able to understand each other. It's a really beautiful movie! And me, which we have more movies like this - meaning movies There are too many empty stories that are good for making time to pass faster.
