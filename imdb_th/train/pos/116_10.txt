Oh man, man ... I'm stupid without reason. (Not the correct word, there is a long list!) To watch this movie and finally have the opportunity to do that and "news" is: a magical labyrinth phenomenon <br /> <br /> for "followers" Von Trier's: Both Rigets, Element of Crime, Dogville, Dancer in The Dark, The Five Obstructions, etc. ... Europa is probably different for the greatness in terms of visuals. Everything is beautiful and gloomy! You get the feeling of being in this "fantasy" warp from a high-level movie like Bunuel, Bergman, until the 40s noir movie with Von Trier. The acidic avant-garde card brings the art movie scene as an authoritative movie maker With good intentions today His dictatorial methods of dealing with very complex problems without irrationality visit the audience's nerves with the intention of preserving some of the deepest wounds we raise in our pretend world. <br /> < br /> I believe that people like Von Trier can help society in many ways in a wide range. Films and daily filmmakers with this kind of power are no longer needed as a tool for contemplation. Perhaps it is the beginning of a new era: "The age of emotional control over our fears" This is what He offered us all the time through his work over and over again. <br /> <br /> Cheers!
