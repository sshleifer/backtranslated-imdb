"Once upon a time, in a charming land called France ... People live happily. At that time, women are simple people and they immerse themselves in their favorite pastime: war. The war in the war was a seven-year war and when it was noticed that there were more corpses of soldiers than the soldiers, the brokers were sent out to reinforce the troops. <br /> <br /> So Fanfan (Gerard Philipe) took the daughter of the farmer in the hay. Escape marriage by applying to the Department Regquit d'Aquitane ... but only believed in his future. According to Gypsies, in advance that he will receive the reputation and fortune of the King's uniform and marry the king's daughter. Alas, Adeline (Gina Lollobrigida) is not a gypsy. <br /> <br /> When Fanfan collects money from his sword in the hand to help the attacking chariot, who should be inside except Marquise du Pompadour and ... the king's daughter? He is now convinced that he will get married. Even though Adeline has the lowest cut shirt, she will eventually discover her love for Fanfan. We are in the middle of a film that does not respect the destiny. Fanfan's brutal adventures of fighting with swords and gangsters There is an escape from hanging a sword on the roof of a tile, a false fight, a romantic escape, and more fun than you can imagine. What Fanfan lacks in polish is done for respect and enthusiasm. He is a swordsman who is fast and is a swift lover. But with the naive belief in his fate and the optimistic nature, how can we not like him? <br /> <br /> Gerard Philip is a stage actor and actor. (Which Francois Truffaut insulted in the face of Cahiers du Cinema continuously) He made most of his own to stop He is handsome, strong, elegant and charming. Men admire him and women dream about him. He died of liver cancer at the time of 36, seven years after all of France's Fanfan was sad. Gina Lollobrigida while Adeline owned her. Not the low-cut shirts that act She has acumen, enthusiasm, no innocence and no one is stupid. <br /> <br /> Fanfan la Tulipe just sings along with endless innuendo, point and nature. Not talking about a ridiculous conversation after Adeline followed the steps to help Fanfan not hang. She met the king in his private room, "Give me your small hand," he said. "But my heart belongs to Fanfan, "Adeline said." Who asks your heart? "The king said. "The things I ask are a little happy." "I am the right woman," Adeline said. "Are you indebted to you? Do you love Fanfan? Then thank you. My hope helps you show the greatest evidence of your love by betraying the loyalty he has sworn to him." It's a clever and funny thing. <br /> <br /> Jean-Luc Godard, Francois Truffaut and other New Wave gangs tend to hate popular movies as entertainment. (And they adjusted their attacks) Fanfan la Tulipe and Christian-Jacques The director is in their main goal. They may miss Fanfan's point, which is a very funny word about the pointlessness of the army and war. It will be much better than this, which seems to create a movie of suffering. Thanks to some of their goodness, Truffaut and Chabrol, for example, posing as a child and being recognized as a good movie is a good movie, whether it is someone who likes or is a person who knows. Wise people who enjoy movies can appreciate any if the movie is doing well. People who agree with the popular movie, insulting themselves like those who brag, never read Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> Jean-Luc Godard eats your heart out. Viva Fanfan!
