This is the second time I received A Perfect Spy. I watched it 2 or 3 years ago and like it. I like it. It's also common to be compared to other Le Carre 'Tinker Tailor series. Soldier Spy Tinker Tailor focuses on the "game" spy player; Perfect spike gives us another axis - what kind of person are we? There are many themes that these movies share, along with others in the form. <br /> <br /> Ambiguity - morals, sex, interpersonal relationships - which create many dimensions of true and false internal and external. Love and responsibility In the way that these characters are the happiest when they are most treated by the people they love and respect - "backstabbed" in various differences. <br /> <br /> Father's style and Father numbers are also important. One of the most interesting characters in A Perfect Spy is Rick's father. The main character of Magnus is perhaps the father. Throughout the story he betrayed and betrayed The gangster who often climbed back up the stairs when he overthrew the person who seemed to not accept what others thought. He asked Magnus every time he found it. "Do you love your old man?" And never "You love me". Maybe sometimes you say somewhere else but A Perfect Spy is a love story. <br /> <br /> Other themes are terrible. The nature of the business is to make others - resist them with their government, with their friends and colleagues, causing them to resist their values ​​and beliefs. In the movie Le Carre, each story that I saw a spy from the Cold War, looking at the war glass, military spy, tinker, tailor, spider, people, smiling and perfect spy, turning and turning is the foundation of grief Dance <br /> <br /> Finally, there is not much theme in art - in each movie, there is usually only one shot, or maybe two shots that are the backup story. Violence, torture and cruelty are always under the surface. We see their results, not blood or dirty prison cells. But in the character of the object that Le Carre stuck because it was accidentally sucked into the cave. <br /> <br /> If you don't see it Top movies and you will enjoy A Perfect Spy. You will be treated. I would like to introduce The Sandbagger (Yorkshire TV) series, seasons 2 and 3, which begin to reach this level of complexity. IPCRESS files and burials in Berlin are good, even though they are lightweight. For political intrigue, try A Very British Coup, House of Cards and Yes, Minister / Yes, Prime Minister. <br /> <br /> If only Brit can make The Three Kingdoms - there are movies. Interesting and complex
