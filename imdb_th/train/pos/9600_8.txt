This film is an impressive story about the adventures of 15-year-old Darius Weems. Darius has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a disease that has not been preserved, which takes the life of his brother at the age of nine and is a top killer. One of the babies in the United States He and a few close friends travel across the country to Los Angeles with the goal of refining his cart on the Pimp My Ride, one of his favorites. The journey started in Georgia, where Darius grew up and never left. The gang headed west for travel that all participants will never forget. Darius sat on the boat for the first time, sitting in a hot air balloon, swimming in the ocean and visiting the sights he wanted to see, such as the Grand Canyon and New Orleans. The filmmakers here have a clear emotional connection with the material. They don't make money from selling $ 20 DVDs, $ 17 to disease research, and $ 3 to make additional copies. The film has won more than 25 awards at the festival and I agree with the words given to the film by Variety. "Confident to stimulate the heart"
