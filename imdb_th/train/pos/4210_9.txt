I really enjoyed this movie. Every aspect of this movie is the most important thing for me for screenplay and acting. This is one of Richard Widmark's strongest roles. He believes in all his performances. Just want to know. Imagine how Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitcham might play this role. This is the first time I have seen the work of Jean Peter I remember. She was very impressed here that I would definitely look for her other work. Telmarter in an outstanding role, deserving an Oscar nomination for her performance from the script This film is applicable to all levels. Black and white photography is perfectly suited and the story will attract audiences from the beginning. Widmark and Peters has excellent chemistry in difficult love. Highly recommended. 9/10
