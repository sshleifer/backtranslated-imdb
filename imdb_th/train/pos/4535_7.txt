The first 50 minutes of this film is quite boring. It focuses on the personal problems that Doyle has, including his sick wife, threatening to kill fans, publishers who are pushing and guilty about the mentally ill father. Although these subjects had a major impact on Doyle's life, I was still skeptical about the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes were excellent. In the end we watched Doyle's head the way he created Holmes and why he had to 'kill' Holmes. A great actor, including Selden, was interesting, played by Tim McInnerny, Arthur Conan Doyle, the role. Interestingly, played by Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as a 'model' for Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bell is well-positioned, especially for movies, television and cameras. Works well if the first 50 minutes are good. Last 40 minutes will be Is a small masterpiece
