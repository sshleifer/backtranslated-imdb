This is an acronym for Hal Roach. This is because of two main reasons: a small child who is in the short term is the most lovable person ever in this movie and the story has many funny and popular elements. br /> <br /> The Little Rascals, I can not think of a cute child than a spanky child at about four years old. Even though the child is quite fat and unattractive in the following years, but he is worth it here. And putting a little boy in caring for a small child, not only funny, but also having a lovely factor again. <br /> <br /> After the older children blackmailed Spanky into a pleasant daycare job afraid All types of funny assault makes loose. The jokes are effective and well done at that time - by accidentally calling crashes involving murder and the last scene that Spanky FINALLY gets control from the most memorable little boy. I haven't seen these shorts for decades and I'm glad I gave this opportunity.
