Great movie with great performances from Zack & Lochley. Their dissatisfaction (& my) Garibaldi arrived at the station. (Respect from Jerry Doyle But in Season 4 and 5, I lost sympathy for the characters.) It didn't take long for him to start criticizing Zack (which I loved most of the performance) and took care of me. Sure, Zak was able to handle the story of that Soulhunter Amazing, especially if you believe in heaven as Zack does. Good humor. 10/10
