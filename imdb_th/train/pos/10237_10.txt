This film is one of the best movies released from Hong Kong's "New Wave" that begins with Tsui Hark's "ZU: Warriors of Magic Mountain". The story tells of New Wave's approach to the martial arts movie. That the director of New Wave (Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Wong Jing, Ching Jing, Jing Tung, etc.) was accepted at that time That is to say, the way in which the movie is then must be more than touching. If not immediately funny, "Burning Paradise" stops everything and by revenge. <br /> <br /> It's not that there is no sense of humor But it is purely human humor, just like the first Buddhist monk who managed the fast feelings of a young woman with a husband while hiding in a straw But this is the same as human beings, not even Buddhist monks who can be saints at all times. <br /> <br /> When the sarcasm in this film ultimately, it is the most nasty thing that is projected out. Comes from the 'abbot' of the Red Lotus Temple who studied pure destruction as never before in the movie He is Milton's Satan nation from "Paradise Lost": "Better to rule in hell than serve in heaven!" And if he can't go to Satan's hell, he will soon change the world around. He turns into a living hell that he can rule. <br /> <br /> That's the standard that shows the brutal violence of many images here: not that the abbot wants to kill people. He wants them to be hopeless, fully desperate to accept his destruction as a comprehensive reality. Therefore, there is a clear sense of broadcasting the red temple scene that may not have any other realities other than the temple itself - it has become all to the universe and the abbot claiming to be an infinite authority. Br / > <br /> Of course, luckily, this film is not over yet. Even if there is a loss But human beings are just human beings in the end (If you want to know how to watch movies!) But there is no doubt that in watching this movie we visited hell. Hope that we will not testify of our own afterlife But we feel that being taught from experience - and it is better
