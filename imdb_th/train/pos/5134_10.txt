This story has been nominated for an Academy Award and I hope it will win! In general, making a jam between some talented musicians, including Leicester and Joe Jones, this song is great! Hollywood often accepts jazz. (Especially the animation, believe it or not) but this is a rare image in an incredibly jammed movie This has been added to the film conservation program and deserved. Therefore, TCM runs this as a filler periodically and runs every March as a tribute to "31 Days of Oscar" from the town where the buzzer has nothing In addition to being groundbreaking and shooting was smooth, the mesh was barely moved. Most strongly recommended and high !!!
