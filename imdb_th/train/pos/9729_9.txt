Weak start, medium hardness, excellent finish That is my impression on this film. I like Simon Pegg in two stories that I have seen him in --- Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. Although his role here is completely changed. Showing his range as an actor But still, I don't like this character as he did in the first episode. <br /> <br /> There is a sense of humor that I call "funny, funny". In fact, it is nothing more than a painful and awkward moment. Like the character Bean Rowan Atkinmson, there are many comedians who also perform similar characters. I do not intend to beat them here, so I will not <br /> <br /> but be warned that if you are like me Three of this film However, it's better than ever. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that this story is based on the true story. Hmmm. Maybe the story of the movie stops annoying and becomes a victory. "Little Man" in the last three I don't want every movie to be sugar and light --- but accidentally, when this movie gets better, it starts to end happily. <br /> <br /> It's also a pleasure. To see the old favorite, Jeff Bridges has a special role. I like "Iron Man" but sad because of the fact that Bridges' characters are villains. Of course, it is a true personal taste because his performance in that is great. However, he was surprised here as a visionary greater than the publisher's life of Sharps. It's good to see him in a role that I can actually enjoy. <br /> <br /> Overall I like it. it! I just hope I will come late in 40 minutes and miss the beginning.
