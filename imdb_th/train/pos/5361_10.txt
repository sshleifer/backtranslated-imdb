If you are popular in gaming, you will understand that you need a bigger and better fix in the world of Running Man. Your needs will be solved. For this game, prisoners compete for freedom and the highest reward - their lives. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. It is a parody on the rags that make us look everyday. It's not one of the best performances of Schwarzenegger But overall it is a very good movie The basic idea that today's TV companies will be the "true" parents of the world is very reliable and is a very good image in this movie. Of course, there are regular Arnie one-liners that I like when they are going. Was shot into the gamezone host gamehow to ask "Is there a last word?" Arnie says: "Yes, I will come back" but the host is absolute. "Only when re-using" and press the eject button I gave this movie 10 stories with the real initiative. I have to watch it 30 times. <br /> <br /> In the short term, don't think you own the T.V. - It's yours .....
