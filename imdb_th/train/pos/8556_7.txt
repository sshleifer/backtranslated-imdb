This movie is very fun. I have no connection with the original America Pie, but it's fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Try again, but better than the Band Band and The naked mile. At least it's fun. <Br /> <br /> After the first five minutes, I laughed, resigned, so I decided to call my friend and we would watch it together. We had a few beers and we had fun. <br /> <br /> You won't find the message. Any depth in this movie But it is worth watching. <br /> <br /> So, lean back and enjoy it.
