This performance is beautifully finished. When it came out for the first time, I had nothing more than a light family comedy. It seems to show many families as well, with different concepts of both parents and children. I never thought of it again in the evening. However, my point of view was shot out the window when John Ritter's tragic death comedy was amazing. This program is at the ground level and praises the characters who live in a delicate way that touches John Ritter's heart. Everyone appreciates what a talented actor can do. When the program aired after Ritters passed, I wanted to hug my father and tell him how much he meant to me. I think that this projection is to throw the talents of the three children, especially Bridget's character, who is concerned with the last words she speaks to him. It reminds me that no matter what I say to the horrible father, I don't mean them and it's very important that he knows this. Great performance
