I remember the first time I saw this thing back in the 70s when it appeared on television late at night. Afraid of hell from me But at that time I was a teenager in those days, not as boring as now. <br /> <br /> The Castle of Blood (aka: DANSE MACABRE) is a good example of the 60s Italian horror genre with BLACK. SUNDAY (1960) by Mario Bava, CURSE OF THE LIVING DEAD (aka: KILL BABY KILL) (1966) and NIGHTMARE CASTLE of Mario Casia (1965). If you want a scary atmosphere with good writing, try These things as well I rate these things, along with the first generation of Poe movies that Roger Corman is doing at the same time. <br /> <br /> I saw a new DVD DVD taken from the French print - and scanned. That made the round on television for many years It adds a few minutes of conversation. (In French) that doesn't add much to the overall movie But good to see it complete without cutting Unfortunately, the DVD doesn't offer anything more than still images from movies. <br /> <br /> One of the images I noticed was that in the opening scene, seeing a man with a smoke effect next to the camera reflected. On the glass of Front door I guess the editors are not on time or maybe they are not interested. But it was something I didn't notice at first That is the wonders of the DVD. You will see all the mistakes and details that are not clear at first, but not important. <br /> <br /> But it doesn't matter. Still get 7 in imdb meter. <br /> < br />
