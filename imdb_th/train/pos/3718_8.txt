This is a good movie. It's not your normal thing But it has something different This movie shows us recruiting in pre-war training and not fighting war. This film is one of the more realistic views of the war and the army than any other movie. Colin Farrel works well in recruiting the army and Clifton Collins Jr and Matthew Davis have a good part. Seeing Colin Farrel moving from grade b Going into grades in the next few years, you probably don't think it will happen. I will add that the creator of the tiger works very well in filming the movie in 2000 and makes it seem that 1970 is good. It is good to see talent used wisely and I hope to see this same talent again in the near future.
