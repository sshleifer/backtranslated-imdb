Edmund Burke said, "All evil needs are good for me to do nothing." Hollywood often makes us waste because the family isn't enough to watch quality movies This movie elevates the loss and restoration of faith. There is no violence, no obscenity, and not worthy of a PG score. Western scenery is good and some scenery is amazing. The actors are still young for their part. But believe and have other abilities Music scores are too loud and in some places, subtracting all conversations. I was not surprised at the ending of the movie anymore. But I was surprised by this Sometimes good people win and they win with honesty. We like movies and messages and would like to recommend for everyone in the family.
