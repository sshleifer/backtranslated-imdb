OK, where do I start ... This film changed my life! Seamless story James Cahill made himself Initially after the first viewing, I was disappointed that I didn't see it on the silver screen. However, this is before exploring the many features of DVD !!!! Oh my God, Jakes Cahill. The film's opinion is almost flawless like his performance. He talks about the secrets of the industry used in movies that you get from experience. <br /> <br /> I was impressed with other actors. The scene where the security officer is talking to the girl in the hallway reminds me of my favorite blue movie (pornographic). Of course I was Gangsta when he expressed disappointment with no part retarded! All of this is the classic movie of all time and the best movie that will come out of Europe in many years! My morning Oscars !!!!!!!!!!!
