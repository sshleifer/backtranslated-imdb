If you love the sci-fi cult of the 70s as I do or if you like movies like "Repo Man" or "Buckaroo Bonzai" more than you love this person It is an exciting stream of the 70s sci-fi consciousness, including the 22nd century garbage collection and the world a million years from now. This movie is pure 70s. Put "Fly Like An Eagle" of Steve Miller's "Pink Floyd" or "Dark Side of The Moon" and you're ready to go!
