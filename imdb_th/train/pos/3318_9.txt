A very cute movie with a fantastic backdrop from Boston and Fenway Park. As a baseball fan and addict, the movie is soft, lots of laughter and authentic baseball scenes, with real ballplay and real references to falling. Bosox's liquefaction in the past and how fun it is to watch a movie with a baseball theme without having to endure the awkwardness of Kevin Costner, who uses himself too much. Let the believer fall out of the target group. Jimmy and Drew work well as a beloved young couple suffering from "jones". Jimmy's Bosox is quite strange and out of the field, but there are fans of Sox who are crazy and live Of them through the fate of the team they love This film is projected quickly and endlessly, although it can be predicted. But with the charm and sympathy of many other popular movies without being pretentious. <br /> <br /> The fun is the return of Willie Garson on the screen. I miss "Stanford Blatch" that is famous. Forever from Sex & the City. He is always funny, even if he is doing or speaking very little. <br /> <br /> Buy two seats in a popcorn box and get ready for a fun time. "Fever Pitch" is Winner
