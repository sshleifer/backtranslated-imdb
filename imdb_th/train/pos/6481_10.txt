I saw this set when I was a kid and loved the details it entered and never forgot it. In the end I bought a DVD set and this is the way I remember. This is just a document that should be neutral and true. This film is unbelievable and has an excellent interview. The only other series I have found is equal to 'Die Deutschen Panzer'. <br /> <br /> I only hope that Hollywood will sit down and watch this series. Great war movies> <br /> Brotherhood notes, Ryan's personal savings, letters from Iwo Jima, the flags of our ancestors and when the trumpet fades, I'd recommend
