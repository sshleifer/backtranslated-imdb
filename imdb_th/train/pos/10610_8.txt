A young man with a sweet temperate mountain and a tragic past (Henry Thomas) comes to find the abandoned girl in the forest and immediately fall in love with her. The elders often support him in caring for children, even if the local provocation (Kara Moore) thinks the new family. A small girl who is determined to walk for a long time and an evil salesman (David Strathairn, disgusting) has a parallel story. This is the charm of life in the Ozarks in the same vein as "Where The Lillies Bloom" & "The Dollmaker". All three were shot at positions in those beautiful hills and covered the life of a simple life - but not easy - - The American language is a strong and short, but violent language that makes the family look relatively safe.
