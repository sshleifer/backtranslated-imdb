I like this movie a lot because it's true on Amazon, which is part of the world that makes me fascinated. I believe that this book was published in a short form in "Reader's Digest" shortly after the actual event. <br /> <br /> Because I am a "baby boomer", the characters and actors are my contemporaries and for The reason I relate to this movie I still believe that this film is worth teaching survival skills if the audience observes the character of the character that leads to the river and the seaside settlement where she can receive help, including survival techniques. Others. The most important thing is her intention to survive and maintain a positive attitude. In conclusion, I hope that the audience will learn something from it in addition to watching for entertainment. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie will be published on VHS and DVD soon because I want to add to the video collection. It should show more often in the satellite movie channel.
