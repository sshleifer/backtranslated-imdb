When you often watch a short movie, you are always scared that the person who created this movie tried to throw it too much. That's not the case for this. A wonderful story about a powerful girl and other worldly forces trying to do things correctly. <br /> <br /> Eric Etebari works great to represent the soul. Of distorted justice <br /> <br /> Both the girl and the father gave a great performance in this great short film. But Eric's acting is definitely a cheat on the show. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie for sophistication, efficiency and excellence above all.
