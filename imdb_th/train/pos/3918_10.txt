A fascinating, breathtaking and sensational movie like Flamenco. It is based on the music of Bizet Amata. Original music written and performed by one of the greatest classical guitarists, who is the lead character in the modern style. Lamego Paco de Lucia, musician player with the same name Legendary flamenco dancer and choreographer Antonio Gades has co-written and choreographed the great choreography of Georges Bizet / Prosper Mérimée novella / Opera. He plays the main character Antonio Dancer / Choreographer. Famous for working on the story of Carmen in the flamenco style that combines dance with singing and clapping hands with rhythm and high dynamism that attracts Watch /> <br /> Cristina Hoyos is excellent and elegant, with technical excellence, matching the beautiful art of her dance in the supporting role. Hoyos was the first dancer in the company Gades for twenty years (1968 -2531) She is a supporter of three films that Carlos Saura made from three great performances of Gades: "Bodas de Sangre" (1978), "Carmen" (1983) and "El Amor Brujo" (1985) Gorgeous. Laura del Sol is a young dancer named Carmen, which Antony saw at first sight. The immortalized by two Frenchmen, the writer Prosper Mérimée, in his most famous novella, written in 1846 that inspired George Bizet Opéra-Comique. Version from 1875 <br /> <br /> Like in the opera and in the novella Carmen in the movie of Saura, it is desirable and deadly. The most noble girl that must be Free above all She was unable to endure the love of one of the owners and needed death to surrender. There are 50 film adaptations of the story and the opera to the screen and unlike what it is, they all have only one sad end. The movie of Saura / Gades is unique, in that sense. Stimulate everyone's feelings and be truly Spanish. I fell in love with it since the first time I saw it twenty years ago and it was special and beautiful like today. Highly recommended
