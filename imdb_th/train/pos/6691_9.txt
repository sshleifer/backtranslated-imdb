This movie is very fun. What makes it especially wonderful has two things: one is a straightforward way in which the character embraces the pattern by talking about costumes and superpowers. There is a real intention that is a very interesting parody. The second is the basic sweetness of the characters and the quality of the chemistry. Claire Forlani deserves a particular note as the goal of Mr. Furious's desire to have many talents here. I know that there are some high expectations people may be disappointed. But this movie is very fun and cute
