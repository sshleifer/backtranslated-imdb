After watching many movies of BYGANGA, I have a clear opinion about him - he focuses too much on the character of the character until he forget the rhythm of the movie. That is why, even if there are good critics But his film didn't attract the attention of a wide audience In Aaron, he followed the same line. But better as the rhythm, especially at the end of the movie Frankly speaking, I slept through the first part, because although the first part provided the necessary information, but it was very slow. <br /> Recommend
