One of the best science fiction works of all time, as a visionary and thought-provoking as Gilliam's Blade Runner or even Brazil. But he was defeated by Pitt's fiercest turns, unlike anything he had done before Although Stowe has not left her league here The story is very layered and there are a lot of ideas about the climactic scene, the magnificence and the final line that is perfect. The scene in the psychiatric hospital is creepy and very funny in their own way. There is a lot of dark humor to show here. Excellent production design and appropriately strange movies In my top ten
