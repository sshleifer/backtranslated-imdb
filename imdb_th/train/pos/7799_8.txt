Very slow but has a complex structure and can finally be touched. The looks and looks are really good at the small beach town of Florida during the winter - I've been here and this is absolutely accurate. <br /> <br /> It is also a launch feature. Actors with Ashley Judd and she made a big impression here. It's hard to believe that this movie is 12 years old - I remember watching it in the cinema and I just rented "Ruby" again, except for the clothes that were seen in the 80s. It holds very well. Ashley shine and impress here, which is difficult to think about her career later. The boys talk about the failure to follow your first contract! Anyone who has seen Ashley here in "Ruby In Paradise" will take this beautiful natural beauty to all kinds of interesting art movies and serious performances - she becomes a "go to" girl for Dumb action movie Very disappointing But at least we have this lovely performance to show her first promise. <br /> <br /> As other reviewers say, this is not suitable for everyone because it is very slow. This is not an action movie or a really romantic story. Director (Victor Nunez, "Ulees Gold", another great character education) treats the life of this ordinary woman with profound respect. Her story is slow and has many details. In this way, I think this is one of the most memorable and memorable stories about a girl I remember - not about Ruby's sexual stimulation or "She lost her virginity" but about choosing her life And her growing maturity. <br /> <br /> A lovely movie. If you take the time to watch ... I think it will be a really great movie to show teens and girls. (Or boys for that matter) and give them the opportunity to think and talk Movies based on In novels or diaries written by women But actually it was the original work of Mr. Nunez, scoring 8 out of 10
