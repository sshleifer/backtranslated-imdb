I really love this show. But I saw the second episode for the first time. After watching the first episode, I could see why people closed at first. The humor of the first episode was not the best, and they tried to start the series appropriately. However, I still like the light and funny attitude of acting. The characters developed a lot after the episode and became a truly entertaining character. At first it didn't represent the rest of the program, which was really good. The episode wasn't bad at all, but when the show went on, it was getting better. So watch other episodes before passing the quality judgments.
