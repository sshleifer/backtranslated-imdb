I feel that this movie is a rare treasure, not just the beginning of Shirley's career. But still hard to see how our society changed You have to understand some of the things that we today see as sex. Going back, it is considered innocent. For example, the parents of the children in the movie and many parents who took their children to watch this movie saw that they were only children who mocked adults. Most people do not think that anyone will see children who are more sexually attractive than teenagers who have more sexual needs than teenagers. For them, it's not sex. Think you are like this before we have internet, TV, etc ... Most sexual crimes are not revealed. Sometimes there is a whispering voice about a child with "Uncle Funny" but that is usually something that comes from it all. Yeah, very sad. But today it is so sad for me. I can see this movie as something other than that. Intended, pure and funny When I saw Shirley's dance like that and they stared at her, yes I was annoyed. I have to remind myself of the time that happened! Those children don't know what Parents know that both children in movies and those who watch it Thoughts may not enter their minds. In the eyes of the general adult at that time, this is not a sex if Shirley is playing in the house Even today, children will participate in many beauty contests, fully dressed for three years. However, the child just pretended to be I do not blame children who want to act like adults. Or old movies that show this In all honesty, our media have done many things, seemingly returning to seem sick and wrong. Sometimes this may be the best thing. But I truly believe that this movie is not one of them It gives the innocent feeling of a pure heart which we lost for a long time.
