In watching DeMille's work early on, it added to me that DeMille in the early days was superior to DeMille at the end. His interest in using light in that scene was amazing. His pacing is very good, allowing him to tell a lot in about an hour. It is a pity that he does not understand the instincts of his next soundtrack as he seems to be in a silent movie. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie I saw Cleo Ridgely. Outstanding, quite restrained and still conveying broad emotions. <br /> <br /> The ending is great.
