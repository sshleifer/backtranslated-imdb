Hollywood imitates the best Daytiem Soap drama! It's fun that we've never seen. Great character and great connections. Whoopi is hilarious ..... Sally Field is the best ... Gary Marshall's line is a riot .... This is what I like about comedies. good Never be afraid to stimulate fun for yourself !!!!!! The scene is great .... The wardrobe is on the spot and "Monster More Head" Backing is a terrible pleasure. Terri Hatcher as "Dr. Monica Demonico" doesn't have enough lines. But no one looks small and beautiful and fun when on the screen I like to know how the idea of ​​this movie happens. I've never seen so many people enjoy creating funny works! Must hurry Soapdish and I'm waiting for the DVD !!!
