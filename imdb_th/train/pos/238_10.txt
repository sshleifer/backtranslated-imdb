Imagine coming out better. <br /> <br /> Hey, before you go to "Chick Flick" with me, I'm a strong and big guy. Macho Man who thinks this is the best movie about One of the past 20 years <br /> <br /> Great performances and wonderful stories. This is a magic drug for the heart and soul. The show shouldn't be better. <br /> <br /> I know each other well while Mercedes Ruehl, along with Holly Hunter, Joan Plowright, Dame Edith Evans, Sissy Spacek, Judi Dench, is one of the greatest actresses. The biggest that has ever appeared in the movie and of course Cloris Leachman (in this movie), in my opinion, may be beyond all of them in her various abilities and roles that she has appeared over the years. This movie is like a book that you can't lay down and when you come to the last page that needs more ... still more. I can't spend my life understanding why this movie in IMDb is so. Only 3.9 points <br /> <br /> The ratings here are very surprising to me, or maybe not. In fact, I understand very well and that's what makes me me really It made me very sorry for movies like "American Beauty" "Leaving Las Vegas" "Sexy Beast" and "Fight Club" ranked higher from popular charts "Rate ... R for that" Junk "Hey, OK. I know there are many different stories in this world for many different audiences. But it's a sad comment when the movie is cute, powerful ... special, directing, directing and writing the script. Looks like. <br /> <br /> Obviously it's an Academy Award as well .. .. How sad and predictable? My conclusion is if you want to see a powerful, happy, sad and beautiful story? See ...... should own this movie ...
