OK, there are many reviews here. What can I add? <br /> <br /> I'll try. <br /> <br /> The reason for this is my favorite scrooge because of everything. Outdoor venue dresses, costumes are beautiful and authentic. Melodious music Supporting actors do very well. One of my favorites is the narrator & nephew, played by Roger Rees. His elusive sincerity is his touch and his voice is the voice of Christmas with me. David Warner is also Bob Cratchit, who is truly reliable He is a difficult life. But he is still positive and elegant. <br /> <br /> The best part of the course - is George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge. Some people say that his image is too rude. I disagree more than this His exchange at the beginning, while cold or violent, is not a character. He is a very indifferent person whose heart is hardened by the volatility of his life and his desire for wealth. <br /> <br /> During the incident, he was clearly not satisfied. This is where we see that there is hope for him. If he goes completely, Marley, his partner, will not come for his sake at first. And finally we are not in the past that we had hoped for I think that's a big part of what Dickens tried to say. When Scrooge looks at his dance at Bell, the employer will see him smiling sadly when he tells Bell about his past life. "With a smile on my face" Clive Donner is smart enough to direct these moments on film. Sometimes they are left on the floor of the room. <br /> <br /> And finally, his repentance is filled with great joy that makes me cry. Tears of happiness every time I see it. His apology for Fred was very sincere, sincere. But only Christmas But also including humanity The happiness he brought to Fred and his wife was very clear. And every line that makes me "God forgave me when I lost it." <br /> <br /> Bravi tutti!
