Every scene is perfect together, this movie has excellent actors and teams. I mean, how do you have a bad movie with Robert Downey Jr. in there? No one will actually exist. He has the ability to add color to the movie with his amazing talent. This movie is perfect! I saw this movie sitting alone on the movie shelves in "Blockbuster" and like it was calling me, I couldn't resist picking it up and bringing it home with me. You can call me a romantic person. But this movie just touched my heart, not to mention, making me laugh with joy at the same time. Even if it makes me cry But I finally admitted that this movie made me see my life. After that, I introduced horror, action and comedy movies to my brother's jokes. This is a movie that has a good feeling. It can make you laugh loudly. Touch the heart, make you fall in love and enjoy your life every time you walk through this film intently. Choosing to live and feel this inspiring movie. Who knows? What if it really happened to you and opened your mind to the wonders of life?
