When reading Diamond's book, I was a little disappointed in the series. But all of this is a lot of information. Reading other comments makes me feel comfortable knowing that 'Cultural Warriors' are working hard to see 'attacks' in 'Western civilization' under every rug. <br /> <br /> Are diamonds a little preacher? Sure, as with many scholars, he saw that his theory was the most important thing. He used the phrase 'germs and steel guns' at every opportunity in the series. We came after about 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Diamond looks a little simpler (in the series)? Sure, the part about the Spaniards in South America is amusing, especially the abbreviation of complex and long history. 'Smallpox, sword and horse', which includes the entire South American conquest in about 15 minutes, but the issue is still correct - in fact, these contributed to the reasoning of the Spanish success in anti-culture established in reality (But not completely defined) <br /> <br /> He preached * Nope is not a word, not going to my ear All he said is that luck plays an important role in determining which cultures are progressing faster * not *. Luck is the only reason. <br /> In the end, if you are looking for something that is guaranteed Your accuracy Your own superiority, and this set is not for you. But if you are interested in all the factors rather than the social influence of success or failure, this series offers a useful interpretation of historical evidence.
