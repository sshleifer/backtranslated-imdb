This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It keeps me on the roller coaster of emotions. I laughed and cried and received disgust and happiness and had love! All this takes only two hours! <br /> <br /> Every actor is great! Of course, I have to mention the leading actor Michael Nyquist. He works amazingly !! I also admire the actors who play Tore, who plays a challenging young man with a convincing way! He reminds me of Leonardo DiCaprio that rolls the Gilbert Grapes! And the most beautiful song in the world is Gabriella's s√•ng
