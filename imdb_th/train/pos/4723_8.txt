Like this movie very little It is a movie that moves about fighting, sacrifice, and especially the bond of friendship between foreigners. (The child actors who play Miki are exceptionally good.) There are a large number of non-existent movies around the WW2. This small, credible story tells of a real break from the norms and original movies this I will add that this movie is boring and far away !! Of course, the horse is amazing and the scenery is breathtaking. For everyone who treats their animals as part of the family (I do), you will find that this movie is especially rewarding. Suggest that movie fans are looking for something slightly different.
