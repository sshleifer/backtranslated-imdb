My first child was born the year that this program came out and I played a record album for kids every Christmas after that. When the CD came out, I bought about ten sets and still gave them to friends and relatives when they started the family ... it would become their favorite Christmas album. Recently I found many DVDs (made from DVD -R from the videotape may sell on eBay) What I bought is a great copy, and it's great to see the show again after more than 25 years. There are some songs on the list that are not in Album and song of the album, some songs are studio versions of the songs on the list. But both CDs and DVDs will be in our library as the best Christmas entertainment ever.
