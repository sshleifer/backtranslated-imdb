I will be honest I received this movie so that I can enjoy it. I mean, come "Hood of the Living Dead"? What other reactions will I have? Although this is a movie (And the creator) decided that it wouldn't be fun But will try my best to be a good movie. <br /> <br /> And you know what? It came very close Slightly less cheese in songs, quizzes, professionalism in photography, showing little things. (Eg props - love Best Buy bags) ... er, not the classic movies of zombies movies, but it's still a small movie that looks good. And acting, writing, and pacing are much better than I expected Despite having a sense of humor, because our two leaders argue about how to decide whether the dead zombies are dead or not, <br /> <br /> If you can overlook the low budget Almost constant disrespect. This may be a fun time at the movie. No, it's not good at all. Yes, it should be better. But producers, actors, crews, all tried to create a good movie. (Instead of being a classic camp) and that counts a lot The lines of the zombies are full of camps, one mile long and thank you for not adding them. I like to see what they do next. And hey, somebody gave them a budget!
