I didn't watch Columbo too much. In fact, I think I only watched one or two stories in addition to this. Even though I like Columbo anyway, without seeing him much, Peter Falk is and is the perfect choice for the character always because of his voice and charm. The perfect proof of this is that even if the series starts back in 2009 Fri 2511, the latest film (And probably not the last time) was created in 2003, that is 35 years and Falkirk was 40 when he first created This series consists of 68 movies (unless I close). All things are made for TV. Everyone knows the character, even though no one has ever seen a movie with him in the cinema. That is a success if you ask me. The story is quite good. The only problem I had was that the murderer and the murder were first revealed. (Although it may be the same for all Columbo movies) without leaving a mystery, but Columbo approaches it to make it quite boring (since there is not much to look forward to at the end of the movie). Good, there are scenes that you are not bored The performance is very good, especially in Falk and Ruth Gordon. They have a wonderful exchange of interaction in movies. The characters are well written and reliable. Conversations and scripts are good for TV, movies. Overall, this film is surprisingly good for movies, television, and of course, should watch the fans of Columbo and / or crime / Mystery flicks. 8/10
