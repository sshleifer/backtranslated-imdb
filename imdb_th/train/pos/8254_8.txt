Set in the middle-class neighborhood of Willard's fantasy town in 1950, this black comedy film with a light touch toy that has a passion for America, such as gun madness and violence, materialism and fighting with the Joan. The And the elimination of the dead Yes, it sounds a bit heavy. But trust me in this story, it is almost as light as a feather. <br /> <br /> Zombies are featured among the characters. Important questions arise, such as who will become zombies (90% of Willard groups choose this last route, while only 10% like traditional funerals)? Who owns the number of zombies that will make the auction like a robot? (They become a sign of social status) and what is the range of possible relationships that can occur between a person and a new born person. <br /> <br /> Director Andrew Currie Write a lively screenplay (together with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton), making this improbable content pass for an hour and a half without hesitation for a good laugh. The top performer helps: Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett are the directors who have been assisted by K'Sun Ray as Timmy, a pure boy with a good heart. Acting as a fair witness to the madness of adults (When seeing her only in "Memento" and "The Matrix", I don't know if Moss has a great comedian. <br /> <br /> The design, production and music are exquisitely 50s. Not for everyone It will be a difficult movie to beat my annual Bizarro award. But the comedy genius comedy from the beginning to the end is one of the most difficult achievements in film making. For me, "Fido" is honking! My rating: 8.5 / 10 (A-) (see on 01/30/07)
