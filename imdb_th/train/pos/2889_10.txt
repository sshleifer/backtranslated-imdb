*** May not think that this story has spoilers But I am rather careful than carelessness. *** I have never seen this movie before. I fell in love with it the first time I saw it with my three year old daughter. I can watch over and over again. <br /> <br /> For Illywood's small performance in her life, she is a great voice for Cinderella. Very reliable The song fits perfectly with the movie. Excellent performances; Like me so much !! You "hate" Lady Trien and Sister; They are terrible. Cartoonists explain bad behavior very well. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, especially if you have a love story. My daughter had watched the movie about 25 times and still felt excited at the end.
