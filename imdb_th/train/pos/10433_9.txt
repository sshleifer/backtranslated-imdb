American boy Jesse boarded a train to Vienna to board the plane to the United States. On the train he met a French Celine girl. Although they first met, they talked like a good friend. When the train stopped in Vienna, Jesse asked Celine to let him go on a tour of Vienna. Then the romantic story unfolds. <br /> <br /> At first they were careful. The most fun scene is listening to the CD in the music store. They looked at each other, even if their eyes were not in contact. After an in-depth discussion, the relationship of the two was close. Then I saw the most romantic scene that they pretended to call their friends. Their deep love for each other is perfect. <br /> <br /> Love is a strange thing. When you need it, it will not come as you want. Love needs mutual understanding. Without it, love will not last long. Spiritual unity is the most important thing for love. <br /> <br /> Great screenplay and performance make the movie very successful. <br /> <br /> One of the romantic movies. Best 9/10
