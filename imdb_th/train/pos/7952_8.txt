This is one of my favorite family movies. I liked it a lot when I was young and I am now very old. I still laughed at all the traditional jokes and might shed tears again. I have never cared for animals to say much or at least those who are animators of the United Nations. But like this I will stand up It is a movie that is quite old. But it will always be in my heart. <br /> <br /> There is no other animal movie I can think of right now that I can compare. Like this I might praise too much for this film. But i don't think that will show I can say that it is a good message that "The house is at the heart" or at least that's the message I received from it. Definitely recommended for a good old family movie night.
