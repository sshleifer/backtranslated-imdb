My opinion for VIVAH: - A charming ideal love story starring Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao. The movie brings us back to a little joy, like the family of the bride and groom lying on the floor playing games together playing. Together, being friendly and respecting each other, Vivah is about the sacredness of marriage and the importance of commitment between two people. Yes, the central romance is an innocent image. But romantic moments sneak in between couples who are married and their stubbornness with modern courtship games makes you crave for fantasies. This film concludes with the marriage of the bridegroom on the wedding day, telling his new bride who has been injured by the fire: "Come, let me dress you up." <br /> <br /> VIVAH - Show many good things. - The beauty of marriage arranged, the beauty of Indian culture, the beauty of Indian women, last but not least, good ideas of being a couple are waiting to get married .... play by the rules! Simple but beautiful, simple story like this .... no plot ... no villain - as in the case of Sooraj Barjatya movies. Most Sooraj returned to what he did best. He created the movie with full confidence. It is a very sweet movie - which teaches the present generation about many good things about marriage, organizing and the combination of the two families. I think AMRITA RAO - looks very good & she acts very well. She has the best scene - although I think that the last half hour belongs to Shahid Kapur completely - those who change will give a great performance. I like the performances of all the other people as well. The Choti, such as Amrita Prakash, Alok Nath, Anupam Kher, Shahid's brother and brother-in-law, are almost as realistic and recognizable as possible. Sooraj sir created a family movie that Well, another story for his credit after Maine Pyar Kiya, HAHK and Hum Saath Saath Hath. The chemistry between Shahid & Amrita is horrible. <br /> <br /> Things like sacredness in marriage / relationships, avoiding Avoid courting, counters Mutual, caring & space, waiting for the wedding "official", prayer / Sacrficing for Ur Beloved - all these and many more have been shown in Vivah. There is also a good audience who are watching this film. Some people / listeners are excited after seeing that they are thinking about marriage - marriage :) That is a success. If you ask me, it looks like AMRITA RAO - Actress from Vivah {Result For good performances} received the prestigious DADSAHEB PHALKE Award for 2006 !! Wearing a hat for her for this achievement, Chalo, though Vivah, Shahid or Amrita didn't receive movie awards and other awards Congratulations to AMRITA RAO - for showing us the image of an Indian bride that is in the purest form and of course with Sooraj Barjatya for showing her the best way :) Shud. Don't forget Shahid Kapur and people. Others that make VIVAH sweet and legendary as it is today !! Imagine to share the same base with Dilip Kumar in the legend .......... It does not mean to be successful !! Congratulations to Amrita Rao - for applying for her job to the next level with this award .... I feel personally - you should continue to do movies with Shahid Kapur !! They created a lovely couple and the chemistry on the screen reminded me of {SRK-Kajol} or {Aamir Khan & Juhi Chawla} ................. <br /> < br /> Some points that I noticed have a few elements: - # 1. If you notice carefully, Amrita Rao looks very good because she always wears traditional dresses. She cares about every Indian woman - in this movie !! Perfect Fit # 2 Shahid Kapur is like most of us - not ready for marriage or marriage soon .... but PREM listens carefully. In a step-by-step discussion that his DAD gave - fully believable in Anupam Kher. Finally, "honesty" and "credibility" were the keywords that he reflected in his first talk with Amrita. person Majority thought that the first meeting with a stranger with a limited time, it is not enough to judge. But from what I saw in this movie, I have the feeling that two people created for each other can connect together in the 1st meeting. It is possible !!! # 3 in all movies - there No. 4 or 5, where Shahid & Amrita lived together - or showed that they were together It's different from most other romantic / wedding movies that Hero & Heroine often sing / dance or today - doing cheap things. But the beauty of each of these five sequences: - distinguished by restraint, innocence and respect for others! # 4 I like the relationship between Chacha ALOK NATH and Amrita Rao. This type of movie should focus on the indifference that is shown to the daughter / girl in some parts of India. # 5 Romantic scenes between couples are shot well - none. Cheap scenes, music is a beautiful picture !! Words like "Jal", "praarthana" etc are going to be suggestions for all women who like this movie :) Personally, I like many conversations in this movie. # 6 Last but not least - all hospital scenes. At Shahid, put "sindhoor" at Amrita when she struggles for life - excellent. The conversation between the couple is impressive and U feels love / I-cant-do-without-U; It's a kind of hat feeling !!! <br /> <br /> *** In many ways, VIVAH reminds me of Pyar Kiya, DDLJ, Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam - for freshness. / Chemistry on the screen of the lead partner:) :) *** If you ask me: - Along with movies like Rang De Basanti, Lage Raho Munnabhai, DOR, CORPORATE and Kabul Express, VIVAH is ranked the best in 2006. This movie - I think Vivah deserves something better than watching / business than Dhoom2 or Fanaa or Golmaal or movie time-through / Whether Pool / style / crap!
