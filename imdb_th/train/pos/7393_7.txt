This movie is an impressive movie. My first experience with foreign movies, it is not too long or too complicated. I'm happy with the subtitles; And the story is surprisingly fresh The story of an adult son visiting his father, an old man, and an older brother with a mental retardation after a long separation In addition, there are some subtle humor in order not to put pressure on the audience.
