I like Ronald Colman's dashing and friend Debonair that you see in movies, such as If I Were King and Kismet. I like him as an example of civilization in The Lost Horrizon and Random Harvest Colman groan, not my favorite thing. > <br /> But in A Double Life precisely because of his role as an actor, Anthony John is a disgusting thing for him. Becomes his best known part. <br /> <br /> Coleman is an actor who takes this method seriously. He had just succeeded in acting comedy and he was a cheerful person. For the change of speed at the moment that the drama concluded, the action of Broadway Colman is bringing the revival of Otello to New York. Opposite to the part that you will receive. <br /> <br /> His leading woman in both is his ex-wife, Signe Hasso, who loves him deeply. But unable to change the mood when he worked, Colman deeply loved her and wanted her back. But he was heading for a mental breakdown when he began to confuse himself with Moor Othello and Hasso, who played her role as Desdemona. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Shelley Winters as a waitress Pity From his madness, and she ended up as Desdemona, a poor person in the drama Was killed in the same way, and now it's the story of the police killing Joe Sawyer. <br /> <br /> Coleman's performance is so good that people wonder if this is a danger to the actor's career or not? I would tremble. I thought so. There were unresolved murders in or around Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles and they wrote Otello. <br /> <br /> I can't buy the story for that reason. But I applaud Ronald Colman and what he does with that part. I am sure there is regret in him who won the Oscar, although one of the other nominees was William Powell, his good friend for life with other dad who ran. That year, Gregory Peck, for the gentleman John Garfield's agreement for body and soul and Michael Redgrave for mourning, became Electra. <br /> <br /> Colman was supported by the rest of the cast, including Edmond O 'Brien at Find yourself In the undesirable part of Cassio in the imagination of Colman's jealousy, yet you will find that there is no equivalent Iago in A Double Life, no one provokes jealousy, it is in his own heart. <br /> <br /> And from one of the most experienced and civilized minds of the last century
