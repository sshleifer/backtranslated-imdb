It is amazing that actress PJ Soles did not become a big star after playing Riff Randall, the # 1 fan of the Ramon Rock group like Ramones in "Rock 'n' Roll High School. Do not think that she is too old to be in high school (actually that is the level with every child looking 24). This movie is a fun story that is not managed. Everything will be blown to the smelter at the end, and that is exactly what it should be Mary Woronov, who has a strange, funny and amusing shape as the headmaster of the Nazis. Flying dangerously near her head Is it a coincidence?) And Dey Young is very attractive as Kate Rambeau, the best of Soles, the weakest link, ironically in the "high school" gang chain, this is Ramones. They can't show. They aren't funny and their concert segments are too long. One Ramones song "I want you to go" is considered a fantasy and captured; Other songs are very good, especially the rare poem Paul McCartney near the beginning. ("Where have we met before?") Good fun! *** From ****
