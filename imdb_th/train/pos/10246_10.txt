This movie must be my favorite forever. It shouldn't have a plot because the creator wants people (Charlie Sheen I think) to believe that it's a real scent movie. This is an exercise in visual effects and is not cut off when the action scenes happen like other movies do today. Today, about the sound effects of the release. Making images out of the computer makes it easy to deal with blood. CGI also has filmmakers who are still unable to get fake blood to look like real things. There is no rape scene because that is not the purpose of making movies. Have you ever seen a mountain with 2 eyes? Rape scenes are funny instead of shocking. Although I am sure that there are some porn creators GONZO trying to marry porn movies with horror. But since they may suck in the making of movies, they may not be able to pull it out. The movie "Baise Moi" has an annoying rape scene because the actor is a real porn star and they show everything, although the overall picture of the movie is bad. <br /> <br /> It's terrible that it's impossible to create a movie. Without thinking Especially when talking about AO or NC-17 scores. I'm sure Eli Roth has the ability / ability to make his Hostel movie series much better. But he believed that it was too bad to rate R ... or at least I hoped that his movie would suck because of these limitations. <br /> <br /> See the Traces of Death or more. Smashed Pumpkins if you Do not need real pictures (Accidents and crime scenes / videos) Do not forget that this film was created in 1985. The fact that this film can still stand against most scandals has made today the story of many. Will be like someone who says 8bit Super Mario Brothers sucks because the PS3 has better graphics
