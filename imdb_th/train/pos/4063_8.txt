The castle in the sky is undoubtedly the movie of Hayao Miyazaki. After seeing it for the first time, I'm glad that it didn't disappoint. On the other hand, you will get a worthwhile time which means (For Miyazaki's related movies) which is no less than great! <br /> <br /> Castle in the Sky was built at the beginning of a movie theater career. It is expected that there will be many trade marks in his later movies with strong female characters (but still young). Forced to grow up By a very interesting character (And sometimes cute) and of course the natural struggle with the civilization of the plane (many !!) beautiful painted scenes ?? But alas, no pork (At the very least that I noticed after all, I only saw once) No less than that, Miyazaki opened his character two years ago with Nausic√£a, which is a dress rehearsal for Princess Mononoke, which is a work. His masterpiece of art, Castle in the Sky, is set a bit from these two things with action packed in the first 30 minutes, similar to his TV series Conan and the episode directed by Meitantei Holmes. The only true girl from the sky will be discovered by Pazu, a small boy working in a small mining town in the countryside, intrigued by her amnesia and wondering if there is a link. Between her and Laputa's mysterious flying city, Pazu is set on helping her know where she came from while fleeing the army and the pirate air gang. As the movie progresses, the plot becomes even harder and more interesting by revealing the best Myiazaki. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is reminiscent of Spirited Away (or vice versa because Castle in the Sky was created first) and like Joe Director of Joe Hisaishi _ the author _ starts with a very light score More complex and beautifully fitting as the plot goes ahead! <br /> <br /> English voice dubbing with good interpretation from both leading stars, although Anna Paquin's Sheeta has a very thick accent. (Which the actor still has at that point in her career) and headed to Mark Hamil as Musa, consisting of a gruesome but terrifying villain! <br /> <br /> Don't miss this one!
