Being a big fan of Andy Goldsworthy right now and owning some of my books, I have expectations for what I see. What I received was completely satisfying and more than I expected. Being an artist of his own (I work with clay) Finding inspiration in our environment to create good art is essential and that is what Andy Goldsworthy specializes in following him over the past year. The director holds natural power, skills and dedication. For artists who connect with nature with wit and inspiration Movie music is embracing and intoxicating. If you are an aspiring artist or anyone who wants a noble experience, please see this film. I'm glad to know that Andy is somewhere. Creating wrestling dance with the power of nature to make our world more beautiful.
