I'm quite afraid to watch this movie because of its price. But living in Italy like this name has never been seen before and I like the process so much that I decided to try it. And I was very surprised! This story is different from other dance movies I have seen recently, meaning deeper than just "winning". It touches and is well written and directed well. Raya is a strong character. I like the fact that she never doubts that she is an adult and concentrate and gives her special abilities. (And the ability that Rutina Wesley has gifted my jaws in the final dance scene) the way she pursued her dreams and refused to let anything stop her frankly, inspiring In addition, the fact that she is not the most hot chick (see Jessica Alba, Briana Evigan, Jenna Dewan, Zoe Seldana ...) makes her attracted and true. Seriously, why does this movie get very low ratings? You can understand in the first 5 minutes that it is a really good performance. I really cried at the end of the movie. And the dance was not comfortable
