How can I tell that I watched this great movie when my nerves were still confused! Director Jacques Audiard must create a name for himself in France and right. Vince Cassel is not Tom Cruise and Emmanuelle Devos is not Penelope Cruz as well, but both are excellent actors and this is a fascinating thriller that started Begin slowly by creating a character that is clever and tense with tension. Important points. Others write about the plot, so I won't say more than anyone in this movie. Has the role of perfection, director, actor, down to the cameraman and everything seems real, no stupid gun play, fighting when It happens reliably. Expressions, feelings, and feelings are almost the same as you are as an audience. Do yourself a favor, get a DVD, a bottle of wine, open low lights, take the phone out of the hook and soak up the excitement in Hitchcockian :)
