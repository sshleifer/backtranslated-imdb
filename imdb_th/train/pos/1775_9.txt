I always wonder why this series has been very popular. I think it's great and write and act very smartly. I think later on it will be seen in the light that deserves. That is, if they ever come out. Many actors and comedians appeared in this story. This truth may make people realize its value and it must be released. Sally Phillips, Simon Pegg, Peter Serafinowicz and Julian Rhind-Tutt. At least the highly successful Green Wing writer Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews are Two of the best comedians of today. Anyone who can create a comedy like Father Ted cannot write something that is not worth publishing. If it comes out, I will definitely buy it.
