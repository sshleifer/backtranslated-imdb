It is a pleasure to see such creativity on TV again. This performance is poetry, art and good fun. The characters have a good relationship and the writing is not bad. (I think it will be better when they get their legs). Definitely worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Women steal the show in this series. Chuck is cute, just like Olive. Both aunts are happy. I sincerely hope that they will write it as a bigger part because it is magic. <br /> <br /> Okay, that's all news that is suitable for printing To create a large popcorn bowl and enjoy the old things. It's like Dr. Seuss for adults
