I do not know the stars or modern Chinese teen songs - but I know the movies that are thoroughly entertaining when I see this movie. Kung Fu Dung is a pure Hollywood movie literally - it plays to laugh. For love and a great combination between Kung Fu and basketball. <br /> <br /> Everyone seems like they enjoy doing this. - Excellent production value - and modern Chinese look. Shadow over Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> The plot of the abandoned orphans who grew up in Kung Fu School will only be kicked out and discover the greatness as Playing basketball (And love and many others;) Great, fun and fun. <br /> <br /> With great action and good conversations, this is one of enjoyment - for all ages - and for Our money is one of the best family movies we've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Please ignore negative comments and give Dunk a chance - we're really glad we did - GOOD comedy.
