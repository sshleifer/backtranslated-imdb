PLAYTHING of the devil is my second attempt in the production of Joseph Sarno - and even though I said it was more fun than using the boring and innocent WILDCATS Swedish that was painfully and painfully <br /> one of That surrounds a group of vampire girls who live in a castle that wants to revive the "leader" who had been killed earlier In order to do so, the girl must dance around, naked and kiss each other and sing a strange prayer and of course must drink blood as well. When the doctor and her brother's car stopped and they had to stop at the castle to find accommodation - they provided the blood that was suitable for the vampires with horns ... but they might not do anything as they seemed ... <br /> <br >> Devil's PLAYTHING is a good example of the use of the early 70s. Many nudity - including some full, subtle, frontal faces - including incest and siblings. g The Lesbian, bloodstained scene ... but these are relatively tame by today's standards. Some hot women in this area will benefit from having more sex. But I think you can't do it all. Will benefit from the heavier violence than it is a vampire movie But I think the purpose of THE DEVIL'S PLAYTHING is more to show the movie, not blood. Still a little slow - and most performances are certainly made of wood - but what is expected from this era and from this budget Worth to see the use of fans - others may find it too boring for their liking. 7/10
