I remember like this thing more than Nausicaa of the valley of the wind when I was older when the tone of the story was too serious for me. Laputa, whose title seems to affect the launch in the United States, to avoid confusion with the audience Spain wide In fact, Pazu has the thick bones and immortality of Conan, who jumped into thousands of stories that held his girl in his arms. This makes him the most lively and entertaining character to watch. Nausica's fans may be disappointed with the flaws in aviation and retro technology from Laputa - the only exception may be a robot unlike Princess. Mononoke and the Valley of the Winds. Themes in Laputa are not directly connected to environmental conservation. If it has a theme, it is anti-war. The importance of natural living - this involves the flying castle which will be discussed shortly and not followed. Overall, I now think that this work is the intersection between good feelings and repetition.
