This is what the cult My friends and I gather once a year to enjoy this movie. It's funny and very dry. I've seen this choreography for dozens of times and it's not fun. Comedians and it's better every time you watch! If you like "Morons from outer space", you'll love this. A wonderful play about the War of the Worlds. I like rampant red necks to get aliens. A bug on the DOD hood. The heat that finds a way to kill a mine mine. "I'll get the bucket!" Very funny. I like to give it out on DVD! Forget negative comments, go and see for yourself!
