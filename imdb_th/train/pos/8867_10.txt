I hope that at least the first season of Cosby will be released on DVD one day. When George had a smart brother, Hilton's freak (Performed by Roscoe Brown Brown) is a classic. It reflects the classic sibling competition and the love between the living brothers and sisters, using different paths. But both are happy. <br /> <br /> Mr. Cosby and Ms. Rashad have changed the chemistry they share in The Cosby Show for many years and have made them more active in the middle class. Seeing the dimension in which they can become artists. <br /> <br /> A list of comedians ... Madeline Kahn, Phylicia Rashad and Mr. Cosby ... Classic genius!
