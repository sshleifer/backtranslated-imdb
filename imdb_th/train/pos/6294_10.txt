The episode of the Twilight Zone combines the silent part (1890) with the melodious and funny performance which is a homage to the first season of Buster Keaton: the buster collapses on the door, falling into a pool, running Around the little pants, the invention of the Time Helmet, the scientist of Silly reminiscent of the Flash Gordon idea that the future will be like cheap, such as $ 1.95 for ladies hats or 17 cents per pound for beef. Looks very high with Buster. Even the 1890 world is too much for Buster / Mulligan. Surprisingly, when he was wrongly transported to the "modern" world in 1960! Buster is trying to go back! "Scientists" at that time wanted to return to a peaceful world in 1890 that he studied and appreciated. They come back together and Buster / Mulligan is now happy and "Scientists" feel sorry that there is no electronic device, modern bed or electric blanket. So Buster sent him back with a crazy helmet. <br /> <br /> The Twilight Zone doesn't have a heavy message. Since Buster Keaton died in 1966, it was one of his last attempts. <br /> <br /> Another lovely story is Maytag Man, Jesse White, who has not known for a long time as a repairman who repairs Time helmet.
