This is a great movie about finding happiness in everyday life. The camera's pacing, emotion, overwhelming musical score and the pure charm of this image makes it a must see. It is not easily popular from young people or emotional dwarfs. The only flaw I saw about this film was that it was not captured in a perfect film format than technically. It deserves to receive Todd-ah, Tech Color and the best sound format available. (Intimate movies can be built in seventy millimeters). Beautiful Italian villas for residents See and hear beautifully As it is, it still needs attention as a small movie that moves sweet I can't stop watching every time it appears on satellite. The transformation of the characters from the tight and unreliable is always a pleasure to watch and I should recommend it more often. <br /> <br /> The cast is perfect, the perfect mood It is a movie about middle age and what people choose to do is profound and prudent without having to dance for the audience to agree with their aptitude. Watch it in one place and let it affect you. If you don't understand, maybe you have not enough life or something wrong with you.
