For my life, why is this movie rated R! While it's about eating carnivorous zombies. Believe it or not, it's actually a good movie for the family - at least if your children are 10 years old and up, unlike traditional zombie movies, this story has great humor, including Original values ​​- even though a bit distorted! Language is not a serious problem, there are no nudity and the movie style is suitable for children (such as the old TV show "Eerie, Indiana") - but with some knuckles that hit the head rate one score! Believe me, most children see worse violence and it seems stupid to make viewers think that this is an adult movie only. <br /> <br /> The story is set in a parallel world. While the fashion, cars and traditions appeared in 1953, in this strange world, the latest outbreak of the zombie disease has resulted in "Zombie War" and big changes in daily life At school, children were trained in armed combat and there was a lovely scene in the movie where the father gave a handgun to his son and told him to keep it in a backpack "in the case"! For life outside of school, it's strange too. Now people learn that zombies are not a bad thing! Heck uses shock collars and training. They can make a slave that can do your homework, clean the streets, deliver milk, or in the case of a really sick person as your "special friend". <br /> <br /> This film deals with a particular family that eventually bought their first zombie slave (played by Billy Connally). The mother is excited and her son gradually becomes a friend of zombies. On the other hand, the father did not believe - while he was forced to kill his own zombie father for many years and he still didn't get this thing !! Funny, irreverent and unique - this movie needs a wider audience.
