Saw this show only a few times But in my memory <br /> <br /> It's very frustrating to buy anywhere and seems to be endlessly repeated like a friend! Even more difficult to be in England, I guess ..? <br /> <br /> They say that they have low ratings or are complaints from Bakersfield PD themselves? Maybe it is too smart for some people? <br /> <br /> But one joke that I want to see again But hardly to find Do I hear that it is or is being reproduced in another network? But not ending here !! <br /> <br /> Summary: ingenious
