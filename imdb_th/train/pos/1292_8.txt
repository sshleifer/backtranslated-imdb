Preston Waters, an 11-year-old boy, has a special problem with his parents and siblings because of money problems. He is crazy to have his own house and his own rules because his brothers always steal his saved money and his parents neglect their wishes. One scary day, Preston is riding his bike. On the same day, the villain about Quigley was trying to escape from the police and accidentally drove Preston's bike. Wanting to stay away from the police, Quigley quickly checks for the damage of Preston's bike. The problem is: it's an empty inspection! Preston is a clever boy and decides to have a high price to check out: 1 million dollars! All of that money is always what Preston wants, like a mansion with a pool, lots of toys and even a limousine! The problem started when the FBI and Quigley wanted to know where the money was, causing Preston to be in a difficult situation and experiencing many problems. <br /> <br /> This film is one of my favorites during my childhood My :)
