I have never watched this program before, although my family members are highly advised. My girlfriend lives in Hadfield (filming location) and she points out some important places when I first went. <br /> <br /> This makes me interested. So I bought Series 1 in the video. And sitting down to watch. In addition to being aware of some places, I found myself not surprised at all. Once again, the BBC is responsible for producing another example of the best comedy in the world. TLOG easily ranks with Red Dwarf, Fawlty Towers and Monty Python. <br /> <br /> Enough To say that I have already installed this program The character is excellent and shows unusual depth while still maintaining a true edge. The look and feel of the program is perfect and sometimes reflects the cold feeling in the north. (Do not despise Hadfield, where I find a warm and friendly place.) <br /> <br /> I hope it will continue. (Which depends on the 2nd series, which summarizes the replay in the UK last night, it is definitely) <br /> <br /> Well done BBC!
