I'm bored one night and Red Eye is stuck and think why not <br /> <br /> Red Eye is one of the best movies in a long time. <br /> <br /> I mean, I just went in. The movie makes it great. <br /> <br /> The story is new and different. <br /> <br /> The movie also has two great leaders in the movie, with Rachel Mcadams as Lisa Reisert and Cillian Murphy. The script is Jackson Rippner. <br /> <br /> The performance is great and you will get the feeling of people in the movie. <br /> <br /> The song is great. Make you feel relaxed. <br /> <br /> I love how the movie is doing well and it never gets boring. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is just a phenomenon. There is nothing more and no less. <br /> <br /> It's a great thriller. <br /> <br /> Overall, I enjoy the Red Eye so much that I can watch over and over again. <br /> If you like Red Eye, I recommend Elektra and Cry Wolf. <br /> <br /> Let me Red Eye 9 of 10. <br /> <br /> Great movie.
