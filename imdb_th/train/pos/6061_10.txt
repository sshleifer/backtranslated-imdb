I enjoy this movie so much that I have watched it twice and it's something to say about the documentary. Music scores, movies and sounds are as amazing as you'd expect from Imax's production. Although it was filmed in Imax's large movie theater, it looked and sounded great in my home system. In fact, it will create the perfect DVD for your system demonstration. <br /> <br /> That topic is also interesting. It's about Mario Andretti and Michael. His son, I'm a Mario fan anyway because He is the best racing driver in history because he is the only one to have won the CART Championship, F1 Championship, The Daytona 500 and Indianapolis 500. The following script, two very important car routes, father and son, car Rae Was found in a chicken coop and a car, the Roadster, the first Mario ran track and we are restored to perfect shine. Another car is Michael's new race car, and we follow it from mold cutting to the race season. Imax uses the right magic to create entertainment and interest. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman, the owner of Michael Amoretti's team, during the time this film was created His anecdotes and ingenuity, drawn from many years as the owner and driver, help in the production. <br /> <br /> The main feature is the race scene. Increase the volume here! There is something about riding over 200 miles per hour and music scores that take you to the screen for an experience you won't forget. Wow! <br /> <br /> The last magical element is the human race of the Andretti family, Mario Andretti, the world of horse racing, the dear father who takes pride in his son's career. They work well together so that every father and son should see this. You can tell that they are a close family. I hope we all get that experience.
