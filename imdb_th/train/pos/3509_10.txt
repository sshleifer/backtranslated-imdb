I have watched this movie for a while, and it still remains in the top of my favorite movies. It was amazingly compiled and what made this movie a detailed tid bit (like the Cafe Bustelo coffee crate that was reused as a cup to wash her hair) that people didn't see Unless you are a wise person This is just one of the films that have a specific culture and especially Please do not beat this movie if you do not have previous knowledge about the foundation being created. I see what the writer / director is doing and he accomplishes the goal perfectly! This film deserves a much better score.
