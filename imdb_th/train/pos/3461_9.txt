Now Columbo may be more noticeable for director Steven Spielberg, one of his early films. Should see the role of Jack Cassidy as a murderer who killed his partner in writing to preserve his life He is a puzzle writer who plans to complete the murder. After his first murder, his next victim will be the owner of a general shop / annoying widow. Instead of wasting more money, he killed her. It was fun to watch Cassidy and Falk. As always, Falk's familiarity as Columbo made him look after it repeatedly over the years. What television today forget about the success of the year is that people will want to watch the program again and again if they like the characters. It's not about who, who, how, and why it is the satisfaction of Columbo and his passion.
