It's been a long time since I watched this movie (at least 15 years) and it still haunts me with a clear picture of the horrific consequences that prisoners of war can face, even in the terms of the Geneva Convention. <br /> <Australia's underwater demolition expert unit was captured in an island near to Japan after a successful mission to place mines in a Japanese port. <Br /> <br /> Once in prison These are expected to be treated like other POWs, but from their fears they soon learn from the friendly Japanese prison guards that they are trying to be spies because they don't. In uniform when arrested The consequences of such violations according to the Japanese fighting code were executed by beheading. <br /> <br /> Despite the pleas and testimony of a compassionate prison officer, The tension is very high, you will hear the tick, even if it may be your chest pain when dealing with marching. <br /> <br /> The ending is too painful to react in my head less than writing. Here, but I can promise you - you will never forget it. Good luck in finding videos in the United States.
