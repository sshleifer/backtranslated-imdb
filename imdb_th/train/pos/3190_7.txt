This is your standard musical comedy from the '30s, along with the greatness that some actors have known in the 30s in a small pendant. <br /> <br /> There are not many stories. About the overall atmosphere that is fun and 'Do not worry' with a sense of humor from Hal Halach. 'Cinderella's story' but of course I didn't miss it while watching the movie. The story has received a lot of confusion in storytelling with different characters and many small pendant looks when the main character, Hit Studios Hollywood. Of course, the highlight of the film is when Laurel & Hardy creates a look and shows their routines. It's like watching movies and laurel and hardy short for free. Laurel and Hardy regularly appear in Walter Long's daily routine and James Finlayson. (Without having a mustache this time) as a short director. <br /> <br /> It is true, of course, the pendant and all subplots divert attention. Main line plot and character But in this case there is no problem because it looks more fun and interesting than the main plot lines and shallow main characters. <br /> <br /> The movie is the absolute thing. Not worse than other types of movies in the same period, although the ratings here are recommended otherwise. <br /> <br /> 7/10
