This movie is better than The Jerk. Very original. I would like to recommend to everyone who likes quirky humor. We have included many lines from this film into our daytime discourse as we have from Monty Python. <br /> <br /> A card game with a homeless person. His displeasure for the traditional turtle soup The Jerk was too choreographed. While I like Steve Martin, he seems to be trying hard. Jerk Too is a scam and everyone will enjoy. Jerk Too is friendly to the family, unlike the original Jerk.
