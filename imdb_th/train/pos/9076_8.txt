This must be one of the funniest TV sitcoms to come out of America since the death of "Everybody Loves Raymond". Warburton is always hilarious and in this game will help fill the remaining actors perfectly. David Spade continues to stimulate my funny bones very much with his unique delivery. After groaning with the British series "Coupling", I can see from the creators of the "Rules of Engagement" getting their original ideas. But this thing is not intended to be "brickbat" - a wonderful conversation Which it was conveyed, this set is especially completely different But it takes more than talented actors to bring success to a new series, especially in very difficult jokes As part of the professional TV comedy team in the best seven years in Australia, I am especially grateful for the role of the director and talent and creativity of the camera team. One of the grievances that I have with the series is that the "can" laugh is very obvious. Of course, live audiences can be used to shoot the series.
