I'm a fan of ART. I like everything about art. I like paintings, sculptures, etc. The film shows so I like it very much. It shows that women want to paint something about art, especially the naked body but she doesn't Can do because of her strict family (father) at the beginning of the movie that she painted herself naked But she needs a man for her drawings But her family did not let her draw naked people because of the moral, even though Artemisia painted her boyfriend and her art teacher was completely naked. She fell in love with an art teacher and it seems that the art teacher loves her too, so at the end he sacrifices his freedom for lying. He said that he raped her. But it's not true Artemisia fell in love with him. But if she says that she will suffer a lot because of the trial that Artem, her father and art teacher are, someone is hurting the art hand to speak the truth. I think this is a great movie about ART and the love of art is worth watching Valentina Cervi is great like Artemisia. She did very well. I like her performance in "The portrait of a lady "as Pansy Osmond 8.5 / 10
