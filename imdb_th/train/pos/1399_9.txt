This is one of the most shallow episodes of the plot. This seems to be an excuse to have fun. But I admire the light method and this is one of the best episodes to see at a truly fun level. Think about it - the crew met with a white rabbit and Alice from the Bengal Tiger Wonderland, Samurai Warriors, Knights On horseback that killed McCoy and hosted strange activities that didn't seem to do anything Feel the end Despite all the dangers, you can't do everything seriously - it's too fun and the whole episode looks very realistic. Therefore, at a level that is not purely aesthetic, it is a wonderful thing.
