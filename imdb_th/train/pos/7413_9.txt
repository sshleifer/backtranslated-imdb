The shower helps in itself. In many ways, almost every movie takes place in an old bathhouse with citizens who send humor, pathetic humor and emotional touch. The love and friendship between the owner and his mentally retarded son is deep and impressive. The way in which the older brother was attracted to this small world seems to be not forced and persuasive. The plot is crooked, full of surprises and mocking and overall touch with a sense of what I have to call the neighbors in the relationship and the conflict of the actors. This is the movie that I pulled out when I wanted to believe in the world again.
