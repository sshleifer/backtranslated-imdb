This film seems to draw the border - on one side, those who love it on the other side who find it unbearable. <br /> <br /> Start with a lot of funny movies in this movie that Many viewers do not "get". Of course, Jet Li's mask looks like Bruce Lee's Cato - he should be a joke. A man with a time bomb sew his heart - outrageous? Of course, it's a joke! Some readers may ask, if this movie should be funny, why is it too violent and bloody? Well, for one thing, patience for this level of violence is different from culture to culture. And while the audience in Hong Kong is aware of this violence is serious But has a slightly higher average than Hong Kong action movies. <br /> <br /> Black Mark is a type of movie. They are just extremes because the meeting itself is totally unrealistic. After decades of watching, people were shot without apparent wounds. Many were shocked to see Bonnie and Clyde, and the savage bandits threw blood all over the place. But the fact is that when you are shot with a fast metal bullet, it is almost certain that the blood will burst, especially from the arteries. <br /> <br /> The film is a Chinese comic book. It is true that Spider-Man films have never been scary. But if they are honest with the truth, they will be! Despite the origin of comic books But this film is honest to the truth. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have is filming and editing too flashy. If the creator of this film was filmed with a nostalgic Hollywood style (such as, The Rocketeer, or the latest Captain Skye movie), I wonder who would think it was nasty. <br /> <br /> But It still stands. I also enjoy watching this movie.
