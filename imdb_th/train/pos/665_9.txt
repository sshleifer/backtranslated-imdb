"And All Through the House" is a special episode of the basement, not just because it comes from the first season. But this is the first episode that I saw! I remember being a young man on vacation with my parents in the summer of 1989 in our hotel room in South Carolina on the HBO. I saw now and I was buried at the crypt immediately and Forever! I am always a big fan of horror series and like to watch monster movies and with this series starting with HBO, I'm happy again. Now, for the first time I saw it as memorable for me and one of my favorites, it was a lot of fun with a great twist. "And All Through the House" has a cozy atmosphere on Christmas Eve that is full of Snow, which is the perfect way for you to relax on vacation! However, you have Mary Ellen Trainor (who plays in the Warner brothers, many of whom work in small parts) as a greedy flirting wife who takes care of her husband while waiting for money and new love. Just like the most horrible things in the horror series make the worst and worst people get what they deserve. The odds are heavily stacked when the person dressed like Santa escapes from the local bean house to stop the Christmas Eve! From E.C.'s ancient cartoon lesson, you will learn that the bad guys get what they want! This fairy tale ends in a perfect holiday scream! In addition, this story is in the 1972 film and JoAnn Collins. This story is undoubtedly one of my favorites and probably one of the classic vaults of the time!
