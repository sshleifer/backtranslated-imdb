At first, I reacted to a lot of people leaving after seeing this: the image of a fat person, sunbathing and others being the right image. OK, so he made Diane Arbus to find something .. but not long before I realized that this was not done in a way that was a human deity because the image that appeared I felt That the problem is all about the audience: we have conditions by Hollywood and movies from everywhere Watching people who are over the age of sexual characteristics is an invisible thing that should not be expressed. If this is a movie that is all presented, it will be a big deal. However, the story of a woman with an improper girlfriend and his drunken friend strikes like a brick: a very beautiful storytelling, an unbelievable performance, and the idea that the scene is improvised That blonde man is a genius actor. Finally, I want to argue, who said that this film is all about the poorness of these people. The old man who is with the woman who eventually dances with him is the perfect character that destroys that mold. So don't overlook this movie by looking over him. Yes, his dog was killed. This is not a picture of the rose of the world, but not .. completely hopeless. However, I am grateful to such a beautiful filmmaker. I will not say that each thread is as strong as possible. But I said that this movie kicked the ass and would recommend it very much.
