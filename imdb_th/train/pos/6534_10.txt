I heard that this movie was great from many of my friends who saw it, and all of them said it was so wonderful, so I had very high expectations - and Nancy Drew exceeded those high expectations. ! It has a funny part, it makes me enjoy all the action and ducks that try to kill her and Emma Roberts is amazing as Nancy Drew. The remaining actors are also very good. I would like to introduce this movie !! <br /> <br /> Nancy: "I wonder why they tried to kill us ?!" Corky: "Yes, I wonder, too. I'm crawling away! "<br /> <br /> Nancy:" I hate when people try to kill me. It's rude! "<br /> ~ Nancy Drew
