I saw this movie for the first time during and the International Film Education Program. I am a student 'Non-traditional' and perhaps because of the reasons many years ago or caused by intellect, admiring the storytelling slowly and pondering of the movie With the heat and dust of a dry land, this story is deeply psychological, consisting of many layers of symbols and the reversal of the theme of being 'other' in the land that we do not understand. The understanding that is filled with unresolved memories and the privacy of outsiders Created almost 20 years ago and is also a pioneer in the form of many other foreign films that explore the topic of colonies in colonial areas without involving the culture in which they entered. Filmed more extravagantly and the hard work that has been done since reflecting on the same topic: Indo-China, nowhere in Africa, there are two things that can be compared. There is no adrenaline or violence pumping action. The fight is both emotional and subtle. But being said that it is a good movie to watch
