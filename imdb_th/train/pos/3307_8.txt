Let us start by saying that the English name of the film "The Power of Kangwon Province" is a completely wrong name because in the movie of Hong Sang Soo, there is no real war picture, real problems and conflicts. Unsuitable or incorrect provinces in the context of this film, if we are to judge this movie with a Korean name, "Kangwon-do ui him" will appear as a vague message about the emotional turmoil of its protagonist. The mind is not resting. Hong Sang Soo has also prepared comprehensive visually relevant documents about the unusual choices made by people in their lives. Those who are suspicious are two young women who are in the process of changing emotions and Dreaming that if filmmaking comes out of emptiness, it can be claimed to be the virtue of the filmmaker. Hong Sang Soo must be regarded as a filmmaker with Brave film which talks about the empty universality of human relationships and emotional life. This is the only fair conclusion that can be deduced from this film.
