Glory to Fawcett to take that role at that time was considered a controversy. For my memories, rape remains a taboo subject in 1980 and the rights and emotions of women are not deeply monitored at that time. <br /> <br /> Fawcett is Only a woman who was Marussa was a crazy psychopath. But sometimes it is slightly transparent The scene where she threw a hot oil pan at Russo was classic, and while the villain deserved it From there, she would imprison him to be a slave and face the consequences Highly recommended. 8/10
