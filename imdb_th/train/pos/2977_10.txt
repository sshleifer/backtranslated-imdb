There are many words that I want to use to describe this movie. But I can't really? This movie is a movie to watch if you just want to sit, laugh, cry and pee. I'm serious. Don't watch this movie if you are offended by rudeness, sex, nudity, homosexuality ... and everything related to nature Being a woman and that may not be a factor. I can watch this movie over and over again. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are great. In addition to their debut, I think Baseketball is the winner. I laugh now. Just think of the stupid things they do in movies. Watch movies !! That's all i will say It's hard for me to comment on this because I'm one of those people, like Ozzy Osbourne, who has a curse on almost every line that blurs out of the mouth when speaking. So I will make it professional. The best movie. Hey, yes !!
