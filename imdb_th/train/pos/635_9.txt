I went to watch this movie on July 19 without knowing a few actors and knew that it was fantasy / adventure in some kind. <br /> <br /> The story line has nothing like what I saw. Actually, and the unique story is very much appreciated with everything that is currently being screened in theaters, despite what the first impression might make it impossible. The great or ridiculous, and it's really fun and funny. The flow is quite well done, nothing seems to run or drag out. The soundtrack for the lack of better words is magical and adds a lot to the movie compared to filling the silence that often occurs in movies or TV. And even though I may know that something is happening at the point where I am still not able to stop watching the screen; My knowledge is not the only one that has left the cinema all the time. <br /> <br /> The only thing I do is that there seems to be almost no marketing for this movie.
