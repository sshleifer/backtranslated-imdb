This movie is probably the most impressive and elevated movie I've ever seen. I am not a religious person But sometimes a great art like this movie can give me a religious experience. Suddenly one person knew what it meant for life. <br /> <br /> I must admit that when I first heard about this movie, I wondered. I think the plot is sound, and I am afraid that the story will be repeated. But being a fan of David Lynch, I decided to stop playing. I spent about 30 minutes in filming. But I lost my way There are many wits and warmth in this movie! I left the feeling in the cinema that I learned something valuable about life. <br /> <br /> This is not a typical David Lynch movie, and in some ways it's very surprising that he should create a movie After exploring The dark side of human nature for many years On the other hand, I am not surprised that he will deeply convey the deep emotions and deep understanding of human beings, because I think he managed this well in The Elephant Man Lynch. And I think The Straight Story is the best for him. 9.5 / 10
