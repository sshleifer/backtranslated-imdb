I've watched it more often than other TFTC episodes. It's very fun and it's quite scary. But it's fun, scary A woman killed her second husband, but found that there was a problem when a man was fleeing in a ragged Santa Claus costume and decided to pay her and her little girl to visit. Remember from live broadcasts or other comedy shows. The TV is an evil wife and Larry the Duck plays a madman in a dirty Santa costume. I forgot that Sandra was played by Drake for many years. His Santa is an unstoppable power and sometimes scary. You can guess how Santa will enter the house. Now playing for laughs But may be very severe sometimes
