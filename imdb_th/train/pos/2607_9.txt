The last episode of the season sent mixed messages. I felt the joy and the feeling of being lied to and deceived. Rosanne told all viewers that the nine seasons were a lie because Dan, her husband, died. She also admits that the family has never received a lottery prize and the 9th season is a lie about what she wants or wants. I'm still confused about when she says that Becky ends up with David and Darlene and Mark because Becky and Mark agree that they are pregnant. So I believe that's just the way you want it to be, but it's not so the end of the season is so good. But sent a variety of feelings I will always be a fan of the program :)
