This movie has an interesting actor. It doesn't have a list of actors. But the actors in this movie did very well. I'm glad we have this grade b movie. This is the basic story that the actors have the basics and the way they perform. You don't have to spend a million dollars to create a movie that combines ordinary actors. Basically, I like the way they have roads for themselves and no one is around and what I think is interesting is that they don't close the cafe to prepare equipment and He's done everything from police stations and Arnold vosloo Michael madsen done a good job in an acting role in a hostage situation. This is a great movie and I hope to see more in the near future.
