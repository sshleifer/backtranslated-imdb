This is a good movie, a good family movie to watch if you don't have anything to do. If you expect this movie to be a verbatim from the book, you will be very disappointed. I'm quite disappointed because I read a few times when I was in elementary school. <br /> <br /> This is about a new kid in town named Billy. He bet on the school bully and betting is not like most bets. Billy must eat 10 worms in one day or the bully wins. <br /> <br /> The performance is ok. Maybe the worst part of the movie. Actors, children are beyond the truth. In many ways, they think it is a revelation if Billy doesn't eat worms. Although Hallie Eisenberg did a great job, <br /> <br /> that plot line. Good like a movie I can watch this movie without having to watch the time .... Sometimes <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a good family movie that has some weaknesses. I rate this movie 7/10
