I can't wait to read about Fred Astaire. Collaborating with George Burns & Gracie Allen in the movie written by P.G Wodehouse and music by Gershwins is worth watching. But lacking the quality of the film Fred & Ginger <br /> <br /> The story may be better than reading in the Wodehouse book. Some performances are very painful to watch. (Especially young men and women) <br /> <br /> But ...! Dance in the theater is more valuable than most movies. I never knew that Gracie Allen could dance. But boys do in this movie Have you ever tried to stand on one of those rotating discs in the funhouse? Imagine tapdancing one of the high heels! She followed miraculously with Astaire and increased the overall picture quality. <br /> <br /> Many good songs, especially fun, are nice work if you can and Upper Lip Stiff <br /> <br / > Recommended for fans of Astaire, Burns & Allen. I had to go back and watch the dance in the theater as soon as the credit rolled.
