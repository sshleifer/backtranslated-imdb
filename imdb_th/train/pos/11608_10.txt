This is a great movie. From reading other reviews, I can see that I am not the only one who shed tears. Tamilyn Tomita is shown with such skills and confidence. In the hands of a few actors, her final scene would seem repetitive and repetitive. No one can guess that this movie is made with limited budget and limited. The movie is handsome and there are many big name actors. The script is great. I can see why they want to be there. If you watch a long and long credit list at the end, you'll see that half of Hawaii is spiked to make this movie happen. the movie "My only complaint" is that I almost don't want the movie to end.
