Thats My Bush is the first of many entertaining performances by Parker and Stone. I think it is often very funny and it's quite subversive and crazy. South Park fans will get something here. <br /> < br /> Another surprise is the production value here. A lot of money must be put into this and it shows. Many small details that are expensive. It's not a small show and Comedy Central is not the perfect channel. But they clearly entered this list In the way I understand that it is the death of the program as well. But it is too expensive Of course, it can be cheaper and go there. <br /> <br /> Critics like it and it has a little fan base. But it can't attract a large audience As we know, the program stopped after 8 episodes, which I think almost 1 season. <br /> <br /> When I like acting, it has errors. The problem of acting is that it doesn't really know what it wants. It seems to be trying to be a sitcom and sit down at the same time Actors perform well and some people are good actors. But in my opinion, they don't seem to get 100% of the strange humor that they should present. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think the program needs some characters to look down. More soil In South Park, you have Kyle and Stan, which is a true touch in a wonderful universe. I think that's what makes South Park work. You need a conscious character that you can relate to in a realistic way and that makes things more interesting as well because it forces you to take it seriously at some level. If everything is structured and structured, it is difficult to be included in the mood, which is the biggest problem of Thats. My Bush Kyle and Stan are characters in South Park that show insanity in the show We have nothing like that here and this performance suffers from it. <br /> <br /> Another anchor point is Parker and Stone, flirting with the Republican party. It's the only thing about them. I'm not what they're trying to do. Did not show that Bush was anything other than Homer Simpson's cute character, a cute character in the world that many people could not bear him So it makes him feel every movement ... but it's hard to understand what Parker and Stone really mean. It's like a joke that is with us. In any way, it was not marked. It seems to be awkward because it doesn't remind you about the true bush. <br /> <br /> Besides that, I think the show is really fun. Some of the jokes here are hilarious. Supporters who are aborted fetuses may be one of my favorite jokes on any list. And the show is full of good material and sometimes very funny if you use your brain a little while watching it
