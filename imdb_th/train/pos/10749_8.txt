I rented this thing with my son who just found interest in 9/11. He was a kindergarten boy at that time and didn't know what was being published. I like the way it is said to be "documentary." If there is a movie that I would like to suggest about 9/11, this is the movie! Usually you will see this movie with well-known actors. This movie is not known. You also see movies about 9/11. You hear about firefighters or two people who lost their lives to save lives. I don't feel like it has anything! I only rent this movie and will consider adding it to my collection! Really good! My heart goes out to survivors and families of victims of 9/11!
