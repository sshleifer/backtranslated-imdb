A wonderful example of the Busby Berkeley musical drama that was created in the early 1930s. The audience was very surprised to see James Cagney in this type of vehicle. Quite different from "Public Enemy" 2 years ago. Cagney adds sparkle and interest to the story and storyline. But the highlight of this movie is the production of all 3 numbers back and forth. First, with the conservative "Honeymoon Hotel" number, then followed by a spectacular sequence "By A Waterfall" followed by a sequence of "Shanghai Lil" Cagney participated in the last number on the bar. Counter with Ruby Keeler. "Shanghai Lil" number with Cagney is great, but it is a comedown & anti-climactic after an incredible and exciting mind-boggling dance by "By A Waterfall". The number "Shanghai Lil" is in the middle & closed with "By A Waterfall" which will blow the other 2 numbers out of the water to speak and in my best view of the three numbers Three production numbers, the cake on the cold and the performance of James Cagney, adding to the cake. Outstanding musical achievements, 4-star movies, top-quality theater plays, worth watching, you won't be disappointed !!!!!!!!!
