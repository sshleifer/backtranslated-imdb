My first fassbinder was a wonderful experience. Movies and alternative theaters (A small hall with uncomfortable seats, people have to wait while the film rolls change) is the perfect match Found that they were really fun The sound is excellent. (Sometimes more loud than dialogue) <br /> <br /> Everything seems to be in the right place. And I like the way the post-war presentation is really fun! <br /> <br />
