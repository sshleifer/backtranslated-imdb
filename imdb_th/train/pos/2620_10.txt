Surprisingly: Disney DTV sequels (straight to the video) are really good. "The Lion King 1 1/2" is a joke that deals with Mircat and those who like Warthog, Timon and Pumbaa Begin by watching the original movie and commenting until Timon complains, "We haven't come here yet." Timon and Pumba decided to tell the audience about their story. They started making new movies and laughing. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I lost hope in Disney. Most of the direct fare to their videos is very scary, with stories that are desperate to cash in the original "1 1/2". Decide to try different things: it tells the original story from a new perspective. OK, add something like Timon comes from and the way he and Pumbaa find it, but it's an interesting concept. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella remember the friendship and perfect friendship that made us love them in the first movie. There are also exquisite parody movies. (Including the only scene that imitates 'Good, Bad and Ugly' and 'Cool Hand Luke at the same time') and the script is full of strange memorable characters "The Simpsons") as Timon's wary-hearted wart and Jerry Stiller as Tim Uncle Max's Timon Matthew Broderick appeared as Simba and his "teen" scene. Making me think of Ferris Bueller. Everyone is doing well, especially Robert Guillame (that's how you spell it or As Rafiki, the exudes Yoda spoke more in this movie (Timon commented on this many times) <br /> <br /> 'The Lion King 1 1/2' is the perfect choice for Those who are tired of Shrek's movement 10/10
