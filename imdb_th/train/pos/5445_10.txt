I saw this movie ten years ago and I think it's really funny. It's not as bad as some critics make it possible. The fact that it was written by John Hughes is reliable, often shows that at least you can expect a funny conversation. (By the way I thought it was strange, rather good science, which was written at lightning speed by Hughes) <br /> <br /> The film looks very elegant, using all the main colors - red, yellow. Etc. - which makes it look unique The actors are quite good. The rude Bunny Packard and Delores Salk with the evil are outstanding. <br /> <br /> The film is a little dated.
