"The Thief of Bagdad" is impressive in the form of magician Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). He plans with lies and magic spells to take the kingdom from the king, the correct ruler of King Ahmad and the beautiful princess from the father. Her ... <br /> <br /> He eventually falls victim to all the tyranny (in books and legends) that will love and from the general people he doesn't care about. This is embodied by a little thief ( Sabu) <br /> <br /> Army of Kwai Good and evil, black and white are well known. Visible terms and literature ... <br /> <br /> The poem is simple and very beautiful ... The magician's costume and his people sprang up and fell like the wings of a black bird. Suddenly attacked at night To create destruction and terror ... <br /> <br /> A hero wearing a white dress and a turban and his princess dressed in pink and blues ... <br /> <br /> For a beautiful scene It fits well with everything that has passed, while the use of color makes the world lively like never before ... <br /> <br /> With flying carpets and white horses flying. With the giant devil (played by Rex Ingram, superbly) with evil sorcerers and with the good performances of Sabu and Veidt "The Thief of Bagdad" brings together the true quality and atmosphere of the Arabian Nights ... <br /> The 1940 version is still the best fairy tale of the screen!
