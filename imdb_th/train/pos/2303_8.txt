THE MAN IN THE MOON is a warm and lively drama drama centered on a farming family in the 1950s. The main story follows the 14 year old girl (Reese Witherspoon) who develops a passion for neighbors. 17 years old (Jason London) who falls in love with her sister (Emily Warfield) and the unexpected tragedy that caused this family to change forever. 1950, there is a love show here, and the screenplay will give the character that you are interested almost immediately. Witherspoon began to show the talent that won the Academy Award, and she will develop in this first role and London is a charming leader. Warfield lends a powerful role to his sister. Also admiring Sam Waterston and Tess Harper, who plays the parents of girls and Gail Strickland, the mother of London players. I was unexpectedly impressed by the quietness and the dramatic impact of the intense emotion and the deeper meaning of the phrase. "Family Relations"
