Solino moved me with a deeply drawn character. While being a simple matter of competition between the two brothers, it's not just about hatred or jealousy. What I like most about this movie is how I can identify the feelings that Gigi is experiencing, especially when he has to take his mother back to her hometown in Italy and miss out on the awards ceremony His film festival film Seeing this character who struggled hard during his artistic dreams and the feeling of duty to his mother was so frustrating. Even at the end when he tried again to contact his father, he was very brave. And in real life, most dad cannot pass through the wall to reach him. I can identify even with the older brother, Giancarlo, who is more self-confident and his brother has a lot of insecurity. A really beautiful movie that makes me laugh and cry.
