King Solomon's mining made us Patrick Patterson (Played Allan Quatermain) who spent most of his time in Africa But decided that it was time to return to England and become a father and son. He found that his wife's parents had taken care of his son, and that he had little chance of taking care of him with a large amount of money to prosecute Alison Deedy (playing Elizabeth). In Africa and captured by an African tribe for a ransom from the map, Elizabeth's father sent her. Elizabeth sought Quatermain to bring her back to Africa to find her father. <br /> > There are good characters that support the character Cor compatible with Quatermain and Elizabeth and that the enemy (Russia) to /> <br /> The film maps the attention <br your end. Patrick plays a handsome honorable man who comes to help the young woman in suffering again. Patrick is an excellent actor who can easily pass on love, loss and despair. The quiet man, anger and strength In the heart of King Solomon, his character smiled a few times. I wanted to see Patrick Swayze in a relaxed love story once again, which he didn't have to repeat his jaw and was very strong Maybe a little dance can help But this is a good movie for the whole family and worth the time to watch.
