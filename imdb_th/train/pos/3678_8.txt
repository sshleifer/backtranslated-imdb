It is a very good movie and I recommend it to everyone but there are 2 negative points: - The level of the story has a large frequency. Some scenes are great and some scenes are boring - many stories do not exist in themselves. (If you compare fe with coffee and cigarettes, each subject has a point, message, pearl or you want to call it) but the best, most stories are really good, some are Excellent and overall, it's one of the best movies of this year. <br /> <br /> Annoying that I have to fill in at least 10 lines. Analyzing a single sequence ... <br /> <br /> Well, I think it!
