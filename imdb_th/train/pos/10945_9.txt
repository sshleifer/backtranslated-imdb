The best performance since Seinfeld. She's really funny. It's all about being centered on herself. A cheerful gay stoner. Getting out to music or cartoons makes this program the freshest on TV. One of the few items I have pointed out. Scene with a wise old black woman in a pharmacy ("Oh, wait a minute. You are near you. Look old." Facing your finger and walking away. Haha.) Syrup. Silly. It's very fun. The weakness shown is her sister and the police alone because they are too normal !! I can't wait until the next show, something I didn't feel for any performances in a long time.
