I can't believe that people are looking for the story in this movie. This is Laural and Hardy is lighter. Both are riots. Their comic genius is as funny today as 70 years ago. It's not a dirty word from both mouths and they can make the audience in the wound Their jokes are not complicated by any stretch. If the Whoopee cushion cannot make you smile, there is no reason to see what they do. It's an easier time and people laugh at funny things without having to plan. I think it's easy to enjoy this, so I passed the certification. Two comedians aren't calculated, we are just too complicated ... can't we be lucky?
