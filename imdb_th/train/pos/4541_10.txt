I saw this movie on cable. It's really funny. Since the police chief is dead to the big villain, Jay Lono and Mr. Mayaki from the karate child actor in this comedy about a prototype car I compared this movie to "RUSH HOUR", where local police must cooperate with the Asian police to solve the case. Chase through the farmers market in Detroit. Bring memories back. Fun soundtrack, great script. I give 10/10.
