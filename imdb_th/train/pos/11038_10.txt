I was hooked from beginning to end. The terrifying horror comes from an image that creates nuisance and organic bumps created to prevent you from jumping. But for you to go "What do I see f * ck?" Other critics give a brief summary of what the film is about, so I won't repeat what I said. I told others about this movie after the day I saw it just because it still haunts me. I still have a bad dream after seeing it and I'm a really awesome fan, not being spelled with rags like "Grudge" or even "Silent Hill". What makes me a nightmare is the uneasiness that I feel about what I will do if I am in the cell with those people. What will my personal horror be? My subconscious took me there and it was not satisfactory. That my friend is a great horror flick thing done to you! The best part of this movie is it's subtle. It's not about the Bogeymen that jump out to you, the invasion of aliens or many blood. It's the opposite The horror that you created in your own heart The irony of the four characters is horror, not from external forces that confirm that it has power over them. Just the men asked for one thing they wanted and they received ... but not the way they thought. On the other side, they get what they want from a mysterious book. But in the end they may not want Sometimes being trapped in a cell is the best place!
