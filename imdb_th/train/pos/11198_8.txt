Hitchcock expressed the understanding he had developed for images in the early silent films. The story of this film involves two boxers who fight with girls, a drama that doesn't need much guidance. Although Hitchcock's talents are found in his pictures Almost every shot is filled with symbols. What is especially memorable is the jewelry that a boxer gave to a woman before she married another boxer. He moved her arms up clearly and sexually and with just one simple movement, Hitch showed us everything we needed to know. The boxing scene is well managed with an interesting perspective, which once again proves that he has spent a long time. The film also provides in-depth information about caring for women at a later time. The desire of boxers is driven by money and sexual desire, not reason or love. The only woman in this movie is a beautiful party girl who is open to proposals for sex or an elderly group that helps destroy happy relationships. Overall, the ring is a must for anyone interested in Hitchcock's early work and his development as a storyteller with pictures.
