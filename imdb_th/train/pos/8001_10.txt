Of course, it's one of the best movies I've seen for a while. Beautiful directions and impeccable performances make this movie fun and moving very often. Denzel Washington plays one of his most attractive and emotional roles, and the rest of the actors are beautifully rendered. Of course, Christopher Walken is great in his part, though he doesn't appear as often as I Will like The story of the highest level of greed that has been offset by the innocence and love of children. This is a movie for action movie lovers because it has a fair share of ammunition, rockets and revenge. The location of Mexico City makes sense of fading and corruption. In conclusion, it is a charming movie from beginning to end. Highly recommended!
