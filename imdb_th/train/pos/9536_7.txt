Japanese movies that are boring and scary about little creatures, bring people and turn them into zombies like machines that are overpowering and hacking so that the winner will eat the loser. In the middle of this couple, there are infected couples. <br /> <br /> Great technical horror film (?) Is for people with stomach pain due to blood and body parts flying. Good taste makes me unable to explain what happened here. But say that it is scary If you like this with a multi-step format, above all the slender content means that watching this movie. Personally, I'm not the only one who can enjoy movies like this in everything. Here I am amazed enough to recommend to people I know know who likes movies that are full of blood .. It is a movie with enough detail that I want to watch again since now that I know. What happened Revealed at the end - I want to go back and see what I didn't do. There are rare internal logic in these movies. <br /> <br /> 7ish from 10 for those who like blood and limbs that are cut to zero or more accurate than running and hiding warnings for others.
