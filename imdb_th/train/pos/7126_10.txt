This movie resonates with me on two levels. As a child, I was evacuated from London and planted a reluctant family in a rural village. While I escaped the bombing and had experience creating precious memories (For example, hearing the nightingale singing for the first night of darkness) and enjoying the life that I never had in London. I miss my family. Tom is an old man whose wife and children died and lived alone in a small rural village. As an old man who now doesn't have a wife whose children have been married and live far from another province, I'm lonely again. The boy is a religious fanatic with a strange idea of ​​raising children. Due to the ever-growing love between Tom Oakley and the old boy, Tom went to search for him and eventually saved him from strange and dangerous situations. At the end of the story, there is a great tension due to the rule of bureaucracy. It seems that the child loses someone who has developed a love relationship with him.
