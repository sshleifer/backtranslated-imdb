I just watched the detention last night and I like what I see. It's a fun and cool movie that looks very good on a motorcycle. He looks good in this movie compared to his latest movie. He's in good condition now. The story is ok and other actors can pass. I won't call this movie the best. But still a good movie. <br /> <br /> But there is a problem. The first one is the bullet that flies everywhere, and even if they are fired at the point of blank they miss the target, they should show that the ppl has escaped the bullet in a better way. Another problem I have is the way students swear. I do not know which school where students can swear in front of teachers and even in the classroom. The third problem is that there are very few bad people. Should have more bad guys The last problem is the fact that the set looks magical. But that's because of the small budget Overall, this movie is a good movie. I enjoy it. I would like to recommend others to see PS. Now DEAD Beat Cop (Some One-liners are cool too) <br /> <br />
