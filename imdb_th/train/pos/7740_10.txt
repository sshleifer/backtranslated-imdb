It is difficult to create an impeccable movie like this. It is one of the best structured movies that I have ever seen. Every line of dialogue can be interpreted in a variety of ways, involving three different main characters. Films, interwoven with the motives and the two-tiered cross attached to you and refused to release. Add to that the slow burning romance between Kevin and Faye will move into something ever committed to celluloid and you have a mixture of movies. It demonstrates the romance of movies such as "Titanic" as repetitive. If you are looking for a movie to watch while you are washing You have to bind yourself to this movie. You can't chat while running in and out of the room. This movie needs your attention. Treat it with the respect you deserve and you will receive many benefits. If you don't think "Titanic" is the greatest movie ever.
