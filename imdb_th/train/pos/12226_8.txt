This is the movie created for the best TV ever! I'm talking about this because I'm a huge Silverstone fan? Some, but even without you, I still see it. I am a big fan of serial killer movies and believe that this will be a great item in that category. In addition, Mary Giordano is also easily ranked among the top five characters of Alicia. Completely memorable - like she actually exists. I will have you beside me if there is a mystery that needs to be solved. She plays the character like her real life with confidence in everything she does. Seems to be a faithful and honest person ... like she is in real life What is that show? Yes, she is rebellious again. This time, she's not bad. She's too good and afraid to do things that seem beyond the law. But she does not do things that teenagers generally do She spent time reading Mac Detective and fixing crime. Many bored words: She is the revenge of the death of his father in a different way from the vigilante style. At that time, Alicia seems to be playing the same character: rebel, seductive, without a single parent. This happens here as well. But she is quite stupid at this time. It doesn't matter. She's still cool like a fool. Try it out soon, otherwise Giordano will investigate why you can't ...
