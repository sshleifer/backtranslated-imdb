I teach Japanese to an online high school and I have integrated cultural activities so that students can learn about countries and languages ​​and watching "Gung Ho" is one of the requirements. Students can buy or rent movies. Does this pattern help students see how others see the world and their lives different from what we do? Many of my students tell me that they enjoy a lot of movies. They will get a copy for themselves. It is a very interesting story to see how we focus on this culture and how to value those cultures. I just hope I can get a clean TV version. I don't really use vulgar language that car workers use all the time.
