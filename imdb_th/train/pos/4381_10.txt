This drama has everything: great performances, incredible photography, good stories. It is often compared to "Braveheart" because both films originated in Scottish history. Although I love Braveheart, but I think this is a better movie in two stories. Jessica has incredible results. (Should be nominated for an Academy Award) Liam Neeson is a great person in the role of the game. Tim Roth plays one of the most nasty evil characters in film history. (He was nominated for an Oscar) John Hertz is excellent as Lord Montrose. I was amazed by the many amazing characters that John Hurt can play. This is the story of the money conflict between Rob Roy and his family and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a self-made person who will not solve his problems with Montrose if it violates his honor. Montrose, who has inherited his position, has no sense of honor. And that's what this story is about The honor of the general people compared to the noble corruption This movie is very entertaining. It's attractive for everyone. It has a romantic action, beautiful scenery and an exciting plot. One of my favorite movies
