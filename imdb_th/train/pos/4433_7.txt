Subject: At Texas Island, photographer Bob, who photographed the magazine, met Kathleen, a mysterious, independent spirit and desire in life. Bob, who had experienced a very traumatic recently Her life is not as easy as imagined through Kathleen. Bob is involved in a dangerous network. Can Kathleen win his trust? <br /> <br /> Review: Dialogue in the movie. This is a very natural subject. Psychology 'will get a little more work out. Why do these people do what they do? What is their inspiration for choosing? This is what gives the depth of the movie and what to think about in my view. The story never reached an emotional climax even though the character had passed enough to prove that So you won't get to know the character at a deeper level The actors present good works and play naturally and 'believe', but I think it will be better for movies if Kathleen was played by a younger actress because of the innocence of This character, a woman on camera, works well and has some wonderful pictures of nature on the island. I gave the movie 7/10
