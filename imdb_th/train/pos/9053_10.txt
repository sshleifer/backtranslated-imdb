1.) This movie is great! I watched it while I was in the city next to where he grew! I went to see the buildings that the story happened. Overall, I like this movie, one of the most Jake Gyllenhaal !! My favorite part is science work and all the time with his father. They are very sad. Homer wants to follow his dreams and his father doesn't seem to care about any way. The tag line is true. "Sometimes a dream is bright enough to make the sky bright Their slang too Definitely recommend this movie!
