I was in a bad frame when I saw this movie for the first time. For some reason, it clicks on every level of family tension, loneliness and someone's needs to share your life as well. It doesn't hurt that someone will share your life with a beautiful girl like Claire. (Cindy Preston) I also bought audio tracks for this movie (very rare). Love and hope that someday it will come out on the DV.
