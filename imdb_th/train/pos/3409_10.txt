North Africa in the 1930s to a small Arab town on the edge of the Sahara came to a beautiful woman looking for the meaning of her life & handsome King Trappist cast away from his faith crisis. They will find and attention will be stimulated. But not even the Sand Diviner who knows that they will find happiness or sadness here in the Garden of Allah. <br /> <br /> The story is pure Hokuto But this movie is still fun & beautiful. Marlene Dietrich & Charles Boyer is a great lover. She is a simple, beautiful person and Boyer gives the most effective acting and makes his delicate face to be able to act as a substitute for him. <br /> <br /> The supporting actors are great: Basil Rathbone, in a sympathetic role as the Desert Love Count. Joseph Schildkraut is a friendly and talkative guide (everyone "Arab" that he and others say in this film is nonsense); Lucile Watson as a gentle Mother Superior Alan Marshal plays the honorable French soldier. Tilly Losch is a dangerous dancer. Henry Brandon, like the staff of Hairy Cartoons; John Carradine is a mysterious sandboxer And Sir Catherine Aubrey Smith as a wise priest. <br /> <br /> Movie actors will remember Helen Jerome, Eddie as Nun, Marcia Mae Jones and Bonita Granville (overlooked Nun's shoulder) as a girl convent; Emaciated Nigel De Brulier, who acted as a monastery and Ferdinand Gottschalk as a hotel clerk. Not everyone was checked. <br /> <br /> The color film of the 1930s was both hard and cute and the film This is no exception - the movie is colorful like the desert. THE GARDEN OF ALLAH is a Technicolor movie. The first story that was filmed in place. Yuma, Arizona, gave the film makers all the dunes they wanted. But contaminated drinking water and 135 degrees of heat soon made the company a revolution When the daily run shows that Boyer's face was burned as a bright red tomato, producer David Osselenick finally gave up. The rest of the movie was shot on the Hollywood sound stage. Leewood
