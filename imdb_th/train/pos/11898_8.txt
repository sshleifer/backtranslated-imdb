This film is the perfect picture of The Nutcracker; The dance is excellent. The scenery in the background is great and I love bed dancing. <br /> <br /> Oh and the costumes ... I love Marzipan. Special effects are very good. (Such as trees, beds, etc.) and I am happy with the rat I like that they don't make them scary. But cute and cuddly Except the king, I think <br /> <br /> If you are a humble person, you won't have fun. But this is a very good movie that is good for all ages - not all levels of Testosterone <br /> <br /> But I have a little complaint. <br /> <br /> At first, why do they have to put a partner of Sugar Plum Fairy in those poor stockings? It's almost impossible to make a difference if he is naked! And secondly .. Why does EARTH cause them to do Culkin's pink dress?
