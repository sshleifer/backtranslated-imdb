Rudy did it again with the heat from the road that came to Dolemite. This list is full of Rudy Ray Moore's needs, roar, humor and martial arts. Rudy avoids the crazy red-necked sheriff in this film, which has a shameful scene where Rudy jumps into the steep hill. Can be seen from laughter and the impact of magic Blaxploitation
