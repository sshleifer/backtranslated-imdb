This is a special Christmas favorite that I hope they will release on vhs or dvd because my 33 RPM is lost and any tape I made is gone for a long time. <br /> <br /> I'm not John. The fans of Denver, however, were very impressed with the song, which is mostly a traditional favorite song with a muppet (esp Little St. Nick!). There is also a little known song (traditional). > <br /> Although it was created in the challenge Of the 70 items with a timeless feel. Hope to receive a copy soon !!!
