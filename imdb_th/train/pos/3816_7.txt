"Secret Sunshine" reminds me of "The Rapture" (1991) with Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny, but this Korean production is a better movie. It represents the Korean Christians who are religious in Korea in the provinces and the experience of the main characters interacting with them after a terrible personal tragedy. Shin-ae is a widowed mother who moved to Milyang ('Secret Sunshine' in Chinese) from Seoul, along with her little son. She chose Milyang because of her late husband. (Died of a car accident) was born there and she felt that she wanted to start a new life in a new place She did not respond to any of the local Christian enthusiasm which one member tried to convince her to come to the church and the prayer meeting. Shin-ae had no major offense and politely eliminated these people. As far as possible In fact, she dealt with everyone in Milyang to start. But some people try to stand up to invade her world and the consequences are often funny. Speaking more than that is to give the film away. But it should be noted that the acting of women in the leading role (Jeon Do-Yeon) is amazing. After reading that she received the Best Actress Award in Cannes in 2007, I expect her to work well. But Jon is fascinated and impossible to take his eyes off when she is on the screen. This film is a harrowing masterpiece of Evelyn Waugh-esquire. Shows that fate can feel as crazy as possible
