Disney has done it again. The wonderful ways of Timone and Pumbaa come to life again to tell us that they meet and help the lion when he needs them. I love this movie and watch it over and over again It shows that Timone lives with his family and friends, Meir Kat, before traveling to find his dream home and adventure. Then he found a madman and things changed. They repeatedly searched for the house that Timon wanted and failed, which was a joke when Timone became increasingly mad His more than we did in the previous two movies The rest you already know.
