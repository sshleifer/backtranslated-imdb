HOLES is not Disney on average - it's a lot of fun. Even adults who are cringe in the design-oriented group. "Family Entertainment" focused on the group at Uncle Walt's studio through live performances. Perhaps the secret of the success of this movie is the integrity of this book, which is slightly darker than that of ordinary children. The action began when Stanley Yelnat was sent to the boy's concentration camp, where all prisoners were forced to dig a hole under the desert desert to form a ban. But as the story progresses, Stanley's tales combine with legendary treasures and this adventure will be ten times more fun than Disney movies about concentration camps. Every boy has the right to be Jon Voight. Special colors and Sigourney Weaver are as beautiful as ever.
