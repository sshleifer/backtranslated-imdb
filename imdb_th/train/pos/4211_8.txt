I watched it tonight on TV (HBO). I have to admit that the tension in this film is not comparable to most other FN-era movies. I like the way the Chip is calm for a while, and then VIOLENT at times. Next, it's classic. Ah, yes. The villians, cigars and police are sluggish! It has everything This film delivers all the products to me. I like the way in which they blend communism with a common plot for this film era. Very courageous because blacklisting was popular in those days. I rate this movie, one of the best things I've seen in the FN category!
