Very good movie, classic sci-fi movie with humor, action and everything. This film offers many aliens. We see many Rebel Alliance leaders and imperial forces. The emperor is quite a traditional character. I like Ewoks that represent native forests and Vietnamese people. (Great reference) I like fighting between Vader and Luke, which is the best fairy tale. In the return of Jedi, the end of the first trilogy ends and the empire finally falls. I also admired the celebration of victory, which fulfilled Vader's redemption and returned to the spirit of Anakin Sky Walker along with Yoda and Obawan. It gives sadness and tears. The greatest scene in Star Wars is one of the movies: when Vader opens the emperor Luke watched and felt comfortable when seeing Obawan Yoda and ... his father (1997 edition, not Hayden Christensen). The next best scene was when Luke ran back to Darth Vader to protect Leia There is a deep dark side of this film, even with a good ending. I feel that there is nothing more than eye contact. As always, John William's songs will bring the classic into the Star Wars universe.
