Dog day is one of the most accurate movies I've ever seen. Explain modern city life. It's very cruel and cruel at some point and sadly it's very close to reality. Separation, desperation, deep emotional death, problems with problems, distortions, complexes, insanity, everything that exists in the big city. That is currently advancing It makes you aware of the poor condition that people have brought to society again. <br /> <br /> The negative side of city life has never seen images on the screen correctly. I just hope it will be a lie. Unfortunately it's not so ... 10/10
