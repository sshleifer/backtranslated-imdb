John Waters created the most lively movie, anxious, dark, dark. Personally, I thought I had seen (probably the Fast Fast Fast Food Woman approached in seconds). The director's vision Not pure ... is a personal and strange reflection of his family and inner life ... a voice that has never been forced or exaggerated. Quirky <br /> <br /> There is no shock design at Terrifying Ennui Or magazine ratings .... Plimpton is wonderful while the sister .. Eddie furlong is the inspiration for casting. Grandmother and Mary, who talked about yesterday's tea bags, waste recycling clothes, became a work of art today and the lesson of this film is that the most important thing that we value is family ... And a humble life
