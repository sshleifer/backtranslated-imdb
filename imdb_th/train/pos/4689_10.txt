I fully agree with the comments until now. I remember that this documentary is one of the most amazing and informative things I've ever seen. As stated earlier, I remembered that I began to see that it was just another natural study - interesting, not necessarily special, but I was wrong. Not only was the story of the colony amazing But I still remember that music is a part of attractiveness. If I remember correctly, it was a Native Americn pipe (similar to the song at the end of One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest). I was looking for a copy. This needs to be watched for everyone, especially schools. It should be released again.
