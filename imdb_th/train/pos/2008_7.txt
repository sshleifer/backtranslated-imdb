Original Vampires (1998) is one of my favorites. I want to know how the sequel will work when considering that they don't use the original characters. I am quite surprised at how to play this. As a rule, the sequel will not be as good as the original, with a few exceptions. Although this movie is not a great movie But the writer did well to maintain the main theme and vampire legend from the first film in the story. Jon Bon Jovi is a disadvantage at first. But he proved to be a famous killer I wonder if anyone can make James Wood's performance the first place, though ... unless you bring Buffy. <br /> <br /> This is a good watch. & I'll see again> < br /> I was left with two questions, though ... What happened to Jack Crowe and Derek Bliss as a murderer? Guess that we must let the imagination
