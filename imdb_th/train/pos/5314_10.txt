I saw this movie for the first time at the Sundance Film Festival this year and as a teenager myself. I found this movie quite interesting. These kids are very unusual and unexpected to be shown in this movie. But with the correct dialogue and garbage, they made this movie completely successful. I like this movie more than others, but I recommend letting go and watch this movie. It is a mixture of hilarious opinions and hilarious reality. The recording of the core of a high school, a record of a high school, is above my favorites and hope to have the opportunity to screen in theaters. I thank all the children who are working hard to create this movie. It helped me cry in our eyes.
