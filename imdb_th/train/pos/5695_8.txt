Some movies can survive with originality alone - "Wonderland" is one of those movies. The script manages to throw everything into the field with high fever. But do not make it incoherent The speed of this thriller does not choose to cover up the weak chapter. But to reflect on the drug-addicted reality <br /> <br /> As director James Cox is a very strange way to work with his actors. Most characters are always on the edge and often because they have a rather ugly personality. Val Kilmer explained that John Holmes is a businessman able to manage and control. No fault for Kilmer But his Holmes version seems to be able to control the weak mind only severely. However, it is an amazing performance. Compare this with Kilmer's 'Hollywood' role more than in "The St". It seems to prove that he is at home more in a witty indie flick <br /> < br /> Actors are the main force There are many small performances that are particularly notable for women, Carrie Fisher, Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudrow. Everyone has time limits on the screen next to their male counterparts. But all of them are excellent. In addition to Kilmer, Ted Levine and Dylan McDermott provide strange and amazing energy for their role. <br /> <br /> At first I stopped watching "Wonderland" because I thought it was a movie. About porn actors. Feeling yes. The story revolves around John Holmes. But nothing related to his career Essentially, this movie is a murder mystery and so - it's wonderful. <br /> <br /> Score: 7.5 out of 10.
