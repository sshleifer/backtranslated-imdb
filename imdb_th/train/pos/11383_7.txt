This is a musical that has a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and the 'Parisien' atmosphere that gives the movie a lot of charm. But in terms of the story .. it doesn't really have Or at least not working The show was not smooth by Caron, but I liked the dialogue in some scenes. I liked the scene at Seine. I liked the characters played by Levant in color; And of course the beautiful dance, <br /> <br /> 7.5 - 8 seems to be my point
