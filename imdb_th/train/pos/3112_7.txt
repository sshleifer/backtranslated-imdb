I watched both the Bourne Identity and the Bourne Supremacy on the DVD before seeing this in the cinema. I've been waiting for this thing before they started filming. I am not disappointed. <br /> <br /> A little spoiler below - <br /> <br /> Overall, it's good. But it lacks the continuity of the first two The identity and supremacy both flow gracefully between adrenaline action and retro drama. This movie sometimes feels lacking. The plot of creating downs is pulled out too little. That makes the following actions make us feel energetic. <br /> <br /> Camera: talking about the crazy greengrass camera shake. The trademark appears and is annoying for me. I know that it has been talked / lamented about nausea on the message board. But that doesn't mean it's not relevant The training of all martial arts that the actors passed was totally wasteful. Ridiculous camera cuts and wagging cameras destroy most of the battles in the movie. It is the right way and being directed by students to make the movie feel insecure. I expect that those techniques will be used in the horror flick created for high school kids. But not in a good action series for adults Too close shots make some frames to get interesting images. Continuous close-ups feel like being lazy. Bring it to me. <br /> <br /> Story: The story begins to be confused at first. They push new names and face you from the beginning. Makes me feel that you will get when you come into the movie slowly and know that you miss some important information Feel hurried or compressed for time reasons After you follow it, the story is quite good. It's fun to be a leader along with Bond. However, I don't care about the final scene of the Supremacy (Landy / Bourne by phone) in the middle of the Ultimatum. Basically, it makes the movie half a prequel. I think it's awkward. <br /> <br /> Actors / characters: Film stars are action. Obviously there are only two remaining manuscripts, Bourne and Nicky Parsons. The combination is a strange thing for me. I think they just want Bond with someone to protect and trust, unless I miss something. They never tell you why they collaborate. Other killers in the movie are quiet. This feels like Gilroy / Greengrass / those who do not want to leave to understand, but seriously disappointing. Damon with Clive Owen in the Identity and Marton Csokas in the Supremacy .. Those scenes are phenomenal These killers are not as interesting as Castel (fella Bourne, the first person to fight with himself). The general performers are reduced when the series continues. Clive Owen is true later That is a measure of strength for the first actor. Second, they basically exchange Chris Cooper and Joan Allen ... not equal. This person exchanges Brian Cox and Franka Potente for 3 actors who will be named later. Nothing compared to David Strathairn, Scott Glenn or Albert Finney, but they were not the first to think of this series. In addition to pauses that seem to be long, the show is correct. <br /> <br /> Overall successful. Feels like they want to get the series too If they cut or rearrange parts that are slower than new, eliminate all Scott Glenn's parts, zoom out and take the camera away from the victim. The arrest will be perfect. <br /> <br /> Spoiler <br /> <br /> I don't see why they are alive at the end. It is my understanding. This is the conclusion. They clearly refer to the beginning of the series with his silhouettes that are still motionless. I think it will be like that. A complete ending type circle. I like Nicky who responds to news reports. <br /> <br /> Specifications Spoiler Warning - Quotations from the movie below - <br /> <br /> The last line of Bourne at the end "Look here .. Look at .. what they get you to get" from the first killer he killed. I love that thing. The final scene is great. (Except that it was Vosen {Strathairn} who shot Bourne. Why did he do that, just take revenge if he was angry enough to kill, why not shoot Pamela Landy after she sent his top secret file? Make sense)
