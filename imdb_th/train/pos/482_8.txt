This is a poem on film, presented and photographed with wonderfully delicate art. It captures the atmosphere of time and place perfectly. (The lake area of ​​Italy in the twenties.) It is a love story with a twist. The characters are unique and believable. The setting of some exotic dainty scenes - the funeral boat in the mist - the chess table with long patterns in the middle of the tile floor with elaborate patterns. And instead of ending happily forcing this story with bitter sweetness If the movie is an art, this thing is close to the masterpiece. <br /> <br />
