If you want the pain of an intense laugh, watch this movie and what Bruce did with his newsreader. The deleted scenes have no value. I don't know why they don't include them in the original movie. Can't do it because of the time since the movie is only 101 minutes long. Morgan Freeman is a great actor who has been overlooked for too long. Jim Carrey needs medicine!
