When I first watched, I found this story less annoying than Cannon Movie Tales. After many more, I think it is one of the best. Some songs are quite poor, especially love songs. But there are two outstanding things that make the movie even singing worthwhile One is the art direction. As with other storytelling of Cannon Movie, this is a beautiful decorative work. Every piece of cloth and gem (Both of which are important in the film's storyline) look new and new and intersect with the ordinary clothes of the farmer Even during the love song, I found myself studying the dress and the princess's hair was doing very well. Another story is the cartoon rhythm. This movie is a wonderful story. But the absurdity of the emperor (And makes him fun at the end) The suspicious defender, the guardian, Nicholas and the stupid prince are all funny and seem absurd.
