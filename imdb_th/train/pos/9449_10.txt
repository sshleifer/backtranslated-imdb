I watched this movie in a few hours in the morning when I should sleep. In itself is a testimony that liberation is a binding movie I think Bor has done a great job in directing this movie. How did the first scene that happened to the hill tribes and the stubborn banjos? It shows very well and how fast people in the area are reserved and simple. At the point - near the end of the "fight", banjo boys are smiling. (Love the banjo) But when Drew tries to hold the boy's hand after the "fight", the child is too reserved to answer. River trips never make you tired of course. Brutal rape scene But need to show that the resistance groups in the rainforest area of ​​Georgia I think Betty's wound after that was good. Some people say that he is not affected by the test. I do not agree - if you really pay attention, he does not respond during the entire operation immediately after Reynolds places the arrow through the attacker and they chase those who do not have teeth. It caused confusion when Ed killed another man at a later time at the top of the cliff. Almost appeared that the arrow was shot while Ed curled up and was expected to die. But then you know that the arrows that he had shot before have the final effect But after reading the message from the disgruntled voter who gave "1", I gave "10". The reason for this person seems to be more personal bias than to be a point of view with his purpose and vote clearly That is an unrelated attempt to reduce rank
