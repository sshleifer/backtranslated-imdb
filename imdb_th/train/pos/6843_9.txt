Director of writer Brian De Palma is well known for the film that was called quite unfairly "Hitchcock imitations".

(Performed by Angie Dickinson) and slow on the road (Played by Nancy Allen) <br /> <br /> Yes, it will remind you clearly from "Psycho", but De Palma's flick is just a creative, technical and creative idea that dark The order of the museum is scored and specially modified.
