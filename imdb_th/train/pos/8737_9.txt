During the crisis, people say that Antz is better than Antz. It's a good movie. But I enjoy Bug's Life a bit. I can't remember the Pixar animation, except the two Toy Story movies that I laughed so hard. The animation is clean, the story is original and not taught. The voice dubbing is what makes this movie. Dave Foley is a serious ant that makes himself very problematic. The jump is a great character by the great Kevin Spacey, as well as Haydn Panettiere as Dot. There are also Sterling sponsored by Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn. Excellent funny script and sometimes even touching It lacks Antz's social message, but what we have is strong entertainment. 9/10 Bethany Cox
