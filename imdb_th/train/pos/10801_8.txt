Actually, when I watched this movie many years ago, I wanted to close it immediately. While I was sitting there for about 10 minutes or so, I realized that the actor who played Navin stole the show. His facial expressions and funny gestures shook my head as though he wasn't in the comedies. The more he has this "Marty Feldman" that happened to him. But more capable ... don't have to go away from Marty How much did this movie shock me near the original Jerk, but then again, it was even more I think if this movie was first released and I saw the movie of Steve Martin, 2nd place, I think 2nd place is very cheap. I know it sounds like a BOLD statement, but it's true. I like Steve Martin very much. But his performance was 2nd against the actors in The Jerk Too. I hope I get a copy of it for my collection. I ask you to see if you can find it.
