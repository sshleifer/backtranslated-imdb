I saw this movie for the first time in the course of playing and playing at Tulane. I was shocked to see how beautiful and raw this documentary was. It is sincerity in the unresolved reality of the life of solitude. The family is an interesting thing and I think it shows Little Edie as her heart * I found that beauty comes from family disorders. Obviously, the relationship between mother and daughter is not able to work in society alone and you begin to desire to restore Little Edie to society. Overall, this film is beautiful and surprisingly beautiful Both thumbs walk up!
