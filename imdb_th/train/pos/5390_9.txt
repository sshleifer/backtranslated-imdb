Life Begins is an excellent pre-movie movie starring some of the best times. It is located in the ward of the hospital, especially in the room for women who are expected to have problems. There was an older woman, an unmarried mother (Glenda Farrell), a weak woman, an Italian woman and a main character (Loretta Young), who spent 20 years in prison to kill her husband (Eric Lin Den) is at the hospital every second to know that everything is okay. Aline MacMahone plays as a nurse who is good at her job. <br /> <br /> This movie is very interesting and fun. It was not very shocking, but it was interesting to see objects that were abandoned on the silver screen. The performance was great around me. Loretta is a beautiful girl here in her prime, where Eric Linden comes out and is as sincere as he can. His innocence reminds Michael J. Fox Glenda Farrell to be excellent. As always, the main material of the code in advance and for good reason.
