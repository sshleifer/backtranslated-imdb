As far as I like the big epic images - I'll keep your name well - it's great to come back with a few beers. Movies that plot to use the back seat for parts The movie that the dialogue was not written intelligently until it tied itself to the never ending prose. There are hundreds of films that are suitable for billing ... but in my opinion, Gone In Sixty Seconds is one of the better movies. <br /> <br /> It's a movie update that shares its name. It also shares the rock of that image. But it is not an act The wonderful thing about the manuscript has been improved. What has been improved is increased with more budgets. Often these attempts are a recipe for complete disaster - see the remake of the ugly pug of Italian work for those who bomb it - but here, thanks to the most talented actors, Sixty succeeds. <Br /> <br /> Most of the stories and conversations don't have much to write. IMDb is very often. You will have a scene where the same line of conversation goes back and forth between the actors. People will have different voices. Many people find this thing annoying. I found that it made me smile. Each actor is given the opportunity to express the meaning of his or her style here with Cage, Jolie and Duvall as leaders of the group. (And it should be noted that it was amusing to see Mrs Pitt not getting the first bill here) <br /> <br /> The villains aren't even scary - I've seen Chris Eccleston play a difficult role before, so I know he can handle them. But I think that he had been deliberately ordered to make his role unreasonable in order not to distract from the action. We know what heroes are going to be successful; We just sit in the car with them, enjoy the ride. I think most of these scenes are played with the tongue until the cheek until it passes through the heads of many people who give bad points. In fact, I didn't think of breaking the fourth wall at the camera: it was that kind of movie. <br /> <br /> All of this style and not much matter - things that often lose my patience if not Execute * only * so - will not have value if action is not there. And most of it is great. I noticed that it was a general trend to use quick shot shots to control. Personally, I feel that this thing is boring. I like movies like this that have to show enough impressions to not have to use the tension caused by the overcast shooting all the time. I was informed that Cage really did. Many cars had to break up with him without insurance. (In real life, I mean - his character doesn't care at all) and it shows This man was able to actually move the vehicle and this was well used in the last scene of a slow-burning climate in which he drove the Mustang to the ground in the most strange and fun land. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a big effort of the 9/11 post with compulsory social commentary. The rhythm is not uniform. Some scenes may be cut and not all actors are drawn. But the car movie is not better than this So if you hate cars ... why are you reading these comments too !! <br /> <br /> I'll play the role of "weakness and boring" (guess the franchise) every day 7/10
