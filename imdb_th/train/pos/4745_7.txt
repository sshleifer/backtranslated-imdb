I do not understand why they decided to release this movie to introduce American audiences to Dynamo, the Jet Fist of Legend is probably a much better choice. But it is not great as well The final battle sequence was well staged by Standing Wu Ping, the Matrix coordinator. But the English release suffered from rough editing and copying. (I asked the Hollywood studio to release this movie without comment.) Jet Li showed his special abilities in the title role and Francoise Yip played a cool role The mask has a strange German style that adds interest. But full of gun battles and explosions Focus on the excellent physical skills of Li in the Black Mask regulations as a good movie But do yourself a favor and get a Fist of Legend if you want to watch a great movie that shows Li's skills
