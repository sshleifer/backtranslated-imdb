"The Kennel Murder Case" starts at the run and doesn't stop until the end. Everyone has a reason to kill the victim and many people try. William Powell is excellent as the Philovan detective. The gentleman Mary Astor feels fresh as a granddaughter who wants to marry her Scottish gentleman and enjoy her heritage. This movie comes with "Nancy Drew, Reporter" on DVD, which is fun. If you have to rent a disc (Or check from your local library) do it. It's pure entertainment!
