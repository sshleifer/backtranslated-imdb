OK, so may not be the type of movie "Best Film of the Year" award (In addition to the great soundtrack that I think has won a few awards) but it's a great movie about 'The Kid' (Prince / O (your pick) and what happens around him that lives Based in Minneapolis, playing his music. Truly wonderful music. In my opinion, you must have this classic soundtrack and include eighty sounds and feelings. Excellent fashion and the movie itself is well made. It is worth seeing over and over again if you like Prince / O (which I do).
