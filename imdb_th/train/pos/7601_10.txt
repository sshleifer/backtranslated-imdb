Lost is one of the genres ... It is charming and full of thrill, excitement and emotion all at the same time. I've never seen this TV drama before. It is full of excitement in the forest and has a good screenplay. The actors live on the island in a natural way that I feel lost in the island while watching. It is a wonderful work that is described in a very smart way. The series is like a movie that shows the life of The survivors disappeared on a deserted island. I was tempted to watch one episode after another and I would like to recommend this series for TV lovers. Everyone looks at it to see the wonders of wandering anywhere.
