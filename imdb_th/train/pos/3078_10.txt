Love this show ... intelligent performances, intelligent conversations, great stories with real people .... Please bring it back or make it available online ... really miss .. Hope Davis Shine in this list I like the idea of ​​SIX DEGREES ... it's really reasonable in this crazy world. Get rid of yourself in a stupid reality show and let this performance be the second time. Please bring it back to the groove ... but please! When it goes out of the air, I look in online and like how I can see it with minimal interruption in reality. Online ABC makes it easy to enjoy the show when you miss them at a critical time .... Whenever you want to bring me back
