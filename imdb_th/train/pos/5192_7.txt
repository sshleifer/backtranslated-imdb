I'm a kung fu fan But not a Wu fan I have no interest in the movie, a gangster that is full of playing with guns. Now martial arts; * That's * beautiful! And John Woo surprised me by creating a fun kung fu movie that is almost too much of a fight if possible! This is a good thing. <br /> <br /> Many of the fighting scenes are very good. (And some scenes are not good) and the main characters are fun and cute The bad guys are incredibly evil. But less entertainment You must see the sleep wizard !! He can only fight when he sleeps - it's horrible! <br /> <br /> When watching over and over again, Hurray for Chivalry tends to be bored and slightly protracted. Actually, it's not good, so I rate "only" 7 out of 10, but actually it's almost "8" <br /> <br /> All in one of the better kung fu movies, all smack-dab in the heart of the Kung Fu cinema president. A really good kung fu movie came from the mid to late 1970s, with notable exceptions from the late 60s and early 70s (and the early 80s for fairness).
