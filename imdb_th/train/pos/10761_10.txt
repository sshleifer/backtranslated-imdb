My roommate bought this documentary and invited me to watch with her. She came from China and only heard about 9/11 and wanted to know the difficult truth and she wanted me to tell this story more after the documentary. I feel terrible to watch this movie. It's like a nightmare night and it still makes tears and tears. <br /> <br /> But I am very grateful that I watched this documentary because on September 11 I'm sure we all remember where we are and what we are doing when we hear. We can all think of some questions only: "Why?", "How?", "What happened", "Oh my God! "Almost all Americans I am grateful to firefighters and brave police who risked their lives to save others. But I don't think we will think about what they're doing. This shouldn't be a documentary about 9/11. The cameraman just filmed a weekday on the job and they were just a few blocks from the World Trade Center and received everything outside and inside the tape. <br /> < br /> On September 11, I thought to myself that "Never mind, police and firefighters will help people survive." To be honest, I thought it was an accident. I was in my junior high school and switched from the gym and prepared to study science. Some people entered the locker room shouting that "Some buildings have just been bombed in New York!" We all dressed up quickly and ran to our classroom when we watched the first tower that was burned on the TV, not just 15 seconds later. Live on TV. The second plane. Crashed into another World Trade Center and we know that this is not an accident A few minutes later we heard about the Pentagon and had a plane heading to Chicago but was shot down. Many ideas ran through our heads and I still thought "What do firefighters and police do?" But it's a step for them. I think they will know what to do. <br /> <br /> The first tower is broken. We know that there are so many lives. The second tower also collapsed. The firefighters in this documentary show the courage, confusion and strength of true human emotions. They don't know what to do. They have scars like everyone else in the tower. They heard that the body was falling from the ground when someone jumped out of the window. And here I am in the classroom, just cry, see everything that happens on the TV I was amazed with this movie and just wanted to go to New York and tell them how much Americans are grateful to them for their help. I know that they feel that they are working. But they do more, they are heroes Every day after September 11 for 3 weeks, they continue to dig, knowing that there are no survivors. But they still hope and pray May God bless them and their brave heart. <br /> <br /> For my roommate, she was crying and admitted that this was the first time she cried in this attack. She had to see the truth of what happened on the tragedy day. She asked, "Why?" I don't know what to say. It broke my heart that people can be evil. "It sounds strange." But it was a day. Normal for everyone, "one of the firefighters said in the documentary. No one expects this to happen. Otherwise, those people in the World Trade Center or the Pentagon or the plane that has been hijacked, they just have to do their job there, or even stay there for the second time. They not only were killed but also killed and those hijackers made music with heart. When seeing people celebrate in the Middle East, why do people do this? They celebrate death and loss: mother, father, sister, brother, friend, grandparent, aunt, uncle, uncle, relative, etc. Why? <br /> <br /> Thank you to the people who created this movie. You truly think of firefighters, police and soldiers in Iraq and give you the hope that there are good people in this world. Thank you to all of you, our heroes. <br /> <br /> 10/10
