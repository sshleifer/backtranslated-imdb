John Cassavetes's "Opening Night" is fantastic and fascinating. Great because it plays with the deepest fear we have in our imagination that is interesting because it never surprised us. With a long period of two hours and twenty minutes, everyone who appreciates the character will not be able to take his eyes off the screen. <br /> <br /> The story of the actress Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands) is uncertain. ) Trying to gather to play to fight with her demons; "Opening Night" not just about women who are going to collapse But also about the complexity of the life of the stage actors and the world of the drama characters of Cassavetes. All here are experienced people who know about the world of theater. Half of the film took place on the stage, whether the actors are working or behind the stage, where the producers and writers and directors do their duty. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes has a lot of compassion for himself. His drama turned to the audience, but the audience in the cinema. Because there was another audience in the theater who didn't know what was happening and laughed because they thought everything was a show And that is what it is; It's just that the audience in the theater can't see the 'stage' the way we do. They did not experience the abundance of Gena Rowlands before she left the stage. But the most important is; They don't know why she was doing that. <br /> <br /> I always thought it would be difficult to be friends with actors. Myrtle (Rowland) said she was an actor and that was the only thing. That you know how to do; And I think that if I have a friend who is a professional actor, it will be very difficult to tell when he speaks the truth because I know he is an actor and he can fake anything at any time. Many things that Myrtle made during the bad experience that the movie made her pass? We wonder if she is real; The remaining characters were also skeptical. <br /> <br /> There was a writer Sarah (Joan Blondell) who didn't understand why Myrtle didn't understand the characters she wrote for her. With director Manny (Ben Gassara) who cannot accept the fact that his best actress may lose Producer David (Paul Stewart) who doesn't know where to stand and Maurice (Cassavetes's companion) Myrtle, who can't handle the love they have for each other. <br /> <br /> When she witnessed death Of teenage girlfriends; All of this comes together and affects Myrtle, but no one knows whether her delusions are true or not. They didn't say anything because they didn't want to make her angry. But this movie enters the subconscious mind that only Myrtle accepts. Sometimes we can tell that everyone has it. During these times, the great script of Cassavetes demonstrates the terrible cruelty in the words that the characters speak in the backstage debate, and not just what everyone says to Myrtle, but what she said. With them <br /> <br /> This is a person who is not afraid to speak their thoughts and change what they think at all times, like the way in which Cassavetes's movies are made. Is more important in the "shadow" because the characters participate in the big picture <br /> <br /> But in other ways, the way to create a real movie, this movie is no different from "shadow". There are beautiful things in the way that the camera Al Ruban shot. Character image When someone talks about the camera not focusing on him, it will shoot the person who is listening. So that we can see that he or she responds to what others say Sometimes they are not interested, sometimes they are happy, sometimes sad. <br /> <br /> The adaptation may still be there, even in all these great performances. Near the end, there were unexpected scenes at Cassavetes and Rowlands. Whether it is temporary or not, is not something we have to doubt We just got to see And see the couple exchanging life experiences and seeing the words live truly in conversations that are more meaningful than they show? It is not more natural.
