Things to Come is a rarity of movie rarities about ideas. Many movies present a vision of the future. But there is little effort to show us how the future can happen The first part of the movie when the war came to Everytown was short but powerful (ironically, the film's audience last year released a laugh with reports that enemy aircraft attacked England - the peace was at the highest level. Wales' predictions came out too soon). Montage the endless war, followed by The most effective working style The name that is described makes me think of graphic design. Expressionist Of German The art director is William Cameron Menzies. The great and the ruins of Everytown are his best works. Margaret Scott was very seductive as the chief woman of Everytown in the 21st century. It is equally outstanding design. The performance in the 21st century is not interesting - perhaps this is a wrong attempt to compare the technical reasoning of this time with the barbarism of the 1970s. Unfortunately, the style of work that is representative of Angry crowd Should have done much better, even using the 30s technology. This is especially annoying because the giant plane scene is very reliable. This has been redeemed with the beautiful words of Raymond Massey, which summarizes the film - rarely the ideal scientific progress that is well expressed. The last question of Massey is more relevant now, in the era of spaceflight with very little use. This scene is aided by Sir Arthur Bliss's exciting song, which I am proud of, proudly. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the VHS version of this film is extremely scary. Most models have edited the interesting montage of workers and cutting-edge machines that brought us from the 1970s to 2038. I hope the good DVDs are in this movie.
