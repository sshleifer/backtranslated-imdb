I read about Flavia THE HERETIC for many years. But I just saw it early last year when I bought a crazy movie and for whatever reason it was in my mind recently. For many months I have seen <br /> <br /> It is definitely an outstanding film set in Italy in the 15th century. (But I don't think there will be any specific year) This is a time of Christian domination, a time of madness, and the movie captures this story. <br /> <br /> Flavia Our protagonist is a girl who faces a Muslim who falls down on the battlefield. He seems to be a warm and interesting person and she is immediately taken with him. Her father, the family's soldiers, stood almost immediately and killed the wounded right before her eyes. But she will continue to see him in her dreams. <br /> <br /> Her father sent her to a convent that looked like an open-minded hospital - so the inhabitants were heavily enslaved by Not accepting medieval Christians, slowly going crazy. Flavia came under the influence of a nun with one up. But in a crazy world, only crazy people are really mad and this sister realizes the madness around her. She used the time when they were living in a clash with Flavia, who was a child and was clearly sheltered, began to question everything about this world that she found herself trapped. <br /> <br /> In describing this world, showing many discontent. We saw a horse raping a female boss in his land in the form of a pig. Torture of a religious nun Flavius ​​finally observed and rejected the question of Christian belief that created a parade of horrors that would have received some criticism over the years, seemingly unusual. I disagree with that comment. Although sometimes the views of Flavia are expressed in a style that is not clearly reflected, for example, contemporary feminist commentary (This film was created in 1974) revolves around the obvious question. Perhaps it is difficult to believe that she can fish a lot in her own time. But that was a little point that was not made to scramble. Flavia was written for us in our time or in any age that was sympathetic to her condition. The sinking of this story will make the forest disappear. <br /> <br /> Flavia was delighted when the Muslims came to the countryside and she found a new generation of Islamist leaders still visiting. Her dream By attacking her almost immediately, he allowed her to lead the army into the Joan of Arc in a full-scale fighting style and ordered the invaders to pull down the Christian society and avenge everything she saw as an action. Wicked /> <br /> Are you the announcer for the new and better world? You might think so But the Muslims of that era were not interested in feminism as well. Soon she learned a difficult way. As they say, meet the new boss ... <br /> <br /> This is just a thumbnail of what happened in the FLAVIA THE HERETIC. This movie is quite insidious and has a rather bad rhythm. Not a movie about the masses It's quite good But and not in the "nunnery", which is often cast mercilessly I think it is very valuable in the final film and I'm glad to see it.
