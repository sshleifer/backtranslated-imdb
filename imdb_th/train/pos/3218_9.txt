Nine out of ten may seem like a high mark for the slander video screaming at the US box office and are widely criticized as the poorest movie of Kurt Russell's career. <br /> <br /> I have My reasons <br /> <br /> At first, when you read the negative reviews of this movie, they often started with Russell's woody nature in Todd's interpretation. I will start here also with my surprising message that this may be the best show I see Russell pulling out. Todd is an emotionally disabled person and suffering from a severe plot - this film was written before the phenomenon was widely accepted as now. <br /> <br /> The depiction is a story. interesting Todd was withdrawn from his followers and heretics. He suffers from irrational anxiety - putting the key to the fever field by training that teaches him to analyze every movement and interaction with another human for signs of betrayal and danger. His excessive emphasis makes it impossible to understand the larger continuity in which the work he was assigned to sit inside - with the scenes in which he sliced ​​carrots, cut into small pieces and still worked unabashedly. Many people interpret this as a sign of his physical strength and pay attention to the work done. But it was a sign that he was doing a mission requested by memorization - not understanding the relationship between the vegetables he prepared and the food to eat later. <br /> <br /> Todd's dialogue is Spartan. To say the least - two talk scenes that he received are the heart of the film's plot Fear and discipline that we have been told. Fear of pumping him in a state of excessive alertness, which the smallest detail will not pass him, makes him ready to respond on the knife edge. There is a discipline that will keep him in check through his fears to overcome it and execute strategically. Inference is that he doesn't have the time to think and can't afford to feel. Many viewers have different interpretations of his reaction to hugging from Sandra of Nielsen - but I believe you have to interpret from the human perspective with the experience of embracing in the fight. - The vibrations show him. The fear of being caught, his movement and his vision is limited - fear and absolute discipline. <br /> <br /> Then there is a description of his abandonment. (Twice in reality) - so the representatives of our society The soldiers walked into the garbage dump of society when they fulfilled the requirements. 40% of the unemployed are former soldiers in our world. In HIS, it is only worse. Russell quickly picked up the mantle of the responsibility of the scepter with his wife and children - which needed a mission. Even those who had a high chance of death. <br /> <br /> There is also a military description. Busey's Church and hotshot from HQ, Mekum's new male Mekum is faster, stronger, more accurate and more aggressive. Any one can knock Todd onto the floor - but it's not about the tools you have. It's the way you use it. Todd, who gives incentives for the freedom to use his initiative and acts without the effect of stupor from superior perception, uses ambush tactics and tricky tricks to cut the wound through the unit. Newer It is a reminder that military power cannot compensate for the failure of leadership. <br /> <br /> There are many other topics that are delicate. When the movie is filmed and written to a minimum, it will make a lot of white space for your own interpretation. Watch the soldiers with an open mind and see what it teaches you.
