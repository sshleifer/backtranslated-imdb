This is the best solo performance at Eddie Murphy. It's best to just forget the Nutty Professor and the famous gentleman. This is the real Eddie Murphy. (Pretending that he is gay), Michael Jackson and other artists are murderers. I think it is quite daring to make fun for popular artists at that time. My favorite action is what he is at his annual barbecue with his family and playing a drunkard father and aunty rabbit falling from the stairs. <br /> <br /> This performance is the best medicine when you feel. Worse! If you look at the sequels 'raw', don't be disappointed. It's quite good as well, but doesn't match 'raving'.
