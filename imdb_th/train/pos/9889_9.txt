Read Eric's review again. He explained his own feelings perfectly for this movie more thoroughly than I ever did. I'm just writing here to encourage you to look and see it. <br /> <br /> I saw it many years ago on IFC TV. I think it's a unique movie that I hesitate to make comparisons. It was filmed in northern Mexico, somewhere in the non-stop land of Coahuila / Zacatecas / San Luis Potosi. This is not Durango, like Sedona, Mexico (from John Wayne's movie) but is a place full of nature and true. I have to find a novel now to check the original position of the story. Just like the film's position, strange and fierce and wonderful and strange and not suitable for everyone. It is an almost productive work that motivates me to study movies. <br /> <br /> I didn't really forget this movie. It was an indelible thing. Yet for many years I forgot the existence of it. I know that no one sees it, never read and doesn't see any references. Erendira is an unusual name. I will even forget the name. I will buy a copy now. <br /> <br /> ** I have since the post above became a big fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and regretted not reading him before. <br /> <br / > Relative to the comments of MsMyth below; This film was filmed in Mexico. But the author is a Colombian and does not comment on Mexican or Mexican history. In any way, Marquez now lives in Mexico for political reasons. This story is universal. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying to find a copy of this movie for my library. I like movies? You have to read the story and everything else. Garcia Marquz wrote and in fact the original place in this story is Colombia.
