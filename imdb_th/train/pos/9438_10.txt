This is one of the greatest movies ever. It is a classic forever The character played by Ned Betty experienced one of the biggest changes on the screen. He is an insurance salesman who is overweight, shallow and useless. He was proud of his folly and also decided to "turn back" into a fool. When he watched the old man wear a hat and the old man replied that "You don't know anything." The voice was determined. it's true. He did not "know nothing", but rape in the rainforest, once a human, was a warrior. His fake courage is shallow. The old self has died forever, leaving it in a forest far away and under hundreds of feet of water. And what of Lewis, our brave guide Lewis is a philosopher / hunter / warrior and he is just a bean. Bert Reynolds proved himself as an actor back in 1972 in this film, giving himself completely in this great role. Who doesn't want to have a friend like Lewis, if anyone who is at risk of being forgotten / will soon be left behind the world, just like our ruthless travelers find themselves. This film talks about us on many levels. The story feels like real. It works as a complete action / adventure with great movies. It acts like a horror movie that is dangerous and almost surreal in the face of evil-minded people who oppose them. "Sow" Ned Betty, but still works as an art movie by using many symbols in To convey the truth that is our essence I have seen this movie at least fifty times and every time it appears I find that I have to watch it. You have to watch it many times to begin to understand it. This is one deep film. This is a movie that has been released well. And this is one of the hell of the story. I gave 10 out of 10 and put in 10 of my greatest movies of all time, along with Schindler's List, Casablanca, Taxi Driver and Sling Blade and more. Movies that you need to think a lot Movies that use stories to make issues without trying to teach you If you think you know the release, you may do it. But you may not do It is really good
