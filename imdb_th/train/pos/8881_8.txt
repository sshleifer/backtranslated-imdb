For the first time, consider the time when the film was created in 1995. The rapper is in there and that adds to its ability. <br /> <br /> Remy is an awkward teenager in a society that tries. Search him The way and can't do until he meets and becomes friends with the Nazis. They brought him into the Nazis, not all that was awkward. But like most gangs, they fill the gaps that disappear, whether it be economic, social, emotional or whatever. Michael Rappaport plays the role perfectly. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps is a famous star and Has a work ethic and chips on his shoulder He still tries to feel sorry for himself and his fate, and let the girlfriend and the teacher teach him to match it. <br /> <br /> Christen is a white girl who tries. Find yourself She was raped to date. Then she found herself experimenting with her sexuality and participating in politics. <br /> <br /> This film deals with racism and likes things related to racism, perspective. <br /> <br /> I read a lot of comments about the lack of black characters 'evil' but with evil white characters (Nazis). What did Remy not show? Give That is what he tried to do evil, and continue to fail until skinheads, some people accept him. He was scared. It was sad to see him invent the way he did. He said that right before he committed suicide, I didn't mean I wanted to be an engineer. <br /> <br /> Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes are angry black men, Ice Cube is quite wise and Busta Rhymes was shown to be a dumb connoisseur. They both do not show any interest for roommates and don't seem to like white people too much. They were angry like the Nazis. But not at the level of the Nazis in terms of overall badness Sorry if it makes it look unfair. But have black people like the Nazis? No, <br /> <br /> People say it's white. = -Bad black = Well, it's not true. The only white character that is not good is the Nazis and the police, which are more or less true in real life. Kristen is a good woman. Her boyfriend (Omar epps Roommate) is a good person and even Remy is a good person. He misunderstood. <br /> <br /> Omar Eps Ice and Busta are seriously defective characters. Angry and fearless Although the police are constantly being threatened, they seem to show their anger. Remy's incompetence makes it seem that his anger is right. <br /> <br /> Good movies do very well. Like all movies related to racism, it is a great part for talking. <br /> <br /> I don't think Cube and Busta can beat the Nazis.
