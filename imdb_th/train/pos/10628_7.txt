Even with occasional arrogant acting scenes and stories "see-it-all-before" This is a fairly interesting movie. <br /> <br /> There is a suspicion. The demon's scene is really creepy. The effect is great and best of all. The story does not have a joke that is not good to distract from the film because the horror movie (scrambled) exists in them now. <br /> Honestly, this is not the greatest movie. But actually it attracts you and at least tries to develop the character. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I watched it.
