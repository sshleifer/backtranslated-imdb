This movie is great! I expect to have something different from the movie I saw. However, it is profound in showing the aggressive nature of human sexuality and the connection with animal behavior. I would like to remind those who read this article, which has sexual content that is too blatant, because the obvious sexual nature of this film feels like high pornography. It also has a scene that is very rape. <br /> <br /> At the same time, I suggest watching. "Sexual art" that is rare. Every minute of the picture will breathe the sexual spirit of the seventies by the way. One should not forget that the time has changed. <br /> <br /> Go see it! It's worth your money and time!
