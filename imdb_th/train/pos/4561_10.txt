I've watched this movie three times and every time I saw it became more personal and engaging. <br /> <br /> The performance was amazing. Lewis, who is an amazing actor, although Brenda Fricker is surprising in itself. She captured your heart as a mother of a physically handicapped child who couldn't walk or speak until he was in the late teens. <br /> <br /> I can't say enough good things about movies But I will stop here I recommend to everyone who enjoys movies based on real events or just enjoying good drama in general.
