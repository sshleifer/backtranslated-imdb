This film is excellent, recorded for some scenes with Esposito. I enjoy gathering all the detectives in the series and including summaries that have never been modified between the series (thanks to NBC ...). Saw Pembleton and Bayliss together in most humans and the most basic person. Braugher and Secor did very well but were normally overlooked. It was painful to see that this was the end of the murder. Memories, tapes and replay on CourtTV are not the same as watching it every Friday. But this film works well and is very well done by presenting the picture of life after Al retired and family relationships that exist between units I am very happy
