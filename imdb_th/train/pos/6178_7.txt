Mitchell Leisen's fifth feature as a director and he shows his versatility by directing a musical after his previous film is a heavy drama. In addition, he also played as a cameo as the band leader. <br /> <br /> You can say it's a pre-movie movie and there's nothing that's been created in the US for a while later (like 30+ years ) Leisen shoots a musical number so they are like the audience will see - no wide screen images or from above Busby Berkeley. What I find funny or interesting is that you never really see the audience. <Br /> <br /> As others say The actor is quite devoid of character, and Jack Oakie and Victor McLaghlan play movies by Gertrude Michael /> <br /> has sparked a number of music that seems <br interesting and good. (The rape, especially the Rhapsody, is amusing) but the drama is not reliable and counterfeits - three murders too. Affect the mood the least with the characters This is what this movie seems to be much better.
