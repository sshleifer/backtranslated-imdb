I have always been skeptical before watching British retro movies because I often find them in a light and boring movie script (such as Vanity Fair or The Other Boleyn Girl). Producing spectacular Europe The rich English landscape and accent that makes the movie an artistic value that they don't really have From Emily Blunt, Paul Bettany and Jim Broadbent, and various costumes and locations that make the movie look unexpectedly rich and I say "unexpected" because of me The Company will not pay attention to those details so much <br /> <br /> "Victorian" is one of the key issues in contemporary civilization and not only. But in social terms But also in science, art and culture as well. I really don't know much about the origins of that era and probably because I like the political and economic events that make the landing of the modern era easy. At Queen Victoria, it was such a picture that was a young and wise king, whose decisions were not always good. But at least they were inspired by good intentions. I also found images of love between Victoria and Prince Albert that were very interesting. The intelligence and emotions that occurred, the only failure I found in this movie is the screenwriter Julian Fellowes, using a romantic movie in a love story that makes him feel guilty / > <br /> I like The Young Victoria very much and I was very surprised with it. I hope that the retro movies will follow a lot of examples of this movie: costumes and landscapes. The work is Supporting interesting and non-renewable stories
