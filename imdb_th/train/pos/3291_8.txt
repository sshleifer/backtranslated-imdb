This great movie and a shame to get a little bit of attention outside the art house and students who stay until two o'clock in the morning to watch Channel Four. <br /> <br /> The story is simple but works like that. Very powerful. Blurry between imagination that looks like a child and a nightmare that is difficult to see is blurred very well. The budget looks quite low. But for the credit of the concerned person, it will not show too often It hasn't been dated yet too much. <br /> <br /> I'm lucky enough to close this tape a few years ago and it has a half-dozen view. It is one of the movies that are not attractive for everyone. Although, as usual, those who have more ways to think about movies will benefit a lot from this story. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Buerke makes the work as good as Anna. Disappeared from the acting scene Cross is also very good, with the height of his character in the context of the picture. <br /> <br /> There is something true. (And I didn't say that) disturbing the time in both movies Half-second shock and more tension pulled out See with lights. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br />
