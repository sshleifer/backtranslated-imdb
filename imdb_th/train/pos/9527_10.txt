This is the best mob movie ever created. It deserves more than what is received from Oscar. Received many nominations, such as scores, artistic directions, supporting roles (Newman). The film was nominated for Best Picture, Director (Mendes), actor (Hank) , Actors (Newman and the law) hangs to one of his best performances and the children playing Michelle Jr. are so good that I was surprised that I didn't see him in other films Today, critics do not give credit. The film is enough But apart from the incredible performances, the true star of the film is incredible music. This is the best score of the year. It was nominated but not won. This is a great movie that everyone should watch. My Grade-A +
