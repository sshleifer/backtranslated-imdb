First of all, I want to say that it is great. It's shocking and sometimes shocking. And in order to say that at least I am 11 years old and this is my favorite movie, I can definitely stand to watch a boring movie It's like traveling through humanity. Its complete realism shows through this great masterpiece. It is the story of both hearts and voices (HELLMAN) that create a mutual friendship. Joe Buck (VOIGHT), an innocent Texas themed, comes to New York to make women rich in fun. He soon met Ricko 'RATSO' Rizzo (HOFFMAN), a poor man who barely paid rent. Ratso became Joe's manager, but soon the two were unable to find a job. Which results in stealing food While they are trying to survive on the streets of New York, we know how difficult it is. They couldn't get Joe to be a girl until they met a woman at the party. Joe earns money and soon Joe takes Ratso to Florida of dreams. The last five minutes were broken. But the greatest moment in the movie from MIDNIGHT COWBOY, we have a different perspective and sometimes create chaos for life.
