This game is very playable. I played continuously for hours until late. But the fact that you can't save the game when you are in space, you are involved in this matter. Release any game information. <br /> <br /> Yes. "Freelancer" is a follow-up. But there are some shortcomings For example, some of the things that make me very worried about that you can't skip the cut scenes. For this reason, sometimes you have to watch the cut scenes at the same time, a few minutes after the time passes. A great opportunity for me to work on multitasking to check my email or chat with my friends and other things like that while I have to wait for the scene to end. <br /> <br /> Story Begin But you get more ridiculous things The game ended abruptly, at least for me. Obviously, they are referring to the upcoming sequel. I don't know if there will be a sequel at this time. But I'm sure it's possible that I will pick up one when it is released. <br /> <br /> The style of play is very easy! Even for those who are not familiar with flying games In order to be brave, every fool can play this game. Yes, some levels are difficult and require a lot of effort. I spend about 1-2 weeks than I will finish this game, which may be a bit short. But thank God for many players options! It allows you to play short missions like a single player game when you finish it. <br /> <br /> Although many missions are the same in the middle of the big dogfights, <br /> <br /> Good graphics but not just revolution or anything. <br /> <br /> Addictive game, but beware of bugs. <br /> <br /> 7/10
