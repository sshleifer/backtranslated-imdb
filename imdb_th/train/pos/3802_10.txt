Dragon Hunters must be the best animated film I have ever seen. It has fallen. The jaw. This movie is about a pair of robbers in search of cash, furry dogs, their strange blue lights and a dream girl. Being a knight and they were sent on a mission to the end of the world to kill. The world of the mighty dragon is vicious. But actually it doesn't matter what this movie is about Because it is a beautiful jaw image Gravity in this fantasy world is so different, the blocks of architecture and the boundaries of the land float around amidst the cathedral and the castle and the village as well, and there is a forest of floating lilies. The world is creative, unique and beautiful, with a quiet story book. The world looks like a beautiful painting set. These monsters are visually beautiful, like the fire dragon that consists of many red bats. Plot some stories, unlike the original, such as the protagonists who want their farms to become la Of Mice and Men and seem to be unable to do it in this world. But gorgeous graphics, scary scenes, and emotionally stimulating dialogue make this movie exciting
