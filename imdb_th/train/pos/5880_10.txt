In contrast to the ones above me, I feel that this movie is really funny, especially in the scenes with a lot of combinations. I don't want the story and the story with people who haven't watched yet. But I would say that Paresh Rawal does not have an extensive role, such as Priyadarshan movies in the past, such as Hera Pheri and Hungama Paresh Rawal. He was no less than in this film, as he had received from Waqt and almost all of his films after Andaaz, although all three heroes in this film will be released. But they did very well in the performance, especially the good and hot Nargis I will say that if you like Hungama or Hera Pheri, this movie must watch.
