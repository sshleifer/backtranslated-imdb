This is a small flick that happened in Michigan about a man who was haunted in his past by his abusive stepfather (Gunnar Hansen) and grew up badly. In fact, he is certainly a deceiver. But try not to be too clear He also has an environment like his little devil and an angel that follows him. The devil never said anything. But actually not necessarily, and he is a creepy Max Schreck. Suppose that the angel spins his wheel on this issue quite a lot, because Eric is busy doing things that make him feel better, like the person "Liberate" that he decided to want most women to be beautiful This is a good picture of madness and you are the one who thinks what will happen. But overall I watched this story from beginning to end, focusing on this issue because of interest. It's a bit lacking in some areas. But nothing I could put my finger on A good effort and worth looking at if you like the serial killer flicks.
