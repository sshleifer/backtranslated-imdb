This is one of the movies of Dev Anand, who gave a great movie. But different to the Hindi film industry, such as Jewel, Steal and Guide Short story (If you ask me what the story is), the story is easy - the brother tries to find the missing sister. Sisters joined the hippies who smoked cigarettes and prayers, rabbits, Rama, rabbit, Krishna. But the film shows some important events that the world experienced in the 70s. Hippie culture, drug delivery, freedom, family taxation and new things such as Eastern religion (Which is new for white people) religion. They are perfectly managed. Zeenat gives the best things to her and Dev as usual is great. Best used music (Unlike the way they were hurt for the sake of having music) in this movie They were not destroyed either. The perfect example is 'Dekho o deewano ... Ram ka naam badnam na karo'. Each word in that song has a lot of philosophy and meaning. The end is sad. But that's not the essence of the Devji movie as a whole, believing in making movies, succeeded in showing what he wanted to show here. Must see to experience the beautiful hippie and Nepal culture in the 70s
