I found that Gray Garden is an interesting movie. <br /> <br /> Look too strange with the right idea: forget the society. <br /> <br /> And live in the house. That has no deterioration The heating and raising of cats and large raccoons <br /> <br /> Make them very interested in themselves. <br /> <br /> Every day while talking to the camera. <Br / > <br /> Big, Edie and Little Edie are two crazy people at Mazles Bros. <br /> <br /> have chosen to document They look like the characters that come from <br /> <br /> Fellini's movie, strangers only if it's reasonable. Old Edie is <br /> <br /> Almost fell sick of paper, clothes and plates. Dirty <br /> <br /> Growing around her, Little Edie is even more interesting. <br /> <br /> Walk around the house, wear a veil like baboushka. <br /> <br /> Around her head. <br /> <br /> I have never seen her hair throughout the story, and we never get a hint that she still has. Many things Although fifty-eight years old, she is still beautiful and full of life. <br /> <br /> In the gray garden, we understand that these two women, <br /> <br> life is less than it used to be. /> <br /> Little Edie should be the stairs of both. While her mother in previous years, <br /> <br /> has married, built a family, lived in luxury and <br /> <br /> even some recordings (Scene 77, she sings < br /> <br /> Along with recording "Tea for Two" that she had done decades ago, <br /> <br /> One of the best scenes in the movie), Edie left the acting career of She, as <br /> <br> A model takes care of her unwell mother at the age of 58. She still wants <br /> <br /> found that she If Little Edie is still a little girl, <br /> <br /> Full of dreams of temptation and fame and happiness in the home and romance. <br /> <br / > Happiness that has not been fulfilled /> <br /> The highlight of this movie, including the opening moments of Little <br /> <br /> Edie describes her dress with "tea sequence camera." for two ", <br /> <br /> Birthday party, argument, grocery store, deliver the scene <br /> <br /> and the scene in the room the roof Everything is unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Frankly and unpretentious. And it makes everything more memorable. <br /> <br /> Because it's true. <br /> <br /> I recommend seeing the gray garden facing Kenneth. <br /> <br / > Short Puce Moment Anger Criterion DVD is $ 35.00, but it's worth every penny
