This is a wonderful "small" movie. I said "small" because it doesn't have a hundred-gun or a dozen guns like in John Wu's movie. Great performances by Roy Scheider and all three "bad guys" John Frankenheimer It seems that there is more luck in small production today. This film looks very easy, the story is more yarn than the washing machine - instead of looking around, it seems that everything is getting worse when the plot is thicker. A wonderful ending is very positive. I never read the book Elmore Leonard, but it can't be much different from this movie because it feels like I'm watching the movie Elmore Leonard.
