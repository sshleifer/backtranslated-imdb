This is the second program in the general Columbo series, and it's better today. While I was able to watch closely on the DVD and see how it was created, I was very impressed with the direction of Bernard L. Kowalski (the director of Macho CALLAHAN's refinement and countless TV episodes) - see That the action after the murder of the murderer shows a split-screen display in his two glasses, see how the murder is shown in a montage, view shooting from the point of view of the corpse In addition to the impressive avant-garde music from Gil Melle, the famous jazz musician is great and helps create a great atmosphere. And the support performance of Brett Halsey as a pro-golf player is excellent - the resolution and complexity in the nine-in-ten role will be a dimensional cut. There is no "formula" setting at the time of filming, so there is a surprise in Columbo's method. Of course, Falk, Robert Cull and Ray Millland are the highest quality actors and have Happy to see them work - all men are familiar with other roles in every program in the Columbo - and MANY series of others - well built, as well as very good documentary movies.
