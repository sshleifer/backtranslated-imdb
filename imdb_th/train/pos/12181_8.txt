"Lady from Shanghai" is well known as one of Hollywood's most problematic works. The original Welsh cut was taken by the manufacturer and cut into ribbons. This story makes the mysterious story that is messy and difficult to follow. They posted a lot of dubbing of his conversations because the density of the Irish accent and the dubbing was clear and not too good. The most disastrous of all, Welles and his screen and the real life of Lady Rita Hayworth, are in their relationship and their tumultuous chemistry comes on the screen. The great direction of Orson Welles is that he makes this film incredibly stylish and atmospheric - every scene seems to breathe from the screen. Moreover, the characters and the scenes are still strange in dreams and surreal. This strange feeling elevates the scenes that are often found in these movies, such as the scene in the courtroom in the middle. I often find that the drama in the courtroom is boring. But the direction of Welles and the strange touch makes them fascinating, like everything The ending at the carnival reminds almost one of David Lynch. <br /> <br /> The performance here is also very good. Despite their failed relationships, Welles and Hayworth both gave good performances - their interactions. But slightly lacking. Others are excellent and delightful to watch, especially Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. "Lady of Shanghai" clearly has a problem. But it is worthwhile to watch just to see one of his best cinema experts (8/10)
