The movie I'm criticizing is a television movie created in 1996 and performed by Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin. <br /> <br /> The main protagonist / main character is Jennifer Stanton (Hart), a typical American teenager. Those who feel pressure from having a control father (Baldwin), however, when she meets a former prisoner named Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan "never kissed") They 'fall' immediately, but Jennifer has different ideas about where to use their relationship. She manipulated him to kill her parents to protect their 'love', but she just used him to get rid of her parents so that she could be with Brad (David Lascher in the future. Actually, Melissa Joan Hart really surprised me with her role as an evil burglar and she carried the movie well using her friend and Nick so that she could escape from the murder. The rest of the actors work well and they all have their own when they have a screen. I also found it interesting that the film was created and released in the same year. Hart began painting Sabrina, Teenage Witch and this performance she was able to perform in my film and television. <br /> <br /> Although This movie Has dated, it still looks outstanding due to her best work related to drama or thriller movies and I am looking forward to 'Nine Dead' coming out in November because it shows that she can Can see as others or Sabrina Spellman. "<br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina. You can watch on the internet, so I recommend W Exam
