The second film of Abhay Deol, written by Imtiaz Ali. The first directed effort by Shivam Nair Soha may have the first meat role as a Megha. A woman who escaped from the house and was waiting at the marriage registration office of Delhi to meet Her girlfriend, Dheeraj (Shayan Munshi), to meet her. She waited and waited, and was eventually found to be a suffering woman by Ankush (Abhay Deol). They spent many days together as he solved the situation. Which should Her basket after another and eventually falls in love with her. Then the fans came back! Aage pardey par dekhiye! Does it sound familiar? This is another modification of Dostoyevsky's White Nights borrowed from Le Notti Bianchi (very small - Ankush makes the couple separate by telling the boyfriend that she is dead!) But this is adaptation to Environment and more realistic than Saawariya. I wonder why no one brought this little gem when we talked about Zawariya like crazy in the last few months. <br /> <br /> Settings Delhi is something that Excellent - have forced through the Old Delhi. From the top of the Connaught Circus roof road with a rickshaw (what?) The colorful light fixtures in the hotel are enough to tell you that this is a difficult connection for an hourly rental room! <br /> <br /> The more you see Abhay, the more I like this young man. In this second movie, he is quite good as a witness to hire people who have a purpose in life by a beautiful woman. Soha looks beautiful and when she smiles, she fits in this chapter. But I found that she was not credible during this more serious time. I'm not sure if she has in her to be a great actress or she might blossom like a brother. The song of Himesh Reshammiya is not that good and in fact this movie has a stumbling block. Telling stories and not sitting with the characters trying to sing them The supporting actors were excellent and I easily lifted this finger to White Nights. BTW - The fact that I love Abhay's cute dimples is not about my score.
