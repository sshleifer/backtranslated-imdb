Personnaly I like this movie very much and it makes me especially impressed. Two main actors are giving us great performances. At the end, it is a delight to know what has happened to the characters. <br /> <br /> Alchemy between The song is great in the way they are. <br /> <br /> That's why I didn't feel surprised when I learned that I had won five Golden Globe Awards (the most award-winning film in Golden Globes) Oscar and even a Grammy This movie is a classic movie that should be worth watching by everyone. Great movies that are often criticized (Probably because Streisand dares to participate as a co-director) Her art is the biggest and that will definitely make you satisfied!
