This movie is really a mixed bag. On the other side, the story and concept of the movie is really good, stressful, and there are good plans in it, but on the other hand it says that it is very slow, without style and is not involved I still considered "Just Cause" as an average thriller, just because of the talented actors. <br /> <br /> Maybe Sean Connery may have a role in his role. I mean, he is not a person who believes as a 'hero' and father of a young daughter (played by Scarlett Johansson who is very young) and Kate Capshaw's husband. This chapter, however, Sean Connerey, of course, is an excellent actor and that is the only reason that he can still carry the movie as well as he is. But of course he was assisted by strong actors, including actors like Lawrence Fishburn, Blair Underwood, Ned Betty, Hope Lang, Lynn. Tigpen and Ed Harris All actors are really good. But some people use very little at the same time, which is a real shame, including the opportunity to miss. In particular, Ed Harris is great in his role as a psychic serial killer. He felt really chilling and acting perfectly. Usually he will not play a ruthless and bleak role in the movie, so he was surprised by his role in this chapter. His acting alone is reason enough to watch this movie. However, due to the fact that the story is told without style and is too much of a formula, there is no character in the movie that is made out well because it feels too far away. <br /> <br /> It's a way. Really telling stories The Arne Glimcher kills all films with great potential, directing the film with a little style and making the speed sometimes too low. For this reason, we, as an audience, never participate in any story or character. <br /> <br /> It's really bad because "Just Cause" has more than enough potential. A good actor and a smooth story that has unexpected things happen and turns out that nothing is possible. Actors and stories are the only reason that the film is still an average thriller that might make fans like this. However, it is an eternal shame that the movie lacks in storytelling and style, or else this movie may be a true classic in the genre of movies. <br /> <br /> 7/10
