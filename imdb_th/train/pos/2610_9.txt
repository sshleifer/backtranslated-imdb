During the ten years that the Wildside broadcast, there is nothing close to quality in the local production which includes Underbelly, two sets that are fun. But has been overestimated, which has brought to the latest crime history events in Sydney and Melbourne Blue murder drama (Which starred Tony Martin But as a person on the other side of the law) may be an exception. <br /> <br /> Wildside is being repeated at night initially. After not watching the program for a while, I am still impressed with the story and the characters that are human. Best actor: Detective Tony Martin, haunting the disappearance of his son, Rachel Blake. (Which later contacted Martin in real life) as a community against alcoholism. Equally good support roles were prepared by Aaron Pederson, Jessica Napier, Mary Coustas (yes, Effie himself) and Abbie Cornish, girl, <br /> <br /> ABC opened the mystery show only the first three episodes on the DVD a couple of years ago. The logic of this kind of marketing is beyond me. But I guess it may be related to licensing with traditional manufacturers. <br /> <br /> Great series that is amazingly good. This is the hope that ABC's DVD division will act together. <br /> <br /> (As the host of the ABC message board said the release of additional DVDs in December 2009)
