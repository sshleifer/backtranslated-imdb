After seeing you receiving the letter and being disappointed, I decided to watch the original movie that inspired the film, The Shop Around the Corner. It is a true gem and from this moment is one of my favorite movies of all time. The performance is perfect. This story is very beautiful. If you haven't watched, I want you to see it today. I do not resist again and sometimes I like the new version more than the original version. But this time, have to admit that You Got Got Mail is a bad modification of this classic. Don't miss out on your video store and rent The Shop Around the Corner today!
