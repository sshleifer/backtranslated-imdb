Sidney Stratton experienced problems keeping work at many textile mills, mostly because of his experiments in the textile laboratory. Stratton experimented with new fabric formulations that would create the best fabrics, non-dirty fabrics, no wrinkles or deterioration. condition Finally, when Stratton created the fabric, he created enemies in all textile workers. (Which will lose their job) and the owner (who will lose money since the mill has a special privilege), so Stratton in his white dress became England. This film is perfect and Only Elingings can be done. Guiness's performances (and the great actors like Greenwood, Thesiger and Parker) and Mackendrick's direction make this film a delightful story. But the real hero is the story itself, good words in business and industry with additional elements of drama, romance and suspense. Score 8
