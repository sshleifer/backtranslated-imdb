It is very difficult to say what happened to "The Lady from Shanghai" and this movie is probably without interference from the studio. Orson Welles' main focus in this film is to raise money for his theater. In fact, funding his project is what drives him to find work. He created "Lady from Shanghai" in soon he will be past his wife Rita Hayes Wirth Harry Kohn fear the image of Rita and suspend the release of the film for one year /> <br /> stories relating <br. With an Irish sailor named Michael O'Hara who fell in love with Elsevier Short blond hair). Her husband is a well-known criminal lawyer Arthur Bannister. (Everett Sloan), who is disabled inside when he goes outside He hired Ohara to work on his yacht, and there, Ohara was dragged into the website of murder and deception. <br /> <br /> "The Lady from Shanghai" moves slowly. I agree with one of the posters that the movie today was criticized for having to spend time creating a storyline. Yet this movie dragged The scene in the fun house is wonderful - Welles wants it without music and I believe the studio will cut it down. It's a shame Taking pictures all the time is amazing. The atmosphere is very brave and stylish. <br /> <br /> Welsh is a great actor, handsome in his youth, charming and has a beautiful tone and technique. But in many movies If he doesn't trust himself or doesn't spend time developing characters But he relied on outsiders such as accents and fake nose The only time he didn't do this was "Tomorrow is forever," in which the director received an excellent performance and felt deeply out of him. In contrast to "compulsion" where he shows that he is a true technical acting expert as he calls in his performance here, Welles is doing four times as a director, actor, co-star. Writer and lecturer Focusing on unnecessary sounds completely and looks violent is a quick way to describe the characteristics. However, he is always interesting. <br /> <br /> The best supporting players, including Sloan and Glenn Anders Hayworth, are beautiful and soft. (Her singing has been dubbed by Anita Ellis again). It is like a complete goddess and one of the great screen shows. It's a sad life for bright beauty. <br /> <br /> The movie Orson Welles is worth seeing and "The Lady from Shanghai" is no exception. But this makes the audience disappointed as well as "The Magnificent Ambersons" - just like any work that Welles did in a studio system. He is a great artist who should be independent. He is not He is a strange pair of poles - he wants more freedom. But based on evidence from his later work, he needed a studio structure Alas, he didn't have both.
