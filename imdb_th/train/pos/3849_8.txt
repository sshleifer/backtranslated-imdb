Verhooven's last Dutch-speaking movie made me laugh well. As a movie looking for small details and references in every movie, I can guarantee that everyone interested in the art of movies that this piece is everyone's favorite. I haven't read Gerard Reves' book, which is this movie. But I still believe that we will get a picture of a poet / writer who thinks of himself as a straightforward person who has given him an anti-hero surrounded by a character with an ambiguous intent like him. All of this in a well-packed movie. Paul Verhopven managed to change the "gesellich (?)" To be cute, otherwise it was the location of the Dutch to become a scene that requires an amazing film noir
