I went to watch this movie after reading it. It was a drama about a man with supernatural gifts who were made into monsters by society Suffice to say that I expect something completely different from what I have received. But it was a happy surprise My friends and I both think that this movie is very romantic. (The fact that the male lead is not bad at all will certainly help) and has developed enough plot, action and humor. Part of the movie that is now the name of each other has movietheatre all laughing) for you to enjoy and invest in So in the short term: not what I expected But it is very surprising I will buy this movie when it comes out on DVD.
