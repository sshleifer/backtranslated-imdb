A group of people are traveling to Belgrade in a terrible bus led by a drunken conductor and his stupid son. (Those who like to drive with their eyes closed) Their journeys are often interrupted by a lot of fun events, with a lot of irony explaining the collapse of the national spirit in 1941 and so funny today Used as a joke, a man who "steals the show" is a 4-foot-high farmer with his four sons, twice as big as him. In the end, this movie takes one drama and the journey will become nothing but the swan song in the country that is dying.
