Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, starring "modern" musicals that show the talent of MacDonald's cartoons. The 40s surreal musicals seem to create fun for the 40s fashion, even in the present day. Eye-catching dresses and dresses (yes, B&W) helps to increase the imagination and the dream of all movies. Many good songs enliven the movie with the number "Twinkle in Your Eye", all highlights, including fun jitter numbers between MacDonald and Binnie Barnes. In addition to casting actors Edward Everett Horton, Reginal Owen, Mona Maris, Douglas Dumbrille and Anne Jeffreys are also seen in an extended section, including Esther Dale, Almira Sessions, Grace Hayle, Gertrude Hoffman, Rafaela Ottiano, Odette Myrtile, Cecil Cunningham and many more. <br /> <br /> Very fun and glad to see MacDonald in The observances jitterbug / vamp, she can do it all.
