This is one of the most calming, relaxing and beautifully animated movies I've ever seen. With beautiful music throughout the movie, sound and music makes you feel like being in a movie! This film is not only But suitable for children only But for adults too It teaches you a lesson, for example, don't forget who you are, you can do what you are interested and brave and brave. This movie can make you cry all the time as well, which is an impressive story in the movie. This movie is funny, sad, cute and makes you not to miss! Some movies really feel fuzzy after you see them and the movie "Soul" is one of them! With a 9/10 star rating for animation, music and great ideas for movies, it gives me a lot of spirits!
