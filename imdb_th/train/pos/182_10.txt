If you are not trained with the world of Gundam, this is a good starting point. If you have been out of power with Star Wars or Star Trek, this is an interesting and realistic sci-fi series that you can play, whether it's a giant robot you expect, but a complex space war drama. And emotional attractiveness, where the line between "good" and "bad" is slightly different. <br /> <br /> Gundam 0080 focuses on the story of Al-Izurah. In a neutral space colony He spent the day of his dream about Mobile Suit and playing war with his friends. At the time of this series, Almaty was a "enemy" soldier, Bernie Wiseman. At the end, Al A little learns a difficult lesson about the reality of war and suffering and necessary sacrifice > <br /> I love this OAV series with a cool mecha design that is related to the story. I recommend this set to anyone who likes SF-like anime or who thinks that anime is just nonsense or sexy entertainment.
