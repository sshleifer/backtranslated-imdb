They have me from the first performance. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Trinity County. A small place similar to Mayberry that is a little different. The sheriff is really Satan. There is no spoiler like you won't understand in the next 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Oh, but that's not all. It turns out that Satan has a son named Caleb. Some people try to make him good. But it was a tough fight. Bakh (Satan) sheriff knew who Caleb was and liked to spend time with him in teaching him the way of darkness and subtle soreness. Mostly he is a hero. Everyone is indebted to him because he often creates a disaster and saves them from it. So every time you think someone will disappoint him, one of his friends can't sabotage. <br /> <br /> When I like it, Lucas and Caleb go out in the woods. cottage And some men with guns decided to rob them Lucas used as an excuse to teach Caleb a lesson about evil. <br /> <br /> Thief (Ted) hesitated to shoot them. Lucas tells Caleb that Ted has half the conscience. If he had no conscience, he would have shot them now. If he had a real conscience, he would not become a criminal. So he started calling him Half-Ted. It's quite funny. He teased the villain. And of course he was in front of the Half-Ted 10 steps all the time, and of course he was able to control completely at all times. They really give you Satan popularity. <br /> <br /> A great performance. It's one of my favorite horror shows of all time. Twilight Zone Night Stalker The circle of Gothic American supernatural fear <br /> <br /> That's a good company.
