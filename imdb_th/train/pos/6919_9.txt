"Winchester '73" marks the first set of Western series related to James Stewart and director Anthony Mann. Most of Stewart's heroes have violence that threatens to explode at any time. <br /> <br /> The name means "One in a thousand" rifles used for a rifle shooting event held in Dodge City on July 4, 1876. Lin McAdam (Stewart) entered the city and a close friend High Spade (Mil. Lard Mitchell, which is on the path of Dutch Henry Brow n (Stephen McNally) for a dastardly act They arrived in time to see Marshal Wyatt Earp (Will Geer) running the Lola (Shelley Winters) saloon outside the city. It turns out that Dutch Henry is still in town for a rifle shot. Lin and Dutch Henry shot it out to win the coveted prize by winning Lin. But Dutch Henry robbed Lin's gun and fled. <br /> <br /> Lin and the Dutch spade route Henry across the country where they met Lola, Steve Miller (Charles Dredd) was held in a US cavalry camp waiting for an Indian attack led by Yongbull (Rock Hudson), who received the prestigious rifle from the killing of John McIntyre. He got the weapon by cheating on the Dutch Henry, the Young Bull Pok√©mon killed during the attack and the gun passed to Steve. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, back to the farm, Lola and Steve met the notorious gunman Waco. Johnny Dean (Dan Duryea), which killed Steve and received a valuable rifle and Lola for himself. When Dean meets the Dutchman Henry, he allows him to take his "gun" back to plan to kill him later. In the city of Tuscaloosa, killing the dean as a Dutchman, Henry plans to occupy the bank. Poor and he escapes to the hills with Lin's quest. In the final shooting of the best, the two met in the final. <br /> <br /> I believe that this film is one of Stewart / Mann's collaborations filmed in B&W. Beautiful, especially the scene in "Wide open space" and especially the final showdown Stewart plays with a type of hero who is motivated to take a serious revenge, the mood he will lead to future movies with Mann. <br /> <br /> As part of the general westerners Players according to the contract of the day In addition to the above mentioned, JC Flippen appears as a sergeant, cavalryman Steve Brodie, James Millican, John Doucette and Chuck Roberson, various henchmen, Ray Aunty as Sheriff, following Duryea, Tony Curtis and James Good.
