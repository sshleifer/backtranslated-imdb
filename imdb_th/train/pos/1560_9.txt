This is a reunification team and a scene of justice. Clark has made a significant leap from a troubled teenager who is afraid of fate that has been controlled to Superman, who, like Green Arrow, has released his emotions to a few loved ones ready to save the world. blade This is not just an exciting story about teamwork, loyalty and friendship. This is about deciding what is more important in life. Lessons for Clark I don't want the series to end. But I hope that the next episode will be attached to what Justice shows without "back", pushing and putting a good end in Smallville --- and Superman's excellent starting point. > <br /> We should now see the difference between Lex and the team. Nine stars should give sufficient credit.
