Many people like this movie and many people like it a lot. But it seems that it's because of the wrong reason. Scarface should be loved and loved. But it's not the way it used to be. <br /> <br /> Many people say that the performance is true. Al Pacino. If saying that Pacino goes above, this is an exaggeration. But he did very well. He just pulled the inner demon out of you well. His character, Tony Montana, is not a great guy who starts with But his thirst for power only brought his greed to another level Inhumane level Of course, Pacino sometimes seems to be comic and surreal. But that didn't make me seem to be responsible. In any way, the supporting actors performed very well. Michelle Pfeiffer wasn't the best in her. But she is suitable for the role she plays. On the other hand, Steven Bauer is his best person. But he is also Steven Bauer Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, good and like Michelle Pfeiffer that suits her role well. Robert Loggia I like watching him just see him shouting apart from Pacino. memorize Everyone seems to be suitable for their role by staying there. They don't get together perfectly. <br /> <br /> Brian De Palma works very well in directing this movie. Whenever an actor can be larger than his life, his performance should be credited by the director and I will definitely give De Palma. Brian De Palma, even if not respected He knows how to bring movies according to their genre. But sometimes it doesn't work well This place is done. This is by all counting the gangster movies. But less than this movie because De Palma <br /> <br /> The writing is great. It's pure Oliver Stone. When I saw the credit at the end of this movie and saw that Oliver Stone wrote this, I wasn't surprised at all. That is a testament to him. I have only him as a great writer and for me he proved this again with Scarface. No one knows how to write a supernatural reality for movies than Oliver Stone. <br /> <br /> The song is good, but it's not great. Of course I don't like Giorgio Moroder. The music is a little 80s-ish for me. But it didn't bother me The movie was good, not amazing. But actually, those who pay attention to this movie <br /> <br /> This may be one of the most influential movies in the past 25 years, but as mentioned earlier, for the wrong reason. People should realize that Tony Montana's character is not a hero. He is a monster. He wasn't already inspired. He is greedy, bloodthirsty, illiterate, and consumes himself. Yet he was a model for many people because he was in some way a rebellion. But may be the most important thing, because he is a lost gangster Vigilante will be like Mother Tereasa next to Scarface. <br /> <br /> The good thing about this movie, although it shows that Tony Montanas' is not a real problem. If we or the authority want to close people like him, we can do it, but we do not act in an unusual and distorted way. He is the person you can blame for everything and make yourself better. Tony Montanas in this world is the scapegoat of our society. There is no excuse for people like him. Instead of being a reminder that we should not justify or allow ourselves to do bad things just because we measure or think that we measure better compared to gangs or drug dealers. I love this movie because it's more than a film about corruption. It's a strange movie that reminds you of yourself.
