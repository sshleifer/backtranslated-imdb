<br /> <br /> Have you ever felt like being watched, like having someone keep tabs on every step you make? Before you decide to break the law, the FBI will always be there. At least that is the feeling that you get after watching the FBI crime drama. It is the foundation of the organization from a small office to one of the most modern facilities in the world (in 1959) by telling stories through the eyes of agents. One person named Chip Hardesty (James Stewart) <br /> <br /> Chippy lived with the FBI from the first day and he was glad to work above all in the world, even sometimes his family. Rail unit of the FBI tracked his life by what he described as a representative and how that affects his personal life. This film serves a great role in showing what types of cases the FBI handles and how to deal with them. The audience will see the Chip stop Ku Klux Klan revolt to reveal the murder / land scandal of India, bringing refugees into custody, rescuing hostages and helping to fight in World War II. He also helped bring the communist spy to justice. <br /> <br /> The steward in the vague, complex performance is the protagonist (as always) as a slightly nervous agent who loves his work. Too little One of the best parts about this film is that we see the inner workings of Chip's family life and his work. We testify to him suffering from the death of his best friend and then his son. We observe his wife's failure and his marriage has a rocky time. Almost all of his personal problems were caused by his love of his work. Vera Miles gave an uncertain performance. But it's very convincing She had never been a great actress before. But there is always something that attracts and attracts you Maybe that's just me Sadly, there are no other performances that are worth mentioning. But the story that attracted that interest made me very interested. <br /> <br /> The movie in this movie is impressive, especially in the South American forest All colors have a surface that determines the film's atmosphere. Perhaps the greatest part of this movie is Mervyn Leroy's incredible direction. Every scene is flowing. They just roll together to tell a wonderful story. It's full of camera shots with some creativity that has Hitchcockian feelings. <br /> <br /> All of the FBI's films are exciting but overlooked. Ticketing at two Half an hour, some viewers may be intimidated. But if you have a chance, I recommend jumping into this one. I enjoy Jimmy Stewart's gorgeous performances and lovely stories.
