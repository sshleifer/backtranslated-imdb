As the second world champion Okinawan Karate, I like movies about sacrifice for sports. But this movie has many more This movie is very good and very deep. Recently, I was disturbed by a very serious injury and a catastrophe. Almost bright for me And this stupid little movie made me feel so deep that it was a bewildering story that reminded me of what life should be This is a movie about living. Live your own life and respect others. Empowering God to bless "Bend it like Beckham" I believe it's a real gem.
