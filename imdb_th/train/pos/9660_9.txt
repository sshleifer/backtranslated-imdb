After deliberation, I decided that I liked this movie. And after reading the comments from all other posters here and thinking more, I decided that I liked it a lot. I love American movies - probably because they tell stories a lot. They often have a well-defined beginning, middle, and late "Presque rien". On the other hand, they don't try. I disagree with other posters that say it is 'Art too' in every area, this film aims to awaken your memories. Often in movies that you feel like there ... You feel the sunshine, summer, hot winds, cold winter, friendship, loneliness and more. <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> Every director directs you into the life of the character, which is why many people feel strongly that the movie disappointed them. After looking at it, I felt the same. But when contemplating, I know that this is what the movie must have: 'The story' is not a story. It's the emotion that you (the audience) feel. <br /> <br /> The scenery and camera angles will make you immerse in the scene - They are full of elaborate and lively with details and differences. Although I generally do not agree with the film without complete development. (After that, it's not a movie that should be told) but this movie is one of my new favorites.
