I might be one of the few people in Australia who didn't watch tennis when this series aired. I must say that when William McInnis first appeared to me, that was a crappy actor! But while the series continues, his performance is reduced and I love him a lot. He is rotten. But he makes me laugh I watched the show to see Hugo Speers (Heart and Bones, The Full Monty) and Tom Long (SeaChange, Two Hands). Tom Longs wave! Sigh ... seriously. Long's performance is great and really wonderful. He stole the show Martin's sack also plays a good role, and the leading actress has entertained. I recommend this program if you enjoy the story by watching and turning around without wearing a shirt ...
