The first movie is an intelligent work of art (film). The plot is full of surprises. The little boy pretends to grow up to receive one million dollars and how he spent his time. I mean how to overcome this Walt Disney beat himself this time The comedy is mostly expected, but other unexpected times I mean this movie, okay or this movie is ok. It also teaches young and intelligent children, and this kid is smart and shorts. But it was terrible The young man like this young man received the attention of the police and his father, allowing him to be free. That is like letting the killer get free bail for ten years. If I were to do that, I would be 'suble jack' (a large stick that sting when used for your buttocks really hard). The child is really lucky. Back to the story The filmmakers really know what they are doing when they do this movie. But still not perfect The performance is good and bad. Children and women without chemistry are not father. But the brothers are excellent. 'Special techniques in return are lame. Including this movie does not depend on reality I hate and love it at the same time.
