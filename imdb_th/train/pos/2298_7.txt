I love the mysterious horror movie and the British Hammer Studios, who presented one of their greatest films. "The Devil Rides Out" (1968) has proved more talented in this horror field. This mysterious tenth episode of the short series "Hammer House of Horror" (1980), "Guardian of the Abyss" is an eerie list for the series. Director Don Sharp, who used to increase the performance of the hammer with "The Kiss of the Vampire" (1963) and "Rasputin: The Mad Monk" (1966) and directed two movies "Fu Machu" starring Christopher Lee. suspect A well-known name among the director of HHH and he also gave it here. The old merchant Michael (Ray Lennen) stumbles on a mysterious old mirror. The resulting glass is the object of the desire of the ghost worship, which is used for the ritual of Satan. When he defended a beautiful girl named Allison (Rosalin Landor), who had to be sacrificed by religious doctrine, Michael experienced deep problems with their horrific cult and leaders. (John Carson) ... At the moment, the favorite episode of "Hammer House of Horror" (the best part, clearly, is the excellent seventh episode "The Silent Scream"). It's a creepy story. And the atmosphere The plot has many interesting twists and remains suspicious and suspicious throughout the story. Ray Lennen is a good leader, Rosalin Lander, a young woman, believed to be the innocent beauty and John Carson is truly eerie as the leader of Satan. "Guardian of the Abyss "is another interesting and creepy story. HHH and my Hammer fans shouldn't miss it.
