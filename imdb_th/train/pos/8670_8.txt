WWE Armageddon, December 17, 2006 - Live broadcast from Richmond Coliseum, Richmond, VA <br /> <br /> Kane vs. MVP in Inferno: So this is an unprecedented competition in WWE and Kane vs. MVP (wondering why it was the first match on the card) I only watched the ending that Kane put the MVP's ass on the fire because they were on the apron. The MVP ran around the stage while shouting? Finally refs extinguish the fire with a fire extinguisher when MVP sprawl around the ramp. Funny and fun ending 7/10 <br /> WWE Tag Team Championship: Now should be William Regal and Dave Taylor with Brian Kendrick and Paul London (c) in the regular tag team competition. However, GM Teddy came to the ring and announced that it would be a Fatal 4 ladder tag game, MNM and The Hardys were thrown in and it was all chaos. The only word to describe this open eye? Wow. Man, I don't remember how many sick spots in this race and the words are not fair. There is one remarkable point, especially at The Hardys, installing a ladder in the position he saw, and Jeff jumped on the rope while Matt caught the MNM for killing and then who! Nitro explodes while Mercury is clearly visible and has a blood like hell with a wound on his face. He must be taken away and grow up in the competition alone. Another point is when Jeff Power joins London while slipping down the stairs. There are other amazing points that fly too high to be remembered. Eventually, London removed the belt to get this crazy show. 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> The Boogeyman vs. The Miz: Two men were thrown in and out of the ring until Boogeyman exploded. The power to sit for victory and then release the worm onto Miz's mouth as usual. 5.5 / 10 For three minutes of anonymous identification, <br /> <br /> Champion of the United States: Chris Benoit (c) Facing Chavo Guerrero in the general Guerrero match, some good points, including the superplex from the top rope By Chavo and the long chain of German suplexes of Benoit that are unusual. Vicki Guerrero entered the ring with a belt to Benoit. But Benoit makes her scared and takes a long time to decide whether to take her to the marksmanship. This makes Chavo able to spin but Benoit spins up again and Chavo is locked in the Sharpshooter. Complete the game. Fighting 7/10 <br /> WWE Cruiserweight Championship: Gregory Helms (c) vs. Jimmy Wang Yang. For this, in a fairly moderate competition Does the competition have a high flying point? Most notably Helms' move out of the top rope ?? But it seems that the crowd will not participate after seeing the competition, ladder and yang need to get more air. The hat will win the race after blowing the rubber out with the knee face. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> The Undertaker and Mr. Kennedy in the Last Ride: After the match between these two, this is a competition. Last Ride II and The winner must take his opponent out of the playing field with a tank. Quite good for what both can offer Kennedy sent a large number of mailers and even dropped out of the chokeslam to throw people out of Armageddon about 15 feet; And thank God for Kennedy. Otherwise, it would be cruel. Kennedy almost won until Taker returned to the inside of the truck. (I like the camera view inside the truck.) The receiver missed the steel pipe, Kennedy and broke the window of the body instead. But later was captured by the opening chair, Kennedy, and followed by a sequence of chokeslam and graves on the roof of the grave. Kennedy lost consciousness and the driver took him out of the scene to win. I found myself really interested in the intentions of these people to really photograph sick people. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Santa entered my ring. "What?" Like many children in the crowd, and then the word "The underwear contest" will enter my ears. <br /> <br /> Batista and John Cena vs. Finlay and King Booker: Talk about special abilities and techniques. This competition is a fairly good main event, with a reasonably driven force from one team to another. Even Finlay had a legitimate shock with his opponent this time. (I wonder if he has the power to win the championship) and he and most bookers do not succeed in trying to cheat? Except at one point that Booker slammed his scepter into the neck of Zina Batista, attacking Bomb on Booker for victory, not going to see FU; Cena shows 5 Knuckle Shuffle, and I think he did STFU as well. This may be the best technical match of the night, and participants really do great for what they can do without a ladder. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Being an open WWE fan and Close. I have to admit that Armageddon was watched a lot throughout the catchers and the ladder race finally swallowed half of the list; The Last Ride competition has some exciting points and the main event is very good for its type. All other matches are based on their billing, except for the Boogeyman and The Miz competition and the series contest. The useless inner Armageddon is very fun to pay to watch, and despite the big defeat in the PPV event, Armageddon would like to say goodbye to this year with respect. PPV score: 8/10
