It can happen anywhere in the right situation. Street entertainers attract the attention of famous singers and subsequent friendships. Age entertainer found / bought a boy to send his art to Then we follow them through the difficulties of their challenges. But free life by the river Traveling in the city to that city, he performed and was famous to a certain extent. Despite the time and influence But men are kind and good. <br /> <br /> Overall, the performance is the first rate, especially Xu Zhu, who shows the image of a street performer. The child (Renying Zhou) is beautiful and strong, serious and durable. Clear justice The two protagonists, along with help from the master opera singer Master Liang (Zhao Zhigang, interesting and interesting), draw a very interesting story about forgiveness, sadness and love. Some people have mentioned the similarity of this film with BA BIE JI BA (FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE); But this film can't stand easily on its own. Any similarity is as far away as possible. <br /> <br /> The only word I have with KING OF MASKS is the ending. It's weak. That is bored and about profound as a sledgehammer The audience is over. In this regard, management is not necessary for anything. It's a shame. In order to bring far better motion pictures just to give up on such emotional (and repetitive) pathos, it makes this movie really good instead of classic movies. It should be. In addition, the King of the Mask is still worth your time. I'm glad to see Shaw Brothers still producing good movies. Highly recommended
