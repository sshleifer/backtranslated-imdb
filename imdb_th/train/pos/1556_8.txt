Like everyone else who commented on "Fr√§ulein Doktor" I stumbled by this small gem on a late night TV that had never been heard before. The strange combination of the story about anti-heroine novels But unscrupulous in one hand and the depiction of realistic warfare and well researched For me, this is one of the five best movies about WWI (the other is "All Quiet On The Western Front", "Paths Of Glory", "Gallipoli" and after the war "La vie et rien d'autre") And the scene with poisonous gas attacks is really cold Horses and men look like horsemen of the Apocalypse with a gas mask. <br /> <br /> I just wish I could record the tape.
