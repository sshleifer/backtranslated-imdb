As a fan of the author John Le Carre, I gradually made my own books and adapted them. I found the 1987 Le Carre masterpiece adaptation in my local library and sat down to see it, thinking that I knew what to expect. I was amazed to discover that my expectations were beyond that in this drama, which was the scene between the spy spy and the human drama. <br /> <br /> Peter Eagan gave a great performance in As Magnus Pym, the perfect spy of the title. Performed in the long tradition of the strongest main character of Le Carre, Pym is also quite the best as well. While the man was forced to live his whole life and betrayal, sometimes leaving the situation and other times just to survive with his consequences. Becoming an Egan plays Pim for Perfect as a man always, if not from another person, Egan alone makes six hours or more of this drama worth seeing from his performance. <br /> <br /> Surronding Egan is a great actor. Ray McAnally gave one of his best performances as Rick's father, Pim's father, Rick (as Le Carre said). Based on the author's father, McAnally plays a man who comes and leaves Pym's life and is one of the people responsible for the Pym that became a "perfect spy" in reality, if not for McAnally One year later in A Very British Coup. This will be the best show of his too short career. <br /> <br /> The rest of the support is also great, from Caroline John as Pym's mother to Alan Howard as His spy advisor to Rüdiger Weigang, as a young Pym's friend, changed the supervisor to Jane Booker, the wife of Pym, an excellent supporter. Special mention from the three young actors playing Pim (Jonathan Haley, Nicholas Haley and Benedict Taylor) The creator of a young man who will become a man played by Peter Egan. <br /> <br /> Value The production of the drama is also strong. When Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and Smiley People 's drama adaptations proved that these stories can only be told in a dramatic fashion. The location is great, from the British location to the locations spread throughout Eastern Europe and the United States, as well as Chris Edwards as the film's producer. Elmer Cossey adds realism to the world of drama. But the highlight of this drama is the screenplay. Actually, <br /> <br /> The screenwriter Arthur Hofkraft managed a wonderful six hundred page novel adaptation. This novel is large. (At least in the beginning) autobiography of Pym's childhood reflects the life of John Le Carre The script for this drama is no exception because it traces the development of Magnus Pym from a young boy to "Perfect spy" mini series never diverted from telling the story of man in the context of the espionage world. If anyone wants to prove that the spy thriller may be tense and fascinating without having to fight with a gun once, fighting with fists or chasing a James Bond style car, this is proof. While the mini-series has a length of six plus hours, it never wastes a moment and it's better for it. <br /> <br /> Although it may be too long for some people who don't have a short concentration Here must be found. From the performances of Peter Egan and Ray McAnally, to good production values ​​and good literary scripts, Perfect Spy is one of the best plays that can be expected to be seen. It was an interesting journey in the history of the Cold War. But it is more than that It was a journey that John le Carre called "the secret path": the path of spies, people who had to lie and betrayed for survival. Whether it's a human drama as a spy, A Perfect Spy that shouldn't be missed.
