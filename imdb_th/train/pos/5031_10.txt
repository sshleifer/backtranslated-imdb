This film is beautifully designed! No flaws Not in the design of the sound light plot series. The script is an invitation to a complex game that participants are on a simple mission. <br /> <br /> Paxton is the best person in this role. His manner of infection used in his voice was useless. Each shot is made meticulously! The surprise appeared again when the movie arrived in the first hour. This may not be the best picture of the year. But is a jewel that has been polished well Not for a simple mind
