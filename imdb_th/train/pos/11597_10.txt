I read many comments that I also share about remembering this movie and want to be terrible to watch again. But I don't know the name of the movie Fortunately, since searching and searching for titles on this website, I read the comments here and realized that this is a movie that I can remember. Then I searched and searched the movie and was excited to see the movie again in the next 40 years. Since this website and your opinion, you help me and I want to thank you all. I want to share how I can find this movie for anyone looking for a copy as well. It is the VHS version of the Wonderful World of Disney "Call it Courage", which has two movies. Own copy I think it's only available on the VHS. I found it on eBay and I saw it in many books. Enjoy it, I know I do! <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful story about the love of boys and eagles that they care for. When it was time to sacrifice the eagle, the boy let the eagle free because he refused to be killed. After the boy was forced to leave the tribe for punishment after the Eagle was released, the eagle saved the lives of the children and, moreover, taught him how to survive. The intimacy that boys and eagles share in the wilderness is impressive and filming is amazing. It's a wonderful era. I have never seen anything close to this movie!
