I agree with the comments above. I love the realism in this story and in many movies. (Not just an unusual eating movie) Producers seem to forget that They use the problem every day and create a very dramatic scene, and then come to the end of every movie, perfect again, which I don't like because it's not true. Does not mean saying that things are not better and do not mean things that are not in this movie But it didn't take most of the movies that created all these problems and the end of the movie ended everything perfectly again. When people were eating disorders, not only people But accepting and wanting to be better, then life is a peach. It takes time and I like the way in this film that we grow up with our characters through difficulties with them. Better and worse because it's an important part of the movie. It comes into the minds of people who have eating disorders and shows the complications and pain in a very realistic way and I like it. I like that it shows that people who are secret and betrayal feel when suffering from eating disorders. It's scary to see how people react when they discover, especially if they see it. with I think this movie is very impressive and beautiful and can tell well and challenge one of my favorites.
