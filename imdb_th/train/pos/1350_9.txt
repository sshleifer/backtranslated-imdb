In "Anne of Green Gables" (1934), Marilla Cuthbert (Helen Westley) and Matthew Cuthbert (OP Heggie), a middle-aged brother who lives together at Green Gables farm in Avonlea on Prince Edward Island. Boys from a distant orphanage to help on their farms But an orphan who was sent to be a 14 year old girl named Anne Shirley (Arun Evelyn Paris - a veteran in Disney's "Alice" shorts, which will later use her character's name) <br /> <br /> Anne, only 11 in Lucy Maude Montgomery's original novel But the same actress cannot be trusted from the age of 11 to the college level at the time of the story This film suffered from this concession due to the numerous reactions of Ann and what she said had more fun than from an eleven year old boy from a teenager. In this book, Ann is bright and fast, eager to come to mind. But not satisfied with her name, her shape, freckles and her long red hair Ann had a very happy life and adapted to her new family and the environment of Prince Edward Island. <br /> <br /> Actually Anne is The original "Queen Drama Teen" and the screenwriter chose to focus on her character. Which changed the basic genre from comedic family drama to comedy The changes that make the audience happy and still make the reader unsatisfied But to act as a fair reminder for anyone who expects to have a completely honest adjustment The funny element is the strength of this film because it is one of the fastest self-reflection parody of the Hollywood Convention. Actress Anne Shirley is one of Hollywood's forever beauty, and the film is both black and white. Lots of fun to see the endless characters of the title, about the look and color of her hair that conflict with what appears on the screen. Ann doesn't make you regret about the ridiculous rural friends who have a realistic line, like: "If you deny it will be sadness for the rest of my life." Maybe the most fun time is when she corrects the spelling of the name of She is on a blackboard in the classroom. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown works well because of Anne's love. Neighboring neighbors The love of Connecticut /> <br /> Hurt Then again <br I know nothing. I am only a child
