Well, let's face each other. This is a very scary movie. The story (like this) is terrible, but this movie was made for one reason and the same reason. This case Pavarotti during his best time Okay, maybe the movie Lanza is an excuse for him to hit a girl. But this movie about listening to Luciano alone is worth watching movies. A large star that stuck to himself, faced with his fears, found humility and love at the same time, and with a large number of belts Level. I am an Italian. I am a big Pavarotti fan. (There is nothing about the big Pavarotti, including his fan base) And when I saw this movie for the first time, I went out on my own, seeing the height and depth of life's possibilities. And love for the first time The sound and beautiful memories are enough to give me a deep breath of life and love again. <br /> <br /> Yeah, it looks sad and terrible. But the sound is timeless and timeless and the sound is important So I rate this movie in the hope that people who have never heard of Pavarotti before listening to and watching and enjoying music and love at a new level, especially when he left Like Italian food that you never tried before, try it! You may be surprised as a lover of Luciano or Peep Pavarotti in the future.
