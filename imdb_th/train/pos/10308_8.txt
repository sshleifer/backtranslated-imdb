Morgan Freeman is more unusual like God than George Burns? This movie is sure to be better than bored "O Lord". I am fully devoted and LMAO along the way. Carrey is the perfect person because of the strange Anchorman Wannabe and Aniston takes her to be a frustrated girlfriend in play I do not think that she is ugly or insolent. I think my favorite scene is when Carrey opens the locker, thinking that he can't keep his life history. See if you can see the file in the cabinet that holds his joke bathroom event Write well and play better than this comedy. It will go down as one of the best jokes.
