Great epic, as it is, Kenneth Branagh's great rendition of William Shakespeare's most popular tragedy under the weight of four hours of play time. Two separate parts, totally separate, would be better to fully appreciate what makes the movie filming absolutely advanced. While I certainly acknowledge this masterpiece But I have to confess that there is a lack of enthusiasm for his famous, lively voice. (And he sent himself better) and many of his prosperity, so "Hamlet" lost the impact when losing his grip. <br /> <br /> From Patrick Doyle's songs to Alex Thomson's movie To the beautiful scene of Tim Harvey, this movie is a feast of pictures and beautiful ears. Chuck Bracken brings three large robes to be adapted and played. His adjustment was excellent, his direction was strong. But when the role of Hamlet, stress seemed to be expressed Still, he still works well in things that have an incredible taxi role. Derek Jacoby was pleased with the cardinals with delight and Julie Christie was the most amazing as Gertrude Richard Briers was fantastic, like Polonius and Charlton Heston, again influential as other King players. Many stops, including Jack Lemmon (Excellent in a small role), Billy Crystal, Judy Dench, Sir John Mills, John Jill Ged, Sir John Gigel, The Show Award must be one. In the great discovery of Kate Winslet in the last few years She is a moving image of the most tragic figure in all matters. Ophelia <br /> <br /> To finish (Before this review is longer than movies) I have to say that it is the length of the test. The audience in this film, Branagh, directed the performance with the aim of making important scenes and many effects. There are too many people to welcome. Watching this movie is a great reminder of the pearls of wisdom that we gather. "Whether it's a lender or a borrower" or "Be honest to yourself" and of course: "Will it be or not? <br /> <br /> The two-hour opening will take diligence. But if you manage to track the progress, you are sure to get a thrilling compilation practice. The thrust from the tragic funeral onwards. <br /> <br /> Monday 8 June 1998 - Hoyts Croydon
