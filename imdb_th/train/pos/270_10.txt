I must say that Seventeen and Missing is much better than I expected. The recognition I received from the example is that it will be boring. But I was amazed by this impressive mystery. <br /> <br /> Dedee Pfeiffer is Emilie, the mother who confirms her daughter. Lori (Tegan Moss) does not attend a graduation party called one night. But Lori ignores her mother's wishes and goes to the next party. When Laurie didn't return home, Emilie knew something was wrong and she began to have a picture of her daughter and an event that caused her to disappear. <br /> <br /> Seventy & missing better than the TV movie. Many other types of this type, due to unpredictable Pfeiffer, is the reason to watch this movie and most of it comes out to be reliable. The original LMN movie was shown last night. 10/10
