This movie is very good, easy. It's rare that you will find a comedy that has level, and this is a very good example. When I saw this movie before credit accumulated friends and I looked at another and asked ... 'You just caught that? For those wondering, look at the level. See the comparison between Vick and the people in the DNA Club! Look at the various characters and positions. If you don't see anything, see the connection between the treatment of the wig and the movie path. It's in the head of VICK! Open line about the world of Vick The scene covered by the camera enters Vick's head and inside is the whole universe! Comic cartoon thugs that look beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
