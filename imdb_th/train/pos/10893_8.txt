It's good that I rented a movie before seeing the ratings of the audience from this website. It is a wonderful movie that I will add to my Christmas selection. The actors were wonderfully chosen and Ben Affleck had a good lead role. I will tell the audience who didn't watch this movie to go ahead and buy. I voted there for the Christmas holiday. The film is very funny and very well written, and Ben plays a very wealthy executive. What he says and does is I imagine people who have too much money to do. This film is more fun than The Santa Claus and Christmas With The Kranks. There is also a good story and teach the true meaning of Christmas, which you can't buy love for money.
