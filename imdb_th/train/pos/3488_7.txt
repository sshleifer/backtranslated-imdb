WWE needed a savior when Wrestlemania 14 rolled around. The departure of Brett Hart and Hart's evaporation later allowed the Vile D-Generation X to become unstable in the WWE. Their Shawn Michaels stole the name from Hart due to the interference of Vince McMahon and with the help of his teammates, Triple H and Chyna led the system to challenge his supremacy in a systematic way. g Appeared Cold Steve Austin hates McMahonagement. Austin is worried about DX, so in the fact that they need help from "The Baddest Man on the Planet" Mike Tyson is a special practitioner. Austin will have a chance to negotiate with him firmly in the meeting game with Shawn Michaels. <br /> <br /> But first, there is an undercard that must pass, which kicks out with the Legion of Doom that won 15 battles. Remembering as # 1 of the tag, I really forgot this match until I checked the PPV again. Nothing good and emphasized the lack of depth of the tag during that time. <br /> <br /> Make an appointment. Next, see the name of Light Heavyweight that is protected by Champion Taka Michonoku and Aguila WWE. The Light Heavy Weight Title to compete with. The strongest Cruiserweight Division in WCW is not successful, and this is the only time the title will be defended at Wrestlemania. The short competition will take about five minutes and in fact is too short to succeed. The little things that they do are exciting and this is a good match, which saw Taka still retain his name. <br /> <br /> OK, our next match saw members of the Triple DX H cover. The name of the WWE European, in which he won the bizarre fashion from Shawn Michaels in RAW in December and did not prevent PPV and Owen Hart. The survivor Sole Triple H had a big entrance with the band DX there to show his songs. Balanced but being handcuffed to the WWE Commissioner Sgt Slaughter, Triple H and Owen paired well before Shinana intervened to make Hart a little punch which led to Triple. H received the position A good match would be even bigger than this. <br /> <br /> But of course we don't want to leave our next match, which saw Marc Mero, a real-life husband and wife. Sable Goldust defeated and Luna Vachon in the first mixed tag match at Wrestlemania in 8 years. And in all honesty, it's not worth the wait. While not scary, the competition is not memorable as well. This is the end of Mero's single run in WWE and the main purpose is to continue his relationship with Sable. <br /> <br /> Next, we see Ken Shamrock turning around. Which he destroyed the IC Champion The Rock, but then refused to release his hand from the locked ankle, resulting in the referee returning his decision This is a short competition, but is suitable for what it is. <br /> <br /> Continue to see the first good match of the night due to the WWE Tag Team Champions in the new era of outlaws losing their position to Cactus. Jack and Chainsaw Charlie Fun Trash Competition The decision was overturned the next night when the cactus and fanatic threw the outlaw into the trash behind the stage instead of being used in the competition. But this is still a fun game. <br /> <br /> It was not the time for the first meeting between Kane and Undertaker. His younger brother Kane had an Undertaker the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble. He when he helped Shawn Michaels lock the Undertaker in the coffin and put him in the fire to avenge the Undertaker who burned their parents' house and left him horribly many years ago. This is an appropriate match and tells a good story because Underataker absorbs everything Kane can throw at him and slam him with a three-hole grave to finish the race. <br /> <br /> This is the only event. The main thing that saw the WWE champions have to face Steve Austin and Mike Tyson as a guest. Michaels suffered a mild injury in the match against the Royal Rumble Undertaker and was outstanding in this match despite physical limitations. Triple H and Chyna were exiled. Back in the first period after external intervention The match ended in an effort at Austin Drake, Sweet Chin Music and hit Stone Cold Stunner with reference. Then, TYson entered the arena to count three celebrations with Austin and then knocked Michelle out of the competition. It turned out that Tyson and Austin were together, and the cat played with the mouse all the time. <br /> <br /> That was the final PPV competition for Shaw Michelle, four and a half years. It helped to create Austin as the greatest star in the wrestling business, and important publicity from Tyson's appearance proved to be a major turning point in WWE's fight with WCW. Austin would become the biggest star. In WWE history and with Rock, Mick Foley, Undertaker and Triple H leading the WWE throughout the period when they will receive the highest level of cultural relevance And everything starts here at Wrestlemania 14
