I'm tired of 4 to 5 year old daughters who have to watch Disney jukebox and others. Everything seems to be old, tired and repeated cartoons over and over again. When my daughter couldn't go to work this afternoon because one of them was sick, I wanted them to rest and rest for a moment. I turned on the TV and searched for different things. I flipped the channel. My finger stopped surfing channels when I heard Harvey's voice. I love all the loneliness that this man has done and when I saw that he was making a voice for a small duck ... well, I can't change the channel! My daughter immediately enjoyed the cartoon and the more we watched the TOGETHER program, the more I loved it and the message that was shown. It doesn't have to show "gay rights", but for anyone who has been a child for anything. I have a friend who gets to choose either one or the other .... too fat, too thin. A woman is a bully, not smart enough. There is only one parent .... You name it! In general, children are very cruel to each other, so I am happy to see fun cartoons that convey the meaning of the lives of viewers. My girls accept other people like them and do not choose others because of differences. My eldest daughter stood up for her friends if they chose (Happened to have a single mother and a little girl who was chosen frequently - it warmed my heart when Kassie stood up for her!) <br /> So you guys who condemn this performance because you feel it Support "gay rights" or be forced to "Accepting certain perspectives" You clearly and completely missed the point of this little cartoon. <br /> <br /> And if you want it, explain it to you .... Well, you need more help than any TV program. That has been provided
