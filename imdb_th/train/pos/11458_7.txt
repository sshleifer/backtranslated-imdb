Hello again from the darkness Understand the mind and inspiration of great artists. Surprisingly, most people see people who have to work ... no matter what the conditions are, the reason for his life ends Seeing the statue of Goldsworthy still alive and seeing his reaction to each person is very voyeur. This artist created because he had to - not for money or reputation. It is his life When you see his failure, energy seems to be expelled from his body like a hot air balloon. It is not the fear of starting again that he uses his energy from his work. Watching him create only to have natural possession and remember that his work is quite painful. But still amazing He talks about the flow and time in the least conversation and seems to have little doubt that the artist and the world are one. When he said he wanted the world But it doesn't need him ... I ask differently The only complaint is that the music score seems to be slowing down.
