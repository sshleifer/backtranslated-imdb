Deathtrap is not an investigation It is someone who will do with anyone before. It's very difficult to explain this movie without leaving anything at all, so I'm not going to talk about the plot again. As long as the show is still Cris Reeves, the greatest role as Clifford, a young playwright You see the range of his acting abilities in this film since "Breathe cheeseburgers" until serious fear Clifford is a serious role in playing and on stage, I have never seen Clifford play well on both sides. The actor plays him like a small puppy or a madman. Reeves is the only person I can see who has the right character all the way for Michael Caine. He ... Well, Michael Caine, one of the best actors in the last 50 years and in movies This story is the same as he used to be.
