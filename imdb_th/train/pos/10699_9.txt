When I saw the birthday girl, I liked it a lot, so I set out to watch the movie Nicole Kidman, all the things I could do to make them disappointed when compared to this movie. I set the theory that while the presence of one star will always guarantee a certain level of quality due to the control of their art with Nicole Kidman, the influence that she exerted is dangerous to the entertainment of the movie - IMHO, for example. Like Dogville, even to discourage viewers from anything that is seen to divert the existing understanding. She is returning home or other films that send Gays and lesbians to the interests of others <br /> <br /> Here she is a woman and she is doing a fantastic job, really. I can't say who or who can control her. The way in which this film shows her openness, even though her resistance is at the heart of what makes women a woman And for this reason, what makes the hopeless hope of mankind a little to be achieved One listener seemed to imagine the expansion of Ego Man. But his changes are reliable enough It was not horribly invented because it was created to create a male ego. But it saved the necessary growth that arose from the unique situation of the film. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is a lot of charm that the criminals have shown to be completely human, apart from criminal missions their Her gang has a rough and broken friendship, unlike American culture. And while they are their enemies, they are not really their enemies As a result, they taught him to compete. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised at Kidman's ability to appear in Russian. I wonder if your ancestors are Russian or not. But without her photos I checked, found that there were any hints, maybe just make-up But it was amazing. <br /> <br /> I hope that they will hit her head again soon so that she can create another great movie. Even my free digging at Ms. kidman, this message is a great movie in every area and may be the role of life.
