THE PERVERT'S GUIDE to CINEMA (2007) **** <br /> <br /> If Loving Cinema makes me a warp person, so be it! <br /> <br /> If you are 'moviefreak' that is true like me So I'm sure you will get enough movies about making movies, and I don't mean that this documentary must be known. I mean all the discourse about the movie viewing experience. If so, I will be testing the movie for you. <br /> <br /> In Sophie, Phenomena (Ralph's sister & Joseph, if you wonder), save the sage cinephile Slavoj Zizek in Analyze him Impressive cinema (And often aggressively) spent everything from the quiet era of Chaplin to the modern era of the analysis of the Wachowski brothers, detailed and copious about mental, social, economic and magic participation With his unflagging thesis, determination and close-force from explaining that the house of The Bates in PSYCHO reflects the spirit of Norman Bates, conflicting at each level as his Ego. Superego & Id is one thing The incredible faith test that wins over the skeptic. <br /> <br /> Although I don't know who Zizek is? He is similar to the hybrid of filmmaker Brian DePalma, European actor Rade Serbedzija, and the hyperkinetic energy of Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese. With his brothers' language and passion, the host came as a mad prophet. br>> <br /> Fiennes inserts Zizek in the background of many movie clips that are full of funny sounds. But still allowing the outcry and delirium to continue, arguing over three films covering the scope of the film The likes of Kubrick, Lynch, Hitchcock and movies are diverse, such as THE WIZARD OF OZ, THE RED SHOES and FIGHT CLUB. <br /> <br /> There is something for everyone and if a man can cause Argument or at least there is a reason to discuss the style of the movie? Even if they are Freudian / Jungian is wrong? If so, I said that the theory of this movie is worth the watch. Find it now if you can do it before reaching the home video. It's the only way to appreciate it.
