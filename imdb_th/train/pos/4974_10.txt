This is a delightful presentation. Hemo (blood) as a Greek god, plays very well with animations that are arrogant, arrogance, arrogance, absurdity and innocent wonder. Words (or scenes) that I clearly remembered that when Hemo Yang's "All these plumbing ... You haven't learned my secret" and threatened to invade, the scientist answered him with one word "Thalassa" - the salt water that made. In Novelist But makes the hemolse and blood chemistry completely separate. <br /> <br /> A great combination of entertainment and information makes this classic look refreshing and lively from today until the launch date. Stimulating interest and imagination is the basis of teaching children to love learning.
