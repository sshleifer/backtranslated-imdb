They started small - Ben & Logan's mother began an email campaign to bring Darius's knowledge to the state: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and raise funds for fellas to take Darius, not just seeing the ocean To say that young college friends have successfully applied hope and awareness of this terrible disease They realized the dream of Darius and some people knew. They rested on life while showing love, care, and lots of fun to Darius while helping Darius see how he can show the same nature to others suffering from DMD. Go to become a Red Cross volunteer - sit on his chair, collect money (With friends) outside the local grocery store His wonderful smile tells the world that dreams come true - what you need is hope and a group of friends in college to support and care for you. Give Oscar to Darius and everyone - no one deserves more Martha Sweeney
