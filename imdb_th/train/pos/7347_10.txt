I am the owner of Ralph Bakshis that has been forgotten as a masterpiece of fire and ice on an old OOP rental video tape. <br /> <br /> For one thing, this is better than other Conan-esque movies you've seen. Of course, it's wonderful, but who cares? It is a test of time and the only way to begin to look worthless is to compare with modern fantasy epics like LOTR: FOTR (although I like this movie) <br /> <br /> The story is as follows: After the battle between Fire & Ice, the king's daughter was kidnapped by a geologic creature, Jarols (Ice), while the only survivor in the victim's village saved her life. <br /> <br /> Yeah, it's not. Like a tree But Betty is not the point It is an interesting fact about the world of two enemies: fire and ice and it is successful. <br /> <br /> For the action scenes: excellent. They are well managed. Very suspicious and very noisy Just check the air fight. Now it's over. <br /> <br /> Actions and conversations: really talented. They won't be nominated for an Academy Award. But they are ok and don't worry. <br /> <br /> The animation is quite good, taken in 3D and swirled (I think). It looks quite good. Many backgrounds look detailed and appealing well, and although the character design gives a little 1 dimensional feeling, but ok. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a little gem that is right. Abandoned beyond any great "entertainment" 10/10
