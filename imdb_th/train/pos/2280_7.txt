Difficult to categorize movies - probably an avant-garde spy thriller. Yes, Mother Night is Vonnegut's great novel and of course is one of his easiest novels to adapt to lengthy movies The film adaptation is very faithful to the original book. The "indie" approach to creating this movie may be more effective than having a large Hollywood studio to finance. Today, I wonder if the smart novel like Mother Night will receive green light from a large Hollywood mill. And usually it's very bad But not in this case. Mother Night has a tight direction and is a solid actor. Nick Nolte, who seems to be getting a better role as he grows older, has a personality. "Ordinary people" that allows him to use a variety of characters. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and wonderful as always. I always thought that she deserved better than she left the entertainment industry. I guess your debut as a dead girl (Twin Peaks) with little airtime is not the best option, even if the TV program becomes a minor phenomenon. However, this movie is completely fun and you don't have to read the book to understand the movie. In fact, from the current political reality, the location of the novel may appear. The date and the younger audience with knowledge of history will be fully confused by the events that occurred. Industrial world in geography, history and lord know other subjects!)
