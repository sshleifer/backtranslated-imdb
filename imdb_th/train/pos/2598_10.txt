As if the film had no value in itself, this was a great way to get an overview of this novel as an introduction to reading. Fall in the graduate school, I read the book for the first time. The joy of reading this novel is my memory of a detailed movie. And better or worse - and now I have read and taught novels for over three decades - Milo O'Shea is still Leopold Bloom
