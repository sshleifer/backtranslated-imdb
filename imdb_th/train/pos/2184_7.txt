While the music was happy enough, what was attached to me about this film was the unexpected funny chemistry between Basil Rathbone as a songwriter and Oscar Levant as his assistant. Play art that is stressful and distracted. (A far way from his more familiar role, whether it is a villain or a logical villain, Sherlock Holmes) Rathbone's character looks like he can't find a way out of the bed without help And that is the help of Starbucks, playing with humorous humor by Oscar Levant When hiring Crosby's character as a ghost song writer, Rathbone introduced him to Starbucks by saying "He did everything I thought for me," Levant replied. "Ah, it's a part-time job." Of course, it will pass in the past. (Or more) Rathbone is too busy to listen to his hit songs As other critics say, who knows that Rathbone can be very funny! Unfortunately, he had no chance to show his comedic abilities.
