This peculiarity from Roman Polanski shows clearly what time he was obsessed with him. Polanski played a shy person who rented an apartment in Paris that the tenant had previously committed suicide. He was obsessed with discovering what led her to the point where he was dressed by dragging and reenacting events in ways that they might unfold. This film creates insecurity and an atmosphere of horrific fear that Polanski is capable of, but it comes out too much in the form of "Rosemary's Baby" and "Repulsion". The other two are better than Polanski in the apartment. <br /> <br /> But for the enchantment .... If I didn't read too many movies, I must believe that this was Polanksi's reaction to the feelings of persecution he felt. Was identified as a misuse and exiled from America Did not judge about him in some way But it is difficult to deny that evidence in the movie. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
