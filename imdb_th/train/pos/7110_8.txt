John Garfield plays the Marines who are blinded by the bombing while fighting with Guadalcanal and must learn to live with his disability. He has a concept of blindness disorders, and of course he will be a burden to everyone. The hospital staff and his wounded Marines friend cannot pass through. Eleanor Parker cannot play this game. He is stubborn and blinded by his own fear, self-pity and prejudice. It was a complex role that Garfield had to do memorablely in a great performance that gave only one audience, despite the syrupy melodrama. The best scene is the Guadalcanal, where he is in the nest. The machine gun tries to protect the Japanese soldiers who are fighting in the night that looks evil and later becomes a dream sequence in the hospital. His girlfriend walked back from the camera.
