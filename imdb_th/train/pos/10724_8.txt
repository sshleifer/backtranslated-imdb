This is one of the movies that feels good on Saturday afternoon. It was there with other retro flicks, such as Flight of the Navigator, just a cute movie with a light comedy to make things lighter. And it was fun to see that 20 years with star changes like Kelly Preston and Lea Thompson. Not to mention Joquin Phoenix. <br /> <br /> I like this movie occasionally. Nothing is too deep or scary. Just a good story And I will never know Mr. Phoenix. Recently, I didn't read the credit. He is really a baby. When he created this movie, <br /> <br /> Kelly Preston is a new actress. She and Tung have done a great job in this film. I agree that it's not an Oscar movie. But it looks very worthwhile Especially if you have children in the range of 8 to 11 years or people who are interested in the space program
