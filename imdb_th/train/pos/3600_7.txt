At first glance, I expect this movie to be crappy because I think the story will be too feminist, but I am wrong as you may read in the comments published earlier. This is not a hassle. I never had the idea that the main character was exaggerating her position as a woman. It was like Guzman was presented as a spine, in contrast to her classmates. So I was amazed by the story. In fact, I thought it was quite good, except for the predictable ending. Maybe it is a better idea to make plans change, so the audience is more surprised. <br /> <br /> In addition, I would like to say that Rodriguez has received respect from The way she brought her character away I can't really explain why, but especially in the love scene that you convinced me. It looks real. I think <br /> <br /> I gave 7 in 10 just because of a boring half hour.
