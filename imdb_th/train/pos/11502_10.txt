As an explorer / photographer in the forty cities and old fans of the Kolchak series: The Original Night Stalker, from my childhood, there is one aspect that is not really mentioned: the number of surveys in the city of Carr In the series He often manages to leave one of the great drains or tunnels. Only his reliable flashlight (Okay, so he has some flames in the monkey tunnel) and his camera. He never holds any other equipment to protect himself or make the survey easier. <br /> <br /> Like many here. Recently bought a DVD set of two pilot films and the next episode from the TV and had to review all the items slowly. And even though I remember watching them go back in the early 70s when they first aired, it passed 30 years ... They were a whole lot of new look again. Campy is outdated and wonderful - but charming. And highly entertaining They didn't do this today. Now, all the turbulence comes back again with the characters and predictable plans. <br /> <br /> Thank you, my 16-year-old daughter. Sit down to watch the episode with me and develop a kind of appreciation for them. ) It gives me hope and faith. This series will continue for the next generation of fans in the years to come.
