As a Barbra fan, those who post this will have prejudices. In addition, this movie is a classic. (Focus on other posts) but give time (late 70s) that will never be there again and it is interesting to look at the screen Make this movie her own I don't think she will be satisfied But it made her fans know Barbra (at that time) by singing live, the new appearance of the young and the heavy acting. But the excitement and interest throughout. The final "finale" frame is difficult for most non-Barbra fans to sit. But it speaks to people who appreciate her talent. <br /> <br />
