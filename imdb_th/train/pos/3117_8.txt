I will start by saying that I am very pleased with the trilogy of Bond Trilogy. Please do not destroy it by doing the following sequences or as a prequel. Let it be alone, correct .. moving. With the ability and variety as Matt Damon is ... It seems that he intends to play Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the first two films of Bourne, you won't be disappointed with the third episode It adheres to things that are usable and adds a bit more. I am pleased to see that all the information we have received in the 'Identity' and 'Supremacy' all belong to the network in 'Ultimatum' to draw a full picture of the past with Jason Bourne's problem. And make you sit on the edge of the seat The fight between Bond and the killer is always fun to watch. I'm a big fan of movies around the CIA and CIA representatives. How to gather their Intel and this movie is on that road makes it even more exciting for me. <br /> <br /> If you choose to watch The Bourne Ultimatum without looking at the previous 2 sectors .. You will still enjoy the movie thoroughly. But I suggest you look before This will help you fully understand the character of Jason Bourne and become part of his world. This allows you to appreciate and enjoy more movies. I'm not sure which one is better than the first 2, but I personally think 'Ultimatum' might just be advantageous when comparing the trilogy.
