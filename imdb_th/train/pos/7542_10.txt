This film will not sit well with some people, but it must look. I'm glad that people come to talk about the reality of African-American couples who work to make a name in the community and how many of them feel. That trying to be there "other" African Americans moved in. <br /> <br /> (Minor Spoilers) <br /> <br /> This showtime movie is a little like Spike. Lee Joint ... You have a male African American (Danny Glover) That worked his way through the traditional white legal profession in the 1970s. Like the Americans, he moved his family to be compatible with his mobile status. But forget that there are still many problems that arise The only African American in the neighborhood is a maid. Who is the owner of the house? <br /> <br /> Then the mix began. His wife (Whoopi Goldberg) was ordered to "participate" so she did what other women in the neighborhood of she makes And when the man thought he and his family were "in" the next door, another African American who came in because they were awarded the "Lotto" (Mo'nique) and in the eyes of He and he don't want to relate to them. Because he doesn't want neighbors to think that they are the same Of course, he has a better ability than his new neighbor. "Ghetto" shouldn't be there! Who has a problem now? <br /> <br /> The thing that this movie shows you is the great pain that our families face and the way they lose themselves in the process. It makes you ask whether racism begins and ends at ... and with whom it shows that no matter what color you are and how much money you have, you can also shut yourself from the real world. And help those around you It also shows that these African-American children, when in a familiar area, such as falling into the trap of changing themselves to fit the culture (With blonde hair and blue eyes They laughed with a joke, not knowing that they were funny and unconscious .. Why <br /> <br /> But overall, this movie is about 'people', no matter what kind of race you play. This makes you scared of neighbors and against each other ... all this because you think that it suits you all because you feel that you have more money than others. You automatically - and you forget the battles you have and those. The <br /> <br /> Again, not for everyone. But watch and judge for yourself. <br /> <br />
