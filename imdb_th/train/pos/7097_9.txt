Just kidding. I rented 12 Monkeys the day before because I was a big fan of Bruce Willis and I heard something about this movie. Good and bad But it's one of those movies that you have to pay attention every second, so I'm a little worried. Just because I felt like one minute, if it would be one of the movies that I had to watch many times. But I watched last night and I was really impressed. This movie has everything in it: action, drama, cyber-fire, history, dark humor and even a little love. All the actors worked brilliantly. I gave Bruce a lot of credit while he was in the car with his psychiatrist. He really received me. But Brad Pitt, I was surprised by his wonderful work. He didn't make his character crazy and made it usable and very convincing. The story is scary. But very good and waking up Now, animals are ruling over the ground, while humans are below. But scientists sent James to the past of 1990 (meaning sending him to '96) to find information about the virus. James received a mental institution to meet with his new psychiatrist, Dr. Kathryn Rally and another psychiatric patient, Jeffrey Gronen He told them in the future. Of course, no one believed him. He will return to the future. But the scientist sent him back to the correct year to go to the doctor to be kidnapped by James But he told her more and believed him Now they're trying to prevent viruses from happening. <br /> <br /> 12 Monkeys are incredible movies. As I have said that the story is so scary, just because it is not difficult to believe that we are not far from that event. But all the movies are excellent. The whole set of characters is great. It has a terminator feeling that we may lose something precious in one day if we don't listen to others. What is right and wrong? Who knows? But I would recommend 12 Monkeys. It's a great movie that if you give the right opportunity, I'm sure you will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> 9/10
