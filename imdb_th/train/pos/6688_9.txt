In the history of movies based on the comic book "Mystery Men" is one of the lowest evaluated movies. This is not a normal superhero cartoon movie! It follows the exploits of the Motley Wannabes team, including Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), Shoveller (William H. Macy), Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and Spleen (enough Ruben) "Mystery Men" spoofs many Superman movies, such as "Superman" or "Batman", such as sharp words and secret identity questions. Most super heroes are not billionaires like Bruce Wayne. But is a blue collar with work on men and houses that are neurotic So it seems that the director Kinka Usher will make the hero become something that the average audience can relate to. I find "Mystery Men" very exciting and funny. Although it doesn't become a franchise But still happy to see!
