I love this movie The first time I saw it when I was 20 (which was only four years ago) and I really enjoyed it, I brought my own copy the next day. The jokes play well by everyone involved. I had to go back and watch the scene where Tsanders explained why he found water at 6 feet in one area and 227 feet in another area. Look for Jason Robards's father.
