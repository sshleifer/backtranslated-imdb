I enjoy this movie because it is fun because I have seen Sean Connery perform and this story has the added bonus of Ed Harris and Lawrence Fishburne in this movie as well. This story has Grandma waiting for help from Connery because of her grandson in prison. She said that he had been convicted. At first it seems that there may be some aspects of the class. But later it appeared that the main official in that case was a black person and it seemed that he had done some bad things to oppress the boy's confession. The boy tried to point to another killer who was imprisoned in the prison who was about to be killed. He is particularly disgusting, as he is happy with what he does, writing to the relatives of his victims and trying to get people to send letters. There are many twists and turns in this one with some unexpected. I like Sean Connery's character, trying to understand all the tests. This movie makes me crazy in the area, especially when you know what has happened in the end. You get the mutual influence between Connery and Harris and Connery and Fishburne because they are all quite good in this story. In the end, this makes the suspect / thriller quite good.
