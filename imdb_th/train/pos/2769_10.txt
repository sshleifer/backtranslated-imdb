This film has the size and grandeur of many great biblical epics in the 1950s and 60s, but it may be the first time that the biblical characters are human. The best thing about this is that it does not diminish in the eyes of the audience. This is a unique and attractive balance that helps us realize that even the greatest people like David still have flaws that find their faith and greatness in the face of flaws. <Br /> <br /> Actors are the first in the movie. Gilbert Barnett is David's second son, absolute to Susan Hayward, who is great like Bathsheba. Hayward is her best in this movie. Her truth But bigger than the way of life of the performances, rather here But she has a role that you sympathize with her. <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey did a great job as Nathan the prophet. As a child, when I watched the first movie, Massey, it seems that he had just talked to the Lord and was truly a wonderful picture. There is no doubt that he was helped by the great music composed by the remarkable Alfred Newman, who was also very successful in other biblical epics such as "The Robe" and "The Greatest Story Ever Told "with 100 other movies! The cinematic photography by Leon Shamroy did a great job and also increased the size of the movie. Henry King, a truly low-cost film director who likes William Wyler, never pigeons himself into any one line. Show greater than life that never lost sight of the love story between David and Bathsheba and the heavy fighting of David in God. The path that trampled on the movie The title may look very good. But King still maintains the truth and interest along the way. Moreover, we never felt the mystery about trying to understand God's will, just as David was struggling with the same thing. From the first scene in which the soldier died, trying to protect the ark from being destroyed David is not satisfied with Nathan's answer. (To paraphrase) that no one understands God's will This is the journey that we started by passing into a powerful end, in which David finally confronted himself. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie is owned by Gregory Peck, who was great as King David. David is the one you can believe that will rule the country mercilessly. But once he was a faithful singer in the Psalms This is one of his best performances. <br /> <br /> I don't see this movie on television anymore. But when I do, I never fail to watch. I think it is still good today.
