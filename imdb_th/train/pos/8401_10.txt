Love Trap is "must see" independent movie When I sat down to watch movies, I came in with low expectations. But left with blessings The story is an important and creative poem. The writer draws you further and further, each scene allowing you to connect with realistic characters that everyone can identify The movie allowed me to ponder my life and what I thought was love. This film shows what love is. Actions are not emotions. I was impressed with the quality of the movie and the soundtrack of the movie. All presentations exceed my expectations. I lifted my finger for two things and recommended to everyone of all ages and backgrounds.
