I honestly think that this is the best version of the world war I've seen. It's funny. But it's also educational. I'm learning a whole lot and if I can, I want that movie. My favorite part is when the soldiers kill the robot and another part from the back. In the final film war of the world, I think it should be like the first time and it will be better. But whatever way I lifted my finger to this story, <br /> <br /> And if they would create another movie like this, I would definitely see it. <br /> <br /> Thank you.
