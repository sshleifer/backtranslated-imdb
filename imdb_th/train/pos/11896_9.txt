I stumbled upon the replay of this program many years ago and fell in love with it. It consists of TÃ©a Leoni and Holland Taylor and makes me laugh one episode later. I guess it didn't make it big and was canceled after a few seasons. But I believe it is a good run and will recommend watching it ... if there is a chance
