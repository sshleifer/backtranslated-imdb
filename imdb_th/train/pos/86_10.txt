I remember seeing this in the Salem cinema. (I've attended "Kiddie Matin√©e" almost every Saturday) in Dayton Ohio when I was young and never forget It surprised me and my friends. I hope there is a way that I can watch again! I tried to find collectible shorts or something that was useless. I just discovered that it was a Cousteau movie and that made me feel better. His success is beyond my understanding. The fish are in the truth of the cat. At one point, if I remember correctly! If anyone can help me find a way to watch it again, I will be very grateful!
