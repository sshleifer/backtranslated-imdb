There are great details in A Bug's Life covering everything. This movie looks very good and sometimes the animation may fall out. This film is not too much orignal. In general, it is only the period used by Seven Samurai of Kurosawa. I enjoy the interaction of the characters and the villains in this movie. It seems that Disney often makes their bad guys copy carbon-cut outs. The grasshopper is dangerous and jumping. The bad thing brings is a wonderful creation. Try this one.
