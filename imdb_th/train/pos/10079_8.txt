I enjoy watching movies in China in the 1930s in this beautiful movie. The story is easy. Older male actors want to pass on art to young men, even if they don't have children. The actor's face has the magic to see. The story reveals the sacrifices and gratitude of children towards those who treat them well and the desire to be treated well. The opera in this movie reminds me of FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE, which is much more complex and complicated. The story here reminds me of the story of Dickens for many days in which children almost lack property. This plot is predictable and sensitive to me. But it's worth the time to see courage, humanity and history
