First of all, no one understands why this film has been rated low, not just the first horror movie since a long time for me, which is quite boiling with a horror experience for ten years, starting from driving The car in the dark (ghost train) since childhood. Second, the main actor Cheri Christian has a face that gives you the hope that you will be the lead actor in the important image of the future. Thirdly, this woman is so beautiful that I recommend the director to leave Cameron Diazes, Eva Mendezes and all the names of these temporary lamps. Christian is not light. <br /> <br /> However, "the remains of darkness" are also important in metaphysics. They think that photos show the medieval life between reality and "imagination" that cannot be seen with their own eyes. But I have never seen in movies before that these creatures will appear on photos for some people only and sometimes only Which means that photos are not just a symbol of reality (Which the truth becomes a symbol) but becomes a form of reality, an option which can be changed according to the actual "real" symbolic change of the image, meaning that it affects the photographic object, ie The signal will look like an object. Now, in our normal perception world, it is common for objects to change the signal F.ex. If there is a birdman, his photos will show him with a beard like never before. But on the other hand, the change of the object by the signal implies that the photo with the beard is the first and only one. This is the case with the images taken by the main characters in the prison in this movie. This is a new story and we have to thank you for all the new things in horror movies that often repeat and rearrange the effects and features that are already well known, mostly since the silent era.
