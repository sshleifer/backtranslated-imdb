Normally I don't like Emma Roberts a lot, but after watching Nancy Drew, it changed his mind. The actors in the movie make everything exciting and funny. Most of the time when you watch a mystery movie, you can edit it before the show. But in this movie, it's like you're there. The clues must be consistent until finally you can understand all the crimes. I'm still surprised that she discovered it. This movie is very smart and people who watch this movie also like movies as well. Clothes are the parts that I like in this movie. It's very cute. I don't think there will be another movie like this until the sequel comes out. I let it be nine because the famous girls didn't have the correct part. But they still make me laugh It's a really great movie and a great mystery. I definitely recommend watching.
