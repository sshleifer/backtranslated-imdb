It's a movie like this that makes you want you to never choose people who grow up in school. If you like this movie, I suggest you watch Valentine. I just discovered today that the person who played Marty (Simon) killed himself a bit after the movie was released, which was a shame since he worked well. I wonder if it's because the part that he plays in the movie or not. It started when Carol tricked him into the female bathroom to act like they were going to do. When he switched to the shower, Carols' famous friends sneaked into the bathroom and prepared everything, camera, electric shock, pole. When Marty opens the veil, he realizes that he has been tricked. He tried to cover the bathroom, but the children opened it, grabbed Marty and started to have meaning to him while the camera was rolling. They held him up. His head dipped in the toliet while it was flushed and they used a little bit of electricity. When the boy was in the detention center designated by the coach, the two boys gave Marty together to make. He hurled Crossing one of the glass windows in the gym using bricks to make the teacher excuse while Marty is puking in the bathroom, skip into the science laboratory and mix some things that look like cocaine. But not sure what it is The lab made him badly disfigured. 5 years later, the children who tortured him that day were invited to gather at the school for 5 years at the old school which was burned that day. One person will be killed I do not understand how a girl drowned really drowned. She will come back after Marty goes out. She almost went out for the first time.
