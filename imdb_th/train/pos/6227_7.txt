Of course, it is one of Astaire's little plays / Rogers. It's just a terrible plan and a walk. It takes only a few minutes to swing. But felt that much longer Partly because of the second love between Randolph Scott and Harriet Hilliard, Scott is not interesting. I like hilltribe people. She's cute and I like one or more of her songs. "But where are you?" At least three wonderful dance scenes between Astaire and Rogers. The dance competition contributes to the top of any of their numbers. Dancing is great. "I put all my eggs in one basket." Presenting both rehearsals, dancing that they are not perfect. Its imperfections make it more perfect and "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is one of Irving Berlin's best songs. Therefore, this movie should be worth watching in a great time.
