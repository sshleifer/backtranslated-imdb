First of all, I'm not Justin Timberlake. The fangirl is obsessed with making him look good. In fact, I'm not a big Justin fan, but I like this movie. <br /> <br /> I work. At the video Shop and when I see this movie with a big character that I have never heard before, I have to see what it's about. I didn't find that Justin's performance was terrible. It was the worst thing in the group. But it was a very impressive group, with Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott being the two names that didn't do the first credit. This is a basic story, a journalist who discovers a corrupt police. But I think it works well. The characters of L L Cool J are clearly conflicting. But actually I don't know what he will do in the end Morgan Freeman is a wise counselor that he does well, and just as I love Kevin Speyey, he is like that. His character doesn't have many substances. But as Kevin Spacey, he can't do anything wrong. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, I think Dylan McDermott gave the best performance as a cop. Truly believe in the character and make him scared me a few times. <br /> <br /> I expect to have a lot of honesty An awesome poem, a sequence of unjust actions But it was surprisingly well done and I didn't find it Every shooting has one point, it's not a rather solid ancient idea. <br /> <br /> Overall, the amazing actors, good stories that make me interested and enough action to make me jump. I don't know why it doesn't appear in the cinema. It's better than the garbage I've seen on the big screen. I would say it's worth watching.
