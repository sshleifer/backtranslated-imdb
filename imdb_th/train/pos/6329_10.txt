A cult movie for every true Russian intellectual Everything is excellent, especially the performance: it's great. The movie is a book full of symbols: What I like is the brightest symbol of Razrukha (the Russian word that speaks of "Destruction" often refers to a period of turmoil in the life after the Civil War in 1918-20) - opened the dirty door in the brick wall filled with snow and the black hole of the rear door. <br /> <br /> Now, this movie has been released on DVD with images that have been completely revived and 5.1 audio has been translated. English subtitles are also good, even though Sharikov's obscene vocabulary. The part was replaced by a weaker terminology in translation, I know that the DVD is available in different countries. But if you find it grabbed immediately, it's worth it to see. <br /> <br /> And in summary, the truth: about 50% of Russians today Which are mostly young people, can be identified as Sharikovs at a high level It's a post-Soviet effect: Soviet people don't seem to be fully prepared for the attacks of Western civilization, TV producers and filmmakers have created surprisingly aggressive entertainment and media industries. Soulless and without thought Every Russian instinct Even among the Internet users, every third person uses profane language in forums and chats because it is amazingly normal in spoken language.
