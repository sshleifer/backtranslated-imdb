This is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. This video is special and fascinating all the time. It also received an Oscar for best shooting and deserved as well. I have many movies in my movie collection and many other things that I have seen besides them and not much that are more beautiful or equal, as well as beautiful photographs. < br>> <br /> The movie actors are excellent and perform great roles in showing their characters. We follow their fate with dedication and stick to their emotions. On the way, we also learn things about ourselves and our lives. I think this movie is so much for what it represents and how to present it. I warmly recommend
