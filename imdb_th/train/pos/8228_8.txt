It's hard to tell you more about this film without spoiling. I enjoy it because I didn't expect what I saw. But it's a normal sex drama so .... it's a sex thriller that doesn't seem like anything It consists of Emmanuelle Seigner. There are no strangers in the genre. (And nude) that her husband Polanski ordered her And creepy performances (I can say that it's creepy / yes, CREEPY) from Toreton (Bernard Tavernier's actor). It looks like Pascal Bruckner will meet Roman Polanski (better than Bitter Moon) like Chabrol. Speaking of Les Diaboliques) but near Les Yeux of Les Yeux Georges Franju, the godfather of Dr. Phibes and others) Gems! I am just afraid that they will blow this thing into a Hollywood release, just as they did with the Nighwatch and The Vanishing.
