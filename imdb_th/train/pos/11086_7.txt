I saw this movie when I was young - it was called "Glacier Fox". I was totally hurt! It follows the cute little fox family. The beginning was great and I remember becoming a small fox. I still remember my mother taking me out of the theater while I was hysterical I won't tell you what happened. But let's say it's not good for every fox. I'm familiar with Disney's natural movies that animals don't really die. Oh, this movie made me cry for hours. It's a good movie ... I think - I'm very little and have to tell the truth - I remember being happy with the fox. Rent if you can But don't show your children!
