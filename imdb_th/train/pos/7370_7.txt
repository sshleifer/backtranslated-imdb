Some people compare this film with liberation. I believe that mice and men are more suitable than our leader, Heaton. Definitely love Spike. This is why Heaton doesn't leave Spike. He wants him. They want each other As a sibling as a family, it is only a connection to humanity. All settings, situations, actors are minimal. Frankly, I don't care what happens to the characters. But I'm interested in what filmmakers do with them. He did well with them. I take the time to wonder if the ending is similar to mice and men. The soundtrack and the movie received interest and interest.
