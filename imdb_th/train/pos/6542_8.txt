Even though the target group is well received But I always have a weakness for the YA novel, so I was amazed by the return of Nancy Drew on the screen. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie. The central mystery associated with the long-dead actress was presented in a straightforward, straightforward manner, along with dashes of danger for young detectives. Nancy and her friends have never seriously threatened, so the young audience will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> What I admire from this story is that the end result is quite serious and meaningful. The spokes seem to understand and grow. From the experience <br /> <br /> Emma Roberts is great like Nancy Drew and hopes that we will meet you again in mystery again.
