Buster shines for sure, which is the only vehicle I saw at the end of his career that allowed him to make funny (and silent!) Movies that made him famous. It was still shocking to hear his grit in Talkie's voice - his voice about the only thing I didn't care about as Buster was concerned - but his ability to use penalties remained unbeatable He even repeated some of his first two rookies with Roscoe Arbuckle. <br /> <br /> Thank you to Rod Serling for presenting our story now. He doesn't have enough time to do it. But this is a praise for Hollywood's greatest genius.
