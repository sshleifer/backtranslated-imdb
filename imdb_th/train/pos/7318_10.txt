John Carpenter's Halloween <br /> <br /> Is it the greatest horror movie of all time? No .. may not be for everyone But for me it is and will be forever This movie is a true genius and is often considered a very special place in my heart. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I didn't go to watch this movie until twenty years after it was released. But even twenty years later, after the cat had been imitated a lot, and this matter still had the same effect, I had to do it. My dad recommended before going to see Halloween H20, which I drew and rented Halloween 1 and 2. In order to receive the full story and after watching Halloween, it is quite clear that setting and setting Slasher Gen <br /> <br /> The film's story is simple. In 1963, Michael Audrey Myers killed his sister Judith with cold blood with a knife. Testing Yong large Was booked for fifteen years that he was treated by Dr. Sam Loomis, he escaped and returned to his hometown at Haddonfield, where he began stalking three young girls: Laurie Strawberry, Bookworm, Babe. And a strong sex girl. Dr. Loomis follows Michael here, where he asks for help from the town's sheriff Leigh Brackett, who is still skeptical of his story about the psychopathic killer. Michael watched the woman mercilessly and began to kill them one by one until only the remaining innocent Laurie, who was the main target of Michael's list. <br /> <br /> Selection The show from this film is excellent and every actor Jamie Lee Curtis performed her first screenplay as Laurie Struder and Donald Place Sands, giving an exciting performance with his small role as Loomis. Nick Castle, who played the role of Michael, did a great job as a spiritless killer and his walking and body movements were perfect. <br /> <br /> One of the great highlights. Of the film is John Carpenter, the creator of One The most famous horror known today. The blue light looks creepy and powerful, and one of the great moments in this film is when Laurie Young stooped down to see the wall after seeing a friend who is dead and in the shadows behind Michael's face. Before he died Michael's mask is one of the things that make my spine cool the most. The white, emotionless face works perfectly. <br /> <br /> The thing that makes this movie so good is that it's not a full movie. With blood In fact, the 13th movie has a little blood in this film and works instead of suspicion and tension. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Halloween turns into a movie on Friday the 13th. A drama like Jason Voorhees, in which he is the only person who cuts Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> To conclude, I suggest you watch this movie at least once in your life because it is an important place. In creating The movie and without a doubt that if it is not the greatest movie, it is one of the greatest horror movies of all time.
