I just used this video and I watched it last night. The performance started out very badly (Hey ------ Hey ------ Twister) but it did very well soon after the ward. The tornado looks very fake and many CGI effects look terrible. But the scene in which the house was broken and the content that was blown around and was sucked out was very well done and close to the movie like Twister. This story was written very well and was refreshing to see this film released from the movie. The old-fashioned "formula of disaster" seems to be stuck in 30 years. <br /> <br /> At this time, the movie has a strange combination of FX and quality.
