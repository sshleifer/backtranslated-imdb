Spoiler <br /> <br /> Tom and Jerry are classic cartoons with impeccable ideas, and almost every brief is a gem, while I must say that this is certainly a disadvantage compared to Other classic Tom and Jerry shorts, but there is no way you hate this cartoon. Of course, it is understandable that this is one of the worst episodes of Tom and Jerry's first episode, and I can say that I agree. But the truth of this story is that all the episodes of Tom and Jerry are excellent. But some things are better than others Jerry noticed how he was and tried to shock him more than he was. He created a terrible crisis for Tom and Tom was afraid of his intelligence and his life. Then Jerry put a sheet on the vacuum cleaner and controlled it, making it look like a vacuum cleaner was a ghost. Tom finds Jerry doing all this and chasing him. Tom accidentally bites the housekeeper. However, in the end, Jerry became a scared person after he saw his reflection in the cup of flour. <br /> <br /> Overall, this thing is the best from Tom and Jerry Fun and enjoyable piece of time It makes me hope to have more cartoons. Slapstick and gags in this story that made Tom and Jerry well celebrated for a short time, but it felt like something was missing in this story. It feels a lot slower than most Tom and Jerry shorts. However, this is a short period of life with other Tom and Jerry cartoons. But it is still good.
