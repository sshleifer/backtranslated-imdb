I was blown away by Battlestar Galactica, a new fantasy. The performance that made me always guessing and took me to cry more than once. Sci-fi fans were stronger. I like to think that I can choose good things from BS and this is something. Good <br /> <br /> like this, when I heard about the opportunity of the prequel series for the first time, many months ago I had a gut illness I am afraid that the formula that makes Battlestar successful will be able to be reused in Caprica, which is not available. The story of BSG, a group of mourning survivors, stuck on a damaged ship and received instructions. From visions, predictions and the sequence of artificial miracles are perfectly appreciated with special songs and better performers. <br /> <br /> Caprica feels different that BSG is born. After the collapse of great civilizations Caprica plays a civilization in decline and chilly. The overall atmosphere I received from Caprica is similar to the minority report, removing too much drama and opposition in the true BSG format. Caprica is in the first few hours of programming that deal with freedom issues. Religious, racial discrimination, playing with God and the nature of the human spirit. <br /> <br /> The casting for Caprica is still excellent. That is unique and deep, ranging from scientists who have turned their attention to entrepreneurs to troubled and stubborn daughters, actors and actors, each showing their role. <br /> <br /> The song Effectively used in BSG. There is also a major role in Caprica, the powerful rolling drum of Battlestar and Dug, which serves as a theme as well. Caprica uses more music which makes the show more fun. <br /> <br /> The new Caprica is your own show, definitely pulling from the Battlestar franchise as necessary. I hope to get the full series.
