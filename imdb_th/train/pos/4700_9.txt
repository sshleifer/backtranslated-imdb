I can't believe the IMDb ratings are lower than 5.6 about Johnny Dangerously while I write this review, and I think I have to do something to promote memorable jokes as much as I can. Seriously, to get a low score, people who vote must have limited humor, not to mention a very open mind. If you don't like humor flicks, don't watch! The combination of ridiculous humor, very good storytelling, and the remarkable pace gained from many jokes, this movie brought to my DVD collection. And that is, without talking about the images embedded here and there, and of course using "clin d'oeils" and "clich√©s" based on our favorite crime movies. <br /> <br /> I show movies This story is for a lot of people and is introduced to this film without any expectation (except maybe watching a comedy) - a state in which you should watch any movie - they like it. Much It goes well. It's not long to watch and there is no slowing down in the evolution of the story, which I think is really straightforward. Of course, it's not perfect, some are a bit short. But there is no perfect movie, especially when considering other opinions that you have. That's why I rate this movie 9 out of 10. This film has my opinion as a precursor to "Top Secret" and "Spaceballs. "In ridiculous comedy But have a good idea Which is becoming increasingly nonsensical while reducing ideas and creativity Sometimes jokes require more culture than many people who think that they will understand correctly. As a last word, I want to say: See for yourself. Don't follow Joe's words, and if you don't like it, you will know that it's really not good for your taste, which is understandable but unlikely. Possible in my opinion
