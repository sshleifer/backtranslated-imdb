I saw this little Belgian jewel two days after seeing 'American Teen'. Don't make a mistake about it. Teens are sitting on a roller coaster, whether American or European, 'Naissance des Pieuvres' (or it's called in the United States.' Water Lillies') is a story of a 15-year-old girl (played by Pauline Acquart, which sometimes looks like Scarlett Johansson). A young woman who wants to be in the school swimming team just to get close to Adele Haenel, apparently Marie, is more than attracting Floriane. Thinking of all of this is Marie Ann's rather plump and attractive friend who just wants to have a girlfriend like a woman. Others are as old as you During that time, we will find that there is a normal teenage hobby. (Broken hearts, lifting shops, alcoholic beverages and / or drug use, informal sex, etc.) This is a small, quiet movie that takes time to work on your system (Michael's fans Bay Please note: the spacing here is slow, so it's very clear) but if you don't have a problem with this There is no rating here, but will pull the "R" that is difficult due to the language of adult situations.
