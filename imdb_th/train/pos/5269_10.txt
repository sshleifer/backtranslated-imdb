I love bad movies Not only because they tend to entertain as well as 'good' movies (such as Pirates of the Caribbean series and other Hollywood pathos), but they are usually better than those movies. And that's why I love Italian movies in the 1970s and 1980s. And that's why I love this movie. Especially The Barbarians & the Company <br /> <br /> Director Ruggero Deodato has created a very good movie. Such as House on the Edge of the Park and his Atlantis Interceptors and Live Like a Cop. Die Like a Man is a fun action movie. But this is really bad Savage is a very stupid movie. Peter and David Paul as a barbarian sibling, Kutcher and Gore are very funny because of lack of talent and acting skills. But if they don't, they will yell and scream every time doing important things. In one scene, people try to hang Barbarian Brothers and they escape in an unusual way. <br /> <br /> Bad performances, bad tricks, stupid stories, bad directions. I can't explain that I laughed when I watched this for the first time. The savage and the company is a classic camp that everyone should see once. If you think Plan 9 From Outer Space is a fun camp, it will be a real killer.
