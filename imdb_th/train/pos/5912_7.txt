By Dane Youssef <br /> <br /> "Coonskin" is the only movie by Ralph Bakshi. It is reported that there is a movie satire. blaxploitation And negative black patterns, as well as watching the lives of modern black people in America (modern for today, I mean - 1975). This is the movie Bakshi, controversial, exciting and must-see, almost the only definition, not just the random "jock jock" of the movie that tried to scare. It was by Ralph Bakshi. Know If he creates a movie, he has something big to say ... <br /> <br /> Although it has its roots in Cheap blaxploitation "Coonskin" is not just a joke. Leaving the main white film or flicking any type of flyer "Coonskin" needs more. It targets that it will be a higher attraction and fry fish that are larger. <br /> <br /> The film not only stimulates the fun in style and not only accuses blacks but actually It seems to show love, beauty and heart in a strange place. <br /> <br /> "Coonskin" tells the story of some prisoners waiting for jail. The fact that it is possible to separate from the prison in the world "Coonskin" alone makes it outdated. <br /> <br /> One of the prisoners tells the story about three brothers in Harlem, named Bra. Der, Bear, Brother Rabbit, Preacher Fox who needs respect and is part of the action and willing to accept it in any way that is necessary. The Itallian people crowd. Actually everything. <br /> <br / > Big black musicians: Barry White and Scatman C rothers including Charles Gordone, the first black playwright to bring Pulitzer back home. There is something happening here. <br /> <br /> The film is similar to the descent of this world. Which is a racial divide From an angry black man with a deep hips and full of soul with hatred in his heart and a gun in his hand. <br /> <br /> Bakshi's movie never knew the meaning of this sublety. Seems to have never heard the word But may be like this, needing mania Sarcastic hammer Some subjects are not able to handle gently. <br /> <br /> Bucky is merciless. There are no members or minorities of the unresolved Harlem scene. <br /> <br /> The characters here are "Animation" to "real" all depends on the mood and situation The characters, animators and humans have the same reality and will be used in real ways. <br /> <br /> Bucky has never shown an ugly parody picture only for Shock He always said something. Or the black face is worthless This is different from Spike Lee's "Bamboozled", which looks like he will use it to try and say something. <br /> <br /> Like 99.9% of all Bakshi's movies, this movie contains animations. And action live At the same time, Bakshki is not just a gimmick here. All of these techniques are tangled together while saying something. <br /> <br /> One of them feels inevitably obsolete. Many of these movies (included in Bakshi) are very specific. They reflect some trends of the day. But when looking back many years later, there was only a feeling of nostalgia. <br /> <br /> Although music, clothes, slang and The city seems clear that the photos in the time capsule, mind and heart attitude remain the same, whether it is the king's ear. Everyone who sees the movie, the status of things and in the group of people know that I'm talking about <br /> <br /> Even some black characters are rabbits. (Jungle Bunny) Big Bear and Fox One of the most racist and offensive characters is the dirty Harlem police, which is hot on the path of "dirty n ----- s" after the death of the police. But for him, it's not just about business. And not because of the other brothers who wore armor, it was only the joy of the racial purity of the black skin. <br /> <br /> The sequence associated with his godfather and lady is one of the parts. The most moving in the whole movie, which has a lot It can be played like an opera or ballet. <br /> <br /> Promotion line: Warning: "This movie makes everyone angry!" This is not just an advertisement. Continue with great caution. <br /> <br /> You have been warned ... <br /> <br /> By Dane Youssef
