Despite the budget constraints, this is a great movie, proving that the effort and imagination can overcome the lack of money. The openings in the cave paintings seem to show that at least some of the dinosaurs that survived the human era were good red herring After that, the meteor fell into the lake and caused heat which eventually caused hatching of dinosaur eggs. When the prehistoric animals appeared, it was a lively Plesiosaur that caused the disappearance in the area shortly. Okay, so it's not Jurassic Park, but it's still a real entertainment for fans of monster movies.
