I saw "Breaking Glass" for the first time in 1980 and thought it would be one of "Movie Classics". This movie is a good image of the music industry with excellent actors. This is a movie that should be a collection of everyone and everyone who wants to enter the music industry. I can't wait for it to be available on DVD.
