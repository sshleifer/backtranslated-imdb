This is a great movie if viewed in the right context - it means parody of the horror-demon movie - Devil - Teen (and '80s see lots of them)! I saw this movie when it first came out and liked it immediately. Being a big fan of KISS, it's great to see genes in movies. And anything that has OZZY as a preacher who hates metal is not bad! So Fastway is my favorite, so it's good to hear them on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The original VHS (this is the DVD in advance) for Trick Or Treat, which is a illustration of Sammi playing. His guitar in the ring of fire, along with "demons", is being viewed. It's a special order and the price for a VHS copy at that time (around 1987) is $ 90! I really want this movie But not at a ridiculous price, the cover of 'OZZY-Gene' was created for the new $ 5 release only. The release company might think that Gene and OZZY are only known in movies, so they should put them. On the cover! The same thing as the original "Little Shop Of Horrors" - Jack Nicholson is there for five minutes. But now they have a cover as if they are the main stars. <br /> <br /> I have a website "Trick Or Treat" and it's surprising that many people believe that Sammi Curr is a real person! Fastway helps to extend the legendary age by devoting the soundtrack album for 'Sammi Curr'. <br /> <br /> This is just a good time. Rock and roll movies. Of course, it shouldn't be too serious. But happy!
