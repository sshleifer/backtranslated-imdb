This is Poirot / the mysteriously selected sunshine on television. The character is bright and good. Plot and main settings - Student dormitories - Great. Japp has nothing special. But for me, don't distract from the story One important point, many Poirot watchers do not recognize good performances or have good characteristics.

Finally, I read a little Christy novel - none of the past years - and found it annoying that many viewers were concerned about the change from the novel. Please, the audience considers what is presented to you in the movie, not what you think should be there. That said the mystery of Poirot varies in quality But not as much as the inspectors and assessors will have you believe With the exception of The Five Little Pigs' exclusive privilege in the plot, the style and the theme of the Poirot movie that is longer or bad or bad For this album, I watched the movie Poirot / Suchet. In the end, movies without Lemon, Hastings and / or Japp are bad or bad because of lack However, the appearance is both scary.
