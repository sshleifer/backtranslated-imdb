Every time the film is broadcast on the BBC, someone on the Times radio program says it is a satire on the post-war world of rationing and the welfare state. I don't think this is the purpose of the movie. (Small criminals who served black market) and housewives who campaigned against government restrictions but were the frontline organization of the MP. <br /> <br /> Of course, this film sends political / social stories, but in the end, people realize that they need total control to make sure that a fair society they want to be British and more confused than that. <br /> <br /> But I don't think they will go back. Like it used to be before
