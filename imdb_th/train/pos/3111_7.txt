He now has a name, identity, some memories and a missing girlfriend. What he wants is to disappear. Yet they followed him and almost destroyed the world he had created. Now he needs some explanation and to let people know how he is. Yes, Jason Bourne is back and this time he comes here with revenge. <br /> <br /> Okay, this movie doesn't have script. The most complex in the world But its content is smart and very good Ask serious questions about our society. Of course, as with all Hollywood movies since the late 1990s, "The Bourne Suprematy" is a story of superhero Jason Bourne being like Captain America - an entirely wrong project. In the first film, the hero discovers his abilities and he accepts them in the second movie. Now he struggles with what he thinks is evil after the people near him are killed. (His girlfriend in "Suprematy"), which is all that is part of the story of super heroes, including powerful characters (realistic but still impressive: he is almost invincible). > <br /> And the interesting point is the evil he fought around the world. (There is no border in Bourne's movie. The characters will change from one continent to another in the blink of an eye). In the season's best "24" American enemies who believe that he fought for the benefit His country made him completely blind, funny that "crazy patriots" are now the enemies of N.1 of Hollywood paranoia. <br /> <br /> In addition to those interesting stories Useless and the direction is quite not original when it comes to the conversation scene. But what is not important for "The Bourne Ultimatum" is an action movie. And the action scenes are quite impressive. <br /> <br /> Everyone here talks about "Waterloo scene" and "Chase the Tanger" and rightly everyone I especially like the fight in Tanger, which reminds me of exaggeration and madness in the work of Tsui Hark. The scenes that are visually invented, many intelligent action parts and good reflections of contemporary content American: "The Bourne Ultimatum" is the best movie in the series and is an interesting and original action scene.
