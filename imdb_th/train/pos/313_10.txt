I am a black American and I like this opera. I watched it in Spanish, Telemundo, almost 5-7 years ago. The story is a true story about a black slave who has a passion for white commanders, giving her leadership and frankness <br /> <br /> Many of us learn a lot from XICA. She does what she doesn't have and sees her possibilities. Many argue that she sells herself - but she tries to save her future and her children in the future. <br /> <br /> It's a great drama that I think will come out in the form. DVD But it was not released This TV drama is the best drama ever. We want it to be published on DVD or broadcast on TV again, currently playing on Azteca America, which is only available in Mexico or the United States using paid cables. We want it published again to Telemundo.
