This is the type of movie you want to watch with a glass of wine, fire and your feet. No need to use a lot of brain power, so it's good after a long day. I would say it's very unrealistic - if you expect something serious, you don't have to worry. But it was funny Just thinking that a businessman will go as far as he agrees to stay in the slum for a while and then really enjoy it ...
