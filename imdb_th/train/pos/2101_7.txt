Forget Neo and Bourne and the newly created heroes, they look only 12 years old to satisfy the many audiences who want to be their hero. Since they can't be Rambo or McClane, or even Indiana Jones, Hollywood allows for a counterfeit without a beard and also fulfills the desire of teenagers who want to see something that looks like action movies. <br /> <br /> "Action piece set" is just a pain to watch, and every woman may challenge their masculinity without question. This explains the emergence of seniors on our screen for the last few years (Rocky, Rambo) or worse (Die Hard 4 - John McClane, bracing himself ... . No beard !!) <br /> <br /> I said it was the time when a new hero came in. And ended the reign The film "Largo Winch" is still far from perfect and sometimes too predictable at times, but at least Tomer Sisley has shown a promising performance as an action hero. And the only time he was weak when MÃ©lanie Thierry shaved his beard! I rested my case. <br /> <br /> I don't know when I enter the cinema room. But this may be a movie I have been waiting for for ten years. For the first time in France, since Belmondo, a well-built movie based on the B-genre, without blushing At the same time, what we have to chew is that giant dung piles or something too limited to reach a wider audience ... In other words, "Le Pacte des Loups" or "Dobermann" (I like Dobermann) ... I believe that "Largo Winch" has both popularity and the creation of quality movies. <br /> <br /> I left the theater room and was very happy and hungry.
