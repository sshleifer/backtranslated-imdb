I like Laurence Olivier in the past few weeks and I'm excited when discovering this gem. I always find it wonderful when I run across a movie that I don't need to use my finger on the remote control in the case of naked pictures shaking ugly heads. <br /> <br /> Divorce of Lady X is so charming. The last scene and probably the real happiness for the audience in 1938. I only hope that people today will be able to accept and love true humor instead of a terrifying trash. Now people are called jokes. <br /> <br /> X is worth everyone's time.
