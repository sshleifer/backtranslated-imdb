Yes, it's a low budget. Yes, it's one of Candy's oldest movies, but it might be his most funny thing! John Kandy is not far from SCTV in "Going Berserk" and shows If you do not break when Candy tries to help a man and his grocery store while being handcuffed to a group of people who escape in the process of having sex with his girlfriend with the apartment door separating them only (huh ?, watch a movie! ) Or the way Euguene Levy (the creator of Kong Fu Yu) is talking to his mother on the phone or just countless facial expressions that only Candy can help you check the pulse better! If you like John Candy's "Only the Lonely", this may not be the movie that I would like to recommend. But if you enjoy John Candy's SCTV day, this movie will have to watch!
