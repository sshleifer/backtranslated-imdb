At first I watched 8 rules about the United Kingdom Disney Channel for the first series and completely hooked up. When they didn't show it again, they were annoyed, but when abc 1 satred showing the 2nd series, I didn't think that other series would start after I read John ritter's death. The latest series is back to the old excellent standards. I hope that they will produce more programs soon, even though I have seen thousands of performances each time. Kaley couco is my favorite character as an Air Bridge, and also shows amazing performances in Charm Rory is still good. He shared my name and Gram aunt too. I will continue to watch until it ends until then. I hope it will continue to be fun.
