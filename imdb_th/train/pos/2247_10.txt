I am disappointed with the lack of posting in this surprising and powerful small movie. Jordi Mollà may be best known for his role as Diego in "Bomb" Writes, director and star. <br /> <br /> I will not rate any plot as a movie. (At least for me) is a very exciting story that doesn't know anything about it .. If you have a netflix account or have access to a video store that is portable ... I highly recommend it. It's fun, crazy, and sometimes very provocative. <br /> <br /> Mollà's direction is quite impressive and shows a lot of promise. <br /> <br /> Unpredictable. A wonderful performance, speaking in beautiful Spanish. "No somos nadie" (God is on Air) is an amazing movie that you can show to your friends. <br /> <br /> Look at it.
