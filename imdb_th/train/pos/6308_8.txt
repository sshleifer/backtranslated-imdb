Stupid, hilarious, sad, sad, unavoidable You don't care about the factors that make it wrong. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see George Clooney doing something truly funny for change. The casting is perfect and the standard of performance is very high. Although it can be said that the motley team is not new. But I think this movie manages it in an interesting and unique way. Enough to stand out from what I used to do. <br /> <br /> They do very well.
