This movie is one of the most fun movies I've seen for many years and the laughter from the audience supports me. Not since my wedding, Big Fat Greek (2002). Laughter is natural and intense. Simple, complicated, last year, Mr and Mrs Smith (2005) in the use of parody (Espionage in Mr and Mrs Smith and Sex in My Super Ex-Girlfriend) Director Ivan Reitman creates a balance between comedy and drama during the madness and seriousness Never shocked and severely violated the rules of comedy At the same time, this predictive romantic comedy will not lose the emotional element that touches, although the ending will be broadcast in advance. In some ways it was clear that it was great to see that it was played out. Just like in real life, sometimes the truth is clear and invisible. Eight stars from the top ten easily with Tootsie (1982) may be nine (depending on the appearance of the second viewing).
