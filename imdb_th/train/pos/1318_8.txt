I felt compelled to write a review for Space Cobra because it received a good 7.3 star rating, but only a few comments at the time I wrote that this was especially useful. A strange situation and hope that my positive reviews will point people to watch old and forgotten anime movies. Space cobra is a cowardly story of a smuggler and a gangster involving three sisters of ancient planets and dead planets. This is an old movie and animation that is shown. But what it lacks in modern complexity makes it a lot of charm. Space Cobra focuses on Western audiences very much and is very easy to see. There is little, if any, reference to a specific Japanese culture and good for novice anime to watch and have fun. Space cobra itself is witty and pleasing. I can't tell if this is due to the English dub or the creator's intention. But is one of the Japanese comedy characters that I find really funny. The style is a very sixties, barbarellish, along with a great soundtrack from Yello. The style is colorful and imaginative, and there is ongoing action to move the story along. The most peculiar aspect of this movie is how it started as a comedian and ended up with an amazing note. I can't think of other anime or movies that can do this smoothly and reliably. You just know that it's happening. But it was done thoroughly and seemed completely natural You also feel that the characters that traveled and their lives changed from the whole experience. Check if you can
