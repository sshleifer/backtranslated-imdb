I do not know where the Iranian director will be inspired and the plot like this. In fact, it is a very simple storyline that many directors can create - but may not be able to project on a movie like Jafar Panahi. <br /> <br /> This movie is like the whole world. Two circulating At the same time, one connects to the other - the football match and the sex fight that takes place behind the wall of the stadium. <br /> <br /> It makes you feel like you're in the movie and you're a character. One and while watching a movie as if you wanted to see a football match You will feel excited and feel like the actress in the movie. It's interesting that you want to see the ending. You will want to find a verdict. You will die to see what happens to the girls. <br /> <br /> I like the conversation during the period. Smoking girls and one of the military trainees It's like Venus vs Mars. It shows the differences in the thinking of men and women and the struggle of women in order to receive equal rights and opportunities, especially in the patriarchal society like Iran. <br /> < br /> This is the second time the movie of Jafar Panahi that I have seen (the first episode is Crimson Gold) and I am looking forward to see more. <br /> <br /> I have been addicted to Iranian movies and this is something At Must see!
