After many years, I still consider this set as the best example of creating a documentary for World War II. Interviews with many participants from all countries make this story different from other projects. It would be great if you see contemporary documentaries (Ken Burns?) Participate in this topic and try to gather information from veterans before They will leave With modern technology to improve old archive images and many information that has not been discovered since 1974 when producing The World At War, the new version of this series will be welcomed. Historical channels make good performances about various aspects of World War II. But the extended series, for example, World At War has not been tried successfully since the original. If you are interested in this era, don't miss this series. It is necessary to watch.
