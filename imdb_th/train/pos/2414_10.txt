Monarch Cove is one of the best plays on Friday night for a long time. I asked the author to write a long series and broadcast during the life of SOON. Each person is very interesting. The story is true. However, the movie must continue for a long time. I like to see the children of Bianca and Jake grow up and play an important role in the movie, along with the new grandparents who are planning for her educational future. In addition, bring Kathy back to look at her granddaughter and help her life improve because seeing grandparents make their problems better. But the family business needs to be restored to the working status of the year.
