This is the first movie I have ever seen John Singleton, and he is a very good director. The movie begins with a group of newcomers coming in and it shows what happened to many of them. Omar Epps plays as a star actor with some scholarships and has a difficult time tracking his work. he He is a friend to the Ice Cube and life-dating. Tyra Banks Kristy Swanson is a rich girl who raped and became friends with Jennifer Connelly, a lesbian and not sure where to go. Michael Rapaport is a child from Idaho. Falling into the Neo-Nazis group and their leader Cole Hauser. These are the three main characters and Lawrence Fishburne is a political science professor who is trying to help them. It was a great movie and it was unfortunate that the studio had to cut the movie many times.
