I have never seen a program that is as good as a full house. Full House makes all new programs shameful! Anyone who has never seen it, which I do not see it possible, should see it. It's a great show for everyone of all ages. Full House will make you laugh. It will make you cry. It will surprise you. In fact, some people feel that there is some "magical" aspect of the performance, but the positive side weighs every aspect. "Magic" Full House runs for the first time on September 22, 1987 in the section "Our First First Show" and Running the final episode on May 23, 1995, "Michelle Rides Again Part II". <br /> <br /> The story of the show. Very reliable Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) lost his wife Pam in an accident involving drunk driving. Danny has a brother-in-law, Jesse Katsopolis (John Stamos), who is Pam's younger brother, and Danny brings his best friend Joey Gladstone (Dave Coulier) to help him raise three daughters. Danny's daughter is named DJ (Candice Cameron-Bure), Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen). Joe and Jesse plan to move in with Danny and his three girls just in time. few months And stayed with them for eight years Which is the number of years that the show runs. <br /> <br /> Here is a short description of some characters and actors / actresses who played him / her: John Stamos (Jesse): John Stamos is a great actor. He plays Jesse Jessie as a rock star who is waiting for his big break in Full House. John Stamos works great in his role. He watched and played music like his idol. Elvis Presley <br /> <br /> Bob Saget (Danny): Bob Saget is also a great actor. He lost his wife in a car accident involving a drunk driver. He had to raise three girls without the mother of a girl. Bob Saget did an excellent job drawing a single parent who worked full time and still had time to raise his three girls. <br /> <br /> Dave Coulier (Joey): One word that can explain Dave Coulier, funny. He's great. Joey's character play is perfect for him. He did a great job playing as a comedian, waiting for a big break. <br /> <br /> Candice Cameron-Bure (DJ): She is a great actress. She plays the eldest sister, a DJ that stands for Donna Jo. She is one of the best actresses I've ever seen. Her ability to perform in Full House is very reliable. <br /> <br /> Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie): Two simple words can explain Jodie Sweetin. Amazing! I hope I can say everything I want to say about Jodi. But I will only use a maximum of 1000 words with her. She started to show children the name Mother Goose Stories and when she came to Full House, she blew the thoughts of the audience and the creator. Her excellent acting abilities helped make the show as successful as it used to be. According to Dave Coulier, Jody was supposed to be a star on the show. It should be the place where she will get her big break. Jodie at the age of five, when the first broadcast can hit every line perfectly. She showed great enthusiasm. Most young children cannot do this. As you can guess, Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie) is my favorite character in Full House. <br /> <br /> Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen (Michelle): Best House actress is the point. Their start They received a portion of Michelle because they were the only babies who didn't cry while in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> There are more select members who should be accepted. This is the original character since the first show aired in 1987. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing I can say is that Full House has become a Michel show. end I think it will focus on her at the end. Especially when I think Jodie and Candice do better in the show. <br /> <br /> Full House is a great show for everyone. It can teach you a lot. One of the biggest things that can teach you is that everyone can live a good life, even if a tragedy, such as losing a family member, happens. Full House continues to attract new fans. From all of the above, there are only two things left to say. Full House will never die, and thanks to the actors from Full House who give performances that everyone can enjoy.
