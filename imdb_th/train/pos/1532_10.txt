This is like Murder. She Wrote is one of those programs. After a stressful day at school, I sat down in front of the TV and watched. Why? Because I truly enjoy it and it's a shame that it is no longer in the air. Dick Van Dyke is great while Dr. Mark Sloan is a medical detective whose son is a murderer. He was joined by a famous supporting actor. But very talented is Barry Van Dyke. His true son, Victoria Rowell, is also good. But I noticed that all of my hairstyles changed. I like Scott Baio and Charlie Schlatter as well. But I like Michael Tucci as Norman and was baffled that he disappeared immediately This performance is very enjoyable with the wonderful guests. It is quite clear sometimes, such as Colombo. But in every episode, there are always things that are laughable. In summary, this is a great series that has two thumbs and 10/10 Bethany Cox.
