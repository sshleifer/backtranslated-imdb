When working in downtown Manhattan and having lunch during the summer in the park near the town hall, I will see the mayor come. It's great to be able to go beyond the gazebo door and see what it looks like in the lobby and throughout the building. Al Pacino (Mayor John Pappas), "Gigli", '03 gives outstanding performance through all images and especially When he delivered a speech at the African American Church for the murdered little boy John Cusack (Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun), "Runaway Jury", '03, was a servant dedicated to the mayor and worshiped. He was in everything he was trying to accomplish. Bridget Fonda (Marybeth Cogan) began to fall in love with Kevin Calhoun and gave a good supporting role. Last but not least, Danny Aiello (Frank Anselmo), "Off Key", '01, played as A group of people with a very difficult option to do at the end of the picture! Great movie with great performances and great photography in New York!
