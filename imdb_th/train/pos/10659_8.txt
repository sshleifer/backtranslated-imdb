"I like better cheap perfumes; Not long ... "- Ralph Meeker (Lawson )'s punishing character tells this story to Barbara Stanwyck's Helen character after he smells the perfume she took with her husband in Tijuana ...! This line makes me crack and seems like a metaphor for this film - cheaper, better, expensive because people who love cheap perfume that has a way with 2 x 4 are better people to have in the long run! I agree with other comments posted about Helen's attraction to Lawson. Although her description states that she wants Lawson to be eliminated But it seems that she is interested in his hot nature and the passion that he aroused in her will never go away with the tide!
