Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker reunited to play all their songs from 35 years ago when they set up a trio called "Cream". These are the hallucinations of England and America and They look: Everyone, very long hair, wild clothes and loud music. They play a mix of rock and blue and it's a good story. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, they are now 60 years old and they can still sing. Like the disk concert, this great DVD shows us. Of course, I am very familiar with Clapton, which has never had a problem before. But I don't know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, both I've never seen before in a decade. They surprised me. When he was young, Baker felt emaciated until he looked like a madman near death. He now looks healthy, his shape and playing drums are stable. Bruce looks a little haggard. But his voice is great, as always, and happy to hear these old songs. This is just great content and performances from men who know what they are doing. <br /> <br /> Some people criticize this show as being important. I disagree with that. I have no complaints The concert sounds very good. The second song "Spoonful" stands out as a highlight of the concert for me. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
