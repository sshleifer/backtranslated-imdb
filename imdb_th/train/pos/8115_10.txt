2 The first part tries to reduce the irrationality of the wars that are wasted and ruled by savage nationalists. Part 3 predicts progress and exploration to the moon and others is the key to creating Confident in using talent and human resources in a meaningful way There were speeches that some viewers viewed as naive or cheerful. But made others confused by excitement It shows space / launch guns and helicopters, along with mass communications equipment, flat screen lifts and wireless intercoms. It may not be accurate about buildings without windows in the future. But it shows the child-like vision of scientific investigation / boundless technology. <br /> <br /> For me, it looks like a film about a group of rational thinkers who are guided by morality that Like Spinoans in seeking immortality And live ethically with scientific progress and a unified world government Pro characters (Like two people) believe that humanity can 'Stay forever' by treating our trials and advances for future generations. Stand with our humanity as if on the shoulders of giants. <br /> <br /> Arthur C. Clarke (author 2001: A Space Odyssey) introduces this movie to Stanley Kubrick as an example of the great SF movie. Kubrick hates it and says he will never see another movie as Clarke's advice (source : Introduction to the special millennium Clarke in his 2001 novel) Although Clarke ends still recommending it on top of his list whenever someone asks him about the best SF movie, it has the artistic design of the beautiful Menzies but Moderate special effects (Especially tanks, toys) <br /> <br /> I like it very much and think it's the best. It is quite naive about the possibility of creating a society without crime for a long time. It seems unlikely that the inevitable progress For me, it seems that we can easily go back to the dark age, or at least become a still science that we commit suicide through overpopulation or unable to escape the next natural disaster. But it also shows the importance of taking risks to the public and escorts that threaten to have potential threats from space accidents and deaths. It challenges us to choose a side of progress rather than a little desire for safety or comfort or happiness: <br /> <br /> CABAL: "Too much {rest} and too fast and we call It is said to be dead, but for a man without rest And infinite, he had to go - to conquer, beyond conquer this asteroid and the wind and the way and all the laws of the mind And when he conquered all the depths of the area and all the mysteries of the time - he would still start. "<br /> <br /> CABAL:" If we have nothing more than animals - we have to grab the debris. Of happiness and living and suffering and passing away, whether other animals - or finished. "{He pointed to the stars}" That is - or this is all of the universe - or emptiness ... "(Words from the screenplay) <br /> <br /> If things This sounds like there is a reason for The dedication of all societies for the advancement of the Council members (Of the world government) will look like technocrats But actually "technocrats" allow their citizens to become artisans or pursue other passions freely and they must be suppressed by government bans, anti-science laws and Experiments and other documents and limited use of power <br /> <br /> In fact, many rebel groups in the storyline feel impeded by the development of the science and technology of the council. Tried to stop the progress of freedom and the end of the trial. Progress-oriented councils will not suppress free speech of rebel groups. But only prepare 'Gas peace' in times of emergency and need freedom and space to track progress only. <br /> <br /> So it is. Stories about freedom of science as far as possible about the wonders of progress Many people in our society will agree with these basic places, except in the case of social bias. (Many people want to ban cloning) or popularism. (Some people don't want us to progress freely and rather Extinction at a given time while oppressing the world) or fear / reason (some people believe that we are not ready for science / advanced technology because we may destroy ourselves) but Cabal (President of the Council) has answers to problems Danger: "Our scientific revolution does not eliminate death or danger. It makes death and danger worth while." (Screenplay)
