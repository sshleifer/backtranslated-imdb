Okay, sorry, but I love this movie. I love all 80 types of movies because you won't see anything like this again! I want to ask everyone who says that this movie is just a mimic or a mimic of imitation. I have never seen this movie before, rather than a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Essentially, it's about a popular group in a school that likes to make everyone live by using hell. The nerdy boy named Marty It changed terribly when he was injured in a play. <br /> <br /> So it was like 10 years later and a group of friends who attacked Marty started receiving letters from high school. They are the only ones that accept them! So they go back to study at the old school and one by one, being knocked out by ....... Yes, you may know what happened end It may be abandoned or thought better. <br /> <br /> I think you should try and not try to criticize! <br /> <br /> ~ * ~ CupidGrl ~ * ~
