Free features can now be seen in both art, film and video, resume into Broken mode and promote twenty minutes with style and enthusiasm to spare. But is it better than a movie or is it only usable as an example? Ah, there is a lie. <br /> <br /> Bonnie Clayton's story was kidnapped after waking up from a nightmare recurring one night. "Stranger, sadistic and his colorful follower") When she was taken captive, it was clear that her kidnappers knew about her even though she didn't know. While they asked her, the black soldier wore his gun into the hiding place to try to save her life. <br /> <br /> Luckily for us, director Alex Ferrari seems to know what he does, or at least he is good at faking. Shattered does not suffer from lack of any ability to see, which is commendable, especially considering the budget and without the experience of everyone involved. Things that are given by weakness and essay writing Think of trying to kiss Goodnight. Meet the Matrix, write ten minutes after reading Fight Club. Good news for Ferrari and producer / author Jorge Rodriguez is that the composition of the story is easily overlooked for on-screen performances. The plot is really important or not very short in twenty minutes. Does it mean to show the technical skills of the creator? <br /> <br /> Although it's not fair for me to overlook the negative in terms of budget and length of the movie. Crack is a classic, no type. The biggest problem is that it will actually work better as a full-length "twist" feature. Finally, don't create enough time to be shocked. If Ferrari is allowed to use the time to burn, this feature slows down as needed. The plot elements will look less random and the movie will be more complete. This is to know that he was given the opportunity. <br /> <br /> Presenting the sound of 5.1 Dolby Digital 5.1 is second to none in the indie world. I've never heard the aggressive sound from this small feature. The soundtrack inspired by The Matrix is ​​complete and very deep. The gun has punches and even the dialogue comes into effect. Surround Everything presented on this disc is a sound that speaks praise for modern independent DVD production. Included is the equally impressive Dolby 2.0 track, which is the default setting of the menu. <br /> <br /> The special thing is the hours of creating features that will be found on this disc. In fact, there are many special things that I find unrealistic to list and explain each item here, while still expecting my readers to continue reading. No matter how short the actual defects may be, DVDs have the resources to provide unprecedented information. Those who like this film can learn everything about production, including everything from art to concept to promotional campaigns. Those who plan to create their own indie movies can learn everything they want to know from these properties. <br /> <br /> The special things are divided into categories. These include: pre-production, post-production production, after a brief period and history of actors and teams From an important point of view, I find that some parts are quite short. If they are fixed as one feature per menu, they will be less frustrated in navigation because the cursor will default to the top choice and return to the main menu every time. Of course, this is just nitpicking, but maybe for future DVDs, filmmakers will use my advice to the heart. <br /> <br /> There are six voices, criticisms and hours of interviews and talented and even people. Have consonants The sales of their true colors shine out. <br /> <br /> The willingness to share the secrets of making their movies with anyone who picks up this DVD is quite generous. From the special things that I learned that which editing software and effects are the most reliable and effective, which brand of camera creates the most professional image at the lowest price? On top of this, I have received other options. In the event that I find myself unable to find any products used in this particular production, the filmmaker Wannabe reluctant to read the book about it will do well in Watching this DVD <br /> <br /> Overall, I got a really short score of 6 out of 10, but hopefully there are options for the length of the feature. Potential and effort because I scored 8 or 9 in these fields. I recommend DVDs for features and are a perfect example of what can be done for just eight thousand US dollars. Those who buy DVDs can think of themselves as ghosts of producers for large projects. When getting more attention, these people will receive more funding for a longer version of the feature.
