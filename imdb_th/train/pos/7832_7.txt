I finally had the desire to see this in the movie. I've seen Fritz Lang's movies in the video many years ago. I hope the ideal screening conditions will use their magic. <br /> <br /> The conditions are most suitable at Cinematheque Ontario. The old full-length printing. Subtitles in gothic script, original German, with correct English translations without having to be too literally The ideal live piano performance <br /> <br /> The magic of the movie splashed for a while. But eventually failing to capture at least for me. <br /> <br /> This film has no real relationship with Wagner's cycle, as I know, but some may not. Wagner has adapted 13 c Niebelungenenced For his own purposes Part of Fritz Lang's epic - "Siegfried" - there are many to be familiar with Wagner's listeners. However, <br /> "Kriemhild's revenge" is the story of Siegfried Kriemhild's wife. She is married to King Etzel. (Attila) Hun and her desire to take revenge on Hagen and Gunther, the Nibel uncle, who was converted to kill Siegfried. The amazing explosion in this film should develop and expand into the Mythos, as the Götterdämmerung, his Twilight of the Gods, and the end of Valhalla. This film is still in the soil. <br /> <br /> Most movies are exciting. The large series is comparable to "Cabiria" (1914), which inspired Griffith's "intolerance" (1916). Their decorations set a new standard in barbaric beauty. There are huge characters with enormous scars, Huns and Burg Burg, Art Deco and fighting battles that seem to never end. <br /> <br /> Kriemhild is very successful in revenge plans. yours She tries to destroy everything around her. Her loyalty to her sufferer Siegfried does not seem to be much from love or sacrifice. But from what is close to the psychosis, Lady Macbeth cries out. She knows that she is not emotionally prepared for what she has to do, but Kriemhild does not show normal human emotions and certainly does not match the principle. Of women, she was in "the most brutal" to borrow Shakespeare's phrase from the beginning. Margarethe Schön and her director conveyed this brightly. I do not want to be very boastful. But that is the only thing that makes Kriemhild's face moving It is the culmination of a solo performance. However, it was clearly intentional, not just a matter of bad performances. <br /> <br /> What we had at that time was a one-dimensional sketch of an avenged Fury. Some people might see Kriemhild as the heroine who has been given power. I just watched this movie as a woman.
