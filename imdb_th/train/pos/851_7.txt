Pierce Brosnan sipped his last martini and came back with a terrifying mockery. Julian Noble Noble, a new killer with a passion for teenagers, bullfighting and tasteless clothing. While working in Mexico City, he met Danny. (Greg Kinner), a suburban businessman in Denver who had a straightforward problem in town to make a deal in life in the hotel bar. Despite having a completely different personality and Julian's rude and unreasonable words, they became friends. <br /> <br /> Director Richard Shepard, director Richard Shepard revealed that he didn't write the script. This movie with Pierce Brosnan in my heart, but I can't imagine what he will do. He proved to be a true talent for comedians and probably more than James Bond or the Cold War spy. The scene in which they met at the hotel bar (Beautiful scenes and beautiful photography) is a skill to show courage. That scene took almost fifteen minutes and although it may have been carefully scripted But both actors often broke out. But they have achieved great success! It almost feels like a new standard on the screen. Think of Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel on MEAN STEETS, improvise and add one of the most delicate parts of many types of clich√©s and actors who are actors of their own (especially James Bond of Brosnan) and you get the most delightful couple in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Sadly, the story looks a little thin. After one hour, the movie has just disappeared. However, and I certainly can't put my finger on it. I really enjoy it. It feels fresh and original using the imagination and use of light and the advice of Seijun Suzuki and Jean-Pierre Melville. Other characters do not do much. But this film offers something new. In that respect, it is almost easily accomplished in the combination of all general genres with spoofs for entertainment. Very fun. <br /> <br /> Obscura camera --- 7 / 10
