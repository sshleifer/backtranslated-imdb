Many reviews and comments that I have read about this film say that this is an old movie and a performance by Clara Bow. Although the story is typical of Clara's later silence, I still find it quite exciting and incredibly fun. Clara plays the lucky Hawaiian girl who is happy to not stop to win the one she loves ... It doesn't matter if this man is married! The lack of clamor of Clara was shocking during the day. But I believe it gives the sweetness and general fun of the movie Although not a great story (Quite normal) but this movie is a good show of Clara's ability to make viewers laugh
