Almost all things happened in public baths in China. No fancy dress, bomb or charming person - only writing, acting and good navigation (Hollywood acknowledges!) <br /> <br /> The son who is distant back home when he believes that his father is dying. He was surprised to see that his father looked good and operated a family business as usual. In fact, he noticed that his father and his retarded brother had forged a close and caring relationship, and soon it became clear that he had left the band! The father is very traditional and this son, who came from a large city and did not see the value of the old bathhouse How their relationship changed and the turning point from that place was excellent and reliable. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to see that not all Chinese movies are action movies. (Eg starring Jet Li or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) because I don't care about these crazy movies specially Shower and spring in a small town is a wonderful example. Two examples of good Chinese movies about people!
