It's great Feeling full of action and perfection for Kurt Russel. I love this movie. It deserves more than 5.3 stars. Time for fighting needs to be protected. I cry, laugh and most sit in the fear of this story. Good writings for flick, action and plot that are fairly and fairly stable. The ending is not twisted. But still excellent If you like to escape from New York or root for those underdogs, this movie is for you. Not too much blood or violence. It is not difficult to see in that sense. Something for everyone.
