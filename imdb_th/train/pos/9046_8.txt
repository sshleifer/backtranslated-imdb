I saw Jake Gyllenhaal for the first time in Jarhead (2005) for a moment and then since then I watched all his movies that came to my radar screen. Like Clive Owen, he has violence. (And he is like Owen) that just flows out of the screen I am sure that if he has a role with some meat, he will break the Oscar one day ... <br /> <br /> That's not the refusal of this movie. <br /> <br /> It is a good story with a very credible people (according to the author's early shenanigans with rockets). A great actor With a mix of pathetic humor, excitement ... and a great soundtrack with many rock and roll songs that will make your feet dance. <br /> <br /> But this movie is Especially important for me: in 1957 I was the same age as Homer Hickham; Like him, I looked up at the stars at night to see Sputnik while it was dark. Like Homer, I experimented with rockets in my backyard and used the same chemicals as fuels. And just like Homer, I have tried most of the things that ended in a catastrophic explosion! It's so fun ... <br /> <br /> I can't achieve his great height. (Comparative and physical) But that's what you discover when you watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's a basic family movie. Take time to watch with the kids: You will all have a good laugh.
