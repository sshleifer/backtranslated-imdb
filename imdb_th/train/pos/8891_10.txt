I can agree with other opinions that there is no mention of the enormous amount of history in the movie. But it's not a documentary! It means entertainment and I think it's doing very well. <br /> <br /> I agree with the black family. The scene with them seems to be out of place. As if it happened suddenly, it would be thrown in But I understand the story and the relationship between the family later and find it quite well Landmark of the Decade I find it very fun and worth watching.
