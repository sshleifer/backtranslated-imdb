As part of the terminology in the late 1950s, we know Ponderosa, Little Joe, Hoss, Ben Cartwright and others as well as the great "Bonanza" <br /> <br /> On Saturday night and everyone was arrested on television. This is a real list of family values. There may be a weekly crisis. But it is a strong family atmosphere that attracts everyone together. <br /> <br /> Lorne Green is influential as the head of the family. His words show wisdom. Often we are left to wonder if Ben Cartwright, a widow, must be the best husband of his poor wife who died. <br /> <br /> Naturally, we all wonder why Pernell Roberts left the show. The show was a gold mine and Roberts surrendered a lot of money when he left. His career was never removed when he had a relationship as a wagon son. He should try to get back into the series. Of course he lost the bonanza by going out.
