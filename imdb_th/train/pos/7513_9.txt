"The Notorious Bettie Page" (2005) <br /> <br /> Directed by: Mary Harron <br /> <br /> Starring: Gretchen Mol, Chris Bauer, Lili Taylor, Sarah Paulson and David Strathairn <br / > <br /> MPAA score: "R" (for nudity, sexual content and some languages) <br /> <br /> Looks like everyone today is getting a biography about his or her life. From Ray Charles to Johnny Cash, the biopics are now great. "The Notorious Bettie Page" is the latest version that will be released on DVD. It has the features of Gretchen Mol, the world's most famous pin-up version, Bettie Page and filmed mostly in black and white, with some excerpts that are different from "Ray", "Walk the Line". And "Finding Neverland". However, this movie will not be released in Oscar this year. This film has no emotional resonance that is shown in other biopics, and the most remarkable moment in the life of the Bettie Page may be completely overlooked or just suggested. However, this doesn't mean that it's a bad movie. In fact, "The Notorious Bettie Page" is a truly entertaining and fulfilling movie - a solid work of movies. This film focuses on the exciting work of the page and the line between sex and pornography. It was filmed with extreme heat and the care and direction of Mary Haron, capturing and feeling the moment that most filmmakers dream of. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows Bettie Page ( Played by Mol) Whether you know her as an icon or a simple porn star, you know her. She is a woman who has a profound impact on American culture by revealing more skin than was seen at that time. Now most people know her as America's first sexual symbol, which is the legend of many models, especially Playboy and other adult magazines. She lives in a time that shows only the debris below the garbage. There are people arrested and the slaves form the face of the face is just something that will push the American people into chaos. In fact, the photo launches a full Senate investigation about mutual suitability and the difference between non-threatening movies and pornography. <br /> <br /> The performance in "The Notorious Bettie Page" Absolutely wonderful with Gretchen Mol. Her performance as Bettie Page is great. I understand that when she was announced for this role, many people didn't believe it. Her name is not the name that I will immediately think of. When I think of a great performance, now it will be. She plays a complete role and draws me in with a fragile and deeply engaging performance. David Strathairn is fresh. From "Good Night and Good Luck" last year, which he performed the best in 2005. Here he also gave good results again, even though he was slightly used I was shocked that the time on his screen was very limited, but the quality was too high that it was always the most important thing of the movie. The only performance I saw from Lili Taylor was in "The Haunting" (1999). While most people don't care about this movie, I find it fun. But if not superficial, horror movies, and I always thought that Taylor was completely reliable as a moody person. Here, Taylor also provides reliable performance. She gave a very quiet performance and gave a perfect performance to compliment Gretchen. <br /> <br /> After everything was said and done, I realized that as "Find Neverland" and "Walk the Line" It's not comparable to these things because it tells the story of a woman and her career from start to finish. Her personal life is briefly implied, but it is her impact on the world that has become the highest point. We watch movies that know that the page will eventually be naked and we know the impact that her decision will have. But we rarely show the effect they will have on her personal life She is a woman who never looks back and can invent herself at any time. Finally, she is an adult model, turned to teach Christianity. This movie is not beyond the drama. May include a fictitious moment from Page hob like crazy and ask God to forgive her It may show that the page is running and screaming in the rain trying to escape from her past ghosts, but not "the famous Betty page" tells a simple story and that's what Rare according to current standards Fortunately, it's quite refreshing. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: "The Notorious Bettie Page" is a relaxing movie with an amazing movie. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 9 / 10 (A)
