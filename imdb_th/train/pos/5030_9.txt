There is something that surprised me about this movie - it's true. It's not an old-fashioned shit that comes out of Hollywood every month. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in the video because I didn't know this before seeing it at a local video store. My If you see this movie for rent - you won't regret. The doubts are constantly created and the end of the twist is excellent. <br /> <br />
