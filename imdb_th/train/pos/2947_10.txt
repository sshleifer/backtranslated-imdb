If you don't see this, you don't know what you missed. The first time you do that, you will have to lament with the pain that is lying on the floor because of laughing heavily and possibly getting wet as well. <br /> <br /> It's funny. I've never had a comedy before. So far, I have seen that it's great or near. <br /> <br /> One classic torpedo, stories and segways .. <br /> <br /> Uncle Kao at BBQ, Gi Joe , Mr T, goony Goo Goo, human ice cream. You say these things to everyone at Have seen this show and I will bet you a dollar for donuts. They will not be able to keep the face straight and will burst with laughter or recite the rest of the action. <br /> <br /> Pure classic !! The shame you can't get on DVD .. <br /> <br /> Rate 10+ from 10
