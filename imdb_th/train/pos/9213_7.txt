Gómez Pereira is responsible for the most nasty comedies in the latest Spanish film. (Look at his course history) So I don't expect "Cosas Que Hacen ..." ... actually don't know why in the world I decided to watch. Anyway, I just do ... and very surprising. It seems that Gómez Pereira is finally due and now he can make a good movie. He has done a recent job involving middle-aged crises, frustrations, and finding a second chance after you destroy it all. The last half hour of the movie (Even more amazing) is the best part and it's worth watching movies. In addition, we also have Eduard Fernandez who has the main role and I still think he is the best actor in his generation (by far). <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
