This movie is very stupid. <br /> <br /> But do you expect to have a high intelligence movie based on a cartoon named Slam Dunk? Really? Jay Zhou's performance is not the most moving thing I've ever seen. But i enjoy movies Is it somewhere near the wonderful level that people like Jet Li or Stephen Chow can produce? Not really Is it thoroughly entertaining if you just use it for surface values? Of course, it is a movie about candy idols and Chinese musicians who can play basketball in a special way. There are three evil friends and cunning men that make Jay Chou participate in all this. Love, attention, it's a formula, but actually suppressing the unbelief for a moment. It's called Kung Fu Dunk. Do yourself a favor. If you watch - I find myself having some Engrish narratives that make the dialogue movie unwise, unwise. But we can laugh out It seems that they are very much stuck in Jerusalem. And numbers 1, 10 <br /> <br /> I laughed. I cried and I swung. I'll see again. <br /> <br /> Especially the fight scene in the bar. Good choreography and good shot I enjoy the pool table with crystal balls extra bright - I like to play with one of them. <br /> <br /> Smooth enough for me.
