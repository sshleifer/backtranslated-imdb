Before this, I thought that this movie was the most stupid movie of the Muppet. I want to withdraw that order now. In my opinion, the biggest movie MUppet is the TV movie IT MERRY MUPPET. Christmas is a wonderful life that ripped out, which is really scary. MUPPETS uses MANHATTAN. Nothing special. But happier than the Miles Christmas MERPET <br /> <br /> The best song is the song 'You Can't Take No To An Answer'. Muppet Babies sings songs and songs for a great ending. While I love the Muppet Babies list, I like the Muppet Babies sequence here (I said it was an inspiration to show Muppet Babies) <br /> <br /> MELODIES OF MANHATTAN MELODIES. That is a true showstopper. Sesame Street appeared at the wedding. As Mitchits placed in his last line But I hope that things that are between the beginning and the end are a bit more entertainment. There is a lovely pendant from Brooke Shields and Gregory Hines and a great dance set from Rizzo and Rats (designed by Jim Henson, the great man himself who was designed at the end) and the movie certainly entertained. I have to state that the movie MUPPET, MUPPET EXCELLENT and the Christmas MUPPET CAROL are the three most obvious MUppet movies.
