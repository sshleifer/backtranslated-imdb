I love this anime! I laughed my head away with jokes and violence. (Mostly from Akane Ranma who is hesitant But the short temper "fianc√©") is too painful But Ranma deserves it But he tries to do the best ... Ranma's main character goes to China to train only to fall into Jusenkkyo Spring. Curse and become a girl when splashed with cold water. Then it was pure chaos. Among the outstanding things is the partner and sister of Kuno and Kodaji, the sexy shampoo that makes Happosai all wrong. But creating problems for our hero / heroine. However, it is Mama's selfish father who is the perpetrator because of confusion at all times. If anyone wants an anime, this story is probably the story. It's more cute and better with Japanese dub.
