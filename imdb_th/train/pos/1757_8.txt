It was the idea that children and movies didn't try to cover up their youth. <br /> <br /> Andy's friends are a natural component of his nervousness: David (Paul Rudd) broke up with his girlfriend. Two years ago, but still obsessed with her, Jay (Romany Malco) is a woman, a flirtatious woman and Cal (Seth Rogen) is a tattooed sexaholic. Their efforts to make Andy fall in a sack.

Many offers <br /> <br /> However, in the end, the most interesting and most surprising thing of Virgin 40 years is maturity.

But after watching this movie, it is easy to understand why we like Andy. We care about him. He's not just a cardboard, sex cutout, funny sex? He is a life that is alive and really breathing. His neurological nature combines the best of Woody Allen with innocent innocence. His friends didn't jerk, jerk, and his romance was turbulent and bitter. <br /> <br /> Although this is not a perfect movie and has a bit of rude and sexual humor.
