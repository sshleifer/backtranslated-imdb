I love this movie It is well written and serves and has good movies. The story combines action, humor, mystery and tenderness with a wonderful scene and pictures of beautiful places. See, buy, buy, show to your friends. <br /> <br /> The performance is good and Murphy performs well, especially showing the unwilling / unsure of the hero. I enjoy all the characters and find That they are interesting and well developed with dynamic interactions. <br /> <br /> I care about what happens to these people and while the results are quite predictable. The girl is amazingly attractive and the sacred child saves lives - who doesn't see it?) It also makes me happy when everything works well in the end. Thank God that this film has never been destroyed by the crappy sequel. Pick up the popcorn to hug on the sofa and watch this movie. Have fun, be happy and have fun.
