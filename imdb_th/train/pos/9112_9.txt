Being half Portuguese does not make me half blind. (Or half-bias) when talking about Portuguese movies No matter how often I do that But this movie is very exciting! Yes, right - it's as accurate as the history goes / goes - but it never stops to cross over the territory of Portugal. Crowd Standing for a real crowd almost 30 years ago and by God they were right! OK to conclude: very emotional if you live through it But you will see a slight improvement that can be done, as well as the necessary plot. If you just watch it randomly, you're in a period with good historical stories, whether it's past history and more proof of normal thinking Even according to European standards, yes
