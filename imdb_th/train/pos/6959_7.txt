This is the movie Ivan Reitman. With rare exceptions, Ivan likes to have fun. In general, his movies are not "deep", but they are always entertaining enough. Super Ex-Girlfriend Surprised me in what I laughed more than I thought I would Ummar is so great and I love drawing her. I also like Luke Wilson and Renn Wilson honking the horn. Never serious about himself, this movie is over But it is not unique and does not go where no one has ever before .... it is very good and may be a good day for you Headache and do not want to stress your brain It's a very fun game and there's nothing wrong. When you cut something "Super-Girl" away, you will rest. But the story about relationships and relationships is bad It was a boy who met a girl, a boy out of the girl's thing. And finally, the character looks for love Not everyone who will be "dumped" and can do .... is a piece of life that has changed.
