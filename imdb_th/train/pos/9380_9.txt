The lovely old-fashioned thriller is coming like a cross between Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch. "Red Rock West" follows the insecurity of an injured person, an unemployed Mr. N. K. Empty gas tank and not enough money to buy a cup of coffee in the city ute behind it. It was built from the beginning until Mr Cage might be down. But he didn't come out and he might crash But he will not steal even in his current horrifying situation, often when he is mistaken by Mr JT Walsh for the man he has assigned to kill his wife. Mr Cage demands that the wife remind her of The intention of her husband, on the other hand, she, as your person, LFBoyle offered him more money to kill Walsh. Decided to leave while he was still ahead But while he was driving out of the city, he found a man on the road, being excluded while he might have to drive. He took the man to the hospital. Mr Cage was detained by the officer who called the sheriff who became Mr. JTWalsh. The situation changed more complicated when escaping from detention. Mr.Cage avoided being hit by a real killer on the way to fill up. His commissions, you may now be forgiven because you think "Enough" but because it happens on the screen, it seems to be a complete turn of events. The flow of the film's narrative at this point seems impossible. Mr D.Hopper is a hired killer. Such as Mr Cage, USMC veteran. This small piece of Serendipity has made Mr Cage survive long enough to think about killing and survive. It is a tribute to everyone involved that the listener on the paper is amazing, like a piece of nonsense, in fact, is a particularly stressful picture with good performances all around "Red Rock West" as a movie The movie of lovers within five minutes that you know you are going somewhere you have been to many times. But you will be very happy during the trip
