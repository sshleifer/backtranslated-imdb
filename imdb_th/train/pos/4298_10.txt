This movie shocked me so much that I watched it at least once a year. Sometimes I feel uneasy. Sometimes I find it powerful. And I always find human characters and real people It is a movie that shows you the realities of life in LA. Start with the light of a helicopter. Find the dangers that are lurking near the normal life of the characters. It's a movie that shows you that the kindness of strangers can change your life and help you make a difference. Grand Canyon reminds you that every action you take has an effective impact. I found that the film has many similarities in many ways with Robert Altman's short film. Both have a complete list of stars, actors and actors, and both films help you gradually see how the characters are. How to relate to each other and affect each other Grand Canyon works better in presenting strong messages. (Hopefully when faced with the hopeless truth) rather than Altman's movie This movie is something to watch !!!
