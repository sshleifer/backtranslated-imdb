Most Italian horror movie lovers seem to hate this movie because they are not related to the first two demons, and with "Devil III" in the title, one would think it would be The problem is that this film never intended to be a part of the demon series. The only distributor "Devil III" above the original name of "ghouls" to cash in on other popular movies. This new American DVD version is named "Demons III: The Ogre" in the box, but the movie itself says "The Ogre" only. I do not know whether it was published in the past. Is there a name "Demons III" in the movie? But this new launch seems to be a little white lie. If you can pass the "Devil III" in your name, you may enjoy "The Ogre". It begins with progress and continues to progress. No bleeding and this movie looks slow. But I still dig it Don't expect it to be like another demon movie. I give "The Ogre" 7 out of 10 Italian fans should try.
