I grew up in Royersford, Pa., A town in the market of Jerry. I remember my family going out to see the filming. I remember having a man showing "Blob" with me and my brothers and sisters in the bucket. I want to share that my mother is in the movie Her hair style is the same as that of Aneta Corsaut and she is sick one evening. They see my mother and ask her to sit in the car with Steve Mcqueen for an appointment from behind. They paid her $ 25.00 and told her story until she left in August. My mother is not a teenager and she is a few months from giving birth to my little sister.
