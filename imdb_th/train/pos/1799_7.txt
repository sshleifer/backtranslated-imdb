I am 14 years old and I love this cartoon. Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise create a great pair. This movie is really funny and I like music a lot. My favorite song is "You can't be a good dog" and the song is about sharing. I think the name "I am yours" This is the last movie with Judith Barsi, who plays the voice of Anne-Marie. My favorite character is Charlie, but I found that Itchy's voice was so fun to hear. Although some scenes that I found really scary, I still have a hard time watching the scenes with Charlie's dream and Carface scrap the shit out of me. Other characters like King Gator I find really funny. The cute and sad ending actually makes me cry a little. I gave this movie 7/10
