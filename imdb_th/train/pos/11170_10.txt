There is something about Pet Sematary that I have never felt before. Perhaps the truth is I am a kid when I first watch it, making this experience very memorable. But when I watched it over and over again, it wasn't old and I wasn't bored. From opening credits to creepy open songs to very busy endings, there are some things that are crazy, sad and scary at the same time and it still resonates in your head: sometimes die better br /> I don't think it would be useful to tell the whole story again. What you need to know is that it starts from point A (the perfect situation for a happy American family) and slowly sinks to point B (which is to believe me, the end of happiness). Proper, cool effects and Pet Sematary is the last place in the world that I will be. As I said, sometimes the dead are better!
