This may be one of the most popular movies of the 40s - Warner Bros. at the height of their style. Photography by Sol Polito is his greatest work - beautiful elements and light with delicate shadows. Max Steiner scored one of his most beautiful and beautiful scores - the best example of his classic leit method. This song enhances the mood and excitement of the storyline in a beautiful and memorable manner. It is interesting to know that the same production team that made this film continue to create "Now, Voyager" that year - good movies that have won and honors. In my opinion, "The Gay Sisters" is a much better movie - better built in every department and more interesting, complex and fun. The most bizarre movie that entertains people who accept it, in which it is more than to project their own modern creative feelings or advanced standards. Each thing must be judged at the time of its own reference and for what is trying to fulfill its own condition. Most of the complaints I have read in these reviews are children and lack all issues. If you're hungry for the perfect tenderloin, don't go to the bakery and start complaining and complaining about Pui. The art of film criticism literally disappeared in the majority of the population. People who apologize - perhaps if the movie has scores from Rolling Stones and complex sub-plans and search for hundreds of spirits, you all will be glad. I will watch old movies without claiming modern intellectual days a week!
