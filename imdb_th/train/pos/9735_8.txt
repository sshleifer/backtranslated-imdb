Romantic comedy is not the correct way to explain. "How to lose friends & make strangers" The basic love in the plot is largely replaced by more interesting "rags to riches" stories. Although the middle line of the story is passed quickly But in many shots of the screen, it feels like "nitty gritty" goes out, focusing on the important relationships that make "Office politics" and using almost all unrelated scenes But it works well, especially with Pegg at the front seat In the end, this film is very clever, plays well with the relationship between the Atlantic Ocean and Pegg, together with his co-stars and combines the cross between high and low societies. Life is quite good, traveling different characters in the movie. This has a good presentation and the casting is definitely a positive point for this film, both "trade relations" between Pegg and Huston and "Love, Hate" The relationship between Pegg and Dunst works very well in matters that require charm. Even the Fox, the main asset that attracts sex, is still shocked by what becomes a dark character and serves the role of "bimbo" well. It is one of these films that little detail. Every piece delivers great masterpieces. From cross-gender dancers to the amazing soundtrack, every song is compatible with what can only be described as a clever comedy.
