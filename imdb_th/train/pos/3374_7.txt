"Soylent Green" is one of the best and most annoying science fiction movies of the 70s and is still very persuasive even in today's standards. Although the flaws and dates are slightly apocalyptic and environmental evidence (Usually for that time) still feels insecure and thought-provoking The quality of this film surpasses the contemporary SF flicks, mainly due to the strong performances and the intense sequence that I consider to be the classic New York. 2022 is a depressing place to live with too much population. Unemployment, climate that is not good for health and all shortages of all important food products The only form of food that is available is synthetic food and distributed by Soylent Charlton Heston. (In good shape) plays the police investigating the murder of one of Soylent's most famous executives, and he stumbles upon a scandal and a dark secret ... a great surprise. The atmosphere is also tense and mysterious. The sequence of truly brutal and easy riots, one of the most terrifying moments of the 70s movies. Finally, Edward G. Robinson is impressive in his final role and has an excellent supporting role. (But moderately) for Joseph Cotton ("Blood Baron", "Doctor Offensive Phibes") This is a science fiction book in my book: Nightmares and inevitably fades for humanity! No fancy space ships with hairy feathers attack our planet.
