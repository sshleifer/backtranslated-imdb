I have watched this movie for a while after ordering my friend, who is a big fan of Dominic Monaghan. The movie itself is very interesting, although it has a positive point, which for me is Donnie Darko's "wtf". The factor after the movie ends. <br /> <br /> Of course, plus is a negative For me, the girl in this movie is very good and Dominic Monaghan did well as well. Unfortunately I don't have this comment about Daniel Burke. Lonnie players may be me and I don't claim to be a serious critic in the way I didn't find myself good enough. But he doesn't seem to believe as an actor But sometimes it's more amazing for me, not a critic. But this thing makes me interested. <br /> <br /> Well, I think it's a precious movie. It's interesting, confusing and you should see it.
