This is one of the unique horror movies that needs a deeper understanding of the word 'horror' in order to be appreciated. It's important that people may fail to know that this story is told through the perspective of the little boy and, like the youngest child, he easily gets fear. Mostly because he didn't understand things like why his father wasn't there for him. From watching movies, you can see the husband arguing with his wife about the balance between work time and family time and you can easily understand. But not a small boy Also can imagine that the boy was afraid of the tree because it was created early in this film that the family came from the city. At first, when the family traveled to the house, they were hit by a deer and then arrested /> <br /> "Wendigo" is something that his innocent young mind invented to explain all this. There are American Indian myths. But when looking at the scene where the boy heard about it, it would explain to him honestly and easily. Not because that's what Wendigo really is, but because that's the way he understands. When you watch a movie from this point of view, you really begin to appreciate it. Obviously it was a low budget and shot cheaply. But the masterpiece jump, the use of light and general agility rather than makeup And the last question the movie asks is: Is it all in your head? 8/10 <br /> <br /> Rate R: rudeness, violence and sex scenes
