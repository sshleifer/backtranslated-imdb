I saw many Saura movies and often found the way in which he collected great music, dance, drama and movies in his films. Ib√©ria showed Saura better handling multimedia concepts and contemporary concepts of dance and music What is known as my interest is the fact that in this movie, dancers and musicians, dancing and music are equally important: the camera shows various aspects of musical interpretation. But only technical problems. Saura's interest on the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is another element that makes this film the most exciting movie of his other works. That's why I highly recommend it to those who love good movies, good music, good dance, great art.
