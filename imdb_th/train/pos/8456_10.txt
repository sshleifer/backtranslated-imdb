I have watched almost all of the Gundam / Mek anime shows in the United States and the best stories right now. How the plot of it twists and turns Gundam Wing is a series that focuses primarily on politics and war. The following series of five 15-year-old men who are trained as pilots of mobile suits known as Gundams. Gundam pilots are trained to fight the known insurgency. In the name of an ounce When things began to heat up between the OZ and the Gundam pilots, a new political group would emerge and the old people would break away. The old conflict will end and new conflicts will arise. In order to gain peace, the Gundam pilots must come to catch up with the events in their world and stop all battles. But how happy people are to reach their goals I recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for an item that has a profound story.
