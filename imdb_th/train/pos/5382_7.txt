After watching the Next Action Star reality TV series, I was pleased to see the winner's movie immediately. I showed new talents, but I was surprised and excited, of course, that Billy Zane was his best persona as usual, but Corinne and Sean were by his side. It's good to see Jared and Jeanne (from the competition) in their role. The character of Sean is not Billy, who is a hunter and his frustration in discovering new rules in that game. Playing well, Corinne walks very well between her character who likes Sean and is there for money. I like games played until the last moment. Moreover! Not a great movie But as entertainment throughout the show, excellent for two people, the first time they left the door
