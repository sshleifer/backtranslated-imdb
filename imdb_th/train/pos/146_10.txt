I came to an end and almost shouted. "No, no, no, no. It doesn't end here! There are too many unanswered questions! The engagement of the dishwasher - the disappearance of Mona? "Zombies"? The little brother saved his father's life and things about the head ??????? "Oops !! Then I read that at least two actors and members had already passed, and I must say that I knew that it was not true with the vision of Lars von Trier. The ending he has planned! True, it's hard to find someone who will play Helmer as a character that deserves. Helmer doctor you hate! I think I haven't seen the characters that are obsessed and forgetting themselves on the screen more! But I can overlook the actors' changes ... I just have to know how it will end!
