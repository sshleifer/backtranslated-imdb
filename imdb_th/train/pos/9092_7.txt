I think this movie adds variety and is very accurate in terms of history. The way it shows that the communities that gather in Thailand are very interesting ... Portugal, Japan, and communities that the king has managed. The plot around the court is usually a battle for power with many betrayals. The wardrobe is ok. This film is also made locally in Thailand for proper production. The scene with the demon as an executive is very interesting. It's fun and I think it can be used in schools for historical accuracy because it shows that Europe in Asia is a subject of local kings in a way that is different from the Hollywood view. original
