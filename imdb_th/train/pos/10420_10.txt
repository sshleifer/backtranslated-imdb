The Great Caruso shows Mario Lanza's special abilities. He shows great talent in acting and is at the top level as a lyrical singer with soprano singer Dorothy Kirsten of the Metropolitan Opera. Of course I dare to say that he Make music better than Caruso (check A'Vuchella from Tosti and La Danza from Rossini). MGM's art and music department works well as well. This film may be perfect if not Ann Bly in the face of awkward duties; We saw that she tried her best to dress up in the 50s style in the scene before the 1920s - forgive us. Lanza deserves to be a better female leader and Blythe should stick to the less demanding productions. In addition, he noted that Kristen sings most opera duo in this film, with Lanza causing the wrong idea that Caruso is a permanent soprano.
