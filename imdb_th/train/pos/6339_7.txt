The Grinch was created for Jim Carrey and I was very impressed with his performance. Not being a big fan of him, I was apprehensive. But was surprised by the result that Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou, who is the most adorable girl I have seen on the screen for a long time, and she has maturity that exceeds her age in acting skills you At one point I had to tears! I have never read Dr Seuss narrative books, so I don't know what to expect. The humor is quite dark. Overall, I like this movie. (Apart from music!) And would like to recommend for family viewing especially
