I was surprised that '' Secret Secret '' is a fun movie ... probably because I didn't expect anything about this movie ..... even though this movie has gaps. .... I will say that you can't guess who is behind the whole project until the end of the movie ..... At first I thought Robert Ryan used the same method, like '' Gaslight '' that my husband tried to drive. The wife is crazy but I think wrong ...... The main problem That is, they drove in a different direction which didn't give any hint ..... I think Robert Ryan & Claudette Colbert did a good job ...... Plus, Vivian Vance is an actress Who stole the scene in this story ...... movie enthusiasts That makes you guess, will like this ......
