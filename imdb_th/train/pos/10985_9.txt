I can't speak and be devastated after my first look - many parts of the Gray Garden are very funny and unbelievable - the documentary is not real. Weirdsville's luck. I still focus on the way these women (Which is beyond the clinical discrepancy) revealed his own humanity in the most surprising way, and I wonder if the escape from their world is stimulated by something The universe, perhaps some abuse or may be just a challenge and rebellion that spread from their control and live their own lives. This may be one of the greatest movies that have ever been dangerously close to taking advantage without having to cross the edge - while Edies does what I do, I observe things like empty jin bottles in the full bedroom. With rock fragments The ragged bed emerges from the hole on the wall and the final scene looks incredibly sad - like the child's birthday party is seriously wrong. Worth seeing and looking for - you'll never forget. But very annoying
