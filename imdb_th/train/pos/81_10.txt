I watched the McCoys rally and glad to see Richard Crenna and Kathleen Nolan and Tony Martinez !!! Seeing them now is great because I always watch programs that are growing up when the TV says that I will reunite. very excited !!!! The only thing I can't think of is why Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (Little Luke) aren't there. I know Walter Brennan has died. So I entered the computer and tried to find information about them and found this site, so if someone can tell me what happened to Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (little look, I will thank !! I searched everything without luck. The only thing I knew about Michael Winkelman was that he should be born in 1946. This list is valuable and morally in each show, a lesson to learn. The whole cast is unbelievable, the only thing better than finding fault is finding them. So because it's impossible if someone can help please !!! Glenda Thank you.
