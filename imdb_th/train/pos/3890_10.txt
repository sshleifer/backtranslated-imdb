This is a great DVD! Eddie Izzard is the most fun person I have seen for many years. His hilarious routines and make good conversations with other people who have seen it. I highly recommend this. Regarding the history of Europe is quite slow. But ending the jokes in France is quite good because you don't have to speak French to understand. The part about being a homo is quite good. The first scene (about San Francisco) isn't good, but funny at first. Skip those things if you can. It's hardly worth watching. However, this is a joke that shows that everyone should see. "I'm dead!"
