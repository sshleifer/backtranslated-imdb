Lensman is a very unknown gemstone from Toho and MK studios. It is based on novels. But it reminds me of the more "Metroid" game. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this, see In Japanese, with subtitles or plain Japanese, the English dubbed version is almost cropped and modified to death Hand-drawn animation But it was fun to watch
