I was electric when I saw this for the first time in 1983 or 1984, Steven Biko, halfway through the movie. But his resonance of courage and wisdom was not forgotten. I finally did not come to South Africa in 1993. It is about friendship and loyalty. When I was in South Africa and heard the audience performing a dance that Natal sang Nkosi Sikelel 'iAfrika, my hair stood at the end. There is a lot to learn from this story for everyone.
