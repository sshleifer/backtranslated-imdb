The first collaboration between Schoedsack & Cooper is an interesting documentary about the relocation of the Bakhtiari tribe of Persia. Twice a year, more than 50,000 people and half a million animals cross rivers and mountains for animal feed. You will feel like being pampered after watching these people raise their animals with cold water and walk barefoot through the snow to cross the mountain while trying to keep their animals walking along a steep and narrow path.
