I have been watching this movie for a long time. It is a promotion that gives a fair idea about the content and finally when I see it, I find it quite good. Most romantic movies end up in love eventually. Marriage or starting with a happy life after marriage. But there is a great change for changing from old life into relationships and new lives This is what this movie is about when the new spouse Fardeen and Esha marry through marriages arranged and begin their lives with their honeymoon. The performance is very binding, although I think Esha is still silent and she may use some lines for herself. Good knitting stories and conversations are more or less appropriate. Corrections and directions are good. Meghna Gulzar did very well here. To sum up, I would say that it is a great romantic drama. The ultimate, true combination of things that Bollywood can offer clean entertainment.
