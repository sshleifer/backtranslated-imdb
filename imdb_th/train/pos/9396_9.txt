In every movie, you will find that Nicholas Cage is brave and silent. Dennis Hopper as a villain killer, Lara Flynn Boyle is a vamp / tramp and the hard end of J. Walsh. This is the type of four roles that they can play in sleep mode, and they do it often enough to see them play again in the extent that the boredom. I was so relieved that John Dahl, an energetic teacher from a small act, made this thriller director Noir. What jumped out from the top of the cage shows a deeper depth than his superficial action hero. Boyle is alternately hot, innocent and cunning, and one person will experience the solid iron of the spirit that is centered. With his character Wayne The direction of Dahl gives the empty feeling of Big Sky that the story takes place, while being close enough to show that the wrinkled eyebrows can indicate a drastic change in the plan. In the shop The plot of the twist is a great story, and one of the other great things in this movie is that some supporting characters act as if they have brains. Infrequently, the secondary characters, such as the deputy sheriff, have more brains than their bosses. But with the director as wise as Dahl, you should not be surprised by the cleverness of everything related to this film. Great movie
