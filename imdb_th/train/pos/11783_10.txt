Rock Star: INXS is the best TV drama I've ever seen! It has the greatest rock and roll music ever written by a talented singer / actor. There are also 15 people. (In my opinion) the most feeling the heart, feeling good, being surprised by all reality TV It makes me shed tears of happiness for the winners !!! Throughout the 13 weeks of live TV broadcasts, viewers get to know and be familiar with every contestant. After 30 episodes, the remaining contestants seemed to be friends rather than just strangers competing against each other on a reality TV show. And the fact that the INS is and remains one of the greatest rock and roll bands ever increasing the emotional tension created by this wonderful reality series If you do not record the ROCK STAR series: INXS DVD is a great choice.
