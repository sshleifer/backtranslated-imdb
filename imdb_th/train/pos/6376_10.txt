If you have a son or daughter who loves action, adventure, intrigue and imagination - without having to divide the song every twelve minutes - this is the Disney movie for you! My son loves movies every minute and I have to admit that I laughed aloud many times throughout the story. There are no songs that are happy to tell the story wonderfully and every character is cute and able to identify themselves. This thing should go down as a "classic" of Disney, because it has beautiful scenery and uninterrupted excitement!
