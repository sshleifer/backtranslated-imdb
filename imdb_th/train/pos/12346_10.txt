This is a very good story and poetry. Beautiful scenery Excellent music score I've been to Japan twice a year ago, and this film gives me a typical Japanese feeling. The movement of the camera is great, like the actors. It will deepen in your feelings without becoming insulting. Japanese people are very sensitive and kind and everything is brought to the screen here. The director is playing superbly with light and shows the audience that it is possible for them to enjoy movies with detailed details When you watch this movie, you will want to see more from the same director. It's a movie that feels really good and I can only recommend it for everyone to see.
