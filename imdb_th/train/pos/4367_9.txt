I haven't watched this movie for many years, so my knowledge is quite strong. I remember thinking that this movie is a Braveheart movie twice. It is more realistic and has more credible characters. Ridb Roy looks like someone would imagine Rob Rob looks like a messy hair and beard with simple clothes. Liam Nesson also has a Celtic style about him. He looks like a Scot, and more importantly, Rob Roy is a comparison that angers some people. But comparing him with Mel Gibson as William Wallace Gibson is playing as a legendary man, causing him to be described as a giant 6 feet 7, while Gibson is shortened to nearly one foot. The story has a love, a little conspiracy, and the story that the underdog sounds like Braveheart? But instead of the movie that says "freedom", freedom and nationalism, we get movies that mention honor, love and justice. This made the film more interesting, like Gladiator. A great actor and Liam Neeson are very strong leaders in this effort. Very good story about how to deal with courage and humanity. The scene in which Mary was raped and she walked out of the burning house with the strength of Scotland, followed by washing the semen from her target with shock. This is what the heroine in Braveheart has never done. Overall, this is a beautiful and impeccable watch almost to watch!
