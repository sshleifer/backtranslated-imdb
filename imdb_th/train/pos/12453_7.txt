Unfortunately, many consumers who write reviews for IMDb think that the low budget is not good. No matter what the movie might need, more budget is not part of it. Many sets and special effects will be transformed into Lara Croft. Another thing that we have here is one or two steps. <br /> <br /> Almost unknown Alexandra Staden. Attracting attention from the mysteries that are important, her smart little smile and knowing that the face is a formidable thing and you find yourself wanting the camera to not make your face broken. It makes it possible for the bad guy Nicolai to play without being known. (At least in the United States) Nicholas Coaster-Waldo might be interested in the unusual brain in her. She can divert her attention by breaking and spitting. "Stop wasting my time!" Then burst out between his heavy weapons. The creation of a credible scene didn't happen by chance. <br /> <br /> Maybe the biggest problem I have when playing Staden in some way is polite. It's unbelievable that she will give up. With men who look strong and muscular like Coaster-Waldau And can beat him She is not just Peta Wilson or the Hilary Swank-type actor who is pumping up the punch. Coaster-Waldau Let yourself be dominated by Staden. He seems to be fighting with the little sister. <br /> <br /> Because this is not an actual action movie. I just hope that they will do better if they continue.
