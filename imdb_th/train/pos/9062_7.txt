It's the weekend that I watched this comedy. And i like it very much Every child is cute, which reminds me of my childhood with stupid ideas. It's a real entertainment movie for family groups on weekends that can create a lot of memories and laughter. Children's humor is always available. Good performances as well, easy stories, but good shots are a good job for directors to find their way. When talking about children's movies, I miss "12 and hold" for another year. But different from the world of children, which is true and cruel Great work. H2EFW focuses on the happiness of childhood, which every child and family wants. PS Twitch I think Nemo's voice from "Finding Nemo"
