The film has a clear story, which is rather strange for the musical genre "Cats", "Phantom of the Opera", and other musicals of Andrew Lloyd Webber are considered metaphors because they use literary works as a framework. "The story of Biarkan Bintang Menari" (BBM) touches on the essence of human relationships, especially with the Indonesian people. Despite the fact that this movie is based on the "supposedly" fairy tale, it is the dream of 'children' in Indonesian adults. The dance sequence is not perfect. But the song shows how Indonesian people express themselves. I think choreographers should explore Indonesian dance methods without compromising the fact that the development of dance in Indonesia tends to be more Western. The dance sequence seems to be awkward in some ways and is not synchronized with music and / or music, but I still love this movie and is considered a new wave of Indonesian film genre, which I hope will improve in the future.
