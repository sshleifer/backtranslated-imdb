Amazingly amazing, perhaps the best musical adventure of Disney. I love this movie for more than 35 years because it is a clever and fun fantasy, even though there are stupid "flying" scenes. Other scenes and dialogues are wonderful and funny. Who will they choose better than Angela Lansbury to play Eglantine? I can't think of anybody more suitable for this role. The remembrance of this classic is as stupid as creating Mary Poppins. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson, although he has a low quality screenplay He is a comic genius that is often forgotten today. Insulting and appropriate for the English people - no one can make a slap and pull it out as gracefully as he did. It's sad to create this new movie because Tomlinson died a couple of years ago and no one can step into his shoes and create justice for the characters. <br /> <br /> Evening dresses and dance robes Other movies with witches not captured In particular, I enjoy the various parts that the Germans invaded the house of Eglantine, and she had to protect it in every way she could. <br /> <br /> The shaking, shaking along the beautiful seabed Richard and Robert Sherman beat themselves in musical numbers All of them are fantastic and memorable. Portobello Street is one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> Great movies that still exist today !!
