I really like this movie. It's good and the actors are great! Leon Robinson, Richard's players and other classical singers are very good at his work. When you see him in the movie, you know it's good! I would like to recommend people to watch the heartbeat, sadness and special movies if they want to know more about Richard! Outstanding! fresh!
