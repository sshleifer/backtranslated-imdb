OK, normally I won't watch the movie of the Farrell brothers. I don't remember ever watching one. I can't remember watching Jimmy Fallon's movie. Okay, I watched a taxi. But I said that the penalty and forgiveness for that mistake But this movie has Drew Barrymore and I just think that she is the most cute thing. I don't know what it's about you. But i just smile all the time i watch you She just made me fall in love. I mean, I watched Adam Sandler to meet her in the first 50 days. How sad is it? This is not the greatest baseball movie - it shouldn't be. It is a love story about a sad puppy hanging on the only thing that never disappointed him until he found something worthy of quitting It has a predictable end. But there are many ways that make it worthwhile
