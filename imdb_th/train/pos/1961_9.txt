Just returned from the first performance of Basic Instinct 2. I thought it would be a crappy story of criticism, and I was surprised! If you like traditional basic instincts, I think you will enjoy a lot. No. 2 A great story that always makes you wonder and think. This song is excellent by adjusting the original theme. Do not expect to receive an Academy Award. Watch for fun and fun. That is what movies are designed for escape. I can't think of a way to escape better than escaping with the sexy Sharon Stone as she had been. I'm thinking of going to see again this weekend. Let's see!
