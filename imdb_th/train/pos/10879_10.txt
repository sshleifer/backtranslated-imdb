I want to see the cut since the day I heard it, which sometimes last year. Anyway, I'll see today and when the movie starts, I think it starts quite a week. But will improve after 10 minutes or more I think this movie is quite good. But what I don't like is the way the killer created it. I think before I rent it, it might suck like the legend of the city: the end is almost dead. Most everything in UL cut must be updated to 100 times better than UL: Final cut. The best part of the CUT is the killer and the death scene. The killer kicks MO F *** ING ASS. <br /> <br /> I score 8 out of 10.
