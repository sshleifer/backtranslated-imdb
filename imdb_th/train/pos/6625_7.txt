If you've watched an example for the movie "The Recruit" with Colin Farrell and Al Pacino, you won't have to watch that movie. Sadly, the Renaissance has created similar examples. <br /> <br /> The story of the Renaissance is about detectives investigating the kidnapping of young women and medical researchers. The setting is Paris of the future and the elements of science fiction throughout. Although special things about the Renaissance are visual styles and not a matter of Renaissance is a three-dimensional computer animation, such as Final Fantasy, but is very chic, black and white with a distinct contrast. The results look amazing. (Although the problem of human 3D animation is still observed from time to time, the movement of the little robot, the display of a little wooden face, etc.) as a beautiful and stylish noir movie Not the same quality as the picture It's not a bad thing (And if you don't see the sample, it's more exciting than it is for me), but it's a story that is not original and close to repetition A few lines of dialogue are painful, making writing seem like the first attempt of a beginner. <br /> <br /> I'll definitely recommend Renaissance to friends. It's not like what I've seen before, and I believe that creativity is a rewarding experience. It's a story that can be viewed even if it's not perfect.
