This is one of the unfortunate movies that had a sad and unfortunate death at the box office. I saw this film at a local art theater in the form of a revival shortly after it was packed in the mainstream cinema. Of course, deserving of a second contact (Or even the third time) Sandra B. Bring it to the limit by using words and songwriting that are well known in this piece. (Hank Williams's version is 'I So Lonesome I Can Cry', which will make you tears easily. Maybe someday the audience will be ready to show the movie a little more seriously. (But not without anyone laughing as well) The movie moved quickly (Thanks to good editing) so that some viewers don't find it boring and boring. Perhaps revival is just a pipe.
