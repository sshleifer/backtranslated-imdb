Now I'm in front of the TV. See Casomai. It's changing. It's developing or better ... is changing. It started with the wedding of two lovers who reported their love story. After that, everything changed. Children are born and all the rest often occur in pairs. It is not a special movie because it talks about the normal couple and the normalness is the center of this movie. It doesn't want to show us anything special, nothing new, it's just a normal love story, a couple's story, and being normal is different from the rest. It's a blinking movie. Everything is short. Every scene takes only a few seconds. It is a story that reports things that are well known because friends and parents talk about it and their opinions are centered on opinions, creating stories and destroying them. It's a simple story of a couple I say. But it is not boring, it just shows that it is worthy of everything known But I'm sure you all want to know what happened, so don't Don't forget to watch the ending!
