Often tagged as a comedian, a man in a white suit is resting rather than laughing here and there. <br /> <br /> Sidney Stratton is a strange inventor who doesn't get the chance to show off. His invention The world because no one paid him to notice him, just a strange person about the place like it used to be. After proclaiming in Birnley's textile mill, he used their labs to achieve the goal of fabricating not only But not deteriorating But still do not have to clean as well! At first he was declared a genius and who didn't care about him at first, wanted a large piece of him. But then the punishment of an industry that is staring at the head turns into a very scary sound. <br /> <br> This movie is very funny. In fact, some scenes are hilarious dams. But it was a satirical edge with a film that raised it above ordinary for me Conflicts about the advent of technology are important issues.

You watched this movie and watched the fast-paced events for Stanley's main sponsor from the hero to the enemy, hovering once, the victim of hunting himself for better humanity! It's very dark that this movie should be called a black suit. <br /> <br /> I can't find anything wrong in this movie. The script from Roger MacDougall, John Dighton and director Alex Mackendrick can be filmed. Today and it will not be out of place like that Is the clarity and thought in the heart that has The sound and settings are very smooth. By changing the volume level by Mackendrick, some scenes are excellent, especially the tug of war and the scene of one of David Lynch's elephants. 29 years later and after the event. The movie's downfall continues. Winking as a genius at Alec Guinness has closed the film for the audience not only to reflect But Stanley's future only But still the rest of us in the coming world. <br /> <br /> The timeless masterpiece Heart and art pieces 10/10
