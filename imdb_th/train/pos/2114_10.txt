Two war shop workers in a leather shop became sweet lovers when they contacted each other under the box number alias. Within this simple mindset and everyday settings, Lubitsch produces a variety of carpets of wisdom, drama, pain and friction that never give up. Stewart and Sullavan are perfect as general lovers with emotions and feelings. The true tension and the remaining characters are well developed, have their own subplots and jokes. Although being overshadowed by Stuart's big movie, 39/40 (Destry, Philadelphia Story, Mr Smith), this story is easy and we enjoy sub-performances that have never been seen in other films.
