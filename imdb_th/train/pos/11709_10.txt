Now for movies about all movies, this movie may not be ranked high in the list of things you have to watch. But if you know anything about plot development, the profound truth and intentions of this movie (series) exist, you will understand my POV. <br /> <br /> Who has been Can not expect what will happen in the end But this movie is correct according to bibliography and the audience "scared" reasonably in thinking about what might be I am a Christian, not because of this movie. But because of my personal decision to accept Jesus as my Savior Movies and potentials that have something similar to that situation can create fear for someone to think of their actions and decisions. It is not a cheap attempt to scare people into believing in God. But it's a way to get your attention. <br /> <br /> As a Christian, I know I won't be left behind. This thing, I can overlook the superficial entertainment, acting and budgeting of movies to appreciate the depth that this film has to offer. This is a movie that you shouldn't look at. But feel with your heart and soul
