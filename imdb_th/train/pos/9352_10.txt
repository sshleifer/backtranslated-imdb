Most people, especially young people, may not understand this movie. It seems like the story of a loss when actually it's a story about being alone. Some people may never feel lonely at this level. <br /> <br /> The characters of Cheadle Johnson reflect the totally different character of Sander. That Johnson felt attached to his blessing. Fineman tried to forget his life in the same view. Chada is a great additive for actors and Sandler pulls tears. Cheadle plays a role in the cartoon and is a good supporter of Sandler. <br /> <br /> I saw Oscar Somewhere here Very good movie If you get lost and feel alone, this film will make you confident that you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Jerry
