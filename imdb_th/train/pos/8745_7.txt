After high school graduation, Alice and Darlene's best friends decided to travel to Thailand. While they were there, they met a charming Australian man named Nick. After spending time with Nick, he asked them if they wanted to go to Hong Kong with him on weekends or not. They agree At the airport, although they were arrested for drug trafficking and were convicted of 33 years in a Thai prison for what they said they had not done, they did not really know they had to contact Yankee Hank An American lawyer who lives in Thailand with his wife. Word says that if you have money, he can help you. Everything starts well. But they still can't go out. <br /> <br /> This movie is great because it doesn't let things happen and it's interesting all the time. I can't believe the ending. It's one of the endings that you don't know 100% true, but you still know what happened to Nick and drug trafficking because <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale both give good performances here. Beckinsales' performance is slightly weak. The friendship of the characters in both Danes and Beckinsales is good, but looks stronger. Paul Walker also has a slightly unreliable role here;) <br /> <br /> Next, I think Brokedown Palace is a good movie and I give 7/10.
