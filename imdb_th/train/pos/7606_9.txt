The first series of Lost begins with an explosion ... literally and slowly decreases. This may cause some viewers to go out and people who start to see halfway through it may be bored or confused. <br /> <br /> I will introduce new people to the world of wandering, just watching. From the beginning and did not receive a slow response, the general performance was excellent. But why is there a series of 5 series ... why? All of this means that there will be no answer for at least 4 years. Okay. I'll keep looking. It will cause tensions and smooth conversations.
