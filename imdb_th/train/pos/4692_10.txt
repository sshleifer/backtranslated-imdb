Although there is a lot of malice, Johnny is dangerous, one of the most fun movies I've ever seen. It is a movie that should be closely watched. Some funny bits have passed and don't receive the usual attention. For example, watch the use of guns, the price of Michael Keaton at the pet shop ... and in the documentary style that appears at the beginning of the scene. It's one of those rare movies that humor comes to unexpectedly hit you, even if you know it's a funny movie. The director Amy Heckerling is really sharp here - if you enjoy her well-known movie ( Fast Times, Ridgemont High, Clueless, European Vacation, etc.) You should look at <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton is a huge favorite in the roles of actors and actors (Griffin Dunne, Maureen Stapleton, Joe Piscopo , Peter Boyle) is excellent. Highly recommended.
