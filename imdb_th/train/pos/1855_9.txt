When not watching all the movies released in 2002, I can't say that this is the best movie of the year. I can say that it is the best movie I've seen all year. <br /> <br /> Most American movies with blacks are obsessed with America's obsession. "Race relations" or fall into the idea of ​​congestion in the slums of the city along with strange slang. Antwone Fisher stands alone proudly about this: the competition is irrelevant, records for fighting that may or may <br /> <br /> The story of Antwone Fisher is something that should reflect any person who cares. He is narrow-minded and prudent by Derek Luke. As the image of Denzel Washington, while apparently using his star power to create a movie, cling to the background as much as possible and make this film the story of Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> During When betting and popular culture generally want to maintain the ghetoization of many Americans (And Canada too, you know) This is a movie that talks about humanity in all of our stories. I just hope that non-black audiences will go to watch this movie for humanity instead of avoiding because they feel that they don't have a body. Drama or actor in a movie that they can identify That will be a sad explanation about racial relations in North America and on its own. <br /> <br />
