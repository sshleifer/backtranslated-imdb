Look, if I'm interested in the book of Nancy Drew, what I'm going to do is pick up the book and read it. I'm not. Ever since I remembered that I read people who destroyed the movie because it wasn't the same as the book I'm sorry - Can watch movies in the book, flip it anymore But I'm sure you can still find a short, silent movie in the form of books. When Lord of the Rings came out, people complained. When the third person won the Oscar - "The book is better" when I watched To Kill a Mockingbird "Better book" Now many people are upset. But again because Nancy Drew is not like a book I'm not saying that Nancy Drew will win any Academy Award - if anything, it will be one of the Nickelodeon Blimps or Kids Choice Awards. It's a film, not a paper. As a movie, I found Nancy Drew very fun - with a cameo from Bruce Willis and Adam Goldberg and the supporting role of Tate Donovan. This is the first time I saw Emma Roberts in the movie and I enjoyed her work more than Julia and Eric. Her character remains consistent throughout the film and responds well to conflict. A lighthearted movie in the spirit of Harriet the Spy is good now and again. <br /> <br /> I give ten stars because I enjoy the movie thoroughly. I like to see it again.
