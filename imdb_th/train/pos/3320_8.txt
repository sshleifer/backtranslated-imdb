I like this cute and funny movie. I found this movie to be a good family movie. The dirtiest part of this movie is a reference to the New York Yankees. You must be in the Red Sox country to understand that NY Yankees are dirty words. We must speak to Yankee fans. I recommend this picture to everyone in the family. Of course, with love / general comedy. Moments in the movie with me in love and what I do But the movie was made in order to have all the hurtful moments. The movie was a time of the Red Sox national approach (in Fenway Park). Sox and love for another man holding hands
