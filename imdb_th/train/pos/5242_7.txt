I like this movie a lot for two reasons. First, it provides insights about the world of loyalty in Northern Ireland, which has not been treated much in movies, most of which tells us about the Republican struggle. The second reason is the actors' performances. I think they give honest and trustworthy images about a lot of uninhabited mafia, not heard off the coast of my hometown. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a funny movie that is entertaining. In the Northern Ireland actor, casting the actor It will not move the world, although it may open the eyes for some groups to look at the dark world of loyal soldiers.
