For fans of the 1970 Hammer horror movie, this movie should be treated. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the fact that Peter Cushing lost the worst episode. In general, this is a small, scary and scary movie. If this isn't the best movie of Amicus, it's one of them. The best episode that has been recorded correctly in the final episode is the scene that Jon Pertwee plays as a horror movie actor - it's really great, as good as Pertwee. More of this type of movie All of this is an entertaining movie that scares me from my childhood and still gives me creeps to this day.
