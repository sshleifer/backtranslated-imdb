This is not a bad movie. Some critics and a summary of the IMDB page for this film say it's why? The first is the fact that in 1984, movie makers were brave enough to confront as one of the plot elements of domestic violence - so the investigators who complained about this plot disappeared. Sadly Secondly, if there is no element of the film's relationship with the Prince and Father who insults his music, it does not work as it did. Only why is it so good ... because all the songs in this movie have a backdrop that is a plot that makes the song more effective. Third, give this movie a break! For producers and film directors for the first time, this is not bad! There are worse movies from those who have succeeded in the movie !! And finally, the critic who said that the music "D" is also missing the issue In the 1980s and with the style seen in the work of other artists (clothing and movement: elements of thinking that came before Michael Jackson or the Prince? Let's see if you can The In front of the eyes that Prince did in this movie long before the movie "Pulp Fiction" of Quentin Tarentino) as a result of the parts, not a bad movie at all.
