What other investigators call a lack of character development, I call it exaggeration. This film does not hit strongly over the head by giving too much light or unnecessary background. Yes, there are many stories that we have seen only a short time. But this is a one-day snapshot of an event that provokes changes in the character's life. Henry Thomas's performance is a truly lovely study in the power of acting that focuses on reactions rather than actions.
