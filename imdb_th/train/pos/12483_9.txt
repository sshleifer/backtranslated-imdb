Although I was in this movie, which is part of Sheriff Hodges, but still makes me jump many places and believe me that I'm not easy. You might say that I have a bias about the movie and I agree. But I do not see the finished product until 12/27/2006 and very pleased I'm not a horror movie fan. But loved the old movie "B" and the Sci Fi movie in black and white. It will make you completely unbalanced. I recommend watching the movie first, then the director's notes and special features. It's well written, directed and filmed, and I can tell you personally that it's a real pleasure to work with actors and teams. I look forward to being part of Brian and Laurence's future projects.
