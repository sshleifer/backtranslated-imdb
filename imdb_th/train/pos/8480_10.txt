Thanks to the permanent Warner Arc, I can see all the mammoth shows except the kitchen sink. (There is a bathtub) This movie gave the show time to everyone who was under contract with Warners at that time. If some artists seem to be unfamiliar to some people, that is because they are great in a quiet moment There are truly outstanding artists from the music age as well. You will be most impressed with Winnie Lightner, which shows two numbers. In addition, there is also a French actor named Irene Bordeaux who makes love songs in a sexy way. Perhaps one of the biggest highlights is Technicolor, the two "Chinese Fantasy" strips which have been restored for this model. It is truly beautiful and is the star of Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas. Finally there is the last "Lady Luck" final scene which lasted almost a quarter of an hour. This is the epic of the early radio walkers. The old buff movies will love this thing.
