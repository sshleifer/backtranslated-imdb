Marvelous movies from 1979, in which high school students, Vince Lombardi, were confronted by the authoritative new headmaster, Miss Togar (Mary Woronov). Togar is a musician hating and blaming students' musical tastes for their abuse. The leader of the prosecution is Riff Randell (PJ Soles) who loves fun. The # 1 Ramones fans want a rock band to record her songs. <br /> <br /> Now * This is a movie. Impossible to resist The soundtrack is first and foremost with the songs of artists such as Alice Cooper and Velvet Underground, in addition to non-stop Ramones songs "Teenob Lobotomy", "Sheena is a Punk Rocker" and "Blitzkrieg Bop" is just one part their Then the actors will give everything to them. Soles is an ideal choice for Riff's role; She is a real pleasure. Vincent Van Patten and Dey Young are Tom and Kate. Woronov has been carefully selected as a disgusting Togar and insulting Clint Howard as one of his best interests as a business owner. Eaglebauer in the bathroom, Paul Bartel (especially fun as a music teacher Mr. McGree) and The Real Don Steele always have fun and of course it's a treat to see Ramones playing themselves. <br /> <br /> This is the true spirit. The level of energy is high, with co-authors and director Allan Arcush bringing flair to litigation. There is also great humor. Paper airplane trusses are excellent examples of this. This extends to the "oblivious" style of changing scenes. There is a giant clown that is created by a striking future makeup effect, Rob Bottin, one of his oldest gigs. <br /> <br /> About the characters that challenge power. Protecting the rights of the right people, receiving "Rock 'n' Roll High School" is a great cult movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
