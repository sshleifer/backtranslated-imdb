Sanuk, and it breathes fresh air for the Mormons because this is the first movie that tries to show confidence on the screen. Together with James D'Arc, the administrator of the great film tower from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, brought this movie to the most advanced DVD format, Mr. D'Arc, which a few years ago Have made The doctoral thesis of his film was prepared in-depth reviews, as has been done for the DVD. He separated the truth from the novel and let the audience understand why this film was greatly appreciated by Church leaders, although truthful manipulation would continue throughout the story. One of the fun of information related to Dean Jagger, an actor whose role is the title. Many years after this film, he married a young woman in the last days and eventually changed to the faith of the LDS. There's a lot to learn from D'Arc's knowledge and it's great to be a part of DVD!

Thank you FOX for another great DVD and thank James D'Arc. For your wonderful comments!
