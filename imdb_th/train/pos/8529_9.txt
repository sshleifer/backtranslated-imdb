I ran across this film on TV and could not close. Peter Sellers played a friend like no other who fell in love with Goldie Hawn, a warm and cute. The way in which Goldie's character holds himself from the beginning of the movie until the end is not distorted, even today. This movie gives a different perspective on human relations and I find it very funny. Peter Sellers role is difficult. But I think he pulled it out well
