I like Twisted Desire movies. Jeremy Jordan, one of my favorite actors and one of the cute actors, Melissa Joan Hart is a good actor. I've watched almost all of your movies. But all of Jeremy Jordan, the thing I don't like about Twisted Desire is when "Nick" is caught and "Jennifer" bites him. Twisted Desire is my second favorite movie. My first time was The Goonies, but I still love Jeremy Jordan.
