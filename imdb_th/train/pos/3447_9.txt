There was no director I liked more than Mamoru Oshii, but sadly, even though he directed a lot of movies that received a lot of international attention. But there are still movies that are projected through the cracks. Tachiguishi is one of them and although I like it a lot But it is not difficult to see why the Western distributors are reluctant to leave. <br /> <br /> During his big and serious movie, Oshii is known for making small and strange projects. While Tachiguishi falls into this category, of course, Oshii conquered himself by creating things that are difficult to classify, even when Japanese people flick over. <br /> <br /> The main place of it is Non-documentary Yoshio Nomura eyes US But instead of making a fool of subcultures that exist, Oshii invented his own and delve deeper into the lives of culinary heroes, fighting food for free and supporting the level of Japanese cooking. Oshii's approach to that kind of character is The close relationship with Dai Nippon Jin because the model is handled with a sense of gravitational force, while the screen image looks ridiculous as it should be. <br /> <br /> But that's not all. It's not just the filming of his deadly drama. Oshii decides to make it use the new baptismal technique. superlivemation Combining live performances, photography, digital animation and puppets Proceed and proceed (Or posed if you want) by the great Japanese animation industry, not least as the project should be as low as possible. <br /> <br /> And if you think Just covering it, knowing that this movie is a very heavy conversation, making it a good companion for innocence. The influence of grifters is analyzed from all cultural, political and philosophical perspectives that are shot at the audience through the stream. Continuous accumulation and dialogue And to make it worse, the film is based on the history and traditions of Japan, making it more difficult for foreigners to capture the content Needless to say, many views suggest the best of all the details hidden in the movie. <br /> <br /> That said, at the concept level, this film is easy to follow and pretty hilarious. Various, because it is Japan's most powerful historical figure after the war This movie plays like you expect to have a documentary about other important people that will unfold in any way. The limbs are shot with large and lively cuts that the numbers that do not make everything. serious The range of characters that have been introduced is noble. Shinji Hikuchi receives a cake as an animal, a cow wearing a nose ring while wearing a fast food chain with a cow / person. <br /> <br /> Oshii is usually Kenji. Kawai gave in addition to comedy, then the score from the atmosphere and dark to strange, strange and funny A lot of fun comes from the sound and the exaggerated effects that complement the animation and conflict with the tone of the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The film's eyes are very atmospheric. Although it must be said The animation is quite rare and while still effective, there is still time to explode in the oddities that do more than cover occasionally. Which is certainly not a bad thing when seeing that Tachiguishi is a heavy conversation This movie is still a virtual masterpiece because each frame looks lush and is tailored to match and improve the general atmosphere of the movie. <br /> <br /> Be careful because Tachiguishi needs a large audience. You do not speak Japanese. There is a lot of reading and there are many cultural references that need attention. Moreover, the monologue in the movie area is quite protracted and difficult to follow. This film still lacks English subtitles and although my French is enough to get what it is about, I'm sure I missed the best spot of many movies. <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi is not. Easy matter Movies to enter But about half way up to full steam and it doesn't let out there I still hope to see this again in English or Dutch. Actually, the best dub for the movie like this (similar to Container), but I guess the quality anime is quite pleasing. > <br /> From all of the above, I can only do Congratulate Oshii in another amazing movie It's hard to find a movie that combines and combines style and influence to create something unique and still usable. This film is smart, looks good and sounds great and is full of creativity. It's very funny even if you can't catch all the details in the first viewing. But be sure to get this with the appropriate subcategory because the automatic English translation floating in there is not completely valued and the movie is not fair. <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi is suitable for specific audiences and I am not surprised that the French people will be released while others in Europe (and others in the Western world) are still waiting for the signal of this movie. But for those who like Oshii, you must love the arid and spiritless humor and creativity. It is a movie that should not be missed even if it is misused. 4.5 * / 5.0 *
