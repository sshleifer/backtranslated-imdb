The actors are different and now they use different methods. We have a smart street team "Networth" vs a professional team that should be "Magna" but kids. If you think the Smart Street team will There is a problem. You have to be right. As the Magna team struggles many times, the street team collapses a week and a week. <br /> <br /> The first thing to repeat is "Apprentice 3". Nonsense as before (from Trump) and games in this series: If you are Good project management But you lose, the team will open you and you will be fired, even if your teammates stabbed in your back are usually half-ass workers. The only ridiculous is that the game show that claims to hire the best "weed" candidate is the best, while the unusual candidate is stabbed together until someone is left and that person is the best person. Lol <br / > <br /> Everybody in this season, we saw the curse, back stabbing, and even the nasty map of gay men who performed as the team tried to campaign. <br /> <br /> List Victims Tara Dowdell, Audrey Evans, Dan All three of them are the only people I feel that Trump has been unfairly fired. The rest will come true because they incited conflict, anger and suffering. It's amazing that one of the candidates, Audrey Evans, said she worked well, was fired and her worthless teammates were still in the game. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a game. It is "The Apprentice" where management, back stabbing and always popular "The rules of thought" Everyone depends on the project manager. "<br /> <br /> It's fun to drive, even if the candidate is assigned a lot of photography to Creating a small golf course to build a new apartment. <br /> <br /> Although it is still "Apprentice", but what you can do is basically laughing all the time because of madness and chaos. Until the lucky person wins
