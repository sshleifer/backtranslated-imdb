I may have seen one episode or 2 when the original program aired But when I watched 1 episode on netflix, I was attracted to me watching the whole set for 2 days :) I really liked Gary Cole's characters. ("These things have thousands of uses")! Andy Griffith meets with Charles Manson to meet with Satan very much. Charming, charming, charming, charming, charming, charming, charming, charming, charming, charming, charming, charming, charming, charming and charming. I want to be like him when I grow up. Lucas Black is also great. The accent is excellent as well. However, I think this is one of the best TV shows ever, and you owe it to yourself to watch.
