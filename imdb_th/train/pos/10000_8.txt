Homelessness (or homelessness, as George Carl stated) is a problem for many years. But never planned to help people on the street who were once human beings who thought that doing everything from going to school, working or voting Most people think that homeless people are just the cause that is missing while worrying about things such as racism, war in Iraq, pressure on children to succeed in election technology, inflation or worry that they are on the road. < br /> <br /> But if you have been betting on the street for a month without the luxury products that you have received from home entertainment packages, bathrooms, pictures on the computer wall Torre And everything that you used to be to see if it is homeless? That is the lesson of Goddard Bolt. <br /> <br /> Mel Brooks (director) who is the star as Bolt plays the rich with everything in the world until he decides to bet on his sister (Jeffery Tambor) to see. If he can live on the road for thirty days without luxury, if Bolt succeeds, he can do what he wants with the future project of building more buildings. Betting at Bolt was thrown on the road with a bracelet on his leg to check his movements every time he couldn't step out of the sidewalk. He was given the nickname Pepto by a stranger after writing on his forehead that Bolt met with other characters, including a woman named Molly (Lesley Ann Warren), a former divorced dancer before losing his home and a friend. Howard) Morris) and Smoke (Teddy Wilson) familiar with the road They are survivors. The verse is not. He is not familiar with making a common agreement, as he had done when the rich that fought or fled, killed or killed. <br /> <br /> While connecting love between Molly And Bolt does not need to plan "Life Stinks" as one of the movies that Mel Brooks observers, who before being a comedian, showed the tenderness compared to Slapstick's work such as Blazing Saddles, Young Fr ankenstein or spaceballs for this to show how it is Valuable things before losing the next day or vice versa make stupid bets like all rich people do when they don't know what to do with their money. Maybe they should give it to the homeless person instead of using it like a monopoly. <br /> <br /> Or this movie might inspire you to help others.
