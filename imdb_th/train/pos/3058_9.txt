I bought this thing a year ago or more for $ 2 (yes, $ 2) left on the shelf for a long time now. Watching the DVD while watching movies with coldness <br /> <br / > This is the movie that follows Great performances by everyone involved, especially the 6yo boys (about the only smile you received in this movie) <br /> <br /> The plot reminds me of my favorite movie. I am Grosse Pointe Blank, a heartless person. <br /> <br /> As a psychologist, clinical psychologist and forensic scientist, shakes up my spine when revealing the identity of a new contract. The scary thing! Excellent work all around. <br /> <br /> Pete
