The adaptation of MR James's short story, 'A View From A Hill', was first screened on British television in 2005 on a small digital channel that watched BBC 4. I saw it being repeated again in BBC 4 and Decided to give To remember the successful adaptation of the BBC in the 1970s of the MR MR. Others include 'Whistle and I will come to you Lad' and 'The Signalman', even if not in the same class as the work. These masterpieces 'A View From A Hill' are still some fun and suspicious plays. <br /> <br /> Historians have arrived in a small village in the countryside to see a collection of recent ones. Collect ancient objects While in the countryside, he saw hundreds of years of temple ruins. But this involves a pair of old binoculars and a horrible legend about Gallows Hill, whose name is ominous. And what brutal countries and his servants know about this situation? While not scary In any way, I enjoy the work of creating small pieces and spending more than 40 minutes working. It should be a truly wonderful adaptation. It was a slightly hasty feeling and a slightly increased expression to be greeted. <br /> <br /> I gave 7 out of 10.
