I can say that I never expected that this movie would be good. I don't like family movies I am far from the fan of Shahid Kapoor. The latest film director (MPKDH is very stupid and the song is boring and boring but Amrita Rao has become my favorite after Main Hoon Na. There are also Seema Biswas, Alok. Nath and Anupam Kher are able to add a couple of points. <br /> <br /> Finally, I saw the movie and I was very impressed. He took MPK's young couple to attend HAHK wedding and we had a winner. The storyline is similar to HAHK. In the beginning to the serious mode at the end, the director also created a character that you can relate to. What I don't like about HAHK is that the characters look too strange. The perfection of it, Shahid Kapoor surprised me with good work. This is a big improvement and most importantly, he is best suited to the best role of Amrita Rao. In fact, this is the best performance. yours Must love her performance. Sameer Soni, Amrutha Prakash, An upam Kher, Alok Nath and Seema Biswas are great. No actor who feels guilty at <br /> <br /> The song is quite disappointing. But they sound better after watching them. Mujhe Haq Hai and Do Anjaane Ajnabi are good ballads. Milan Abhi Aada Adhura Hai looks good too. The music is not colorful and lively, and they are like ballads. The exception is Hamari Shaadi Mein, which is bound to remind you of HSSH and HAHK. So what are the shortcomings in the movie? This film is quite slow and the ending is quite stretched. But this film continues to move fast, making it a perfect family movie
