Okay, this movie represents many things. For beginners, this movie is about the students who are not satisfied with bringing guns to school and shooting about 9 students. One student survived and was in the hospital with extensive head injuries. The lead character is something that many people think of 'unorthodox / German', even if the movie isn't like that. She looks very mysterious. But is the only student who is not dangerous in the victim's classroom She was questioned because of the history of the athlete and had a phone call with him the night before. However, she is a short and distant person who seems to insult the society. But due to some events that could not be explained at first, she spent about a year studying, causing the score to fail She had a desire to graduate and her practice in the only possible way was to spend time with the survivors in the hospital. <br /> <br /> Almost these leaders contrast And they are quite at the social level, while Alisha is a anti-social German girl who spent time alone (Although she seems to read books quite often But a bookcase / bookcase) 'bubbly' popular girl who seems incredibly optimistic and stuck in the world of her own imagination without ignoring the outside world and realism to survive I feel that both of these roles are a great job to represent the most 'cliques' in modern high school. But more importantly, it shows that the two girls are opposite, who do not know anything at all. While the wounded young woman learns the profound and meaningful truth about her once sheltered life and the outside world, Alisha learns that complete social abandonment and locking everything within is not the best thing. Always <br /> <br /> to connect between these two women and see one of two things Whether it is a high-end girl, a hatred that wants him to rest in this world while she is picking it out with an innocent girl or the story of a cute girl who has been trapped. Then she may be one of the smartest people she knows People may see that this movie is the focus of Alisha that teaches other girls to learn about life. But it's not about that. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a lot of things, while it's about everything I've said. But it also represents the way people manage from large-scale disasters that change lives Of course, this movie is not very symbolic. But instead of forwarding unbelievably straightforward messages as long as you are not afraid to open your heart and heart to certain emotions, you may not be familiar with miraculous performances. Br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is one of the best things I've ever seen. The performance is excellent, the story and the performance are profound and meaningful, and the emotions that flow through this film will make everyone not only But only relevant But may cry too This movie is a terrifying story that has a lot of impact and if I believe that any movie can change a person's life ... This will be the first movie to change my life. <br /> < br /> I like this Movies If you want movies that are animated and have an impact while entertaining and incredibly REAL, see this.
