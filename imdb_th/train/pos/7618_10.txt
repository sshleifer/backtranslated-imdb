Hello: <br /> <br /> I heard about the loss from colleagues who had a different opinion about entertainment. He liked it. I watched episodes one or 2 at the beginning of the season and bored me so I adjusted it out. After a few years I stumbled upon getting bored with the sci-fi values. Can you talk about gravity? Damn, I was sucked in. The rhythm and scripting was very good. Forward / back. Some flashes are like that with Larry's character. But above all My favorite characters are Ben, Locke, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Sayid Jarrah, Sawyer, Hurley, Daniel Faraday, Jin & Wife, Walt, Charlie, Desmond and Jack's father. Jack and Michael are underage. Kate 1 steps above them. Juliet is a person who is more than Kate. Mr. Eko was ranked lower and Charlie's level, if not too much, they both died. Men dressed in black, talking to Jacob (way back) are genuine curiosity. Is a series that has a great layer: looking for more. <br /> <br /> Sincerely
