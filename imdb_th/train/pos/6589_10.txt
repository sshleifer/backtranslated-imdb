I like this show from the first broadcast and I look forward to watching each episode every week. Story, character, writing, special effects are great! Then the sci-fi channel was stunned again and canceled the entertainment program that was written very well. I said that bringing it back, I know that every actor will come back. I recommend buying a DVD. I am I hope the sci-fi channel executives will receive these comments and realize that they need to be more involved with their audience. I watched one program on that channel now (Ghost Hunters) but I'm pretty sure that they will soon cancel that program as well
