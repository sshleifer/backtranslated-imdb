EDMUND LOWE (which reminds me of Warren Williams) who is an interesting actor, an interesting little puzzle that moves fast and runs for a few hours. <br /> <br /> Douglas Wo Luton plays unfortunate jockeys That seems to have intention in his own death (Hypnotize anyone?) And the cast include a number of cast-all people from Virginia, Bruce Kent, Smith Frieda Inescourt, Gene Lockhart, Jesse Ralph, Benita Hume, Rosalind Ivan and HB As an added bonus, Nat Pendleton is a raging detective - and there is also an art deco decoration set for the luxurious interior of a wealthy home. Must be the scene that was used in many movies later. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the mystery is not complicated until anyone can follow the storyline confidently that it is not too confusing. Everything was clear. Detective Philo Vance - and then he had the final confrontation with the murderer who made this movie without a good five-minute suspicion. <br /> <br /> Well done and through a fun time.
