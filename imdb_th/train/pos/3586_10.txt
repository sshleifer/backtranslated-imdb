I saw this for the first time when it premiered over ten years ago. I saw it again today and it still has a big impact on me. She fought alone, a story about a woman, Caitlin (played by Tiffani Thiessen), who was raped by Jace (played by David Lipper). A classmate who likes to attack women Caitlin is in a popular high school group But when she revealed that she had been raped by an anti-her group led by Ethan (played by Brian Austin Green), <br /> <br /> The film recorded the story of Caitlin's struggles with the entire city, including high schools that allow athletes. Define the social environment, allowing them to go with what they want. <br /> <br /> Thiessen and Green are top performers and have real chemistry between the two. They throughout the movie All actors in this film, inspired by actual events, have done a great job. She fought alone, really caught the essence of what it was in high school. (At least in 1995) and have self-esteem and reputation for betting. Recommend 10/10
