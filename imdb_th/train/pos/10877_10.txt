I saw this movie with a lot of friends and even though the two of us walked out of the theater thinking how cool it was, others laughed and commented how stupid it was. That is because it should not be seriously serious. In general, it is a movie that mocks horror, flicks and works well. .. It seems that there will be another movie like that. Well ... Scary Movie ?? This is the Aussie and the original !!! Jessica Napier is a great performer and Sarah Kants has a bright future in the show! I hope to see them more. Molly Ringwald is a good posture and Kylie is a better posture. The impossible princess is the queen of the screen !! I suggest watching this flick as you would guess until the end of the connection with Raffy, Hilary and the movie that never finished 20 years ago.
