I used to like watching "Sabrina the Teenage Witch" on Friday night on ABC's TGIF program. I think this is one of the best shows of TGIF. My friends and I used to gather every Friday to see this program And we never miss any episode. <br /> <br /> My favorite character is Salem. He is cute and very funny. I like Harvey, Sabrina's girlfriend as well. He's hot. I think Melissa Joan Hart is a good teenage witch as well. My favorite episode is "Sabrina Through the Looking Glass" and "Hilda and Zelda: the Teenage Years". Those episodes are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Overall, I miss this performance a lot. I hope one day ABC will bring it back with a new episode. I gave this performance to the stars 10/10
