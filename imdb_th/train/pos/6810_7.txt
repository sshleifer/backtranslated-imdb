After reading the book, I happened on this DVD at Wal-Mart for 3 dollars and thought that for sure ... I got a DVD and watched it last night. When I started watching, I checked the time of use and spent about 90 minutes. I think it's cool ... It seems like running slowly, knowing the story and how much it is. When I arrived at the actual killing, I was like "How much time has it been left?" Was checked "One minute! I felt unbelievably cheated by thinking that this movie only progressed to one third of the story overall. <br /> <br /> But then I noticed happily that the scene selection menu of The DVD includes part 1 and part 2, then there is another one and a half hours! Then I sat happily and enjoyed the movie in the second half more than at first. <br /> <br /> I admit that I didn't see the original movie in 1967 (despite the desire However, read the novel and feel that this is a fairly desirable movie for the two TV series, namely I think the selection of Perry's chapter is totally wrong and a little bit of conflict comes out to me. But still doing very well The first half dragged a little while the second half was more attractive. I think they should have more movie proportions, as Capote made his book: 1/3 before the murder, 1/3 after, and 1/3 after the murderer was arrested. On the other hand, this film made it more than 1/2 before the murder of 1/4 after and 1/4 after the killer was arrested. Again, this makes the second half more exciting. But at the same time, there is less interest while dragging the first half ... <br /> <br /> Now I look back and realize that I just do the same. Mistakes about doing things, dragging back and forth, so I will turn off hell. Go to see the movie and make your own crazy! <br /> <br /> Nick Houston
