It's another movie that plays with your feelings and you will come out as soft as a rocky movie. But I am a sucker for those I give good points ... The performance is very good and has a lot of feelings. Violence is only a little preserved, which causes change. I will give 9 if not to congratulate at the end! Overall, it's a good movie that has very good actors. <br /> <br />
