This movie is one of my favorites all the time. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr ... are actors. Not to mention Sam Jaffe as Gunga Din. The drama, action, adventure and comedy shows come together as one. The final battle scene that continues to this day makes me feel shivering and the ending makes me tears. If you don't see it, I highly recommend it.
