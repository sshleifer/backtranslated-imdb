Despite what others say (* i *), this is the movie that I like forever. I don't know how long I waited. But in the end I fell in love immediately Of course it's strange. But it gives a more exciting taste For those who do not know, Moonchild is one of Gackt's and Hyde's first films. They don't do a lot, maybe 3 or 4 per person. We all know that Adam Sandler did the best at first as well. I believe they will throw some strange situations in it. But I look at finding the best point of this movie. So I've given and will always give this film 10 out of 10
