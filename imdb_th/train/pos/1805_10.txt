I just saw this movie. I first saw when I was 7 years old and could remember the end. So I looked like 10 minutes ago and (I might look like a kid when I was 12 years old. Haha) I started crying at the end. I forgot how sad it was. I think I am primarily sorry for Anne Marie because she says: 'I love you Charlie' and as well: 'I will miss Charlie.' Just make me cry really. It must be one of my favorite movies of all time. It's just a movie to watch. Haha. That's all I can say. XD <br /> <br /> But I love this movie. It's a movie. True Classic <br /> <br /> xx Maverick xx 10/10
