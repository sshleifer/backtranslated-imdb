The Three Stooges are many actors I love. I love all the shorts that they make. I love all six Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All shorts are hilarious and many other great actors and actors, most of which are in a lot of shorts! In my opinion, The Three Stooges is the best actor and the funniest funny team ever! <br /> <br /> One of my favorite Stooges shorts and Shemp, none other than my husband. Be careful! This brief appearance is Christine McIntyre, Dee Green, Beautiful Houck Doris, Alyn Lockwood, Johnny Kascier, Nancy Saunders, Lu Leonard, Maxine Gates and Emil Sitka. this! There are many funny parts here. This is very short, hilarious. There is another similar Three Stooges that is similar to this one called Brideless Groom and I recommend both of them!
