I read the previous comment stating that the film was exhausted at the end of the movie and it had a similar ending to Cape Fear. I will give you simple reviews for the general audience there. I think the selection is perfect. I think this is one of Ed Harris's best performances. It's an evil psychopath !!! I respect his performance very much after watching his performance in this movie. I felt stressed throughout this film. If you like mysterious excitement, this is the movie you want to watch. I also noticed young Scarlett Johannson in this movie. This movie is full of top stars and I recommend!
