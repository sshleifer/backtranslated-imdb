My grandmother bought me this movie when I was 5 years old (I always like scary movies) and I like it. The atmosphere is fantastic and the story is original and fun. I like the scene where the RV is particularly attacked in the desert. Stone is really reliable for a low budget flick. The performance is higher than the average for this type of film and the music is creepy. This is a gem that has definitely been rated. I advise everyone who likes these strange movies from the late seventies to the early eighties, such as "Alice, Sweet Alice", "Poor Pretty Eddie", "Nightmare", "Nightmare", "Hospital Massacre" and "Return of the Aliens, The Deadly Spawn. "Absolutely Classic !!
