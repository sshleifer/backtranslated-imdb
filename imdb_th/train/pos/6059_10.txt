This is a wonderful documentary full of beautiful racing images and great stories. The IMAX camera gives a very wide view because it is the perfect DVD movie. You hear all the speakers running most of the time. This movie doesn't accelerate and give a natural feeling at a speed of 230 miles per hour. Of course, there are additional sound effects. But I think it's good. They give depth to the driving scene ...
