Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor McLaglen are three soldiers in the 19th century in India, with the help of the water boy Sam Sam. One of the most entertaining movies of all time, Sam Jaffe is a great person because the evicted boy who was attacked by others and still wants to be accepted. G as a soldier in the company based on a poem by Rudyard Kipling must see by anyone who enjoys this type of film.
