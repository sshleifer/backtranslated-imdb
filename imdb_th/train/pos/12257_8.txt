This is a book that can be adapted better than a book with Paltrow (although I like that book too). It's not that Beckinsale is better - they are both very good - but the screenplay is better Davies is an expert in adjusting Austen for filming and the production value here is very good. It's not quite as shiny as Hollywood treatment. But close to each other and I think the place and the clothes work well.
