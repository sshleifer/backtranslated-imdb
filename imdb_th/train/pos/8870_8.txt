When John Singleton, he is * on * !! And this is one of his better films, not as tight as Boyz-n-the-Hood But close to it (And has a very similar protagonist) This film is very well written, put together and shot very well There is very little to criticize and most of my complaints are superficial (eg: Fudge receives money for 6 years from college and many expensive items? There is no mention of various backgrounds ... and why Professor Phibbs has an office? Professor of his height * Should have one ... and while we are here for engineering students or not, Ray is Cute character - I think he will have A little more in the way of basic intelligence - he speaks and behaves like all the clowns) <br /> <br /> But that, other than that, the movie is very sharp. There are many good characters and perspectives, and Singleton doesn't get in the story - many characters are not sympathetic, and he works well to separate the Panthers and Supremacist scenes to show both folly. <br /> <br /> Most of the great movies. I like the scenes where Kirsty Swanson is closer to Taryn and Wayne. Every scene is very well connected. In addition, the Malik / Deja scene is also well taken. That is quite often This movie tends to really get * to preach at times, and it tends to reinforce the point that it makes over your head when the point is clear, without bluntness. (We don't want the US flag by typing 'don't understand' onto it. Give some credit. We're not mentally retarded ...) and, above all, even though most of Singleton's time uses quite a good melodrama. It is possible * too * cheezy (such as Deja's death, which is normal until she sings 'WHY !!!' which totally destroys Effects and scenes) <br /> <br /> But in general, the performance is the best. Great performance by Omar Epps (probably the best thing I've ever seen), Kirsty Swanson (who knows Buffy can do it?), Michael Rapaport (surprised by hell ... from True Romance and Beautiful Girls, one actor) and of course Ice Cube and Laurence Fishburne are excellent * Always * <br /> <br /> Cons? Jennifer Connelly Although it is not entirely her fault: her role is structured and one-dimensional. General to the highest level, and Tyra Banks with that role has nothing to fear. She cried and groaned. Another person in the long-acting model group who failed miserably. (Although there are only a few people who prove the exception of this rule) <br /> <br /> Finally, the soundtrack! Wow! An amazing soundtrack (Which is definitely worth buying!) Which is suitable for movies such as gloves Each scene has a pair of songs. (Although Tori Amos song will start * Really * disturb me at the end ... not your best job) Liz Phair, Rage Against the Machine, Ice Cube ... How can we make mistakes? > All <br />: Very good watches, strong actors, excellent scripts, great movies 8/10
