Very good Westerners. This is the first time that writer Richard Wilson directed this movie and this is the first time for Samuel Goldwyn Junior as the producer. It was a pleasure to see Angie Dickinson very young and cute as a saloon. Robert Mitchum came to this town, ruled by outlaws and hired as a city trainer But people worry that he will go too far, including the dangers he will do to the city business. There are some similarities in "Warlock", which was created in 1959. This film is fast and exciting. It gives you an advantage.
