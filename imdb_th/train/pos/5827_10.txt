This three-flick is tied with my other favorite flick, "Anomalies in the Court". Flick This is the chaos of laughter for the three Stooges fans. Enjoy <br /> <br /> The boy is the janitor at the studio. Dio recorded when they heard the lovely Christine McIntyre sing the "Voices of Spring" excellent version. She is about to receive a recording proposal. But she has a scar to be honest with her father about choosing her career and proving herself as a true singer When she and the others leave the studio, the stooge decides to have fun and play her notes and dress as curly as Christine. A mercenary woman who can do Christine's career, see Alon and make a mistake. He and Christine invite him to sing for her party. Of course, there was a man who was upset at the party and they destroyed his solo in front of the crowd, so he would find a way to come back to them. <br /> <br /> What is that? Excellent Flick this flick, do not miss! <br /> <br /> 10/10
