James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play with colleagues in a souvenir shop in Budapest who don't like each other without knowing that they are friends who love pens that haven't met. Very charming Comedians are very involved with two stars and are enthusiastic actors. The story is well written and this film has a naive romance. (I don't know how to explain it) that the movie is not there today. Obviously can be compared to the latest that you have received letters and the winning source in every area. <br /> <br /> This is necessary for watching Christmas. Start the christmas Feel more than this little gem
