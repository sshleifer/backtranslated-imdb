I saw this movie when it first launched in 1989. I enjoy it and I'm still doing it now. But what I realized at this time was that it was quite "adult" for movies that had G rated, especially the idea of ​​death and going to heaven. That is suitable for junk dogs There are a lot of good songs from upbeat ("Let's Make Music Together") to serious emotions ("Home to My Heart"). The final scene of the movie with Charlie and Anne-Marie is one of the most sad stories I've seen in the animation. Movies that should be worth touching
