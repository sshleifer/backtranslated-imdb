Ok, I will be honest when I see the trailer for the list for the first time. I think it is an advertisement for Sun Screen products. With everyone walking on the beach Despite this, I decided to watch it, thinking that it would be a new item that I could laugh at. <br /> <br /> From the first 10 seconds of the program I was hooked, why was he lying on the tree, why the plane crashed etc. Why? <br /> <br /> Not every day at the show Comes with ingenuity, humor, action and doubt, but 'lost' to manage all this With excellent actors and teams, beautiful locations and interesting special effects, 'Lost' will catch everyone who makes music and is a must see for anyone who is bored with sitcoms and TVs. Reality <br /> <br /> Lost on Tuesday 10th in Channel 4 (United Kingdom) 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 = O
