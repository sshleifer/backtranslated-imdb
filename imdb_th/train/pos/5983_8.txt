I first saw this movie as a teenager. It was a time when the heavy metal dominated the world. Trick Or Treat has all the elements for the movie that shook the industry. With actors with Skippy from Family Ties, Gene Simmons of Kiss and Ozzy Osbourne. As a preacher, how can you make a mistake? The evil message backwards played on the vinyl! Yes, right. They used to record in this movie. In one scene, Eddie (Skippy) was listening to a message from a bad rockstar on his record player. When things started to be terrifying, the monster started coming out of his speaker and his stereo. Was overwhelmed During my teens I tried to play my records back in the hope that it would happen to me almost 20 years later. Trick Or Treat is also one of my favorite movies of all time.
