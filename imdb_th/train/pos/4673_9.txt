One of the things that I'm most interested in about this film is how the characters and related history are developed rapidly. I think the author wants us to be interested in the characters without forcing them to enter the characters. The location of the use of art and crafts of furniture design and construction is a unique style and / or similar to what the family / brothers passed in life. The complexity of having a twin, acting as a father, an agent, and even a husband add tremendous tensions in making this film emotionally interesting. In addition, although it is not a matter that people may directly relate to (Such as Jewish business / twins / families) that style is quite universal because every family has black sheep That makes it very interesting
