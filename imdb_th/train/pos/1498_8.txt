This is an amusing and sometimes somewhat poetic anthology, if short in the script writing department, rather than making shortcomings in acting, working in places and overall abundance. The best part of this story is the first time that Denholm Elliot played as a horror writer who traces the character from his novel in the work. (The perfect example of a show that pulls this thing out of the sidewalk only); Third, by Christopher Lee, as the feared boy of his own daughter, and the final episode with Jon Pertwee, the great grandfather, as the cautious horror movie star who received more than a new role in his latest project The conversation between Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt was sparkling and inspiring, both of which saw the opportunity to make it real! Usually, the mattress will be good in the weakest part, which certainly does not help with the fact that the wax figure of the woman he is obsessed with the local wax museum is nothing but "beautiful" as we say she believes. ! There are people who need shocking beauty and we get women who have turtle's jaws instead. A little detail aside, this movie and setting a wonderful country house is one to catch when you can.
