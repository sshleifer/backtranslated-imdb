As a rule, the full moon production logo is a warning signal to avoid movies. But since I like Jeffrey Combs in other movies, I shot it. <br /> <br /> It's not bad, not good, but that's something else. This film involves fighting with the "mysterious" brother (the evil) who wants to dominate the world and the character named Dr. Mordrid must also deal with people and officials in the worldly world in which he has accomplished. br /> <br /> Possible spoils follow Mordrid can travel between "dimensions" and do so to find companions who protect the fortress. However, when blind His eyes were broken into holes. So the wizard then passed his hand across the other's eyes and hey! His eyes were restored! This treatment seems to be used only for the eyes. <br /> <br /> Later, Mordred and his "brother" moved two animal skeletons in the museum to fight. Try to guess who will win. <br /> <br /> However, then the picture is not bad. The adventure of "human" of Dr. Mordred is okay and the comb plays a role. Trust <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of bad things.
