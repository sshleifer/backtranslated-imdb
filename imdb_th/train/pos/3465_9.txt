I sat down to watch this film with a lot of nervousness and hope. I don't think it would be possible for this movie to live up to it. But it did that and some First of all, I must say that Jared Harris did a special job like John Lennon. Sometimes it seems that Harris is cursing Lennon. That resemblance is strange and he studies Lennon's etiquette and voices clearly. Aiden Quinn is quite good, like McCartney, which is similar to Maca, even though he occasionally travels across his scratchy accent. <br /> <br /> Writings This novel is a good writing. Of course it is pure fantasy. But sometimes I feel like a cave peeking through the keyhole in this reunion. The scene on the roof was moving, especially as McCartney told Lennon that he had never heard of it like a child - that he was valuable and important and that it might be his fault for his parents. His neglected I also enjoy the scene in the park where their partner dances with a ragged band. <br /> <br /> One of my complaints will be like this: I'm not sure John will erode. Like him Performing in movies in this period of his life He settled in the situation in his country very well, and in fact he was known to be very friendly when he was contacted by fans. Only a few years later he was very friendly when he was assassinated. First to ask for a signature on the day he was killed John used to live a little longer. I'm pretty sure that the Beatles will reunite in some time. And I'm pretty sure Lennon and McCartney will still be friends today. <br /> <br /> Well done. VH1 I'll watch again and again. <br /> <br / >
