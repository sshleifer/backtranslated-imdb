I have to admit that I am completely shocked with this film. For one, I went to see it on a whim, expecting something mediocre. But when receiving this thing, the most shocking thing is that this is in the populist American movie. This is the best English comedy - dark, strange and funny in the way that American movies never were. I have to stop briefly, but recommend this person wholeheartedly; I watched with many people, English, English, European and some Americans, and while some of us like it (Mostly from the first two groups) some people hate and find it worthless If you think you are like this If not, can't do. 10/10
