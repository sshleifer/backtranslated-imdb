This is a popular movie with popular actor Danny Glover, Tony Danza, Joseph Gordon-Levitt. And especially Christopher Lloyed is an enchanting actor in this film that has a charm about real-life angels that helped the Angels baseball team. You never know how it might happen. I like the role of Lloyd in it. He is hilarious A story about turning your life while the children's beliefs about angels help managers Glover to be angry, angry, harassed and bitter. Look best in people. This film is well made and about seeing the best in people and reaching your dreams. It's funny, charming, impressive and sad. All of this is very good. You will like (or love) it. I guarantee <br /> <br /> *** from ****
