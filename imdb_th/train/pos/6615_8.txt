I am glad to be able to speak optimistically about this film with Karas and the Tasuiev brothers, RENAISSANCE <br /> <br /> And firstly, it seems like it should be viewed; The adventures of RENAISSANCE boys are the story of a police investigation to find a new generation of missing scientists. Ilona Tasuiev, a geneticist and researcher at Avalon. <br /> <br /> The story of Karas, Ilona and Bislane. Although not much better known than SIN CITY, better movies For French cartoon lovers, it will be more meaningful. (I have accumulated my French cartoon collection last week, even though I didn't like that.) The atmosphere, music, characters, their lines, the whole plot were good and loved. Karas, a police class The front line of Paris appeared to search for a young female star of genetic research, Ilona Tasuiev, a gentle, hot blonde girl whose Bislane rebel sister liked very much. I guess <br /> For me, the madman in the comics and TV series about the amazingly beautiful cartoon anime is just like the replay of the WILD WILD WEST episode. Here, the legendary past is replaced with an equal future and blas√© but in exciting terms Renault did not doubt And it looks especially bad But it was attracted and hypnotized Moreover, it has succeeded in sketching the image, even though the real world and we will miss Avalon, Nakata, Jonas Mueller, Tasuiev and Goran, Farfella and Karas, telling the distant childhood in Kasbah ??. I like The feeling of RENAISSANCE that is gentle and cute and adventurous and still a professional looking confident. Among these new cartoons, the adaptation of Dick and Linklater (- the first and first adaptation of Dick -) stands out for me in true beauty and excitement. <br /> <br /> Think that that modern device Appropriate and when not unusual <br /> <br /> The characters have strange names such as Bislane and Farfella, mostly from the arts and entertainment world (Goran and Ilona) and Naghib ??). <br /> <br / > No one seems to notice that RENAISSANCE's poster looks like Rourke, right? The man is Marv; Which did not make it a sin city But not the beginning of the initiative, and in fact, it is more similar to Miller's tale than that, which is the image of the bleak future of a degraded society. (In fact, Willis' character and Rourke's character in the previous movie) On the other hand, this cartoon has a broader public climate, an emotional and straightforward adventure. It's like SIN CITY for children. I mean a nasty boy. 'Because there are some nude pictures For what I have said, one person may respond that the features mentioned are special, even when the ancient people and the general places of the adult cartoon look more than they see. True enough, and it was Oldie Miller that brought things on the screen and RENAISSANCE had similarities here and there. Now it's fair that every ring should have its ERAGORN. Therefore, for each sin city I agree that it is quite a part of these cold future tales.
