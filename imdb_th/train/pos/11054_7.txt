My brothers and I stumbled upon the champions when our local stations aired again in the summer of 1970. We certainly liked it. There are some new and mysterious things about this, especially when compared to American re-run (Petticoat Junction, Green Acres ... You already understand). It feels like The Avengers. Belonging to England and in spies / adventures Began to wonder if I would imagine These are of it or not. But what is suspected of being a website allows me to track information about it. Hope to meet new generation fans
