This movie has everything visually. Funny jokes play with words and verses. It is about a group of boys from ethnic groups and various social classes that gather to overcome common enemies. If you watch this thing more than once, you will find that you are talking about it like Animal House (and yes, I love Animal House as well). Not everyone is good and wants to cause problems. (In this movie, he was right) He was a violent person who was lustful, uncaring and cruel. The group of boys who did not get together at first, ended up joining together to survive and get rid of the major with a tumultuous plan that Mad Magazine can write. Must watch - you'll love it!
