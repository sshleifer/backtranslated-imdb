There is no fear of these childhood that one of the friends - who are still friends for 20 years or more - can remember or seem to suffer. All lines are described as friendly. Pushing may be described as the term "choose" one or more of them. But all were forgiven. * Angst * buried in the movie and the participant in later life describes the relationship - what we see is that young people grow up to be the same person More mature But in general still the same person and the same power structure <br /> <br /> fully amazing! Not only the fact that people in fact can grow up quite dangerously from social meetings - but also the friendship that can actually last.
