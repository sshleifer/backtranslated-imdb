I don't want to be bored by everyone by repeating what I have said. But this is one of the best series ever! It was a great shame when it was canceled and I hope some people will have a good feeling to pick it up and start the series again. The good news is that it is released on DVD !!!! I hurried to the store and picked up a copy and was glad to say that it was as good as I remembered. Gary Cole is a fantastically dark and creepy character and every actor is very good It is a shame that the network does not continue. Shaun Cassidy This is a masterpiece. Anyone who enjoys the genre and who doesn't see it must do that. You will not be disappointed My daughter, who is too young to watch when it's on television (she is 20 years old), is very interested and will soon become a boyfriend. She finds it "distorted" and enjoys when she sees I can't wait to watch an episode that hasn't been aired. <br /> <br /> This performance sounds !!!!
