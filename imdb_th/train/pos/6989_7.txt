This film focuses on the first episode of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, but when I watched this movie, I didn't think of a great TV series. I believe this is an astounding 40-year-old horror movie, surprisingly good, with surprisingly good sounds and images for a 67-year-old domain horror film. I enjoy watching Bela Lugosi and his strange team. Including his wife who wanted the fluid from the glands of the bride to be a witch, an old witch and two bizarre sons, a giant fool from the Freaks of 1932). Monkey girl who is going to act like a typewriter. But still enjoy watching My only problem with this great movie is that it is nonsense and unbelievable for movies. I don't want to make this movie, go out and rent it or better, buy a few dollars for a movie.
