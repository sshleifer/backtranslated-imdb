When I really became interested in movies at the age of eleven, I had a big movie 'must see' and I would go to Blockbuster and rent two or three per week. Some are not for all audiences and my mother is crazy. I remember one of the movies in that list was "A Chorus Line" and could not receive it. Now to see if it is a dream come true. <br /> <br /> Of course, I lost the program and I will do everything to get back because I think there is something really interesting. I mean, take the "A Chorus Line" stage drama into a movie. I know that it is something that we see a lot today. But before this, it was slightly different. And this movie has something special. <br /> <br /> Most musical dramas make movies today. Use the opportunity that the camera offers for free to create different scenes and bring characters to different places. "A Chorus "Line" occurred on the theater stage as a player and it died in the same place as the movie. After an audition held by the famous choreographer Zach (Michael Douglas), Richard Atenborough directed a lot of dancers as they tried to find a job. <br /> <br /> Everything happened in Same day: Unaware of tension The stress of having to learn the quiet competition numbers between dancers and it happens on the stage that Douglas makes each dancer stand out and makes them talk about their personal lives and their most terrifying experiences. There are hundreds of dancers and they are great. But they were shortened over time. <br /> <br /> Like the movie I saw recently "A Prairie Home Companion", the Atenborough radio broadcast here involves continuity issues. What happened and the time didn't seem to stop. Again, I didn't get if Atenborough cut enough to shoot this thing. But sure not seem And it is a great work of governance and editing (John Bloom), but in a short time what you wonder what to do with the camera ?? With just one setting, Ronnie Taylor's movies find a way to make close-ups with some characters, zoom in and out, show scenes from different perspectives, and We have a beautiful view of New York. <br /> <br /> At one important time, Douglas told the rest of the people: "Before we start to get rid of: You are great and I want to hire you all but I don't. "This makes me think about the reality show today, the only thing that can be counted is the ability to sing or dance, and the jury often speaks the words that match the contestants before them. He will go out to some people. It's hard that you have to imagine. At least here, all of them are really wonderful. <br /> <br /> To tell some stories, the characters use the music and in one second the stage uses a new life and it is Marvin Hamlisch's lyrics and Edward Kleban's lyrics make the cinema change flawlessly, showing the dancers' feelings and allowing them to perform great dances by Michael Bennett, a book in the theater. Became a short and flawless screenplay by Arnold Schulman; Which is sometimes very impressive Therefore, if there is no song, it will have a word, but in "A Chorus Line" it is impossible to be moved Reed used the stage to convince the character of Douglas. The words "Let me dance for you" never sound honest and more and more songs and lyrics
