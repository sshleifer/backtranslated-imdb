I'm happy to see the short film "The Cure" by director Ryan Jafri for the first time. What really impressed me was the camera and music work. <br /> <br /> I think many young filmmakers. person We see that the results are not what we shot or below our ambitions. But this film, the director, first launched from a young director, managed well on the screen. Camera movement, color, light, songwriting all contribute to the story and mood of the movie. <br /> <br /> And the music as an important element of the movie language can help a lot. <br /> < br> difficult to describe the woman's heart, her desire for fear, especially in the short term Still, I have to admit that I am not a fan of v / o (subtitles), especially when the film receives advanced storytelling by telling stories instead of shock and wounds. My personal feeling to some parts of the story is that I guess the narrator is trying too hard. So energy pushes the audience back from the mood of the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a short film that is doing well. I can see input from the director. Ryan! Greetings from China await you ahead. <br /> <br /> Time
