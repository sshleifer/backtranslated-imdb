I felt unintentionally in this film on TV and I couldn't leave ... It was a really great movie that made people learn about America's history with the Vietnam War, the time of flower power, the struggle of the nation. .. It shows the conflict of the generation, political opinion, the competition that occurred in the 60s .... I was born in 1980, so I never knew about it. This before ... in the history of the United States is not. Priority and that film learned many facts for me! However, I think every actor is excellent. Especially Jordana Brewster, Josh Hamilton and Jerry O'Connell. Now I can watch this movie more than 1 time per day !! It's great .... The shameful thing that appears on TV is not in the cinema ... <br /> <br />
