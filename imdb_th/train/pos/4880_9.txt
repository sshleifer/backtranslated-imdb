Introduction to the movie world of Yuji Yamada is through his famous and recent Samurai Trilogy with The Twilight Samurai, The Blade Blade and Love and Honor. I enjoy all three movies and when watching the film work of an experienced director, I think it will take a long time to watch all of his movies. There is no need to say that when our mother Kabei came to our coast, I quickly took the opportunity to see what would be the mother's poem everywhere. <br /> <br /> Based on the autobiography of Teruyo Nogami, Kabei - our mother told the four intimate families? Kayo mother "Kabei" (Sayuri Yoshinaga), Father Shigeru "Tobei" (Mitsugoro Bando), eldest daughter Hatsu (Mirai Shida) and youngest child Teru (Miku Sato). Their lives will change forever when Shigeru Was arrested under the peacekeeping law due to a moral conflict with the nation in the late 30s that Japan began "war" in China and after that they joined <br /> <br /> So start Kabei's fight to stop working to raise her family and meet her difficult husband often. Help came from relatives, especially on the side of Shigeru, because Kabei's father brought the attitude that "I told you" to choose your spouse. At one time, students of Shigeru Yama (art lovers should remember Tadanobu Asano here) gave laughter as an eye-catching man who gradually became a partner and guardian, representing the children and Kabei's sister in Hisako law (Rei Dan) from Hiroshima, a warning sign of reversing, some people say that her destiny is unfortunate as the movie progresses on schedule. <br /> <br /> While the film focuses on children Any Grew up under the presence of their mother Their father, the thing that I enjoyed was a family event with a microscope under an event that occurred around the world which affected the general villagers in Japan. It is against the historical backdrop of Japan that has driven the power over the region and has a character here that does not hide those ambitions, even discussing what the country will eventually do if it succeeds in occupying the territory. Occupied This is something that I rarely see in Japanese movies, openly speaking in those days, and in order to understand how people have to struggle with home problems, making resources more difficult in warfare. <br /> <br /> Selected actresses here are perfect in their performances and roles, whether they are veterans or child actors. Actress Sayuri Yoshinaka deserves a special mention for her role as a mother who has to dig deep and find that the inner force will take the family through trying situations while Mirai Shida And Miku Sato is a cute boy Make and compromise Each scene with three people together makes the heart aggravate when difficult or fill your heart with joy. They should celebrate. Soon you will find yourself attracted to want to be a part of this family. Thanks to the powerful performances of the main actors by Yuji Yamada, persuading the natural performances from children. <br /> <br /> Kabei - Our mother is proud to present an amazingly beautiful artistic direction and level in a happy and sad time without having to go to the top or rely on cheap price stories to reduce the feelings of the audience. Many little things that are right here, which makes it perfect, where every scene is not wasted and with a significant difference in conveying the message, whether it is compassion or <br /> <br /> <br /> In addition to the sudden ending (I hope it will continue even more for 2 hours). Kabei Our Mother is highly recommended and you will find it difficult to hold back your tears. That misses your own mother and the sacrifices you make for you on a daily basis What kind of warning should you need? Then sacrificing that scene at the end of the credit will remind you of what you might be allowed.
