This performance was appreciated by critics and those who realized that there was a similarity between the "Pushing Daisies" style and others not stealing. (Yes, I've seen "Amelie" "Pushing Daisies" quite similar. But it is still different enough to be original), rather, there are too few programs on TV that have strange charms : Brian Fuller created both shows (Both programs are related to the young woman "Undead"). This performance never stops and is charming and it is always strange. But always humane. <br /> <br /> I have to say a word about The pattern of the story that is in progress Some people complain that this program has no moral center because at first (And many later) when Ned seems to have escaped with the cause of Chuck's father's death without any effect. First of all, this must be a new definition of "Without any effect" because of the fact that Ned was just a boy and did not realize that he had made Chuck's father dead But he felt guilty The moment he realized what he had done Far more than a dozen in the series, Ned finally confesses to Chuck that he made her father die with a gift. Now there is no police who will claim the person who caused the death of one person by bringing others back to life. Therefore, the question of forgiveness and restitution must be taken without social guidance. In other words, between Ned and Chuck, who did not want to forgive Ned soon. <br /> <br /> But this suggests the problem of continuous storytelling in the network drama. I remember when the character of David Caruso in "NYPD Blue" did something wrong and seemed to go with him - all year - then he was caught and forced to quit the job. (And out of the list) The point is that viewers should learn now and do not think that just because the normal characters do something wrong at the same time and do not catch at that time that he has gone with it There is always next week - and maybe even next year.
