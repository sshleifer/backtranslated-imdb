I spent 5 hours in this movie. There is nothing I have ever seen close to the terrifying fear of this movie that left me without a woman with advanced human aging problems. This film participates in the ninth level as an investment with undeniable feelings for our lives. I am happy to soak up the injured water from the inside. It empowers the mantle that is shared together in the history of human encounters, reaching deep into the pain, separation and inclination of one's self and others The result is forgiveness of building our bridges away from the mud sludge that we have to face. The birth of finding the true people is the pursuit of happiness. Efforts to use realism to cut the dark ground of our bankrupt culture
