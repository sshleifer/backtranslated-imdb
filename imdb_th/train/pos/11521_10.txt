The magician is a great horseman from the beginning to the end. Thank you so much to the magic caused by the stars. Alan Arkin is one of his best roles in decades It's like traveling in the form of redemption and the results of dreams. I can't believe that this movie is very rare - I'll buy it on DVD. But still can't find a solution
