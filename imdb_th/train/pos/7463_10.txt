It seems that this movie will make us polarized. You may love or hate it. I like it. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comments that you just have to "feel" this one. <br /> <br /> In addition, at the beginning of the movie Tom Cruz also shows His girlfriend was painted by Monet, an impressionist painter. Monet's style is to paint with a small tinted spot near the orderly painting. But from a distance, you can tell what the model is. Cruz said the paintings were "Vanilla sky" I believe this is a hint for movie viewers. This movie is like an impressionist drawing. It's an impressionist movie creation! And it's not a coincidence that the name of this film refers to that painting. <br /> <br /> This is not your general linear plot. It takes more thought. There is a symbol and there is a scene that jumps around and no you are not sure what happened But in the end, it was all explained. <br /> <br /> You must concentrate on this movie. But I think people are making mistakes in concentrating too hard. After that is when you should think about it. If you try to figure out that it is unfolding, you will overwhelm yourself. Just let it happen ... "go" with it ... keep an open mind Remember what you saw and recorded the analysis for later use. <br /> <br /> I found all the great performances and thought it was very unique, fiercely creative and spelling. Will not criticize the intellect of those who do not like it It attracts some tastes. If you like psychedelic, existential movies, philosophical, thought-provoking and spiritual ideas, then watch If you want something slightly lighter, skip it. <br /> <br /> But if you like what I describe, you will enjoy it.
