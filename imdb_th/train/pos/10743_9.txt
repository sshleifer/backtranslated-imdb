I read most comments here. I concluded that almost everyone agreed that 9/11 was a shocking history. There are some people who think that the additional lecture is weak and <br /> <br /> I agree that the lecture is weak and unnecessary. About two brothers and sisters met after the disaster and the cliff that hung Tony. But I don't think the subtitles are unnecessary Like many theorists, I think that our life is a story. We live and create our own autobiography. So if we tell about our lives, this thing is usually in the form of subtitles. We do not summarize facts such as: birth, childhood, high school, etc. We create stories about our lives. <br /> <br /> Because we are familiar with the story, we want to create history with stories as well. Of stories that we can identify ourselves We can better understand the things that happened in history when it was told in the form of stories. That is the purpose of adding the story in the documentary. The story is so weak, whether it is But we understand what happened If I go out there, I'll worry about my brother. <br /> <br /> And the second point is making a blockbuster movie about it. It is true that recently there will be a large movie about 9/11, although there is something about it. But no one like this documentary But what happens if there are about 5 years of movies? I agree that it is a mistake to try to make a lot of money from 9/11, but I also agree that movies are the best way to tell history. We have watched a few movies about World War 2. If I didn't watch these movies, my views about WW would be completely different. I remember seeing the Schindler program and I cried for an hour during class. The film gives a good image of things that happen in history and even though it is fiction. <br /> <br /> So my point: The storytelling is not always bad, it makes us identify with stories and make us never forget.
