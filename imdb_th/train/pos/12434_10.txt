For the first film in the proposed series, it will create an appropriate balance. It is made with the style and class that shows that the early days of Modesty as a refugee and her beginning in stepping into power in the crime world. I think it is an image that shows the honesty / truth of her character as the author Peter O'Donnell intended for Alexandra Staden as Modesty is beautiful and a great choice. She acts very persuasive as a tough survivor with a cool / clever / naive and innocent appearance and a full mark of Tarantino for choosing an unknown actor for a very-believable role Up to have a new page to create sections I wait for the next movie
