The most open and impressive documentary film ever created I cry all the way from beginning to end. See the act that you were immediately caught by the battle of the man who will live without pain to live the life that we will receive. The first time I heard the name, I was almost afraid to see the program. It was difficult for me to understand the painful life every day of my life. I really feel him. The most sad part of the documentary is when Jonny took the coffin out. Do you imagine doing that? Moreover, even though he was severely hurt and unbearable, he still opened his own charity (DEBRA). Jonny is one of the only people who deserve respect and appreciation. Well, he is a true hero.
