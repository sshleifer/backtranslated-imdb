I don't know what this movie is until I read about it in L.A. Weekly. I generally agree with the reviews in LA Weekly and decide to buy tickets for this movie (From my favorite TV program Deadwood) and Lucas Haas - I wonder if we will see many more in the near future. The film is funny, heartwarming, great acting features and beautiful photography. I do not know whether this film is distributed or not. But I hope to be like that or not soon This is destined to be a true indie jewel. It also has music from my favorite band, Jewish money! The only thing that disappointed Parker Molly wasn't at the screening. Even without her ... This is the best movie I have ever seen at the festival.
