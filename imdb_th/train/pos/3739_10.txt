I like this movie very much. Bozz is a soldier who is not cool and doesn't want to go to war. His character is similar to Yossarian in Catch-22, Joseph Heller's classic novel about men and war. However, this film is not located in the war zone. But it is a practice to prepare to fight before the war This great movie is about recognizing the disgust that the Vietnam War is a mistake and those who have been sacrificed because of the loss. Colin Farrell is a great man like the Bozz soldier. As shown True love and compassion for his fellow soldiers as he insulted and disrespectful to the establishment that tried to kill him. The Bozz was cool and not boring. Testing and refining his commanders received a goat. Of them at every opportunity He is a person of Jesus Christ who has a psychological level of "saving his life", his fellow soldiers, and demonstrating the true need without having to leave the army of this man. <br /> <br /> Acting and That action is sharp and reliable, and as "Sleeper" Tigerland comes down with Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket as one of the three Vietnamese movies that I think now. <br /> <br /> FIVE STARS is an option.
