I used to live with a roommate who tried to commit suicide and our apartment was in a building where you might get a fifty dollar sound to sneeze after midnight, so there's no need to say that I can. Related to Polanski's "tenant" <br /> <br /> But I like watching movies for other reasons. I'm not sure how it works. Overall - Polanski's characters are descended from paranoia and madness, which last half an hour or so. Ebert for one person is not fully convinced and he slaps the movie too. One cruel criticism But I think the scenes and moments of each person work beautifully, so even though I don't understand all the movies - Egypt has done something about it, for example? - I still have an overall positive impression. <br /> <br /> I love the disgusting friends played by Bernard Fresson. Like God, I settled on how many stupid friends there were instead of friends. together! I like the cinema scene - the moment that "creates" the most fun in the history of movies. And the boy, I love Isabelle, pressed here - she was a fox in this movie, almost unbelievable And she gave me a great performance. <br /> <br /> Polanski is also a good actor. I disagree with the occasional insulting speech about his performance here. His character should be important and low-minded. One of me found that he was perfectly sympathetic - even though he had broken me a bit when he started to dress with drag without a visible reason. <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie is obscure and slow. But it captures the strange properties of living in the apartment - something that I do too much - so I dig it It's very funny that you want to be a general reference point, and suddenly a strange movie like this is very important! Worthwhile to lift the bag to change the DVD.
