Yes, this is a B-grade horror movie, but at least the producers, directors and actors don't pretend. This is heavenly mana. The plot is repeated. A psychic serial killer who is about to be executed. He is splashed with acid, genetically causing him to become a snowman. Caught him With a limited budget, the crew must do with special techniques that limit the money. Most of them seem to be used with snowman costumes. Shooting alone is difficult by cartoon or pan out. (The image that the camera moves to hide the details) <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for children and should not be confused with the Disney movie of the same name. If you don't let your child watch the movie pg-13 alone more than parents, don't let your children watch this movie. The film has two claims that are famous: 1. Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie), beautiful, acting in her first film. The scene in which Jack Frost attacks Shannon, Elizabeth, is worth a look. 2. This movie has a joke about the worst snowman ever. Very bad joke that the director gave credit to the clown in the credit list.
