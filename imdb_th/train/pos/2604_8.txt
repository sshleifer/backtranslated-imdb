"Amazing Grace" feels sluggish because it tells the contemporary story of various lives in the apartment building. The language spoken is Hebrew. But this drama may occur in modern cities It observes family values, romantic relationships and age groups with equal self-confidence. It doesn't just judge the character. But presenting them honestly as they try to solve their immediate problems in this modern world The quality of the performance is very good and the character's observation is intelligent and sharp. I appreciate this movie very much.
