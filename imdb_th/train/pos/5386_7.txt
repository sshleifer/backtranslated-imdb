This movie is a very good movie played in 1932 and may not work as well today because its style looks old and stylish. However, if you are a type of person who likes me who likes old Hollywood movies, you will cut a little film and enjoy what it is - interesting soap. <br /> <br /> The movie is set in Ward for troubled pregnancy In this large room, there are about half a dozen beds in which women are waiting to give birth - but doctors are concerned about potential complications (such as - this room will make the mother really painful!) And like "Love Boat Or "Fantasy Island". Each mother has her own special story. With many violent and insane stories, you must suppress unbelief. I can do and enjoy the movie a little. <br /> <br /> Here are some stories: One story involves father. You don't see mom But he is a very nervous father. However, he is wonderful. This is very impressive. Loretta Young and Eric Linden are sad cases. Loretta was sent to the hospital from prison - apparently she killed a terrible man. You don't know what happened. But you think he is trying to force yourself with her! Nonetheless, she was given a 20-year penalty - and her husband devoted her to her side and as much as she could. <br /> <br /> Glenda Farrell is a scary person. She has a mother hamster's instinct, which is a terrible hamster and has real alcohol! She is funny and worth watching through most movies. I love you drinking from a hot water bottle full of gin and upset when you know you can't make money from selling your twins !! During the film's line, she had a change in the traditional Hollywood style that should be touched - I found that it was being planned. <br /> <br /> There was a girl who gave birth to a baby that was still born. Surprisingly, they brought the girl back to the same ward as the woman waiting for birth !!! A crazy woman that you've lost a child for a moment before walking down from a psychiatric room. She insists that she has children. Later, she escaped again and took a child with him. <br /> <br /> There is a story more than this. But the people I talk about are the main ones. As I said, it was a very strange and entertaining drama - and quite sad in the case of many stories. The ending, in particular, is destroying the heart and doing exceptionally well. There are very few good performances, especially Farrell and Aline MacMahon as head nurse. Overall, it's a very good movie - and I don't know why they felt they had to create this movie a few years later. (Which is normal for Warner Brothers)
