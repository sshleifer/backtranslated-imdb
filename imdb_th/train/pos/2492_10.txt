This is one of the most fun performances I've ever seen. It looks very refreshing and I have stitched many times. I guess it has social awareness factors as well, which makes it quite interesting. If a white woman, would they get the same reaction? Maybe they may not be? The character knows that there are no restrictions (check my lyrics) and don't discourage anyone from their distorted fun! My favorite is Bob the creator. It's really smart. If you like twisted black comedy, this is for you. If you like to maintain your appearance, it may not be the 3 blonde girls who are not British comedians who are shown on TV! It was a funny show and the characters that were released in public without a doubt laughed loudly! It would be impossible to look at the crazy characters and public reactions! This series is easily added to the great comedies!
