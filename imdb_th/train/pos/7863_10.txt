This film is an eye opening for those who can live the charming life of the stars only. It tells you that people who want to do good can't do it. Plus the scene of the bombing is very real. <br /> <br /> The things you read and were taught didn't happen !!! <br /> <br /> Can increase the blood pressure level of You can get 10%. <br /> <br /> Every actor plays a good role. <br /> <br /> Some scenes may be avoided, including teenagers. <br /> <br /> This movie Quite an adult in nature. <br /> <br /> Not a movie that can be seen with the family. <br /> <br /> Selection of actresses. Excellent !!!
