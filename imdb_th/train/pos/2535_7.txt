Prof. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) discovered the Radium X - the powerful power to use for atomic energy. Unfortunately, Rukh was contaminated by radium and began to glow in the dark - and his touch died suddenly. Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi) developed an antidote - but Rukh became angry because of Radium and The antidote and set out to kill everything he believed to be wrong. <br /> <br /> The story is stupid. "The effect" that makes Carlos glow in the dark is an interesting story. Laugh But this is still fun. It moves fast, has a great atmosphere (observe the "house" of Rukh and the movie starts in the dark and rainy night) and Karloff and Lugosi (as always) give a great performance. There is also a good performance by Franic Drake (as Rukh's wife) and Violet Kemble Cooper (like his mother). So it's ok. But just the movie below the movie Karloff / Lugosi. The other plot is far more than I can swallow. I still do this. I give 7 items.
