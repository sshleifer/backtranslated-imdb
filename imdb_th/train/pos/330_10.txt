I am an Italian man and recently I watched this movie again. I was amazed by its beauty: the first time I was 10 years old and I liked it. But today I can appreciate it with the thoughts and feelings of adults. Now I can understand that it is a masterpiece of the special season of Italian movies. (Pasolini and others) At that time, <br /> <br /> Hollywood epic movies are good ... for fun. Maybe 'Odyssey' may not have an English version because Not funny enough ... not suitable for popcorn and coke viewers. However, suitable for Homer, pathos and existential reflections. <br /> <br /> In Italy, just released a very good DVD version: INTEGRAL with great colors. You can search for file sharing. But in Italian language only and without a bad description: the dialogue and sound of this movie is also amazing
