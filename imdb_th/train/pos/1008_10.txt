I entered this wonderful program in about Season 4, and since then I have seen all the episodes, all episodes on the DVD and getting better and better in Season 9 and 10, now may not have Richard Dean Anderson Now, however, the addition of Ben Browder and Claudie Black, it still has been showing more stamina and remains the same even after 10 seasons. Sadly, now sci-fi channels eliminate this amazing item without being Fry the hope in 11 seasons has made two straight to DVD movies and hope to add more. Atlantis remains strong in the 4th season and has a third rotation in the franchise work. There's nowhere near death. This TV program should not be missed for sci-fi fans and people of this type because there are things that are attractive for people of all ages and people of all types. Watch it !!!!! 10/10
