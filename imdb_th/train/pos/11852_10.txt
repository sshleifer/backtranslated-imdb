The spirit is a unique and unique image of Western life from the perspective of wild horses and Native Americans. The film focuses on the friendships and threats that wild spirits encounter in their lives. <br /> <br /> Well done in presenting the technology that is present to get amazing images that are amazing in Deep level <br /> <br /> Great music with Bryan Adams songs and Hans Zimmer's songs, responsible for popular songs from The Lion King hits in 1994 <br /> <br /> The story is not deep. Much But the fact that it is not very deep, because some movies are not in my opinion to completely divert attention from the film. <br /> <br /> The best movies I have Very happy and suitable for everyone in the family. No one missed. (10/10)
