Since I was interested in the monster in the lake, I really dug this movie. This movie is worth watching. If you like horror, they are a good type of film. The effect is very good, just think "Land of Defeat" I watched this movie in the early 90 years. Maybe like 89/90 on the local channel monster show called "Morgus Presents." What B felt like A. Years later, I saw it on a DVD at Circuit City in the area and bought immediately so I could get 9 because there was a private spot. Heart there with The Monster Squad and Gremlins. Enjoy B movies for all ages.
