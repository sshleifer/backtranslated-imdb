The conclusion for this film is very good in explaining what to expect. It was a very good thriller, well shot, hard to believe that it was Bill Paxton's first debut, although some shots would look like the storyboard version. <br /> <br /> There is still. A few pictures that look good and show the true imagination of Paxton. <br /> <br /> It's a stable story with a great twist. At the end, many of them believe that everyone is fun and the best. Being obscured well enough to Give them a real <br /> <br /> child actor in films did well. I tend to watch movies that have children in the actors' roles because they often come out because the jukebox refuses. But these two children do well. <br /> <br /> This movie isn't scary. It's not scary. But it's very creepy
