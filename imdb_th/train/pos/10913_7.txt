William Powell is a doctor involved in the murder and ex-wife of "The Ex-Mrs Bradford" starring Jean Arthur, Eric Blore and James Gleason. Powell seems to have a chemical relationship with every woman he joins. Even though he and Myrna Loy are perfect screen partners But the actors created other "Thin Man" movies, one with Ginger Rogers and this movie with Arthur, both for good results. <br /> <br /> No one is bored to see. That Powell was witty and professional, and "The Ex-Mrs Bradford" was no exception. The former Mrs. B had Mr. B serve the subpoena for alimony, then returned again to help him solve the mystery. That she dragged him in And this is not the first time you do that! It seems that there is a movie "Bradford" earlier, or that this story is intended to be the first film of the series - Mr. B complains that his former mystery writer brought him into the case continuously. This time, the riders rode in their favorite horses, mysteriously dropping themselves from the horse and died before the finish line. <br /> <br /> The answer to this case is quite strange, but beside the point is joking between the pair. And the intervention of the former Mrs. B. Jean Arthur is quite charming in her role and very funny. However, with an intelligent actress like Arthur doing humor, it seems to be more intentional than a feather. I wonder if the writer has something else in his mind - the strange side of Carole Lombard. When Arthur hears that the police have arrived, she says "Ah, it might be about my alimony. I'm waiting for the police to shake hands." It was Powell's ribs rather than serious words. It still works well, and it shows that a good actress can share with her. <br /> <br /> Absolutely worth watching.
