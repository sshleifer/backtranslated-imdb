There are many problems with Mystery Men. Firstly, there are too many different characters for all of them to get complex or interesting personalities. Special effects diverting from the story and not being special. Paul Reubens loses a pathetic role and a child as a character who just farts and speaks with an unknown accent. /> Now go to the right part. William H Macy, three heavenly words and his performances as shoveler are perfect. Sphinx is an exceptionally funny character that is only a mystery and a mysterious mysterious proverb. Ben Stiller is also amusing, demonstrating the weak character that tries to make it into a big league of heroes. All the characters do and that is the area that I find funny. That is because all the actors are indie movie actors trying to make it into Hollywood's great leagues. <br /> <br /> Honesty The reason I think it has failed at the box office Is America not a sarcastic <br /> <br /> All in all, I love movies. But I feel that it will work better if more effort is made to refine the script than to have CGI terrain and unnecessary effects.
