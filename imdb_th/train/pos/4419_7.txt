I saw this movie and heard the director of writing, Juan Gerard speaking at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> All I know about it is that it's an 8-year-old boy story. During the Cuban Revolution in May In 1958 and affecting his home and family, <br /> <br /> The opening scene of the movie will remind "Cinema Paradiso". In fact, the film is filled with references to classic movies: The Roulette Wheel (Casablanca), "Chicken clucking" (Rebel Without a Cause) refers to Bunuel "Touch of Evil"; You will find more homeless men (Georg Stanford Brown), a reference to Cuban villagers who often use black men as a type of Greek singer. <br /> <br /> The thing that this movie is the best of dream Gerard's desire is to honor the family and the medium-sized movie he loves for the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> This is the true story of Juan Gerard and everyone in it is true, just like the event. That appeared Gerard is an architect and engineer. (And a passionate movie lover) but his dream is to create this movie He and his wife decided to live that dream, and Harvey Kathy became a "angel" who believed in Gerard and agreed to produce and act. Keitel held a powerful screen as "Mysterious" and mysterious grandfather Brown and Keitel are the only Americans in the Iben Hjejle (High Fidelity) team and Gael Garcia Bernal (Y tu Mama Tambien) provides strong support in important roles. Actually, the first half of this film was a problem from Difficult delivery But stay with it The second half is much better because of the revolutionary events combined for the bitter, swallowing, and honest climax. It was Juan Gerard's first attempt, but it was honest like him and his love and heart came through this sincere first attempt. I will see it again, of course, and hope that he will continue to work on the film. <br /> <br />
