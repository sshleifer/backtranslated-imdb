Sensitive and naive But can not deny that there is an impact on the emotional support of men - in this case, embodied that the German and French miners were forced to shut down from each other after the Great War, thanks to the new border While France was the commander But when a fire broke out in the French side, the general popularity of German men led to help, safety and friendship. This is an excuse to fall into the ears of the deaf within ten years, while a man from Pabst's own side will destroy that piece and turn the war into a prelude. But it is clear to me that Pabst believes or at least wants hope for basic humanity like this because the film is screened with optimism while the film is adapted from The Threepenny Opera. In addition, increasing his faithful faith is the fact that the characters here are not simple voices for At work But a real person with a real family at our home, which we live as well These are ordinary people, the working class who just believe in the value of caring and preserving your male friend's rights and in this day of opportunism, individualism I will take thinning in my plan to receive that positive message Represents The view that I think we all can dream of. <br /> <br /> (Note: It is clear that the ending was cut down on most prints that the French built the mine door up and closed the man again. Events that have changed brutally and may make this movie a better movie overall But I have to regret that I felt the positive feelings of the last order, so in the short term I'm glad it was cut) {Level: 8/10 (B) / # 7 (from 11) from 1931}
