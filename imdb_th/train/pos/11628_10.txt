"I don't want this complicated story. I have to assume that you will read this." The fear flew 30,000 feet in an action-thrilling action game. Overnight flights in Miami became a quick survival battle when Lisa (Rachel McAdams) realized that her seatmate (Cillian Murphy) was planning to use her as part of a terrifying assassination plan. She is racing against time to warn the victims that might happen before the call. <br /> <br /> One of the many reasons I love this movie is because of the chemistry between the two stars McAdams and Murphy, who are two actors. I like best For example, the first scene at the airport can be played as a romantic comedy: two people run together .... I have sent it to both as well to create a movie like this. In particular, Murphy's character .. Jackson seems to be complicated in the way he is charming and innocent. But he tried to do his job and made Lisa feel both physically and mentally I mean, in some parts, he seems to be worried about Lisa. <br /> <br /> Great excitement all the way. Many movies that I hate to see a prequel or sequel But actually I don't mind showing prequests for this The favorite scene should be the scene of the head of the rock because it is unexpected. There is also a good collection for the famous 'pen' scene. When will you make her move? There is also a great change in Lisa's McAdam, which she transformed herself from being a victim to fighting back. I like the scene in which she sits in the food court and pretends to ask some women to explore the food center. Murphy is really great with his wine .....
