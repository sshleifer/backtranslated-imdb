****** Warning: There may be spoilers. ************** <br /> <br /> So who is the "mysterious person"? Simply said, Mystery Men is a small group of heroes trying to live in their fantasy teens. Hopelessly at the same time eliminating both their true self and their excellent self. The Shoveller (Bill Macy) worked during the day and at night made his wife and children stay at home while he was down. The boat goes down the street to look for a crime that will be organized. With his unique shovel fighting style. The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sells silverware to the newlyweds every day and throws tableware at the villagers cracking at night if his mother Not busy with the latest spying, Mr. Furious works in the garbage yard to receive wages, then brings his frustration to friends at night by throwing one torpedo that feels bad for friends and enemies. And threatening to be really angry (leaving everyone surprised?) Ben Stiller breathes this life in this character. You can't help but love him. <br /> <br /> All three Take the night to try to capture. 'The moment of glory' that they dreamed of Super Hero Apparently it might have happened. Champion City has Captain Amazing. After all ... fighting against the elite police with a sufficient company logo on his costume to stop a special bullet or two times. Greg Kinnear changed the protagonist. As a middle-aged betrayal who tries to draw attention from his fans back in the twilight of his career. <br /> <br /> To bring "special magic" that may bring endorsement. Liberation Casanova Frankenstein, WAAAAAY a threatened elite played to perfection by Goeffrey Rush mad genius who created this. 'Neurologist' to change Champion City into a reflection of his own insanity ... and ended up catching C.A within hours after being released from prison. This left only the Mystery Men to stop Frankenstein's evil plans, but with followers such as Disco Boys defending Frankenstein, all three had to get a little help. <br /> <br /> Start recruiting and after a painful recruitment The team settled with The Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), which initially had only the true talent in the team with her mysterious bowling ball, seemingly moving by the vengeful spirit of her dead father; Kel Mitchell, who claims to be invisible when no one looks at him. The spleen (Paul Rubens) gets a powerful, bloating mystery by an angry gypsy; And the disadvantaged Sphinx (Wes Studi), who showed that he could cut his gun halfway with his thoughts. Then spent the rest of the film spraying the puzzle and acting beyond intelligence. <Br This movie is a cross-themed game. Anyone who wants to make a small pigeon hole movie in a small category is a battle that is defeated. This is a spoof / parody of the superhero genre - from the pseudo-Burton series that is endlessly recycled. (And sometimes decorated with more spoofed materials) to ridiculous costumes, the type of comic books has been sent quite well But at the same time it flicked a serious superhero as well Both at once Although not a unique idea in itself (For example, this film has some ways that reflect the work of D.C. Inferior Five in Comic's short term), but it is quite creative for large screens. It presents the comic book world that has to suppress the unbelief that will continue to accept, then throw into the inevitable things - and we all know that if the hero is real, they will be true if Big Guy and S are flying around New York City. You will see a half-dozen news reports about fools in underwear that have been given a bottom kick on a regular basis. Of course, the Chauveler is a good fighter and Blue Rising is highly accurate - all parts of the world of super heroes. But that makes them a genuine superhero? Only in their hearts. <br /> <br /> This movie is funny too. Unavoidable when trying to point out the ridiculous nature of a superhero's patent One flying torpedo is a cartoon genius on stage, throwing a lot of bits out to play. Especially as a dialogue by Janeane Garofalo and her bowling father / father, but it's not a comedy in terms of laughter, side-by-side or a memorable eternal joke. It blends with drama, discovery, and romance, but never fully experiences anything. <br /> <br /> The thing that makes Mystery Men a good movie, in the end, is a very good story. Cute, weak / weak, finally being righteous, and at one point shining into super heroes. Justice is served And the movie ends with a scene full of realism (The most realistic in the world where the bowling ball flies and the glasses make perfect disguises) If the audience stops trying to label the movie, the film can be played perfectly. <br /> <br /> Of course. That this film is not perfect Claire Forlani was disgusted and without direction, like the love that Mr. Furious was interested in, despite his important role as his conscience. Tom Waits seemed to be confused by his work as a mad inventor. Heller, although his opening scene will accept women who have retired in the hospital, should be worth watching alone. And the William never lost anything more than a lack of guns (Points created in the movie) filming changes quickly and disjointed (As happened in the average comic book, so it's a forgiving story). Sometimes the music gives power over the scenery.> Overall, this movie is incredible. You may have to be a fan of comics and superhero genres to really appreciate this movie. But it's a fun way and a good way to kill a couple of hours and let your brain rest. <br /> <br /> 8/10 In my opinion
