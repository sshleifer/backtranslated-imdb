Like A Streetcar Named Desire (directed by Gadg, both on stage and on the scene) Panic In The Streets shows New Orleans claiming to be an important celebrity - Jazz's hometown is not mentioned. It was Richard Widmark's seventh film, and went very far to create him as a good actor that he was more than a psychopathic killer. Gadg appeared in an incredibly small role as a theater administrator. But this movie is full of talent that started with Jack Palance (still being charged as Walter Jack Palance) while the big boss 'Big' Emile Meyer, Tommy Rettig, plus Paul Douglas is credible and strong as The police who came to see Widmark's view were more rewarding for seeing a little. Catch it if you can.
