If you are one of the movies of Katana (like me), you will have to thank Katana for shifting, throwing samurai, flicking blood. <br /> <br /> Starring Tadanobu Asano (Vital, Barren Illusion) and Ryu Dai (Kagemusha) This samurai war between the tribes of Heiki against the Genji tribe touched the highest level in the final showdown at the Gojo Bridge. Counting that countless bodies And beautiful vision which Prepared by Maestro Sogo Ishii to do the rest. <br /> <br /> Great Japanese flick for a rainy summer night.
