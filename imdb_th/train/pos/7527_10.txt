An overview of the most popular pin-ups of all time, rather than your drawn biography. This fun and wonderful movie has the look and feel of an era that has an awesome soundtrack. Yom and everything you need in an indie movie I think the tendency to show that Bettie Page is a type of sex fox, like Jayne Mansfield, but if you look carefully at Betty's attitude, she always looks happy. "You hope you will be with me. "Look rude or "I just did this because my acting career didn't work." Watched as a porn star. Women related to this film (Three female producers, writers / directors, female co-writers and cute Gretchen Mol, who I'm sure helped define this role with her sweet influence) captured the mind of The sweet and innocent southern woman who is happy with photography and hopes that the good JC will not be angry with her. <br /> <br /> Gretmore becomes a highly productive career. (She may have the most perfect breast ever), which I am happy because she has a curse. Many years ago, she created the cover of Vanity Fair when nobody knew who she was. And to speak frankly, which is quite considerate I mean, unfortunately, she never made Gwyneth's status, though not because of lack of talent. Choosing a few poor movies when you are a cute blonde girl in Hollywood makes you forgetful. I remember I'm scared. If this does not bring her back to the list, okay, I'll be the uncle of the monkey. <br /> <br /> Very personal. Betty leaves the party with a high note and falls in love with the old man Jesus. Anything that floats your honey boat You are a woman I hope you will be happy wherever you are. <br /> <br /> Congratulations, Mary Harron, you have shown justice to our idols.
