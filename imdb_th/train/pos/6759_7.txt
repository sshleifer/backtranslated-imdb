At THE SIDEWALK ended up being a well-known film directed by Otto Preminger, who gave the world to LAURA and this time he has the same star: DANA ANDREWS and GENE TIERNEY. Must say that Tierney doesn't work here More supportive roles while spotlighting at Andrews. <br /> <br /> He plays a strong and harsh cop who is dealing with gangsters. In a way that was too strong until one night he accidentally killed a man in the process of arresting him. When the suspicion falls to the taxi driver (TOM TULLY), he will investigate the murder. But began to feel guilty because he loved the daughter of a taxi (GENE TIERNEY). Now it seems Tierney looks too luxurious for the woman she plays here and doesn't seem to fit the background elements of the story that is not suitable. <br /> <br /> That story changed according to the investigation Deep down and found that the man killed has a silver plate in the head from serving as a war hero. At the end, it became a moral story with Andrew developing his crime awareness. <br /> <br /> It's an interesting story like noir movies. A good program in Noir's field. Directed by Preminger and played beautifully by Andrew and Tierney.
