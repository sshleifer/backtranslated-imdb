It's easy and also very good. I think that the feeling of separation of sex in a society that is bitter is very delicate. It has a bitter hummer in it. The fact that most actors are not professionals makes the movie more tangible and realistic. There are "documentaries" in the movie as well. The best scene is the scene where all girls are banned from watching, listening enthusiastically to the soldiers who should watch them and broadcast the game. If you are a familiar Iranian and dancing on the streets after winning games, you will be proud of the nation !! If you're not an Iranian, you'll still love it!
