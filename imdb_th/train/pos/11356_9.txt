This is a great movie. It's about many things: hunting down serial killers, Soviet Russian bureaucracy, driving a man and the relationship between this man (lead detective) and his boss. <br /> <br /> What The most attached to me is the relationship between Durokov (Rea) and Fetisov (Sutherland) (excuse the bad spell, please!) For some reason it is moving to see their evolution from hatred. The offense becomes respect and intimacy and works together. One line in the movie summarizes it for me: "He will say something witty. But he was overcome with emotion. "<br /> <br /> A great performance from every actor, even the smallest piece of faith. <br /> <br /> This is not an action movie. Action style In fact, it sometimes moves like a slow drama, but it's worth it. It's very satisfying and not exploiting crime. <br /> <br />
