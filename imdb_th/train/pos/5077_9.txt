Indian cinemas classify two types of police: they are honest or bad people. Honest people often shout at their voices and fight with the system, while bad police enjoy the majority. But have to suffer at the end. <br /> <br /> The film breaks this formula at least. Of the police and their lives The direction will look at the life of an ambitious young cop. Interesting songs and editing determine the trend as far as Indian cinemas continue. <br /> <br /> The movie is sometimes slow and the problems that Anbu faces when Maya are sometimes overlooked But I will still give this 9/10 just because it has credit for the first time.
