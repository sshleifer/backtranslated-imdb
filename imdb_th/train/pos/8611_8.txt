I really enjoyed watching this movie. I taped while watching so I could check later. I enjoy watching the second time more because I can get a clever dialogue between Natalie and Adam, who are the two main characters. I think that the way this story developed is a very provocative idea. I was intrigued by how Natalie would interact with her daughter's friends. At first it seemed that she was talking about a lot of hate. But when she began to interact more, I had to see how this visit would happen. I'm not disappointed The little secret that Sara kept from her mother began to reveal an incomplete daughter, a human being with a flaw, like most of us who wanted freedom from an overwhelming mother who thought she knew a daughter yours Unfortunately to learn The painful traits that sometimes love the people you need to give them are free. The audience attached to this movie until the end saw an impressive performance from Diane Keaton. (Always an excellent audience, even in very little accepted movies about Town and Country thinking) The final scene of driving home Diane Keaton is worth looking forward to revealing. That everyone who loves another man must learn that we must use our own lives, we love others But did not own and ultimately went. It was a difficult lesson But it's worth it to ponder now. Thank you CBS for this broadcast. It's worth the long wait.
