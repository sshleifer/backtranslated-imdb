The reason I say this is because I wrote a screenplay and knew a little about creating until I was asked to watch a movie. I write for some manufacturers that sell it without telling me. Because Alan was my friend, I heard this. I just wrote the first draft, so I was very concerned when I heard that it was on the floor. I asked Peter Collinson through my agent, whether he wanted me to do another body. I also asked if I can see my original script or not because I lost it. I was told too late So I do the only thing I can do under the circumstances and remove my name. I don't know what they might do with my screenplay. Then I was invited to watch the finished movie. I was very impressed that I asked to put my name quickly. It is a beautifully crafted work from the first draft that was written in a hurry. I expect to be asked to do many more things with it. Maybe if I had it, it wouldn't be good. I like to see my original script again if anyone knows where it is? I like to watch movies again. I only saw once in a small theater in Soho.
