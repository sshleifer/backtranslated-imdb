I fell in love with this action drama drama Kurt Russell and Kurt Russell, the only one who can play this game well. Raising the level from childhood, knowing nothing but war and fighting. Todd (Kurtzell) was dropped on this planet after being genetically engineered by an old soldier Gibson, not Jason Statham - Kurt Russell owns this role and makes it all his original, brave and human too. I miss the fact that I never had a sequel. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> - The world <br /> <br /> _________ <br /> <br /> My faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
