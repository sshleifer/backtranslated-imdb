I saw this film at the college film festival in the 70s - I waited a long time that this movie will come out in the video. (Finally going out) It was created in Brazil, so I assumed why it was not done yet. I have checked the video store for over 15 years and are waiting for a movie that stands out! It was one of my all-time favorites - but was warned that it was strange, like Werner Herzog. Strangely - the strangeness of it arises from the realism. <br /> <br /> This film was created from the event Actually back A few centuries ago, in the pre-colonial era, when Europeans first confronted the Amazon tribes A white man was mistaken for a savage human tribe as an enemy, so they intended to kill him. Before they kill him, they make him part of their tribe. All movies are like watching the National Geographic documentary when he becomes a member that has been accepted by their tribe. Do not understand deeply the diversity of human life? Of course, <br /> <br /> Oh yes ... be warned ... This movie has an exact nudity - this is not one of Hollywood's movies that are flicked about the noble barbarian. .. This movie says it's the same. (Read again above: National Geographic, super-realism) <br /> <br />
