Since the death of Siskel and the lack of Ebert, the show was left in the hands of Richard Roeper. Roeper was not a film critic. He just criticized what he didn't like personally, such as movies with country music, pan-pan. "I don't like country music!" And children's movies will be standard. "Do not watch now, wait until it comes out on DVD and rent it for children!" Roeper may be an idiotic philosopher, but in some branches, weekly guests 'sit in' for Ebert. up But who wants to choose daisies among the cattle? All of the above, it is the only item in the city and only makes it worthwhile to watch. For Roger Ebert, if Stephen Hawking can speak, you can do it! It is your thoughts and thoughts that we desire. Do everything necessary for the people to take the throne to declare themselves.
