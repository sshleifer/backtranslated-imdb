Now this is what the family movie should be! There are movies a few years ago that are targeted at families or children that are really valuable to their viewing; But this is one of them My whole family comes from movies, awed, entertained, dazzled and happy. We still refer to the little snippets from here and there. Children like it and we do as well. (Hubby with me is 36 and 32 respectively)! <br /> <br /> In addition to the beautiful and distinctive animation, the characters (little and imaginative as they are) are well developed. There is no one that you can't care about. The personality that brought these small creatures to life has been molded by sound talent combined with the skills and art of Disney's best animations. This is a movie worthy of Walt Disney itself. I think Mr. Disney will fully consent to this movie ... Flick Dot and a group of friends in their little heroes may become popular, like Mickey and Minnie in our era. <br /> <br /> Leave the theater and want to see again .. and buy to own in a video or DVD. I'm eager to see it again .. to get what I might miss the first time. (I have never seen my children identify and embrace the characters quickly and vividly before ... My daughter still talks about "little" points. <br /> <br /> Movies This story is fun, funny, warm and intelligent. Fun for the whole family!
