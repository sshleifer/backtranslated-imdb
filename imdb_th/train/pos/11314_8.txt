Wow! The type of movie you can watch ten times and still be satisfied with its differences. Absolutely incredible! If this was a debut movie of Visconti, I had to think about what would happen if he got better from one movie to another. Another thing that he had seen (when writing) was Death in Venice - which was absolutely incredible: the glistening eyes that were more than Ossessione (Obsession), one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. But the story is not related to Ossessione. If you click "Miscellaneous" in the link of this page, there are still images from the movies on those websites. They are not fair to the experience of this movie: elegant camera movements such as beautiful elements, wonderful faces, such great characters, the development of great stories, the first film adapted from The Postman Always Rings James M Cain's two times "<br /> <br /> I can't believe that this happened in 43, eight years before Brando would introduce realistic performances to the world with Stre. etcar Named Desire (1951). Actors on this subject may not use the technique, that is, they may not really feel everything. (I don't know anything about it) - But they are the best, most realistic and realistic actors to date. In the cinema Eight years before the Streetcar Named Desire tram will give a new feeling on the screen. Ossessione is spectacular with excitement! The most sensational thing since the beginning of the cinema! Yes, I am a wonderful person, but the great Ossessione. <br /> <br /> The reason that Ossessione does not affect Streetcar is that it was created in Italian fascism and banned by Mussolini and cut in America. The Americans did not see the full reputation until 59, eight years after Streetcar. <br /> <br /> I will not say anything about it anymore - just write to tell you that it is one of the best, beautiful and amazing. Wake up the most The movie I've seen and told you to watch! Like other reviewers, I'll buy as soon as I can!
