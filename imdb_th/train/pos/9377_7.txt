A thrilling thriller that has more than two twists and turns. An excellent actor combined with an interesting plot, supervised by the influential Twin Peaks-ish in director Dahl. Nicholas Cage is a very low-performing actor and shows a wonderful picture of a man looking for the right thing to do JT Walsh (RIP to the great actor) Is often a great villain, like Dennis Hopper It's a shame that he has never done on a higher profile in business. I'm sure he has his followers. Overall, this is a great movie that shows you that you don't have to use a large treble or movie soundtrack to perform as an entertainment movie.
