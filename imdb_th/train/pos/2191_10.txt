Shakespeare said that we were actors who entered the big stage. But when this phase was Israel, the work that we interpreted dozens and all of the actions that we did was filled with difficult styles. Dan Katzir managed to take a picture of a part of life in Tel Aviv. And this person who is far from the famous person they speak to us from the heart. Katzir's movie helps Israel escape from the darkness of the information they live in A wonderful country this is happening as light as a bird, which caused his ashes. It is great for me because of the reality of the State of Israel, which Europeans only know the record or newspaper, appearing to be the truth of humanity that is closer and perfect to the truth of millions of people looking for places of He explores all All cultural states with the sole purpose of being a part of it. Katzir created a great documentary film, and he showed that when one of the movies of men with passion, the deepest feelings were projected by force and These feelings pass through our hearts. Thank you Dan, who opened our eyes and gave one of the most beautiful images of the most wonderful countries in the world.
