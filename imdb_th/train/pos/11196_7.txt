Jack Saunders 'One-Round' was so called because he was a carnival fighter who fought with a man in the audience. If they can pass one round, they win a prize - a popular way to attract customers to travel, showing long ago. Jack falls in love with the ticket seller, Mabel, although her head turns quickly when Bob Corby comes into the ring to try his chance with Jack. What nobody knows in the fight is Bob's champion, so he can beat Jack even if it takes some time. As a result, Bob asked Jack to become his partner and quit the carnival circuit. Later, Jack developed himself to become a legitimate fighter. Slowly he climbed up the ranks until he was ready to join the competition. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the champion and Mabel started running behind Jack - even though Mabel is married So, when the final battle took place between Jack and Bob, it was very personal and Jack was ready to kill him. Is he good enough? Will Bob's anger increase reasonably or hinder his performance? Adjust and watch <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and at the moment this movie looks strange for the director known in the mysterious movie in the 1920s. Hitchcock has no fixed lines. He directed or wrote (He did it both for this film) In fact, in many ways, this film is indicative of Hitchcock's silent style because a similar plot takes place in one of his next silhouettes, THE MANXMAN ( Starring Carl Brisson as the wrong husband) So while this seems to be like a normal boxing movie of the day But it didn't make this superintendent have to leave the country even when it ended with a good formula Stupid Although far from perfect silence, it is worth seeing and stuffed with fists.
