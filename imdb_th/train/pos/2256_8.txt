Do not know what will happen from the partner & friend / trainer of Van Damme and his combat coach for most of his films. It was good to see him acting as "TONG PO" in "Kickboxer and other Van Damme movies. He is now his own. He and his wife create a great team. This time, Qissi is the director. act Well, really means that his wife is a writer, producer and most of the scenes that do not require action. She also works well in movie editing. They work great. They do very well. Well resolved, the actors are real fighters and look good together - the story comes together and if you can believe ... no bad language, no sex, just a new act with me, try it! !!
