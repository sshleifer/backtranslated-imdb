Hedy Lamarr recently married an old man and in a honeymoon, she knew that her husband didn't want her. Her disappointment with the marriage and privacy of love led Eva back to her father's house on the farm, leaving her husband. One afternoon while bathing in the lake, her horse escaped with her clothes and young workers discovered and let them return to Eva. They fall in love and become lovers. Later, her husband missed her and tried to let Eva go home. Eva refused and fate led the trio to the same place, ended the story in a sad way. I just watched "Extase" for the first time and the first words I related to the horrific quality of the VHS published in Brazil Brazil's video distribution network: The movie takes only 75 minutes and it looks like It is used in different film rolls. There are some parts that are totally damaged and the other parts are very damaged, so the beauty of the image that Brazilian viewers cannot do if they have the opportunity to find this rare VHS in renting or selling. This movie is really silent. This story is very outdated and only a few lines. So the character is poorly developed However, this film is very brave by touching the beautiful breasts Hedy Lamarr and naked fat bodies for today's aesthetic standards. Another amazing point is the use of poems and metaphors of flowers as a symbol of sexual intercourse between Eva and her lover. The way the director manages the scene to show Eva's needs and privacy is very clear. The end of the conclusion is not unusual for the 1933 movie. I like this movie. But I hope someday I have the opportunity to see the recovered version 87 minutes. My score is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "ÃŠxtase" ("Ecstasy")
