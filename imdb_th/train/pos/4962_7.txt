"The Brak Show" is good, not likely to be in the same level as "Aqua Teen Hunger" or "Space Ghost Coast to Coast", but of course it has many wonderful moments. Basically, it follows the life of Zorak and Brak at Normal life And go to school, live in a neighborhood in the style of sitcoms, where 50 humor and animation of this show is very much "Aqua Teen Hunger" (and in one episode you can see Meatwad) with strange situations and Strange characters, but it's a joke. Some of the songs are great, but not many other songs, but I like this show. The most fun character is Brak's father (that is, no man knows why).
