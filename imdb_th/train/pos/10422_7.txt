Of course Mario Landa is "The Great Caruso" in this 1951 film starring Ann Blyt, Dorothy Kristen, Eduard Franz and Ludwig Dona. This is a highly fictional biography of a world-famous legendary tenor whose name is known to this day. <br /> <br /> This film has been elaborately produced and instrumental and glorious. Magnificently, Blanche Thebom and opera actors The title that appears in the film. If you are a purist, seeing people on the stage smiling during the sextet from "Lucia" will make you bizarre - even though Dorothy, Caruso's wife, will have girls. It is also very difficult that Caruso will sing Edgardo in Lucia; The role is too high for him. <br /> <br /> In order to get a lot of licenses, the script makes the part of Caruso life amazing. The amazing thing about him is that he has created roles in soap operas which are currently in standard musicals. But this thing was never mentioned in the movie. These roles include Maurizio in Adriana Lecouvreur and Dick Johnson in "Girl of the Golden West". There is a famous picture of him resting on a piece of paper wrapped around him like a robe. The reason for taking that picture? His only shirt was in the laundry room. He is one of the pioneers in music recording and is a long-time partner with Victor Talking-Machine Company (later RCA Victor). He sings Jose in Carmen in San Francisco on the night of the earthquake. <br /> <br /> Instead of MGM's story, he died on the stage during Martha's performance that never happened. He had bleeding during "L'Elizier d'Esta", which was found and unable to complete the show; He sang at the Met three times only. His last role was Eleazar in La Juive. What killed him? The same thing that killed Valentino - peritonitis. His first role was not Radames in Aida, as stated in the movie, but Duke in Rigoletto, so when speaking on the screen "Introduced by Dorothy Caruso's biography about her husband" That's what it is - suggesting what is true is Dorothy's father denied her after her marriage and left her $ 1 from the land. His great They also have Gloria's daughter together. (Those who died at the age of 79 on 10/7/2007) However, Caruso had four children by a woman before he married Dorothy. <br /> <br /> Some people say that the voice. Lanza's amazing as Caruso But just listening to Caruso singing in the movie "Match Point" - Caruso. The sound is very different from Lanza. In reality, from his voice, if he wants, Caruso can sing baritone. He thought that there would be a problem with a high note, further evidence of a baritone leaning; And the role that he was preparing for when he died was Othello. The amazing role that Lanza did, of course. Lanza's voice should not be compared to other sounds. He has a unique contribution in film history, making opera music popular. He sang in "The Great Caruso" with strong power; He is truly here at the peak of what will be a short career. His performances are natural and genuine. Ann Blyth is cute like Dorothy and sings a little. <br /> <br /> Actually, movies for opera lovers and fans of Lanza may be The same one
