I have read most of the comments in this movie. I saw this movie (And all prophecy sets) many times with family members of all ages, we are all fun and it makes us meditate on what we know from reading No one is afraid or traumatized as I read in some posts. This film is based on biblical facts. I saw the movie ending "Tribulation", "Armagedon" and many more. This film is one of the best films in presenting Bible truths. It may not have many great special effects, such as current movies. But I believe it is a good tool to witness The movie and the predictive set of this story can be viewed for free on our website, which is higher than Prapra.com and judge for yourself all blessings
