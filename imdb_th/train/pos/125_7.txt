Lars Von Trier has never lagged behind in experimenting with new techniques. Some of them are very original, while others are best forgotten. <br /> <br /> He showed that Germany's war after the train journey At night, Leo Kessler, an American of German descent, who has a lot of ruins in the city, needs to be rescued. It is not an easy job that he quickly discovered. <br /> <br /> His uncle found that he was working as a controller of the Zentropa line. His duty was to take care of the needs of passengers. When the shoe scratches the chalk mark on the floor A horrific dispute arose when the passenger's shoes were not brushed. There is a reference to the German mania that adheres to this stupid detail. <br /> <br /> The journey by train is like a symbol of human life, with all trials and tribulations. In one sequence, Leo rushed through the rear luggage cabinet to discover them filled with dead bodies that seemed to have just escaped from Auschwitz. These horrible images, like being in a dream, each picture has its own bad impact. <br /> <br /> At one station, Urmitz Leo jumped from the train and blown the parcel. In the view of many standing people, he connected the bomb to the bottom of the carriage. He returned to his cabin and connected to the time clock. After that he jumped out of the train. (At high speed) and lying on a cool grass on the river bank When looking at the star above, he decided that his job was to create and not destroy. Later, when he saw a train near a large bridge, he ran with braking speed to get on the train and stop the clock. If you are interested in analyzing the situation, it is a completely impossible task. Quite ridiculous in reality It may happen in a dream. <br /> <br /> It's strange that one person remembers the small details, such as the row of cups hanging on the hook and shaking off with the train. <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this film has been widely accepted But I like Lars Von Trier's next movie (Breaking the Waves and The Idiots). Maybe I'm a realist.
