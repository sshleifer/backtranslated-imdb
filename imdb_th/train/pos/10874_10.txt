<br /> <br /> I have to admit, I expect to have something different from my first look last night, 'Cut', even though I am happy with the unexpected horror of Australia. I am a really scary fan like real, and they find that "Cut" not only is Australia's best genre. But it's also one of the great parody / comedy movies. <br /> <br /> My only concern is that the main audience can't choose many funny elements - this movie isn't very smart in the app. Application But makes me laugh every turn that tries to adapt to the possible horror genre I'm sure this is a joke and hope this will be a joke. <br /> <br /> And of course there is blood. <br /> <br /> The use of 'custom' scissors in the garden is Bright meaning - in addition to the expected thrust and slash In short, there is a lot of variety and creativity in death that is serious enough to make the film's suspicions worthy to make her satisfied. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Kylie Minogue both The pair and Molly Ringwald are another reason to watch the movie - both performances are as good as Simon Bossell ('The Castle') in a great role as a jokey technician. <br /> <br /> All In all things I Think of this film as one of the best horror products of the couple or years, as well as the mockery / beautiful parody - toungue-in-cheek At the end of the story <br /> <br /> Love it!
