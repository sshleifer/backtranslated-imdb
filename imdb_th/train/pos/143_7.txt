Riget II is a good sequel. But not as good as the first part This series seems not as serious as the first series. There are many jokes in this story. Good things. Although <br /> <br /> We come back to the Danish State Hospital. Rigshospitalet National Hospital of Denmark Mrs. Drus is leaving the hospital when the job is finished. But fate needs something else Soon she is chasing ghosts and Helmer is making everyone angry and soon it gets worse because the black power is released into the kingdom. <br /> <br /> This story is related. With more comedies All of that was very fun. But it makes you serious with fewer series The story retains many elements from the latest series and adds new elements. It is well written But some new elements are stupid But they help it by making it look funny than good but not good, original and exciting stories as the first series. <br /> <br /> The actors are the same as adding regular actors. They are all very good. It is strange and setting. Some parts have all strange performances and the characters change during the show, so to be serious and make it real is not easy. But these actors deal with the whole situation completely. <br /> <br /> The good qualities of the first series remain the same. Movies are one of those qualities. A mobile camera that makes Trier famous all over the world for doubt and truth to the series. It gives the camera a unique ability to move and track characters and testers take advantage of these abilities. Well, excellent lightning movement and good composition and editing make it fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Be prepared to see better results in this sequel in the first section. Also preparing to see something more I don't think green things look too good. Think that it is not original and inappropriate The ghost effect is really good. Non-digital results also look good. The little brother looks really strange. But you accept it I can say that the effect is from good to good. <br /> <br /> The song is quite good. Good mood and good Some parts can actually touch It really fits well. As the first person to have quite a few songs in action scenes and work well, <br /> <br /> All of this makes a good sequel. If you see Riget you can see this without disappointed It has many features like the first series. However, I recommend watching the first set before seeing this. Both of these make up a set that you don't want to miss.
