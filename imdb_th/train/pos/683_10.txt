I like ghost stories A good ghost story of night-time shocks. Unexplained sounds. Now I see many of them. As an extra efx that has taken a greater hold in today's movies, sometimes to find real gems, you have to turn the clock back when writers and directors have to use their heads to create really good ghost stories Now, the pilot story is very rare. Now for the television series The Ghost, "New House" is one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen. It used to be one time in 1972 ... I was only 9 years old .. but nothing comparable to it. With all the remarks made in Hollywood, some people should do this "as is" without efx, rather than the original. Now creepy like hell I was fortunate to find it on DVDs today, and it's rare and very rare. The other two similar ghosts are "The Haunting" and George C. Scott. Like this
