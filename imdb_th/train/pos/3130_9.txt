I am a Belgian and grew up in the sixties. Most American series are shown here. (Original language with subtitles) and Batman is one of the first people that I'm enthusiastic. Unfortunately this makes it "Fearless hysteria" among mothers because Batman is considered too violent. Geez compares the innocence of that series with the shit children who have seen today. Therefore, since mothers who protect themselves from the 60s, I have the opportunity to see only two or three episodes! I was very frustrated. I started collecting comic books and bubble cards. (Also get it!) To compensate. I also have a slide Master View ... I have a desire to watch the crusade. Every child needs some kind of hero. <br /> <br /> Many years later, I finally get the chance to see a comeback as a teenager and I really enjoy it. The show on the tongue cheek will help me to escape when I watch as a child. But I understand when I am 17 years old. Yes, I have watched them all now and have a kind heart in the internet post Episode because they have not released the series on DVD (my knowledge) <br /> <br /> This evening I like "Return to the bat cave" ... It was a pleasure to watch because of it. Full of trivia And internal jokes Seeing Adam and Burt is a delightful thing, and this TV movie is great in every area. They play by themselves while playing the role in the series. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to those who create this great "celebration" ... I'll watch again. My advice for all Batman fans is: watch it !!! Rent now !!! Borrow from friends !!! Buy it !!! I never expected myself to rate this thing on the 9/10 ... Well done!
