After Dark My Sweet is a modern noir character and is full of dirty characters, dirt roads and sweaty characters. It seems that most of the truly wonderful noirs of the last two or three decades have occurred in the south where men shine and women um, shine with why? Because it is hooooottttttttttttt And because everyone looks better than wet (At least men do - women with sweating makes me damp) <br /> <br /> Next - there may be spoilers here. <br /> <br /> This movie is an example. The greatness of everything that Noir should do - walking continuously (Although some people with unusual interests are called 'slow'), characters that draw out clearly and broadly the atmosphere, if there is anything about emotions and attitudes. That is the reason why good people are not marked by the original definition of 'excellent' performances (see Bogart, Mitcham, Hurt and Nicholson - they (and their characters) are all But it's real - but they have style That movie is what you want) or a quick adventure (again, all the great noirs seem to burn slowly like cigarettes). Noirs are excellent, creating an environment and you just live with the characters for a couple of hours. <br /> <br /> After Dark My Sweet lets you do that - and let you enjoy interesting and complex characters. Uncle Bud and Colly are passionate - not letting the audience know what makes them tick - and Patric and Dern (I like Bruce Dern by the way). Dern is perfect, especially (see previous comments). The basic form of the character and gives us depth and compassion. <br /> <br /> The story is interesting as well. There are better plans in the world of Noir. (Barely any mystery here - most of it is suspense) but this one is solid If there is anything, the plot of 'Okay' is simple. It relates to Jim Thompson's writing more than anything else, with Thompson almost converted. He escaped Hammett and Chandler's chaotic story for a simple story with a stronger and more confusing character. See a novel like The Killer Inside Me. You will see immediately (from the name). Everything about When talking about Thompson, it's not about it. It's about it. (To refer to Roger Ebert) So the plot of a kidnapping that is relatively simple is not an issue and if you don't like it, it's a joke for you. <br /> <br /> Why is this 8star movie instead of 10star? Because the woman is the leader She is not bad, but she is not Angelica Huston or Anette Benning (see the adaptations of Jim Thompson's The Grifters. If you don't know what I'm talking about, this is a better movie - the best thing of the year. 1990 and the Blood Simple challenge for the best name since Chinatown) She didn't chop (or watch that) and even though she and Patric have chemistry But I didn't do anything to her So there
