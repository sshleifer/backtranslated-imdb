The first time I arrived, I just heard it. I listened to all the comedy and never laughed in my life. Eddie's ability to draw hilarious pictures in our hearts and the wonderful imitations is attractive. Finally, when I saw him doing this, I had to have it. Eddie Murphy's performance, Delirious, showed his genius! By being a new millennium, his actions in 1983 were a joke today. My parents like being a teenager and I (eighteen) love it as well. From that point on, I had to watch Murphy's other films such as Coming To America and Harlem Nights. There would be no other comedian like Eddie.
