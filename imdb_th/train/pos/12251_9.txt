I take a moment to see this model because I can't rent it in a video store. But is another version But I love it I always keep in touch with other Emma people. Gwenneth and Toni Collette Since they are not natural British people have to wear accents and for me it doesn't look natural. It seems like I'm sorry, but don't think that Tony and Gwen Nath have done a great job there. I can't give warmth to any characters, but this model has more warmth and the type of person I think Emma is. Of course, this is the version that I will come back from now. I was disappointed that Mr Knightley didn't look better, but he believed I liked Jane Fairfax more (played by Olivia Williams). I never warmed to her in the movie version. But she showed better in this version. Think about it (other than Mr Knightley). Every character plays better and more superior. Unfortunately both of them came out at the same time and the Paltrow version was published more pity ...... I still love the new scene at the end. Well done with Kate Beckingsale! So if you're a fan of Jane Austen, don't forget to watch this fan.
