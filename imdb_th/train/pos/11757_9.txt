Robin Williams and Kirk Russell played during the age of 30 years which made marraiges in danger by making decisions. Williams is ok. But Russell is the best player as quarterback Taft, Remo Hightower Holly Palance, doing good and interesting as Williams' wife, who can live without this competition. Movies are worth watching just to see the famous Remo in action. Highly recommended
