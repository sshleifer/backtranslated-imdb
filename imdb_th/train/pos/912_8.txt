This film brings back memories from the classical theater of the past, in which actors do not need to take off their clothes for the audience to watch movies. <br /> <br /> At first I thought the main advantages of this movie. Is The amazing chemistry between Shahid and Amrita is definitely making movies. <br /> <br /> I saw many comments about this film that was very sweet and weak. In response to this, I think that to a certain extent, this is the correct analysis. But considering that this is a Barjatya movie that I think compared to MPK, HAHK, HSSH and MPKDH, it has been greatly reduced. HSSH is hardly able to watch in some places. <br /> <br /> In this film But when the sentimental moment arrives, you find yourself smiling, wanting to bless the best couple and hope that nothing bad happens to them. <br /> <br /> Another important plus point is acting. Shahid and Amrita both performed very well, especially Shahid, which looks good in the movie Amrita. It looks amazing and should be considered seriously as a major star in the future. <br /> <br /> Although I enjoy the movie by Total But I felt it was too long Some parts of the center may be cut off and may cause more impact. I still think that music, even if it's suitable for this movie, when you see the situation is a bit outdated and the movie might benefit if there is a more current soundtrack. Although the images of the Mujhe Haq Hain and Hamari Shaadi Mein songs are excellent, <br /> <br /> All of this, I would like to introduce this movie in a romantic manner, look beautiful and have a great climax (I won't go) in detail In case you didn't see <br /> <br /> PS if you tend to cry - take a tissue!
