The third and final part of "Hanzo the Razor" is the most concrete of all of them. "Training", although completed within the first five minutes of the movie Not for everyone, this film details Hanzo's investigation of shark lending that is carried out by the orders of blind monks. It also gives a historical comment on the proud rejection of the old Japanese that will incorporate Western technology.

Hanzo still has a lot of sex and there is no need for blood and violence (it * is * Hanzo Razor).
