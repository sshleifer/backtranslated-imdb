Henry Fool is a better movie But this is the perfect way to track movies, such as 'Henry Fool'. Henry is very serious, 'lying' and his mysterious aura. Even the opening shot of 'Henry Fool' when Simon put his ear to the ground as Henry walked over the hill more clearly through 'Fay Grim', a popular joke that is a very funny meta-jokes. Or little (about writing movies and jokes by yourself) is a good story But the release of this film is a little saturated. In addition, using the Dutch corner of Hartley in this movie is a shaking story. Yes, it's intentions. But it felt forced and used to go too far to vibrate what I wanted to call annoying It's a defective movie. But have to see if Hartley's fans or 'Henry Fool' <br /> <br /> and don't listen to stupid criticism. Don't watch this story until you see the first movie. The ridicule and flair of this movie will end if you don't see Henry Fool. It's a sequel. That is just a mute
