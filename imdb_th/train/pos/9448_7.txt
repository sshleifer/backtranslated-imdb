This is the most annoying movie I've ever seen. The first part of this film is strange. But with quality and amusing The journey begins with peace, detail, and emphasizes the beauty of the hills of Appalachia, but that makes it misleading beyond belief. Obvious social problems (Breeding) and irregularities of rural residents are just the first issues that are annoying to the movie. I can still hear Bobby moaning in pain and I tremble when I think of it. Lewis's legs made me startled. Even so, while the film was overall very troubling and intimidating But there are interesting questions When is morality or right in the life of another person? In some cases, morality driven us to do or not to do in some cases? Is dignity and morality more important than life? Regardless of the conclusion that may be drawn from this film, it is a success in its own right.
