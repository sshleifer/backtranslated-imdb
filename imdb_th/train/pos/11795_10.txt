I will never forget this movie or the event that led to Jonestown in Guyana. It seems very sad, but I have to tell Powers Boothe to perform as the leader of Jim Jones's income. It will make him win an Academy Award easily if it is released in the cinema. Is a mini-series that you won't forget You will not forget the image of cruelty, control and domination of religious leaders. His rise and fall and the threat from the outside world to destroy what he thought was heaven The massive suicide was so scary that it was almost impossible for anyone to imagine why so many people (900+) gave up. They didn't create these mini series anymore, which we left. Without having to open the mouth and hungry and know what happened to others
