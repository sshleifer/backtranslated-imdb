Who can buy this movie? My uncle "Hutch" is a true pilot (not a reel) that sees his wing throwing in the air and captures them with his fist as he is awarded his pilot's wings. <br /> <br /> He is on the screen for a few seconds. But my family likes to have movies He was killed in a dogfight over Italy. He was only 24. When we know the movie studio that created it, <br /> <br /> Or have anyone ever seen in a video store like Blockbuster? I hope they will make all these old movie catalogs because it's very cheap to produce DVDs today. <br /> <br /> Please email me at nfny40@yahoo.com If you know where I can buy, thank you.
