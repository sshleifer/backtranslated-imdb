There are no action scenes other than the SWAT commando reaction. Nearly a teenager after shooting a high school killer. The film has three protagonists; The detective investigates a crime that is not guilty of being released, punished, and two teenage girls survived the episode played by Erica Christensen, a young age, and Philipi is busy. <br /> <br /> The filming was combined because of it and the drama ended. <br /> <br /> Erica Christensen, although only 24 people are around the block until the movie audience is familiar with the style Stable performance The busy Philips, which is older than Christensen, for three years and doesn't know me, so I blown me with her strength and appearance.
