I read bad stories about this movie, so I prepared for the worst "confusion. Scary structure." While there may be some merit with these allegations, this movie is nowhere near. Scary like your typical DVD programmer. In fact, it has inspiration. It tries to do something other than general nonsense / slasher, and by God there are interesting things to happen. <br /> <br /> Miss Barbeau is a miracle to see. She carried this film on her shoulders. <br /> <br /> This doesn't say it's a masterpiece. Finally collapsing under the weight of his own ambitions There are too many sub-plans. (Not explained) trying to live together And the plot of the plot caused by travel across that time was never truly mentioned. For example, if Hope knew that her mother was evil and she would eventually kill her brother It seems that it will overcome hell from the future journey to do it. <br /> <br /> Still, I don't give the same points for a try. A little ambition is not a bad thing.
