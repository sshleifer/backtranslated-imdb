"Party Girl" takes advantage of the great charm of Parker Posey. In fact, sometimes this movie looks like a vehicle that Mr. Posey has been allowed to play on as she usually lives in real life. br /> <br /> The movie, directed by Daisy Von Scherler Mayer, is a treatment for fans of Ms. Posey. Ms. Von Scherler Mayer takes us to a forest trip in Lower Manhattan to show us the spirit that Pointless Whit is devoted to the fun of the clubs that she uses regularly. This is an era that is still more innocent than that area and the adjacent meat market. At least there is no excuse in the movie and we see people down to earth in the normal life. If we can call it that way, <br /> <br /> Parker Posey makes Mary amazing. It's because Parker. Posey, we enjoy the movie more if other actors will play Mary. She is the whole picture. The remaining actors are good.
