As a Pokemon fan, I like this movie very much. It introduces new legendary Pok√©mon. (Like in each movie) and add depth to the relationship between the characters However, I do not expect that non-Pokemon fans will enjoy it. (Including most adults), some lines are repetitive But may be unavoidable when making movies in English The animation is beautiful, even though there are two parts that look bad. And even though the villain is a repetitive person, I think this movie is very good in cycling through various types of villains and I guarantee that they are not the same. People who don't like me talking to themselves, but Pokemon fans will love it.
