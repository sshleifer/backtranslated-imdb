This film has been approved by me. Scenes in the museum require performances without discussion. This is one of the most interesting and unique scenes in the history of the movie. Kate Dickinson's characters are well developed and her performances can be felt throughout the movie. The best work that Angie Dickinson has done since Point Blank!
