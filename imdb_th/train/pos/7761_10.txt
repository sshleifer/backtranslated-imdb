*** Spoiler *** *** Spoiler *** Launched in 1956 and considered quite lively at that time, Douglas Sirk above the drama, candy color, leading color is still a great thing. The story deals with the incomplete Texas oil family behavior, including Kyle, the big brother, the unstable, weak, wounded and alcoholic. Performed by Robert Stack in an impressive and terrifying performance, and his sister Marylee plays. In the extreme Characterized by Dorothy Malone, the performance of Ms. Malone sent a telegram to her through her eyes, which she used to express her emotions, mostly consisting of sexual desire (for Rock Hudson) and jealousy (for Lauren Bacall) Malone is the only actress I have ever seen in movies that entered the room before. Now, don't understand me wrong, her performance is to say that at least it is a complete hoot and one of the best performances of the 1950s, but it's scary because Malone is amazing. Satisfied and attractive, she is not a very good performer and she is not able to be smart or shiny. Her performance is one note. She will do evil, Mambo, and in a wonderful cut, while the father who does not love playing by Robert Keith is always good to his death. Climb up the stairs, Sirk mixed with Malone, almost crazy doing orgasmic dances while Where she undresses the stack (who should have won an Academy Award) & Malone (the winner of the award, but should not have) is the true star of the film, who creates all the hysteria, both sexually and others while "True stars" of Hudson and Baal's fades away in gray and brown, which is the color they were used as the main actors. Hudson, who is a better actor, has been credited for playing in his childhood Stack's best friend Love the interest of Malone, who moans & rock through rock through most movies. But Hudson didn't want to part of her and loved Bac, who married the stack instead. No one is very happy & no one is happy for a long time. Stack-Bacal's marriage broke a big time after one year and the stack drank a lot because he thought he was barren and unable to give the baby to prove that he was a Sirk man. A very intelligent person with a long and fascinating career in both movies and theater in Germany ended his Hollywood career at Universal in the mid-1950s with a full set of "women" movies or Melodramas. Not colorful Although they were adapted from drugs or garbage sources, but in the hands of Sirk, they became masterpieces of the Sirk genre. There was a great sense of color and design that he played in these films filled. With the space on his wide screen, along with the characters that express their emotional life amid the color combination and strange light, giving the shadow and reflection belief in the "write" character Will emerge outside the window, listen at the door, or sneak around. So, finally, after the violence, the accidental murder, abortion and more The suit is suitable for a man sitting at the desk.
