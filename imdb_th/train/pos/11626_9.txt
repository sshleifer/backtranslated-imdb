This is a great and fast thriller by Nightmare on Elm Street, which takes 85 minutes, leaving the supernatural and presenting something more terrifying to us. We are more likely to meet the ruthless Jackson Rippner than Freddy Kruger and Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins). It is a great job to present a friendly and charming killer. McAdams (Claire from The Wedding Crashers) is great. Most movies occur at a very close level between two people, their eyes and their faces. It is a small level of action, not a sweep of a wide canvas, and there are no limitations that are interesting for these things. Film filming is nothing special. But of course we can do a lot with the camera in the scope of the passenger plane. But the conversation was excellent No distractions, no subplots, confusing the problem, which is the heart of the fight between the main characters. By focusing and avoiding distractions, Weskraven was able to plan the smallest and transformed into a thrilling action movie.
