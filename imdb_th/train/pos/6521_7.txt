In the context of the time that I made, I found that this movie has value. While the details may be 'dramatic', the overall history is a good primer. In addition, I found an actor who remembered that I was really happy. Who would imagine that Ben Cartwright was a coward? I will leave the remaining stars for you. For the casting of this film (As expected from movies created in the late thirties) has many fun character actors The perfect touch of comedy Shoot well with beautiful boats and talented performances. I would like to recommend this for everyone who has a taste in a small camp or looking for a two-time piece at the American dawn The names and actors of popular characters are happy to enjoy.
