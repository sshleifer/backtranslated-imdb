Another reason to watch this film is Florence Rice, Florence, who is my first reaction while the credits run on the screen. I soon discovered that Florence Rice was a true beauty that changed in a great performance. As they did in this work from 1939 is a different time But there is charm It leads you to another world. It started out as a light comedian, but then was very serious. Florence Rice gave the music from the comedian to the protagonist. She is absolutely happy, while at the same time being strong and fragile that has evolved from women and women. See her facial expression at the end of the movie. She made four movies, and I went to find thirty-nine people. Alan Marshal is a Flynn / Gable mode and proves the perfect match for Florence. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel give a wonderful cartoon moment But the true star is Florence Rice, a movie fan 30/40. Don't miss this movie!
