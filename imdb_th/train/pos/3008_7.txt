William Powell who never gave up He is happy to watch on the screen as he walks through the situation without being interested in this world. It seems that he is always at the top of the game and shows little interest for everyone who suspects him. Murder is a hardly human project. I noticed that this was the core of the investigation. In addition to the occasional widowed crying, the victims also act as the reason why the movie actually exists. Nothing more There is enough twist and rotation to make things interesting all the way, and Powell is an expert. There are many political inaccuracies, especially those related to Asian actors. This is a little difficult to accept. The performers are excellent and the direction of Curtiz is also a consistent asset.
