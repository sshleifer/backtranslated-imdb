This movie is a great movie. You don't have to wait for a laugh for more than a minute and there's more to happen than the first episode of the movie. Throughout it, there was a mockery of the local schmaltzy - man-made-good-overcoming-type of misery which mocked this. Don't let anyone tell you that they're trying to laugh properly by using profanity - of course, there are lots of content. But as a whole context is not free I love this movie and it costs me just Â£ 2.99 for a DVD. So in terms of entertainment that is worth the money, it's the best movie I've seen this year.
