How to lose friends and people in honesty, one of the best comedies I have seen this year, along with Pineapple Express and Step Brothers. It's not one of the comedies. "Make a profit" that requires humor, fart and humor in the bathroom But instead of moving in a polite manner and you will be tied to the storytelling Simon Pegg nailed into the coffin with the hilarious image of the fish character out of the water and quickly separated himself from the tripod, which he Formerly in England (the other two are Nick Frost and Edgar Wright). Getting to the top of the Hollywood food chain is difficult for us to see clearly with Pegg. His role in the lead role is the comedy "Run Fatboy Run" by David Schwimmer. His second attempt was that the film received positive reviews from most people. But it was a box office failure I, one, has not lost faith in him and I will remain there whenever he wants to shoot the third for glory. <br /> <br /> Other characters are well selected. From Jeff Bridges to Danny Huston and Gillian Anderson Surprisingly, Kirsten Dunst, in my opinion, had improved in this film as the love corner of Pegg's character. However, the spark I saw in the vampire interview still disappeared. She wants to find it quickly or she may experience the consequences of being lost in the land of "rom-coms" forever.
