This film should not be compared to "The Sting" or other caper / heist / con game movies. What makes it a great experience for movies is what it says about relationships, deception and trust. In addition, it is a psychiatric review that is quite unconcerned because the female protagonist is a contract that is easily deceived and then expressed in the original manner at the end. Is Mamet having an unfortunate experience in therapy? Highly recommended!
