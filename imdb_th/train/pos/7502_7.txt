Although I didn't feel anything about Lance's personality and felt that his wife could do much better with others. It may be a stronger movie if they spend more time developing characters. Maybe with Lance - I would like it more. <br /> <br /> However, I have to agree with DoyleLuver completely when they Says "And to talk about Glenn Quinn Ben's character: 'I'm a star here, right? I'm a talented person!'" If you watch a movie, just watch him, even when he is. Behind ... just his facial expression in the eyes. Do you know what inspired Ben, as he felt about the comment, even though it looked quickly behind the character? Great acting in a fair movie
