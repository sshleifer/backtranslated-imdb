Born again is the okay episode of Season 1 bit that reincarnated in my opinion. The more I watch it, the more I like. But it is not higher than 'very good' for me, although it is not very memorable But I will remember that it was a reincarnation. However, now I will say what is good and bad about now. <br /> <br /> Good: Oragami Oh, yes. <br /> <br /> The fish tank is good. /> Throw out the window with a high level x] <br /> <br /> Bad: Marry your best friend's wife !? O_O <br /> <br /> Random selection for reincarnation <br /> <br /> Why do men die by tangling their scarves?> <br /> Summary: Okay. Not very memorable. 7/10
