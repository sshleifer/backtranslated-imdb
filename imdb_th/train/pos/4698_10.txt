Just like the "Johnny Dangerously" wine is getting better every day. This clever and witty movie can stand on its own - but as a mockery of a gangster, it's great. In fact, it is quite clear that it is the best movie in the genre ... the most funny movies of the mob and even the relevant moments - although it is accepted that this position would be easier when the main competitors are traditional pseudocomedies as "Jane Austen's mafia"
