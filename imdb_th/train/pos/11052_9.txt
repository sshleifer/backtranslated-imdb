When I was six years old, I learned about a series called "Los Campeones" and even though I was just a kid, I did everything I needed to convince my parents to see me. "The Champions" and "The Avengers" every week. I think that's the golden age of the English series ... (I own the complete cycle of "prisoners"!) But lasts a few years later. "The Tomorrow People "," The worst witch "(I'm just me or this is" Harry Potter "in girls. Of course, as before, I want" The Campions "to be in Zone 1 or Zone 4. I'm still waiting. . Who "(Keep the whole set in the set, uh, maybe 300 DVD, Please, I can not spend any more, 8), "People of Tomorrow", and 'low budget' more, but the story would have to be within the reach of my zone. Speak and understand English But not everyone that my relatives do, including my parents, who introduced me to these great stories ... I hope someday someone will feel the charm of these series. Or description But in the same way that I see them, remember that Zone 1 or 4 is ok with my TV!
