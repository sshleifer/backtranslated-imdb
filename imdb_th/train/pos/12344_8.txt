The Sea Is Watching was created from the original script of Akira Kurosawa and it is a warm and warm movie. Seeing it will be a delightful thing. <br /> <br /> Kei Kumai as a director is definitely not the same as the old teacher. But everlasting (Especially the mass scenes at the beginning of the movie have poor performances) but overall emotions And the scenery is very fun Another thing you can't miss here: Kurosawa tries to make the character more self-acting than they are acting and doing. <br /> <br /> Maybe because his magic is in Scene while filming And maybe this script may not be as full as it should be Want to expect that might be very stupid ...
