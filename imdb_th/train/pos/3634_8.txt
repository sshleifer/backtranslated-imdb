I have low expectations for this movie. But I'm looking for something that nobody denies in the evening. I walked out of the theater with joy and was very surprised. This is a very good baseball movie and a good lesson about your dreams. Dennis Quaid worked well with his role and I was impressed with his performance. Worth the ticket, the full price and your time for a couple of hours!
