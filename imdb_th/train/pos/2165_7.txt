Viewing "Impulse" is a very satisfying experience. Movies that are unpredictable are rare when someone comes in, such as "Impulse." It's something to embrace. The script is very reasonable and creative. Meg Tilly, Tim Matheson, Hume Cronyn and Bill Paxton give credible performances. This story should play like a zombie movie, but "Impulse" is better than any "zombiefest" that is boring and sparkling in every scene. You will get the feeling that something like this may actually happen, even if the script is pure fiction, since "grabber" until opening credits, you will be amazed. Very entertaining and absolutely recommended - MERK
