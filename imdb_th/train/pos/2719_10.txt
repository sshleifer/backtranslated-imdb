I saw this movie after watching Capote and Infamous. It is an incredible story that the relationship between a man and a man between the author and the protagonist will be weakened in the movie. The journalist is straight, the helper is beatnik rather than gay. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly. But when examined for the second time, we received interesting information from the similes that the writer / director Brooks created. <br /> <br /> Notice the incredible cut at the beginning of the link. Link the killer and the killed The cutter on the phone was paired with Perry on the cutter phone. His face was paired with Perry to wash his face. Only Perry was looking in the mirror and saw his erotic man's body, began to imagine playing guitar in Las Vegas to an empty chair. This failure / dream coincides with failure - The fantasy that Perry tells us about his father who created a beautiful motel in Alaska just to find it empty forever. <br /> <br /> Dick talks about shooting a pheasant. Know that they are dying We cut for the Clutters group. <br /> <br /> Perry talks about his dream of a yellow bird. "Higher than Jesus" that attacked the nuns who persecuted them "Nuns for mercy" He told us, "But the birds killed them." The birds lifted Perry into heaven. Strange, Perry says that he hates nuns, gods and religions. This resonance in his last words when he wants to apologize. But don't know who it is. <br /> <br /> The director gives answers to what is ifs and only <br /> <br /> Nancy Cutter gets a proposal to sleep at a friend's house. She is carrying a horse. Perry will comment on her image and the house later. Nancy can't sleep at her friend's house because her boyfriend is coming for dinner. Deciding to seal her fate. <br /> <br /> Perry talks about Bogart in the "Treasure of Sierra Madre", but it is another picture of Bogart "Beat the Devil", in which Truman Capote writes that hunting The character's treasure is McGuffin, but Dick knows that the protagonist of the movie ends with nothingness. Dick wants a hard cash of $ 10,000 that he thinks is in Clutter's safety (which ironically became a fantasy as much as Perry's Mexican treasure). <br /> <br /> Cut to Herb Clutter signed a $ life insurance contract. 40,000 policies. He is thinking about death at the moment. His death is about to end in a few hours. Insurance agents on behalf of the company want him to live longer when we know what will happen. What's up in a few hours? <br /> Dick says that they don't want witnesses, so no one can remember them. In fact, it's because they get rid of all the witnesses they can remember. <Br / > <br /> "There is a witness," the detective told Dick later. But that is witness to friends in Dick Perry's Truman Capet prison or God? film
