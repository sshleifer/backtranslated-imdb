This is one of the best comedies! Writing a story mimicking this wonderful soap and actors. Look at the actor's name and you'll understand why it's good. If you are a fan of Kevin Kline, he will perform great (as always) and Robert Downey Jr is perfect. If you don't laugh while watching this movie, you don't have any humor.
