This movie has everything that makes the movie look as bad as it should be - sloppy editing, no continuity, bad conversations. (You may say that there is no identity.) The show features a ridiculous story, a long image ... and it's perfect for riffing the MST3K style. Not to mention. "Corpse Eaters drinking game": scribble in style ... take pictures - sign your name ... take pictures - catch bad foley ... many shots <br /> <br /> reason The only one that I didn't give a score higher than 8 was because there was not enough nudity and because despite the badness, it was only an hour - hell. Get at least 20-30 minutes longer!
