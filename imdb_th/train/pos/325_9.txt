This film is a great movie, especially when compared to the true intentions of filmmakers who have current political ideas. Movies that can combine sex, sexual relations, politics and art together easily are rare today. While the optimism in the 1960s was not able to be resurrected, I thought that at least we could learn lessons from the power and charm of this film. I do not know what the person who directed the movie "boring" is watching - there are many stories that have never been the same movie for more than 15 minutes each time.
