There should be more movies about our Native Americans. In particular, I think the use of true Native Americans will be the right thing. I know that Archie Belaney, played by Pierce Brosnan, did a great job in acting that character since he was an Englishman. But my suggestion to Hollywood is to make American Indians play a role and never use anyone else. The Sioux was placed on the back of the stove for too long. Their poverty is devastating to our country. It is my confidence that our country should bring Black Hill back to Soo. We ask Israel to return their land to Arabs. But we didn't try to do the same. We should be ashamed of ourselves. We must practice what we preach!
