I must say that I love movies completely. It has some funny moments that are warm around. Personally, I like this movie a lot because I can finally relate to my childhood. In my opinion, this movie focuses on young gay groups. It shows how young gay boys will be treated while growing up. Mockery called the name and did not know that it was something that I like. Most other young men and women will always remember and now, in the end, movies that show the difficulties of growing gay So I definitely recommend watching this movie. May not watch it until the person is old and old enough to understand
