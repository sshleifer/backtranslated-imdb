For projects with low budget, the movie was successful. The story is interesting and the actors believe Eva Longoria, who is now a star in the TV show "Dragnet", is more sexy than ever. The location is suitable for the plans of the director and director, showing his talents by undertaking many duties for his project. Of course, this low-cost movie can use a better transition and a special effect for the gun scene. But the song makes this chapter moving Although this movie has a common problem, such as continuity, I must say that I will rent the director's next movie. If your film student, you can learn a little from the director's description.
