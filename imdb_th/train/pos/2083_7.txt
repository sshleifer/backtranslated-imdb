This movie is a Hollywood movie starring the same novel by Pearl S. Buck, while some people today may think that it is rich in racial stereotypes while the ideas of the Chinese protagonists. There is progress in itself. I found that the white skin actors who play Chinese are not as bad as I expected. This is not equivalent to Asian blacks. Back then, there were no Asian actors in America. (Not even George Takei is performing) and Rainer works well on her part. It's not the greatest show I've ever seen. But for old-school preschool performances, it is very good The grasshopper scene is very well taken and has a special special effect. <br /> <br /> I suspect that the time of the release during the film's Great Depression became a comparison symbol. In particular, the political turmoil caused farmers to be confused and seem to be left behind. <br /> <br /> The film is similar to John Ford's style. But I think the influence from the East. If this is a western family, the grasshopper will win at the end, punish the peasants with pride, lust and greed. However, here he learns his lessons and wins.
