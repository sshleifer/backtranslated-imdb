When I saw this film in 1950, I wanted to be a scientist too. There is something magical and useful in science. I take a woman-friend to see it for the second time. I don't think she will be impressed like me! This movie is funny. But seriously when synthetic fibers are relatively new Lessons from this film can be applied to problems related to GM's experiments today.
