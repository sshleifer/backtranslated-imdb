Who would have imagined - Hal Hartley created a movie for Syriana while still maintaining his unique style? Fusion is highly entertaining. <br /> <br /> When I didn't watch Hal Hartley's movie for about ten years, I approached the movie with care. His wonderful productions of that period impressed the critics and audiences with unique style and dialogue. The director's previous film is characterized by colorful characters and offers a close observation of life - often in the region of Long Island, New York or in New York City - which is unusual and profound. <br /> <br /> caused by the description of this film "Thriller spy" with my pleasant surprise, Hartley can handle his accepted style and focus on creating a traditional drama that is universal. It works in a lot of ways than he thinks. Hartley's films still have dialogue and focus on his trademark characters, along with singular movie styles. <br /> <br /> More than that, it is very appropriate Due to the current situation in the world and the state of war Every element of darkness Hartley brings all his skills to new things - a political movie worthy of mentioning in the same way as Syriana. He is actually entering himself. The actors perform well in the interpretation of Hartley's vision and style. Parker Posey's fans will see her bloom here, still with us and ripe and beautiful than before.
