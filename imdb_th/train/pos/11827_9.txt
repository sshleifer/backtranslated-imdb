If Dick Tracy, black and white, the Pope will not be religious. Giving a new feeling to the concept of color in movies, we offer a unique experience in the cartoon world and one of the few films that have succeeded in doing this. Thank you to the serious script. Good direction. (Amazing Al Pacino) and most importantly, a powerful combination of movies, art direction and costume design. Use only primary colors. The experience is quite different from what we've seen before. And still have quite a successful success with all the extinct movie gangster movies from modern theaters Overall, I saw that this movie is a new attempt and experience the novelty of creating a movie, which requires more and more old-fashioned formulas and styles that are already seen. 7 out of 10
