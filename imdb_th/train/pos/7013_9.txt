Presenting an amazing performance by Will Smith and a story that draws your attention more difficult than a rock guitarist in the middle of the "Seven Pounds" competition through the coordination of previous directors and actors (The Pursuit of Happiness) My favorite flick. Please remember that the name of Gabriele Muccino because some of his films may be skipped without being noticed if the actor attached to this project is not famous. <br /> <br /> Terrible that I think Will Smith's work before I put two and two together when he called on his own suicide in the first scene and the scene in which the character of Rosario Dawson was presented with an incurable heart-decasease <br /> <br /> However, I still think that writers / directors choose the right way to place bookends (bookends are the first and last scenes) in that way. It is the source of urgency and tension in The film gradually discovers how humans can drive the ultimate sacrifice, and it is a sad story to see the relationship between Smith's character and Dawson flourishing and developing in the back. <br /> <br /> One of my friends that I saw this movie thought that Smith's character might have a gift from heaven and I understood why: acting He was almost angelic when he appeared before the seven. Sometimes he may be violent and scary and when he is alone He weighed his situation too much for him and he breaks down completely. It is quite effective. <br /> <br /> Finally, I can't forget to talk about the collision scene again, which is amazingly made in terms of movies paired with music. Put this into your list.
