Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played their role with confidence. I just cried the role of Glenn Close as Ruth showed that she wanted to deal with the situation. But she was under the control of her husband, "Let him think about what he did." Robert Duvall's character Joe spoke actively. The story of a family in the countryside related to the death of a son accidentally called "rock boy", which means that he has hope and is confused with what he does, so he becomes emotionally paralyzed After that, when Jason Preston's Arnold let all strangers come out, I regretted him until I thought of some horrible things in my life. I am personally and attached to his character. The role of Frederick Forrest and Gailong has not increased much. I miss Frederick Forrest, who plays Ruth's antagonist, Andy's cute brother as a jerk, who doesn't do anything to help the situation. Lou, his wife, played by Glenn, acted like a crazy woman who was frustrated by Arnold's frustration with her own problems without pity and blame him for her problems. I can't really feel sorry for these two people. Although Lou tried to get married, she didn't succeed. Both do not deal with problems effectively. They didn't do anything about this movie and completely ridiculous. Wilfred Brimley's secondary role as a grandfather was to touch him as the only character that showed Arnold's interest. I felt that his role should be thoroughly explained. Players do what they feel is sufficient and sufficient. However, I really like the ending. I smile and cry for joy. I feel good. Hillermans are family again. I want to be a part of this family. They are very realistic.
