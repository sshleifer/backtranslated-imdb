I've heard Eddie Izzard but have never seen him do it. I knew he was a homo and when I saw that he was on HBO one night last summer, I put it without knowing how my husband would react. He blew us out. He was better than Robin Williams. He had total control of the audience; When he did 'Anglert, dead - no, he wasn't' daily routine. The audience didn't know what to think at the end. God as James Mason was also inspired. And the Python Spanish Inquisition version, which was performed by the Church of England - 'Cake or Death?' There is no value. Of performances We disobeyed the television program for months afterwards in order to meet him again and luckily tape him next time he came. If you have the opportunity to see this program, cancel everything and record it, you won't be disappointed.
