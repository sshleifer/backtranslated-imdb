I'm a fan of TV movies in general and this is one of the good movies. Actors' performances are quite strong and there are twists I have never seen before each ad. For me, it's like Medium matches CSI. <br /> <br /> Does anyone think that in some light, the daughter looks like Nicole Kidman? Are they related? I will definitely see it or rent it. If it had been with the video, <br /> <br /> Dedee was great. You go to watch a mysterious movie on TV
