I watched this movie all the time. I've watched with families aged 3 to 87 and everyone in it They all like it. It shows the true scene that the dog has and the love and loyalty that you receive from a very beautiful pet. <br /> <br /> It's great for people who love comedy, torn movies or even pets <br /> <br /> Great music, exciting animals, scenes Truly think and perfect character What I like about the character is the true and varied personality: the shadow (the oldest, the golden retriever). He is a clever man who is full of intelligence and ideas of any dog. Opportunities (American Bulldog puppies), witty, funny characters; And Sassy (Hymilayan cat). She is a real cat that shows what a real cat will do with the real cat owner.
