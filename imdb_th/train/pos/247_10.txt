I love this movie because it shows that they don't kill for fun. But to save the life they love! Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom performed very well in Ned and Joe. There were some scenes that didn't fit quickly. But it's okay Language is very weak and sometimes I don't even know This film shows that just because they are illegitimate does not mean that they are fierce killers! I hope people will watch this movie and learn about important moments in this history. There is one thing that fascinated me about this movie: They were inspired by armor from the book Ned! That's how people remember from their armor. I hope people will watch this movie and get the attention that I have.
