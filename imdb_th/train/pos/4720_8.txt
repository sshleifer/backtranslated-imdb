Beautiful movies, especially if you like horses, World War II movies and the Hungarian Highlands, a story of courage, compassion and loyalty beyond the generations. The horse riding skills are amazing, including the main character's horse in his training. <br /> <br /> I'll buy this movie and watch it again. This is a family movie and I highly recommend it. The movie '' Family Nite 'is good even though there are some violent scenes. But the occupation of the Nazis in Hungary, the indigenous people, is very interesting in the way they stand, even having to face death from Nazi officials with personal reasons for hunting Brady Beautiful movies
