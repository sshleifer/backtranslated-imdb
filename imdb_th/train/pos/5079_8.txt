At first I would like to clarify that Kaakha Kaakha is part of the Tamil prayer and means "defending" roughly while Khakhee means the color of the police uniform (which is Khakhi!). <br /> <br /> In addition, the Tamil film industry is quite full of commercial business in that sentence. <br /> <br /> Now Kaakha Kaakha is a great movie with a great soundtrack. Of course, it's amazing in the final scene, especially love ending. (Which is unexpected!) Sometimes the blood is too much. But of course this is a great movie!
