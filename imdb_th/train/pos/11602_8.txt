I am now happy to see the first contaminated man when it was screened on TV in December 2000. <br /> <br /> Infectious disease specialist (William Hert) lost his family when the disease didn't know, entered his house and killed them. Now many years later, he is in Russia or somewhere I'm not sure that all I actually know is that it happened somewhere in that area. However, due to budget cuts at the infectious disease lab, they were forced to dismiss most employees. One of them is a security officer who is not satisfied with the name Joseph Muller. (As played by Peter Weller, is well known for his role as a non-destructive Robocop) into it and demands that they return to him He wants this job because he is divorced and he wants to pay child support. So he entered there. The fight was a fight and there were some things that came to hit the dangerous thing. Soon it was discovered that Muller was infected by a deadly disease. In fact, it's very serious. One drop of blood will kill people in seconds. Soon the words would be sent out, and the disease specialist (Hurt) was summoned to investigate and later he collaborated with American journalists. Now Muller is determined to go home to see his wife and son and will not stop doing anything, even if he has to infect the entire Russian population. <br /> <br /> Now that I speak before the movie This story is like Falling Down. We have a disturbed person (Weller here, Michael Douglas in Falling Down) that won't stop doing anything to achieve the goal, even if they have to kill a few people in the process. Next, we have a hero type (Hurt here, Robert Duvall in Falling Down) that is sympathetic and determined to stop the enemy. In fact, this movie is a good movie and a good story. Very good lines and performances. <br /> <br /> 8/10
