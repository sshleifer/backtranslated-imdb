When I heard about "Hammerhead" released on DVD and finally found it at a DVD store in my area, I thought "Well, just another cheap monster movie from Nu Image" The people around Boaz Davidson and Avi Lerner produced B - Pictures. Cheap but very fun in the past few months. But there are disappointing movies as well So I didn't expect much, especially after watching the "shark zone" that was quite disappointing a few days ago, but "Hammerhead" turned out to be a great revival of the monster movie in the 1950s. Mad scientists, people who are in dangerous situations, screaming women and young women in distress, eating plants, and of course we have mutated creatures between humans and sharks. Cattle hammer Everything you need for entertaining monster movies The only thing missing is the sex scene, graphics and nudity that you expect in this type of movie. But since this film was created for the TV, it can be understood why these scenes are missing. And it doesn't matter why "Hammerhead" is the best action and horror entertainment There are two reasons why I gave seven points out of ten points: Firstly, monsters are not often seen, and the confrontation with the destruction of the creature is too fast and poorly done, and the second is William Forsythe. "Hero" and fell in love with the beautiful Hunter Tylo. In addition, I would like to recommend this movie for a monster movie fan. Grab a cold drink and popcorn. Come watch this movie and enjoy Jasper P. Morgan.
