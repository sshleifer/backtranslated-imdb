I think this is what this movie wants us to say at the end of the movie! Or Australia is condemned, I don't know yet, but what I know is that I like this movie a lot. But that's not my favorite movie. <br /> <br /> A wonderful story with a great actor. But ends in fear ... makes you cry and says 'Oh, you're so good.' What really happened? Who is it? There is no answer to these questions ... <br /> <br /> Mysterious movies that have a good score overall ... I score 8/10 until 8.5!
