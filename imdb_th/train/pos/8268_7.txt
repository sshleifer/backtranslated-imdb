Bushman and in the supporting role is Jack Picford, always remembered as Marie's brother. Among these three, Picford fell out best as a sympathetic loser who became a friend of Tom. In fact, he had a good scene as well as a remarkable time before the game. big! All standard clich√©s are there and movies because it has been done many times before and since then there are a few surprises.

And because it is just a repetition of his other films, everyone who scores this movie 10 strongly recommends to watch these other movies. <br /> <br /> 4/25/08 = = I just checked and saw This small movie is the highest rated movie in IMDb from the 1920s !! Talk about too many points! There are dozens of better movies - how is this movie going to be # 1? Anyone guess?
