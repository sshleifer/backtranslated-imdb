Yes, it's a Muppet movie that is wonderful and I love them all. Movie characters, TV episodes (It's a funny movie or TV show, the best music that has ever existed) and all the artists behind. But here they make a rare mistake and I'm talking about a strange ending for sure !! <br /> <br /> I think it's very dangerous to be very involved in the American drama and finish. Love story by marriage !! We, as a poor audience, all feel serene or happy because there is no nuisance, chaos and misery! So we all enjoyed these stories, which gathered 2 cute heroes to be lovers without legal bonds such as Mickey Mouse and Minnie, Superman and Lois Lane, Dick Tracy and Pour. Wirs, etc. So with the previous pair You feel safe, calm and peaceful. So when you see what the film's creator has done, you will be angry with me too. <br /> <br /> They create a pathetic creature that is weak (Kermit), marrying his nightmare every day. The most disturbing woman (Miss Piggy)! This is a historical change by the measures of the American entertainment industry! And it is normal to have a negative impact on viewers who have recently refused to bless or believe or are satisfied with that sudden marriage. (Even the poor frog doesn't have the time or the right opportunity to think or decide!). So it's not surprising when you know that this movie is one of the most failed movies in their movies. Only 25 million disputes, compared to 65 million people received from the first film (The Muppet Movie ?? 1979) five years ago !! <br /> <br /> In this movie, they confiscated Manhattan. Tons and rest With!
