Before seeing this, I was fired from the story. But this is not your average victory for misery. Although this is a technique for Tibetan blind children climbing Everest is much more than that. This film shows the strong and contradictory personality of two highly successful blind people who lead children Erik and Sabriye Erik as climbers / blind American athletes, and Sabriye is a blind German scholar. Which started studying at Lhasa, Tibet They both have their own special characteristics. But disagreeing with what will create confidence in children. Erik wants them to reach the peak while Sabriye wants them to enjoy Erik as a model and have a happy moment. The differences are complex and one walks out. Not really sure who is right or whether all the climb is a mistake or a good idea. The deepest scene is the Tibetan children and the difficulties they face before finding their way to school. The most moving thing for me is the story of Tashi, a weak teenager who grew up on the street after his parents left him. I can watch movies both about his life and happy to learn that thanks to the school, he is now doing a small business with some of his fellow students.
