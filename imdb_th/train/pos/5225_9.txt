I think this movie is a very funny movie and is one of the best 'National Lampoon' movies, but it has a very tricky title, which basically concludes what the movie is like .... Men In White !!!! The story is a movie that spoofs many movies, including the Will Smith movie, as you might have guessed, 'Men In Black'. But it ended very well, was very funny (Leslie Nielsen, humorous style) from beginning to end, especially near the beginning when you are in the streets to collect garbage (garbage cans). In addition, they also have beautiful trash trucks (Garbage Collecting Truck ) In that scene too Actually, it's not very good. But that is what makes the comedy, it is funny, funny !! I love the story, partly because it's been drawn and partly because it's interesting to see how fragile it is. (Or should it be un-subtle) They cut all other movies. I'm a big fan of spoof movies that aren't serious. But I am a real fan and with this movie it is hard to decide which is better than this movie. (Mentioned before me this review) or this movie is true But when you make a funny movie it makes it harder But this movie was successful Two men junk, very funny. It reminds me of the sketch in a UK TV show called 'Little Britain'. This movie is a must for your collection and is one of the best, funniest, funny stories. The best and best, Lamphun National Film to the present !!
