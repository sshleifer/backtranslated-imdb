This must be a unique twist of the two types that have been seen. Movie type, monster, giant, with movie type, mummy, residence This unique combination is created for a unique and interesting story. The actors are outstanding, including TOM BOSLEY, which, as far as I know, has never been in horror before. Impressive effects and the concept of a giant mummy filled with small mummies is a wonderful thing. One of my complaints, I just hope that we will see more giant mummies. But other things that I think they do very well The dialogue, characters and stories are perfect. The performance was excellent. This must be the best movie to come out of the sci-fi channel. You heard me the best movie coming out of the sci-fi channel. I let people fall 9 out of 10 people
