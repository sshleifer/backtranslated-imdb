So what makes this TV movie score just 7.6 on this website? Bah! nonsense! No question. This version of Dickens' classic tale, 1984, is the best thing that has ever been done. And yes, Hound has seen the 1951 version, which is good, but not good enough. The performance will be great, George C. Scott is as amazing as Ebenezer Scrooge. We all know the story of a stingy businessman who has been haunted by his soul mate. After that, there are three other spirits in the evening. Scott lamented like Scrooge In fact, too, for some critics who claimed that he could not show the new singer he woke up on Christmas morning after the spirit taught him valuable lessons. But wait, this is George C. Scott. He won't dance down the road with pleasure. He has too much dignity and his Scrooge shines his emotions in real ways. <br /> <br /> The supporting performances are excellent, as well as costumes, music and scenery. The 19th century London came to life again in the visionary style of Clive Donner. This film is scary in many scenes related to the soul. Although the story of moral significance will appear through every frame, <br /> <br /> You will not find this version broadcast on television anymore and that is a disappointment. Christmas Day 1984 should be a part of every household holiday celebration. When decorating out of the basement, this movie should find a way to enter at least one DVD player during the season. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 stars <br /> <br /> Hound
