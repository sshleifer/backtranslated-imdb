I was frankly surprised that there was only a small film made of Columbine Massacre. There are no major puzzling documentaries. Fortunately, we were gifted with Ben Coccio, the director of ZERO DAY and Gus Van Sant, who made the ELEPHANT. There are two things in common, which are common ideas that the exact cause of the massacre is always a mystery that there is something that is bewildering and ignorant about the motives of both killers. The fantasy into reality is horrific. ZERO DAY, which consists of a videotape created by a gunman and is discovered after the event is absolutely breathtaking Even if you know where it is going, you still hope that it will not "go there" ... and the last minute tension of the movie is sad. This film is excellent from top to bottom from the director to the screenplay. (Not very much modified though it looks very natural) to both leading actors and supporting players as well. There is only one side of ZERO DAY that causes me trouble. Okay, we can't understand why athletes do what they do. But of course, one of the supporters is their anger. But these boys don't seem to be really angry. They may say something to indicate that they are But in reality they do not believe me that they have things inside them that force them to kill innocent people But this also made me feel like "Why ???" That Coccio director wanted me to have However, to rent or buy this movie, it will creep to you and stay with you for a long time. A group of people with wisdom, I will only wish for the success they have in making a documentary.
