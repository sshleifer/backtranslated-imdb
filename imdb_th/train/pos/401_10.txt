I just came back from Hong Kong during the summer vacation and saw the Legend of ZU. I think it kicked * s! It is creative and unique. It is Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon with less drama. Although some people think that there is too much FX (Yes, right!) You can't complain about the actor. Zhang Ziyi and Cecilia Cheung are great !!! The Legend of ZU ..... kicks * s !!!!!!!!
