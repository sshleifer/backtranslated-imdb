I think a lot of viewers miss completely with the fact that this is a joke of western movies. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie - it's a clever tongue in using Western cheeks. I do not believe that this movie will be serious for myself for a moment. <br /> <br /> What makes this film stand out is the fact that it has a center for four strong and beautiful women. Two people are black. Asian and Mexican / Hispanic characters <br /> <br /> These women are not your western people - they are strong - they can draw quickly and shoot at <br /> < br /> They were very difficult. Even the bartender was shaking when he poured the liquor into the glass. <br /> <br /> The story that moves this story is typical of the guava - in the veins of "You shot my brother - so I'm going to pick you up! "Only in this Western, a woman's sister was shot and she went out to take revenge on the gang that made it. <br /> <br /> So she went and chased her old henchmen from robbery. <br /> <br /> One of them is Maria, not everyone interested in revenge on Rachel's sister. But she was inspired by the fact that there were gold and jewelry hidden in the city they were heading for. <br /> <br /> There are two scenes that are not reasonable, not that they are too busy. Can be ignored But I wonder why they were there Therefore, this film may use a little tightness. But above all, this is a well-made movie that fails to find an audience that knows what it is. <br /> <br /> My only disappointment is only one lesbian. in This movie is a villain - from one "heroine" to the obvious. Others never reveal sexual relationships. <br /> <br /> 7 stars
