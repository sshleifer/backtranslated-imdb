I see today's special advance screening. I need you to know that I'm not a big fan of Dane Cook or Steve Carell, so I don't expect to do this. Finally I enjoy it a little bit. <br /> <br /> Real life is the story of a widow with 3 daughters who spend the weekend with his family. While in the bookstore, he met a woman of his dreams, only to find that she was the girlfriend of his brother. <br /> <br /> This film was done very well - the movie soundtrack. And the performances are all top, especially Steve Carell. My problems with it are mostly that it seems to lack the development of most characters with the characters of Dane Cook. We never see the relationship between Dane and himself. Steve's close and I feel that it may help to show that Dan's internal conflict is about falling in love with Dane's fans. In addition to this, Dan in Real Life is definitely a sweet movie - it's Good stay from horror movies and action that we received this year.
