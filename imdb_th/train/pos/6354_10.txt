Jim Carrey can do anything. I think this is a movie that looks like a child and it's not all. It's incredibly funny for everyone, adults and kids. I've seen it over and over again because it's almost out of the cinema and now it's released on DVD on Tuesday and I'm excited to see You should definitely see it if you haven't yet. It's great! <br /> <br /> Liz
