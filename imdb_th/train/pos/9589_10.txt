Growing up in NYC in the late 80s / early 90s, I can say that this is one of the most important documentaries in covering this place. During this time, Madonna No did not come with Voguing's ideas here Is where she gets from! Instead of using violence against each other or fighting a female cat, voguing allows people to "fight" within the boundaries of everything that is untouched. (Which will guarantee automatic disqualification) seeing the talented actors / well-prepared in the club is nothing exciting and big names today are here ... Pepper La Beija, Paris Dupr√©e, Xtragavaganza, etc ... All the sequels in the series of moments are the "Deep in Vogue" of Malcom McLaren ... No matter who you are or where you come from because when you walk Those doors to Your "Kingdom of Magic" becomes part of something bigger than yourself / you are important / and most importantly, creating your own movement and imagination ... and anyone from where Any can become a king (or queen). Words and wisdom are as sharp as the movement on the ground. The tension, excitement and magic of the NYC energy in that city was captured in this film. BRILLIANT !!! Please publish it on DVD to see the world !!! Thank You!
