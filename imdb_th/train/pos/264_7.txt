Hickory Dickory Dock is a great Poirot puzzle. I confess that I haven't read the book even though I am a big fan of Agatha Christie. Adaptation does not occur without problems. There are times when humor and courageous attempts to correct it are too little and the events that lead to the final solution are quite hasty. I also thought it had a slow time, so some mysteries felt hurt. However, I like Hickory Dickory Dock filming. It has a style that is very similar to ABC Murders and it creates a real atmosphere with dark and dark cameras. The darker times are quite creepy. This is one of the most haunted music scores in Poirot's adaptation. Perhaps not as disturbing as one of the two buckle my shoes, which makes me a nightmare The plot is complex with all the necessary ingredients, although not as complex as the Buckle My Shoe and sometimes it is a good thing. The performance is very good. David Suchet is perfect (I know I can't use this word forever. But I can not think better than to explain his performance in the series) Poirot, Phillip Jackson and Pauline Moran To their great characters And students have great personalities and have always developed, especially Damien Lewis as Leonard Overall, it's a hard puzzle. But not in the best position 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
