Best movie from Thaddeus O Sullivan, starring British and Irish actors This film deals with thorny topics and can capture Belfast's terrible desperation and atmosphere in the 70s. Surprisingly, it actually did nothing to glorify both sides in this conflict On the one hand, it shows that Catholic parents try to raise their families without problems. On the other hand, involving a loyal gang, which was intended to spread violence Very interesting and very grateful to entertain. Don't expect laughter. 7 out of 10
