Saxophonist Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell) won the studio contract and went to Hollywood. He is at the Hollywwod Hotel (of course). Meanwhile, Mona Marshall (Lola Lane), who has a big talk about himself, is angry and refuses to attend the premiere of her new image. In awe, the studio was hired as Virginia (Rosemary Lane) to imitate her and let Bowers take her to the premiere, not telling him that it's not Marshall. By nature they fell in love You can plot other things on your own. <br /> <br /> Old story (To put it well) but Powell and Rosemary Lane create a cute pair and have a beautiful singing voice. The score is good (highlighted by "Bravo for Hollywood") and director Busby Berkeley shows a unique picture. In his drama series, fun driving songs (By Edgar Kennedy slowing the burning of patents) In addition, Glenda Farrell has a bit of a bit funny as Monas sister Jonesie. <br /> <br /> This film is still not good. The rest of the glass starring fiercely and mostly humorous, not funny. In particular, Lola Lane is lousy, just trying to play Mona for comedy. There is also racism - black girls, stereotypical players for laughs and "humor", a truly shocking class. Things that keep the TV off all the time I know that it was accepted at that time. But it turned out that this day was nasty. <br /> <br /> All in the movie so-so, with some serious problems, getting help from good actors and great music.
