This is the first movie I have to watch last year! It's an evil joke that is incredibly original and looks incredibly good. (They go to the Tech Color screen, the screen is great, amazing) and actually it has the depth of the characters and what they say about society. It is a really clever word that reinforces everything from Homeland Security to competition problems, while also making you laugh and realizing that the world is very scared. Will come from you! She's cute, funny and sexy! Billy Connolly is great as Fido, who can grunt and groan! And Dylan Baker as a valuable father Actually, all the actors are perfect. Henry Czerny is a bad guy. Tim Blake Nelson is a neighbor with a sexy zombie fan. (Get ideas now?) Funny but stimulating and amazing! Go watch this movie! It's not like what you've seen before.
