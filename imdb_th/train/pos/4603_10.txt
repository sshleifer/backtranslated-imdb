There is one detail which is not unusual for Jackie Chan's movie. But there is here It has a very difficult and serious atmosphere while funny elements are also available. Jackie is dangerous and a psychopath here. He is not a hero who was attacked and after that he fought. (In normal form) but he is able to go and start chaos His attitude to banging the wicked in the glass was amazing. Every time it "cracks!" I also enjoy the scene, especially when Jackie goes to the pub and teases the villain who has confronted his girlfriend. It is one of the best blitzkriegs placed on the screen. In addition, all scenes were filmed with the backdrop of the action characters drawn on the wall. (It looks like the poster "rabochiy" from our Soviet era) and some lines in Russia are on the left. (I noticed that it was quite coincidental) that looked great. (And miss the Russian people) I also like when windows are smashed in movies There are many things here. It is amazing to see the characters falling / jumping / running / driving through all the <br /> <br /> The three films are great. I prepared myself to see the quality of the still image. But I saw the perfect ending with amazing feelings and stunts (and not just the characters of Jackie Chan, who appeared in all three movies - great> <br /> I want to explain each movie. Story with a few words: No.1 - very good (in all aspects - it's an interesting story from start to finish) and funny (many scenes are ridiculous); Issue 2 - Enraged (Jackie * beeps * here) and pain (Jackie is tortured); Issue 3 - Unbelievable (women who fight with Jackie are incredible) and lively. (Should I mention a lot of guns and explosions? <br /> <br /> The rest of the story has been mentioned. <br /> <br /> It's a ending that can be repeated. Again (At least me) The place is in the top 10 of the action / comedy actors. Finally, it is released in Russia on DVD. (The second movie has the best option - Chinese / Russian soundtrack. And English / Russian subtitles) <br /> <br /> solid 10 out of 10 Thank you for your interest
