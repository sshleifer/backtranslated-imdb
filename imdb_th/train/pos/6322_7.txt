This friend recommended me this movie. I have never seen an advertisement or an example, so I don't know that Clooney is there and doesn't care about the fact that his role is very small. I think all the characters are appropriate and found that this movie is quite fun. The scene opens with a small bandit standing on the street looking whipped and pale. There is a way to tell you that "Don't go anywhere. It's not boring." And it's not. It turned out to be a light, interesting joke that had enough torque and turned you into the seat to the end. But when the ending came, I felt a little cheated .... just a little bit of the events that were created to make you expect them to continue to build. But at the point that I couldn't determine, it arranged the level out to make the ending feel a little disappointed. I think I expect to reach the peak of the peak. But it turned out to be a low button If you watch movies with that idea and you can live without George Clooney in high volume, you should find that this movie is entertaining and worth watching. Now I want to see the original. (The big story on Madonna Street) But it may be a rarity in the United States.
