To be honest, I had to go to see this movie in the past, not expecting much. But hey, I'm not being deceived. I have a good time. <br /> <br /> I want to say that this movie is a good way. Fresh breeze, despite the fact that they are trying to make Nancy Drew up to date, but that makes me remember these youth films in the age of 60-70 from Europe and Quebec, where they manage to interact with adults. In this case, a 16-year-old teenager tried to do justice by trying to solve the mystery of the death of an actress who died 25 years ago. However, while her father did business in Hollywood, why not try to rent a house. With a mystery hidden behind the door? At the very least, Emma Roberts did a good job here. Kinda, like a fat kid, who at first was raised innocent to support his sister's prank at Nancy. But at the end I found that Nancy was quite cool enough to be with her ... The remaining actors were great actors and were happy to see Rachel Leh jail in a different role. This: single mother (She can help family But this time, she plays a mature woman ...) Don't leave this. It's fun!
