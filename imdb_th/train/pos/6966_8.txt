Overall, I was quite impressed with the pilot. The first fifteen minutes began to worry because he felt that the creators tried to create The OC science fiction, but this fear was resolved when the terrorist incident occurred and from here the process of acting was a theme and situations I rarely saw Tagged television <br /> <br /> BSG handles themes such as monotheism, existentialism, reality, death and terrorism. But most of them have a description for the audience to consider or ignore if they choose On the other hand, these subjects were the focus of the show and I found myself feeling like works such as Ghost In The Shell and The Matrix as a reference point while watching and was surprised by the talk about various themes. I think if you are a big fan of two stories that I just talked about or other movies / TV shows related to the subject I referenced, I think you will find something here. <br /> <br /> In terms of Of the beginning to explain how the situation we know in BSG happens. I believe that they deal with it in a very interesting way. I like the way they describe, especially how Syed's signings in God comes from. Technology thrown in to appear in the future But not strange for us as an audience. <br /> <br /> The only real weakness I noticed was the relationship between Greystone parents and actors playing 'Lacy Rand'. Eric Stoltz and Paula Malcomson individually. Their scenes seem to lack chemistry. At this point, it may be their character development. But this is something that I think needs work. I also found that Magda Apanowicz was not confident in her role. This may be the experience and time required to develop again. But throughout her performance, she seemed to be completely forced and unconvinced. <br /> <br /> Based on the pilot, I look forward to seeing 'Caprica' coming in the future and hopefully it. Will experience the greatness that BSG has ever done
