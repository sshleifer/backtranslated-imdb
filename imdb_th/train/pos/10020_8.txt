Legendary Boris Carlos finished his famous career by creating a horrific comedian group in Mexico. This is the moment when the moody token lists Gothic horror items from the bunch. Carlos gives a terrific and terrifying performance as Matthias Mortel, the eldest elder, who invites him many times, whether greed or greed. Soon the haters were struck by people, toys of the size of the dead that filled the place. The Mexican sex symbol once, Andres Garcia's "Tintorera" is infamous, demonstrating the heroic, skilled police and Julius Zadar are absolutely fascinated as a cute female character. Directions that are free (non) clunky, monotonous scripts by ugly numbers, movies washed out, murderous laughs (Gross dirty pieces have been exploded in the face by small cannons!), String scores overwrought the grief-melancholy atmosphere, mostly shown with lousy (except Karloff in particular), soft-pointed blood, scrubbing at Bad and all thrilling conclusions lend this awesome scary, fun, scuddy and cute scary real horn.
