When I first came out, my father brought it home - we were surprised by it - it's different from what we've seen before. Last night I was looking for a specific movie and I found that 'The Mind's Eye' again. The box came out and I was surprised that the tape was still working! Although not a 'Finding Nemo' quality graphic, it is still very good. They should sell this thing again because it is a landmark for animation on computers. Highly recommended!
