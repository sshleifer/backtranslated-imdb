I saw this movie again to assign my management class. There are mostly opinions about different management styles and quality ideas. (Of the product) I rented this car one night in the eighties and I remember that it was a good movie (but not a lot). I always liked the style and delivery of Michael Keaton. He was the perfect model for the movie. <Br /> <br /> I was surprised to see low ratings for this movie. I give you the right. Yes, it's not an Oscar winner. But it has the appropriate funny value It is a subtle comedy rather than a full joke. I find that there are some people who feel that this is a wrong movie about cultural and business differences. I would like to differentiate. I reassure you that there are many general characteristics and dramatic writing. But then again, Hollywood movies are not documentaries. From what I have read about the difference between car manufacturers on both sides of the Pacific Ocean at that time, many of the main ideas were accurate at that time. <br /> <br /> Some basic differences are Japanese workers make sense Being part of the company as a whole, focusing on teamwork They may make the company above all else. That American workers have more management of the type of relationship More important than the company, I may receive an hate speech in that comment. I'm sure <br /> <br /> Another difference is the quality of viewing and the responsibility that needs to be resolved. In many Japanese factories, checking for defects or problems while discovering Instead of being a character in this film "It's a dealer problem. (Meaning car dealers) "<br /> <br /> Many of these things may be outdated. But I'm sure there are many more rounds Manufacturers are still struggling to keep up with Japan. If there is more interest in the issues of American, European and Japanese car manufacturers, I can recommend books that study this subject in more detail and operate at the same time. This book is called "Machines that change the world" by James Womack, Daniel Jones and Daniel Roos. It's about the education of car manufacturers, both before and during the film's time. Some parts are a little dry. But I think you will find that it helps to backup a lot of movies as well.
