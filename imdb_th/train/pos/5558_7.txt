This story has been a familiar story in Tom and Jerry cartoons for a long time, especially in the 1940s. The only difference is that two cats instead of a cat are threatened to expel if they don't catch the mouse ( Jerry) Tom has an unnamed partner ("Butch?") Living in the house with him, so this makes "Mammy Two Shoes" turn upside down, which is unbelievable that they will have mice even with two cats In the house <br /> <br /> how According to the store to get caught Jerry can live while the other boots are so competitive, continues to /> <br /> Although it was <br familiar territory. But I still enjoy it because that cartoon Make your entertainment not only let cats compete with each other But Jerry in the equation also, so there is a good enough joke to suggest if you are a fan of Tom & Jerry
