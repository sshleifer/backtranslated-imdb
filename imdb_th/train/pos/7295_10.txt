I managed to see this at the New York International Film Festival in November 2005 with my girlfriend. We were both impressed by the complexity of the plot and found it moving emotionally. It's very well directed with strong images. The visual effects are amazing - especially in the short term. There is a traditional way of thinking for serious and serious topics: this movie is about a girl who was proposed by the devil to offer. Help her situation with an inappropriate father. There is also a surprise at the end which makes me careful. This leaned towards the gothic feeling. I like to see this as a documentary film - Kae.
