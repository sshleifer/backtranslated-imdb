This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen: I shine all over the movie. Music and movies hold spells when small things happen on the screen. The slow speed is determined by the travel mode. (Mower, horse riding with large trailers) and being treated with a background and sound and the slow life of other characters. <br /> <br /> The story actually happened. Alvin Straight died in the year. 1996, when 76 years old, no performances Everything is completely true, as if the actors have transformed into real characters. Sissy specs for a violent performance as a disabled daughter who has suffered so much. Richard Farnsworth has been completely selected and he becomes Alvin Strait, a stubborn old man who loves to Explore all over Iowa to visit Lyell, a brother who has broken out in a stroke. Alvin learned many wisdoms during his life and seemed to bring the best of the people he met all the time. <br /> <br /> This film reinforces the importance of the family to this man and Hope everyone of us. I expect to see it again and again. Directed by David Lynch, this film proves his governance skills. Farnsworth was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor; At 79, he is the oldest challenger to ever receive an award.
