In the outskirts of Sao Paulo, the Teodoro family (Julio Lopez), with unusual and very low middle class, has a deep secret. Teodoro religion is a killer hired to kill people in that neighborhood with his friend Waldomiro (Ailton Graça ) He has a very faithful young lover Terezinha (Martha Meola) and he wants to create a new journey to her country. Cláudia has a young lover, Júlio (Ismael de Araújo), who is delivering meat to the butcher shop. His father, Soninha, is a typical sixteen-year-old teenager of the periphery, having a sex life that uses grass, smoking and heavy metals. When Júlio was murdered and when in the neighborhood, the life of the family members changed. <br /> <br /> "Contra Todos" is a great low-cost Brazilian film that captures life in the most outskirts of Brazil. Big city. This story is very true, using the usual elements of the poor areas of the big cities of Brazil. (Drug dealers, popular people, religious people, evangelists, desperate teenagers, etc.) There are many plot points and endings and characters. Great performances, very natural performances and completely convincing stories The character tracking camera caused a lot of changes to the movie. In the special section of the DVD, director Roberto Moreira explains that his screenplay does not have a line, just a description of the situation and was only partially revealed one week before the filming began. Actors have training in workshops and they use a lot of adaptation as a reason for such natural performances. My score is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Contra Todos" ("Against Everybody")
