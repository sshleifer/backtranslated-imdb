This is a movie that feels good about a person's dreams and is driven or driven to realize them. It is a beautiful and inspiring movie. Why do some people try to find errors in every movie that comes out especially good? Dennis Quaid gave a good performance in the real story of Jim Morris, a science teacher and high school baseball coach who was driven by his team to shoot again in a baseball career. With an excellent cast team, including Brian Cox as a former naval officer who made his son's success unstoppable It is good to see him other than the villain in the movie. If I have one complaint about this movie, it is like this: Don't let Royce Applegate sign the national anthem again. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this movie is a great baseball movie "Field of Dreams. "And" The Natural "scores two thumbs up and big" very well done "
