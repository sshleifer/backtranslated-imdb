The perfect space fantasy movie A group of children accidentally went into space and had to go back down. But they are sure that they do, this is not a family movie if they die Then everything will be sad. You don't want Kate Capsaw, a leading woman to perform in the Golden Globe. But sadly she and Lea Thompson won one prize It's terrible. I can't say enough. This movie is great. Lea Thompson - The perfect young woman for this movie. This movie is definitely the best. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but it's better than Star Wars. Star Wars is very popular and space camps don't get much ratings. It should be a good way. <br /> <br /> Excellent 10 / 10-0r maybe 11/10 I'm not good at math
