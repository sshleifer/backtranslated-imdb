Mahatma has been described as a man who neglected his son in this movie. Don't understand me wrong, I'm not condemning the movie. It was a great movie and walked out of the cinema with a lump in my throat. We need to understand the spiritual status of Mahatma. He is a true spiritual leader. Only the enlightened person can separate himself from the person he loves. This talented man will bring his family and followers as an example. According to the film, he spoke to his son Harilall and tried to make him understand where he came from. Poor people who had little intelligence did not understand his father. When things happened to Harilall, Mahatma was calm and admitted that his son was a big tragedy. <br /> <br /> If being other parents, they would allow their values ​​to help. Let the son stand up Mahatma did not do that, he was a true leader led by example.
