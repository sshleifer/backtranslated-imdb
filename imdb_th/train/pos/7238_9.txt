Small spoiler alert !!! <br /> <br /> Good movie ... Very good movie and I was surprised to say that myself because I'm not a big fan of vampires and the sound of the director's name. Deran Serafian often refers to bad news. Most of his movies are lower than general action movies such as Death Warrant and Gunmen. This is one of his first films and maybe he should continue to do horror movies instead. This movie really fascinated me. Good success without seeing famous actors or large budgets involved It's a story that makes you focus. Especially the original Dracula legend fans will be satisfied. Sarafian opens another corner of the famous Bram Stoker story and remains true and true to the truth. It describes the life of the Roemenian Count Dracula and how he feared the Turkish army by stabbing dead bodies in front of his castle. Of course, that's where truth and "Based on the true story" stopped. Drinking blood and objects were invented by Bram Stoker. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Count (Vlad Teppish) emigrated to the United States and seduced many women. And all of them are beautiful girls, I'll give him that Overall, good performances by unknown faces, blood and ax, enough to make fans horror, horror and interesting stories. This movie is not really known and it is hidden on the darkest shelf at my local videostore. But it's worth it to clean the dust on the cover and put it on the VCR. Heck it's better than the famous movie Nicole Kidman of the same name. These two films have nothing in common. But I blame this film to steal attention away from beautiful small images. Check ... My humble opinion at To Die For = 8.5 / 10
