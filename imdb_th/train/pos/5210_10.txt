It was a shame that she didn't get the credit from the screen. She did the best job in this film, with a girl on the cross. The best part of the film, she had more impact than Avril or others in this film. . She almost made S / M look fun! She really believes that the model S / M is afraid of her situation. Although they seem to confuse their dreams of finding bad people But those scenes were created well But they were just superficial of what was shot This is a movie that both wounds should have. It seems that they are leaving a lot of shooting things and almost all the dark things that make this movie worse. It's like they stop marking during filming. Things that are shot will not be rated. R is probably NC-17 or X, but that's what it has to be in order for this movie to be as it should be.
