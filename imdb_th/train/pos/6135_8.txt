Bedknobs & Broomsticks is another Disney masterpiece. It was filmed with animation sequences and actors and actors interacting with animation. (Similar concepts were used in Mary Poppins when children and Mary disappeared in sidewalk art). I rate this film primarily through the eyes of children because I've never seen it for years It was one of my favorite movies. It's wonderful and mysterious and the last scene (The conflict started with the ghost armor that went into battle) is my favorite. There are also many stop animations used with spells. (Eg, people change into rabbits) which may look old and slightly stupid now (I believe that this movie will start slowly) through the eyes of children. This is a fun movie and it's easy for children to take themselves into the children's places in the movie. Sad to be forgotten today
