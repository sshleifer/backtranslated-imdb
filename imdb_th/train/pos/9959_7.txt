If you are open enough to like a barber shop, then you will like this Canadian movie. <br /> <br /> If your mind is a closed mind like Fort Knox The score is: 2.5. <br /> <br /> This is a movie for everyone who prepares to watch movies from outside of their own ethnic areas. It's involved. It's true in life. In two or three times you lose connection between scenes. But many times, especially at the end, you will find yourself having tears or twice in your eyes and this is just because often Reflecting how life can be. <br /> <br /> I like and recommend that everyone who is open minded knows more than traditional American movies.
