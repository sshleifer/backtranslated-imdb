William Powell was Philo Vance in "The Kennel Murder Case" in 1933, a movie starring Mary Astor, Paul Cavanagh, Eugene Palette, Helen Vinson and Ralph Morgan. His Scottish Sciurge acted as the backdrop of a mysterious room locked with too many suspects. The mystery is very intelligent and the storyline is complex and interesting. The camera is still a little still, but Michael Curtiz works well in directing the action. <br /> <br /> The supporting actors are great. All actors brought this movie up. Many actors play Philo Vance, including Paul Lukas, Basil Rathbone, Wilford Hyde-White, Edmund Lowe, James Stephenson, Alan Curtis, Warren William and others. Powell plays the most (five times) and is most suitable for roles - Very relaxed but serious at the same time This happened before the "thin man" that made him a stellar actor - he spent about 12 years in the film and began his career on stage in 1912 at the age of 20, an amazing man. Amazing and amazing Actor who is almost 92 years old. We are very fortunate to have his films published on DVD and TCM today. "The Kennel Murder Case" is a great story and a fun movie that shouldn't be missed.
