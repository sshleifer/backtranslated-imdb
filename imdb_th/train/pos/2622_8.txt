Everyone, my name may sound strange. But nothing else! <br /> <br /> I've never seen anything like this before. It's crazy! Of course that is a good thing. It's a ridiculously interesting movie and my favorite thing is the way they combine things together! Like the little chicken, the fish that pretends to be King Kong and Runt the pig say "The beauty of the Twas that killed the beast" The world war scene and many more this In addition, the way they make it look like they're watching movies and it's like a home theater. <br /> <br /> However, some parts don't fit. Like in the original lion king Timon and Pumba and Simba when he can't beat the Scarlet? In this movie, they are not! They fought backstage hyenas. Moreover, the reason why Pumba was not so confident was because he had been driven by other animals and was only Timon Timon. No one knows that only Timonn's story has been told, while pumbaa has only an incident. <br /> <br /> But other than that
