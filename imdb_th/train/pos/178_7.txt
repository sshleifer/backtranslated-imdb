"Protocols" is a popular image starring Goldie Hawn as a cocktail waitress who returned one night to save the Arabs from the assassination. The woman immediately became famous and got a new job working for the US government. The path of power in the capital of our country will be the same? Hawn is great as usual, although "Protocol" is not as funny as her best movie, "Private Benjamin", but it's still a good movie and I laugh a lot. <br /> <br /> *** ( From four stories)
