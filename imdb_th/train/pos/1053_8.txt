The sister brother-in-law was made by the same director as 'Divorce, Iranian Style' which was very interesting as stated as we saw the divorce court in Iran Now they turn their attention to the court system in Cameroon, Africa. The great thing about this court is that two judges are women who are unusual for this country. However, they deal with many men who use their travels. But this film is remarkable in the fact that it appears that women have made great strides in societies with divorce and women's rights laws. Therefore, judges often punish men who behave in the traditional way at these times. Do not say that women who appear in court will be treated smoother. One of the main highlights of this film is the case of child abuse by Aunt. The judge did not waste time in beating women with anger. And who says that justice does not work anymore with these 2 behind the throne They are always the highest punishment! Ya! You go to women!
