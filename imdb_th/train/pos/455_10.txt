"Magic" is not too strong for this movie spell. You find yourself feeling relaxed and seeing others in a more generous light ... All movies that affect civilization to the audience deserve serious attention. We don't have much beauty. As if it were not enough, it was funny But the special mention must be made from the fantastic Miranda Richardson and the wonderful Josie Walker - both as a rose Forever
