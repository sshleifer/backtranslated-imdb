The first time I discovered Alexander Cader (1940), a fantasy suspect in the early 1950s, about re-billing in the title of "The Wonder Show of the Century!" Korda Technicolor, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK are screened in the only program that will never forget Miklos Rozsa's song. Raise both movies. Texts in each piece are incredibly beautiful! THE THIEF OF BAGDAD is still on my list as the best fantasy movie ever. Over time, it was even more difficult to enjoy the color of the movie in the way that it was first presented. True Technicolor gave the process to Eastman Color in the mid-1950s, both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn. Released new movies both in the style and in the video But the prints of Eastman Color have a more natural pastel color and the original sound of Technicolor vibrations. The name of the Laser Disc's debut also has pastel colors - well, but not as it should have been. About the MGM DVD (December 3, 2002), the bandits of Baghdad once again had a spectacular technique on DVD that was nothing short of amazing !!! It's very exciting to see this again after watching the DVD again. I watched it a second time. The only "Extras" is the Spanish, Sub-Titles, both English and Spanish versions, and original movie trailers created. Beautifully, thanks to MGM for this great DVD release. Now only hope that Korda FEURERS FOURERS and JUNGLE BOOK Korda models have been recovered. (To replace the dissemination of bad public domain publicity) will follow on the DVD shortly
