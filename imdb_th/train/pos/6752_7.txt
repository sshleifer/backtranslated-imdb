The detective (Dana Andrew), famous for his unintentional violence, killed a suspect in a murder case. (Craig Stevens) then tried to cover it. The movie directed by Otto Preminger has a lot of atmosphere. But the story failed when the deceased wife (Gene Tierney) fell in love with Andrew. He digs in and out of the big hole fairly well. But she was very light at the end of the tunnel for the film Noir. Gary Merrill was great, like the Scalese, the bandit leader Andrews was obsessed with and the tension between them made the film powerful and especially driven in the bathhouse with Merrill, Andrews and Neville Brand and the night time meeting of Bellevue Hospital that defines what should be the conclusion of the movie High scores for the atmosphere, Andrews, Merrill, etc ... and the general description of the mafia, although the love corner and good police elements are simple, it doesn't help anything.
