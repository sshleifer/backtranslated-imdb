From modern feelings, sometimes it is difficult to watch old movies. It's annoying to watch the librarian of the stereotypical flower, having to remove the glasses and be beautiful and stupid in order to win men. Especially those who are shallow and unstable Obviously he is a player. (I will not trust him firmly with her) who do not want to settle down to look at attractive women and often call them "babies" (ick!) Even after she changes her appearance and her life for him Only But went to find her after another woman (refused) and knew that Connie used all of her money to repair the ship for him I want you to stand up to him, not to pursue him poorly! His sudden conversion within a few minutes is totally unrealistic and ineffective for me. <br /> <br /> In addition to that subplot, I like movies. How did you like the crew that danced together! (You can tell that they are from San Francisco ....; D) "Rehearsal" dance is great. Ginger Rogers watch accidentally falls and leaves. "The right steps" are excellent. The latest dance scene "Face the Music" with beautiful dresses and beautiful Art Deco dresses And I enjoyed "We Saw the Sea" (although they used it too many times, as if they knew it was their best song) <br /> <br /> continue to plot It's slightly weak, like most musicals (IMO) - and the music is ok. But dancing is worth watching this movie. I hope that they will show some pictures of San Francisco. Since then, this movie should be set. <br /> <br /> It was strange to see a light-hearted naval movie that There is a knowledge of what Hitler is doing at the time. I have to try to suppress all knowledge in order to sink the land of fantasy.
