I must say that I was surprised by the quality of the movie. Better than I expected Scenes and performances are quite good. The director also performed well. Although some scenes are quite awkward But it is a good movie overall The idea was absolutely fantastic and the truth didn't reveal itself until the end. The atmosphere of the mental hospital is quite good. The plot is clear, consistent and well thought. Some people may find it a little boring because the story is very important and they take time to develop characters and stories. The moral of the story is a good movie for its genre and it is amazingly good.
