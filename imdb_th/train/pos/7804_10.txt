I watched this movie over and over again. I have to watch it at least once a week. I came from Africa and watched that movie, taught me something that I didn't even know about Africa. Denzel's movies were filled with lessons for people with a way of life. I hope he will be my own brother. I saw and loved Masala Mississipi. It was an exciting situation when Denzel tried to ask his brother to work for me to think about my teenage years when my brother was always angry about making myself busy. Time My brother always takes care of my old father and he wants to see me as well. Where did Denzel get an African accent in the Cry Freedom movie? I've seen this movie for the first time in Africa and I don't know whether Denzel is an American until I moved down here.
