It's a movie! I never imagined that Richard Attenborough would have this movie in him. Gandhi let me stay indifferent in addition to Ben Kingsley's performances, and I never thought that Attenborough was an exceptionally good filmmaker, but Cry Freedom had a similar interest in the movie a few times. It is an exciting and fascinating political movie with great performances by Kevin Kline and Denzel Washington. <br /> <br /> Kline plays Donald Woods, a South African newspaper editor who is a friend. Civil Rights Movement Steve Biko It started with a difficult friendship because Woods saw that Biko was a black preacher who hated white people, but Biko, with polite words, a clear attitude and complete transparency, wins over Woods and introduces him. Know the truth about apartheid which Woods didn't know at all. <br /> <br /> Biko is a good citizen and complies with the law. Stand against the injustice and the system that prevents his people One night from an illegal meeting, he was arrested and executed until death. Officials tried to close this story because Biko became a great personality in South Africa. But with the efforts of Woods, the truth appeared. But what should be achieved is just a nightmare when Woods and his family become the target of the secret police. <br /> <br /> This film has an interesting structure. In fact, there are two stories: First, it describes Biko's life and death. It is an incredible first half that dominates Washington's charm in what might be his greatest work. <br /> <br /> Interesting second half is a forest that tries to escape from South Africa to publish books. About Biko Woods became an enemy of the state as a forbidden person, meaning that he could not meet people or leave his country. Including him being scouted by the police all the time. Kevin Kline gave a great performance in the second half of this year. <br /> <br /> Although the first half is quite straightforward But the second thing is interesting by fixing by Biko's past events and events that show the suppression of black South Africa. Some people may argue that this is making it more interesting. But for me in the second half, like the cuteness, while Woods and his family plan to escape the bold South Africa. <br /> <br /> The last minute I broke my tears, George Fenton's points and Jonas Gwangwa is certainly involved in this matter. Although I have never been a big fan of Fenton. (Can't stand his Gandhi score) but I think the score for Freedom is one of the most beautiful things ever written for a movie theater. The movie that thanks to the song that is married to a powerful image, sometimes reaching the peak of emotion. <br /> <br /> Cry Freedom is not a movie that will definitely look like Denzel Washington. Performing, writing, music, editing, shooting movies together in perfect synthesis to create poetry for the power of the human spirit. This film deserves a place close to movies such as The Pianist, Life Is beautiful and The Shawshank Redemption.
