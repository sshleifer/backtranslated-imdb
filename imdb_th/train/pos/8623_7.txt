DER TODESKING is not one of the movies Jorg Buttgereit that I like - but it's also an interesting movie about suicide and is a reason and a network. Those looking for a festival or taking advantage of the NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM movie style may be disappointed. DER TODESKING is a "house art" style movie, so those who want to describe linearly and do not need to use ... <br /> < br /> The basic concept of DER TODESKING is that there are "episodes" for each day of the week that have strange chain letters that make people commit suicide, alternating with scenes of rotting dead bodies ... <br /> <br / > There are some things that can be done And that is the motivation. Including men who talk about "problems" with their wives and massacres in concerts (Which, unfortunately, some of it "power" with me because I'm too busy to laugh, laugh with the band SCORPIONS that looks like on the stage ...) but seriously - this is sometimes beautiful (The scenes that show the different angles of the big bridge are especially effective - especially if you understand the importance of the scene and the name shown is definitely someone who committed suicide ...) Sometimes confusing, stupid (SHE WOLF OF THE SS RIP-OFF is quite amusing) sometimes harrowing (I found that the scene of the guy talking to the girl in the park about his wife, in particular). The movie "experience" is more than just entertainment because these "art" movies are very meaningful. Even so, I still didn't find DER TODESKING as strong as NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM and may be placed on a base that is relatively related to NEKROMANTIK 2 in terms of my personal "enjoyment level". Of course, it is worth watching the movie "Art" of Buttgereit. Or if you dig this type of movie, try SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY - in my opinion, the best art-house / horror movie I've seen 7/10 for DER.
