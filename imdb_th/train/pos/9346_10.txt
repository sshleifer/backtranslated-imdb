If you don't enjoy this movie, whether you're dead or you hate Adam Sandler or Don Cheadle, <br /> <br /> Every great actor gives a good performance. This film proves that Adam Sandler is a good actor, despite what the critics say. Adam Sandler became a famous actor. Everything started with his performance in Big Daddy. He then created two bad movies. Then he passed a great performance in the first 50 days at the Longest Yard. Then click and now occupy my position. < br /> <br /> Back to the movie Adam Sandler plays the man who lost everything. The closest thing to his family is his mother, husband and father. After his former college roommate (Cheadle) ran into him, he seemed to change his life. I won't say anything anymore because I don't want to destroy the movie. But I recommend this movie One of the best movies of 2007
