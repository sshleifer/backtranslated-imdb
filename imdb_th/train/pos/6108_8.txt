I enjoy this movie a lot. Many Korean people will feel familiar with this movie because many people have tutors when going to school. Movies are average. This movie is probably better if the fairy or the movement of the camera is more unusual. However, the editing is neat and unusual. <br /> <br /> The performance is also very good. Kim Ha Neul often plays as a naive and weak girl in Korean opera. But this time, she played Tomboy very well. Kwon Sang Woo also plays a credible role. <br /> <br /> The thing I like the most about this movie is that the character's emotions are not over-realistic There are many Korean love movies that the characters cry in the river in front of the audience and I always think it's very old. No shit in this movie. <br /> <br /> Funny and very well done.
