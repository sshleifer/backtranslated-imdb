The famous leader decided after a heart attack back to the village where he was born to live a quiet life. There he came to the Dutch with a choir of a local church that would change his life. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect it when I watched this movie for the first time yesterday. I like watching foreign movies that are not English and I've seen two Swedish movies before in my life. But this movie is the best until now. <br /> <br /> Where to start? In my opinion, this movie is a gem, thanks to many things, one of which is a great performance. Michael Nyqvist is perfect as a musician. Daniel Daréus, who is almost shy and devoted, Frida Hallgren, beautiful and charming Lovely smile and her delicate performances The choir members develop interesting characters with their own stories. <br /> <br /> This film tells stories of beautiful stories about music, love, pain, memories, death about men. Dedicate his life to music and those who try to create peace in the village he was born while trying to make peace with the past and with his way of life. Until now, Kay Pollack shows us that the Swedes are outstanding filmmakers. Go see Så som i himmelen. It is a movie that makes you think about life and love and it makes you feel comfortable as well.
