Although I didn't start to read "classics" in literature until I was 47, but it wasn't too late. Jane Eyre was a favorite for a number of reasons, mostly because there was no part of the book I liked. The part that I like very much A small 1983 TV series featuring Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton is everything I hope to be. I saw that it was a full-length movie. In 2006, Milton was 'Mr. Rochester'. Very good, but I love Zelah's 'Jane Eyre'. The selection of another 'classic' movie I saw recently. I was disappointed in producing directions and conversations. It is only honesty of Hollywood's greed and arrogance. The artistic license for the great work in the literature is not there. But the copy The use of the name after the license is fraudulent. Leave it at Brits to get this right. You will not be able to read the book again without having to review the movie with appropriate context and spirit. Very well done, bbc
