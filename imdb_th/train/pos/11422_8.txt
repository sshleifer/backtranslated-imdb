Claire Denis's Chocolat is a beautiful movie. But disappointing This film presents a very interesting image of the European colonial family home that lives in Cameroon, giving viewers a perspective that is information about the lives of many characters and their interactions. he However, the development of these characters is often shockingly inadequate. For example, the important issue in this regard is that the young French cannot build strong relationships with others. Although this image was executed impeccably, especially in the way Denis set the storyline with scenes from France returning to her childhood home. But the woman lacks the intimacy with other characters of the movie, making it difficult for the viewer or lacking it) as the protagonist of the general stagnation of the character's development, making it difficult to participate in the plot The rules are loosely related. This film creates a lot of tension between the characters, especially between Aimee and the man in her life. But never fully talked about this social conflict, causing the audience to be dissatisfied The last few scenes are powerful but depressing. Denise's work is interesting from an intellectual and historical perspective. But if you are looking for a movie with adventure or drama, Chocolat is definitely not the best option.
