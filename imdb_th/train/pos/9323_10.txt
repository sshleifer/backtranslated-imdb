For me, this movie is very powerful. I don't want to be a spoiler. But I have friends many years ago We are like brothers This film brings back vivid memories. <br /> <br /> For some reason, I can't vote for this movie, which will be 10. I still get messages like "No voting at all ..." Still, I still see the statistics available. Will try again tomorrow (Monday). <br /> <br /> A little flaw that I overlooked It is the relationship between the characters that received me. Perform beautifully and the real situation I am in their partner. <br /> <br /> The small gem of the movie, like "Spring Forward", is another gem that is overlooked. I am very happy that these movies are still being created. About the relationship between people, writing well, spread out gently with performances and first class directions In the end, that's all about
