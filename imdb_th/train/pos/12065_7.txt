"Insignificance" is far from a great movie from the stage, directed by Nic Roeg, in the form of Roeg's movie. Theresa Russo, in fact, she is very good here and far from the problems in other Roeg movies such as "Bad Timing" and "Cold Heaven" as an "actor" who is Marilyn Monroe Russell. That is very effective. She is a depressed siren. But is a favorite She played well alongside Michael Emil as Einstein, the best to say the least. He seems to have an admirable role, and while Theresa Russell is not like Monroe, she is interesting enough to make the ring true. Other players are enough if not quite as appealing as Emil and Russell. The intelligent and well-used script is directed by Roeg but is not clear, such as "Walkabout" or "Performance" as in other movies of Roeg has a tendency to rely on ambiguous and ambiguous events, which add little to this film. In many ways, this film will work better as a shorter ( 60 minutes) Simple piece Is still a movie that is quite acceptable Sometimes excellent But quite lacking overall rating: - *** 1/2 / *****
