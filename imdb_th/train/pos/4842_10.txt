If Arthur Askey's ideas make you brave, don't worry, you can still watch and love The Ghost Train as well as the Back Room Boy, which is equally great. It's a movie that's too good to sink. Even performances of leading actors Personally, I love Askey. Perhaps because I entered his world instead of expecting him to enter the mine without justification, a mistake many people make. The ghost train has an atmosphere that is so intense that you can't see it without being surprised. In a dark and deep world that takes you, it will soak in the way that a few cheerful flags. '40s And is a movie that I imagine a few people who have only watched once The actor is especially good. Perhaps Linden Travers will be thick, but with the backdrop of a lonely train station at war. She rarely gets to play Nutter and striking the sad passing of Carole Lynne's lovely past year. Destroy the last link we had with this amazing movie and now it's a story in the past. But wait patiently for us to press play
