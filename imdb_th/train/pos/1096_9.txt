I saw this movie for the first time in 1980 in the movie viewing point at noon. After watching many times (And buy a video) It also makes me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is reminiscent of another era - a comedy movie in a country that is in a wealthy middle class America. But was executed well Perform well But it is also a document of its age - a celebration of optimism after the baby boom and the age of defenseless consumers This film is not happy. "Wrong" <br /> <br /> Three great actors - urbane Melvyn Douglas; Stunned Carrie Grant; Shockingly define Myrna Loy - complement each other and the memorable character team. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene - "means we have to explode" and "Miss Stellwaggen" and "this little piglet" <br /> <br /> love
