May be the best movie of the year for me. This small French film is placed at the office of Secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos), who spent the whole day working for others, uncredited and a source of insulting and daytime dialogue that was too clear for her to read the lips The change was moving when she was hired by Vincent Cassel as her assistant. The relationship that develops between them is the center of the movie. Interdependence for many different reasons, binding them. Carla is attracted to Paul and the fact that he makes her feel attracted to things that seem first. Paul did nothing to release her feelings because he needed help from her. He owes money to the local gangster and plans to steal from him, which is related to Carlas' lip reading skills. I think the main thing that pushed this movie above the suspense / average drama is the amazing chemistry between Two stars Throughout the movie, no matter what other characters are on the screen, you will feel the amazing bond between Carla and Paul. I can't remember when I saw the sex chemistry between the two actors. Emmanuell Devos gave a great performance. (She won the French Cesar award for the best actor). You never felt that you were watching this show. Carla is really a chameleon like Vincent Cassel is also great. He makes the characters quite unattractive, both attracting and attracting. I love this movie because these two people and both times when I finished watching it, I want to go back to the cinema and relate to them again.
