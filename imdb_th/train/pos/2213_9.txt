Wow, this is a movie that is very impressive. I can't believe that I started to wake up. But it came at the end of the ounce. I started watching. I couldn't stop it. There were all very good actors. Even Eartha Kitt and Ruby Forest, Whitaker and James Earl Joan. And many well-known actors and actors, this is more than a history that opens the eyes to another part of the society that people do not know and may be embarrassed to talk I have never heard a book or movie about it before, and this is something that black history never looks, just because they have privacy and a variety of races. I would like to recommend this movie.
