The first time I saw this movie, I loved it so much. It's different. <br /> <br /> I'm a Christian. (Believe in the Bible) I do not go with the crowd of right-wing believers. I fell out of that atmosphere. <br /> <br /> For me, in their efforts to control our government, they are doing what Judas is trying to do. I called it Judas Syndrome. <br /> <br /> Judas didn't understand, even though Jesus said that his kingdom was not in this world. <br /> <br /> This film definitely shows. br /> <br /> I like that Jesus enjoys playing games and jokes with his disciples. <br /> <br /> He is a very beautiful Jesus. <br /> <br /> It's a movie. <br /> <br /> Very pleasant.
