This is a wonderful noir movie in the modern era .... "Excellent" in interesting stories from beginning to end. There are some holes and some stupid parts that make you shaky in unbelief ..... but I do not find anyone who does not sink in this matter. The movie has a number of suspicious action, suspense, plot, twists and interesting characters. In addition, there are sports that provide good colors and movies, including sound tracks from good guitars. <br /> <br /> I labeled this crime movie "Film Noir" because it has guts. Audacious and not all characters are good Even the only good man played by Nicholas Cage still has a problem with lies and a quick relationship that he shouldn't do. He also did something in the end which was wrong. But I will not spoil it by speaking When it can be said that the remaining characters are so bad that the cage looks good! <br /> <br /> Speaking of "bad guys", there are not many people who can do better than Dennis Hopper. At least in the "Daft" category, he is difficult to overcome. Enjoy watching for many reasons. JT Walsh provides excellent support as well. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies that has never been released much. You will enjoy watching this thing. By the way, try to say the name of the movie out loud three times faster without making it chaotic!
