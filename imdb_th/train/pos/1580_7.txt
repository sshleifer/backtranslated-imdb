This is not looking for another disaster. But it is a story about events that take place on a small street in Berlin and related people The film begins today in New York City, where Ruth Winestein (Jattalampe) is sad about the death of her husband and family members, all gathered at her side. Ruth Hannah's daughter (Maria Schrader) gradually realizes that her mother was raised by an Aryan woman named Lena Fischer (Doris Schade), so she traveled to Germany and set 90 years old, telling her about Events in Rosenstrasse <br /> <br /> ***** Alerts Spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> Lena talks about Berlin in 1943 at Gestapo to catch all Jewish spouses. In the building on the Rosenstrasse road, though they should Immune to the marriage with the Aryan and for nine days, a group of women would wait outside and shout for release. Ruth, eight years old (Svea Lohde) waited for her mother to come out and nowhere to go but she found 33-year-old Lena (Katrina Mun), who took her in. The husband of Lena Fabian (Martin Fifefel) came in to meet the Nazi authorities so that they could do something. <Br /> <br /> This film is By Margaret von Cosmo Eye creator of a documentary film about her first in nearly 10 years working in television. From more provocative efforts, she remains one of the most highly regarded directors in Europe. This is not one of the Nazi movies that we watched for cruel acts against Jews, even though we have seen intense treatment. But it is a small event that means life and death of the people involved. This film does not try to shock anyone or open the door for debate in the situation. But what it wants to do is just shine a small event, but it's a real life that happened during history. Part of the strength of the film comes from the actors and there is a good performance that is shown through, especially by Riemann and Lohde who are young and always good to see Schrader (Aimee & Jaguar) in an important role. This is not a great movie or something that will change your perspective in World War II. But considering that the innocent life was executed because of the incident, I think the only reason is important to tell this true story.
