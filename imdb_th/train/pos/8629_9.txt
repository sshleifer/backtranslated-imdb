I read a small ad in a horror magazine in the early decades about Liebe des Totes (love of the dead) or something similar. Of course, this is to awaken my curiosity, so I ordered the Nekromantik 1 & 2 and the Der Todesking (The Death King). Nekromantik movies are okay, even interesting and unique in their approach to Necrophilia (though They are clearly seen as horror-opera shows instead of intending to cause fear in their hearts.> <br /> TODESKING In my opinion, one of the best movies ever created. It consists of scenes showing various aspects of death, death as enemies. Death as a deliverer of death is a huge decay of the body. This movie is a lifelong metaphor. It shows how fragile life is and how short our lives are. It reduces the audience into the children they (we) are true. The fact that we cannot really understand the nature of death and hence the whole process of death is the main message of this film. This is the most realistic movie. Buttgereit never tries to hide death after a white rose or whatever. No matter what moral standards you set, death cannot be avoided, and sooner or later it is not fiction. But it's your truth This applies to Dear Reader as it does for movie viewers. Some youth examiners do not seem to understand this, which is a complete solution, because of course they will live forever ... <br /> <br /> This is not a movie about exploitation. Why? Because death does not take advantage of us It harvested us We grow for seven days, then we will be brought back to the pre-birth state of Schopenhauerian That is death. Buttgereit makes us the oldest tales. Whether you choose to look at it as "optimistic" or "pessimistic" depends on you. When first glance, it may be very dark. Consider that in order to make something alive, other things must die. "Who wants to live forever?" <br /> <br /> I believe that when Buttgereit shows the body that has been eaten by the worm, he shows that not only decayed but created a new life. Would it be better to die and give life to a worm then become a bird and eventually become earth instead of a living dead zombie, one of this favorite animal? <br /> <br /> When you realize this, you see Der Todesking as the correct context. <br /> <br /> Cap Sieben Tage dies. Woche, siebenmal letzte Stunden seven is the day of the week. (Human weakness!) Seven times in the last hour. <br /> <br /> Don't be afraid of the Reaper, Buttgereit tells us because the Reaper uses only cooked things. And an apple that does not pull food will rot! <br /> <br /> Have a good life, other friends! <br /> <br /> (and watch this movie compare to Ingemar Bergmans "the seventh seal "In terms of depth and universality)
