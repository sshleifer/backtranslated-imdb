The girl came to her husband's hometown after he left with an accident. She barely settled in this small town, but soon after, her son was kidnapped and all her hopes ... This can lead to various plans in the movie as usual: find a new life partner. And finally happy Or depressed enough to eventually fight and commit suicide ... She tried to commit suicide. But after continuing to fight with God She trusts in God only to find that God forgives everyone, even the murderer. Well, I should be careful here about God. The movie doesn't mean anything to God. The way in which the movie deals with this issue is quite interesting: not in the perspective of a woman or from the perspective of God. (In this way, there will be a lot of grass growth, clouds that can see the flight) but from the eyes of the third person, the movie makes us understand and don't explain anything. Interested for that woman There is this man everywhere around the woman and clearly falls in love with her. But in his style He is funny like a clown that I should say unscrupulously hanged our heroine. The combination of these two women, full of tension, always crying and throwing, and the man smiled and spoke stupidly, ended up with a good balance of emotions: nothing unusual, laughable or boring /> <br /> highly recommended
