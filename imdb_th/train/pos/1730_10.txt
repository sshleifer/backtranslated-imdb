A quiet gem that does not tell the true story of the POW escape during World War II. The performance is great, especially Anthony Steele. This film can work in many levels: brain, emotion, image and character. The conversation is really intelligent and loud. In fact, every round of authenticity makes this head and shoulders above most epic battles.
