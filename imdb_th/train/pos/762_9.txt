I enjoy watching people breakdance dance, especially if they do well in the best scene of this movie, which takes you to the disco club called "Roxy" especially at Christmas because of "MC Santa Claus "Appears. <br /> <br /> Although this is an old movie, and even though I was filming a video from the TV, when State Movie Archive of Finland performed in the summer of 2004 on my own big screen Go there to check It's more fun on the big screen than on TV. <br /> <br /> Although many people here think that watching on the big screen is a waste of money for the ticket, I don't agree with this and I think when I paid my ticket, I received money from watching this thing because it was on a large screen, especially sitting at the front of the cinema. An unforgettable and better experience in the video.
