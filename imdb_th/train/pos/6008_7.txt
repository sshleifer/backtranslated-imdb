When I first watched this movie in the early 1970s, I was afraid of this movie. It is an amazing story and events on campus in Europe and the United States make you involved in what Antonioni is trying to talk about in the last 15 minutes of the movie: remind you of "dictator" establishments and business interests. large The repeated explosion of a beautiful house in the desert, the female characters bring to enjoy the natural cold currents, drawing planes in psychedelic designs. (Even British Airways was made a few years ago) as some of Images that have been copied by advertising personnel around the world for decades. Even Pink Floyd added their fans after the film's release. <br /> <br /> You saw this movie in the next 30 years. And you start to wonder why the same movie lost its charm The current anti-establishment films have more content than the original - facts, documents, good performances and excellent screenplays. Antonioni seems to be outdated; Flawed genius Even today, Antonioni's "Blow Up" watch feels like he is passing. <br /> <br /> "Zabriski point" must be evaluated for what it used to be when released. It's a great movie if you see it on the wide Panavision screen compared to the screen, dwarf, picture and ear TV (Mick Jagger, Kieth Richards, Pink Floyd and others). The charm of this movie remains. The leading couple is not a great actor. But they are cute and natural. One of them (Mark Frechette) died in a prison in the United States to expand the reality of values ​​that were not as he presented in movies. <br /> <br /> Today Antonioni does not seem to "sync" but look carefully and you will be impressed with the muted sounds of regular actors - Rod Taylor, GD Spradling, the women at the pool, the police at the weather bar. The true voice, on the other hand, comes from those who do not agree. Antonioni is related 30 years ago, but his media ability cannot be questioned even today. He knew what he was doing.
