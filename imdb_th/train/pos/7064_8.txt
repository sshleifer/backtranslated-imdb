Deanna Durbin saved the life of Universal from bankruptcy and made it still a large studio. In the mid-30s, most of the major directors at Universal, such as Milestone, Browning and Wyler, were only James Vale. But his famous horror movie is behind him Deanna and Judy Garland appeared briefly as "Every Sunday" and in the beginning Garland was recommended for the role of Penny in "Three Smart Girls" when Garland was unavailable. Universal changed Was Durbin. At first she was a supporting player. But her potential is so bright that the script is rewritten to make her a star. Directed by Henry Koster, this film is European. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a spectacular view of the lake in "Switzerland" "Three Wise Girls" of the name - Three Girls Joan (Nan Gray), Kay (Barbara Read) and Penny (Dina Durbin) are sailing with Penny to Her glorious voice and "My heart is singing." All is not good in front of their house. Their father plans to marry a woman (Binnie Barnes), so the three girls with the help of a trustworthy nurse (Lucille Watson) decide to go to New York and Reunited with their mother, Lucille Watson, best remembered for her role as Robert Taylor's strict mother in "Waterloo Bridge" (1941) <br /> <br /> Donna is a gold digger who comes with her scary mother (Alice Brady) married to Judson Craig (Charles Winninger) for People who do not have experience in the movie, Dean seems to be wonderful like a penny, which is more annoying than the energetic sister and she is as beautiful as the picture When she sings "The person who cares for me" for her father. You will melt - the most loud voice you have. She still has one of the most fun lines in the movie. When her father comforted her "I'll take you to the zoo tomorrow." She replied, "Oh, I see enough monkeys here!" <br /> <br /> With the help of Bill Evans (John King), they decide. Hire "Count" (Mischa Auer) for love. They meet at a nightclub. But because there is a mixture of Lord Michael Stuart (Ray Millland) was counted wrong and Donna fell in love with him. (She thinks he is half the owner of Australia !!!) This plan fails. Kay and Donna want to speed up her marriage with Judson. <br /> <br /> Penny decides to handle things with her own hands. And ran away She was taken to the local police station where she was charming with the police by translating "Il Bacio" (she tried to convince them to be small opera singers). Everything ended happily with their mother ( Nella Walker) Things that have happened to their father, and at the same time, Donna makes people recognize the number of false (Mischa Auer) and travel to Australia with him. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
