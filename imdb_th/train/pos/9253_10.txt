This movie is not "funny". <br /> <br /> Okay, I agree that there are a few HUMOROUS connections, but there is nothing funny. For example: Before the hot sex scene between Eleniak and one of her men, she was handcuffed to the bed pole and he couldn't remove her shirt. Before leaving the room to receive the key, he told her "Okay, don't go anywhere." <br /> <br /> Look funny but not funny. <br /> <br /> Story and The performance is quite good. <br /> <br /> But Erika Eleniak definitely steals the show. She's hot and sexy and has a scene full of heat with her that can't help but go back and see again. <br /> <br /> There are also many other sexy scenes that She has a line. <br /> <br /> Overall 5 stars. I will give three if not for Erika Eleniak.
