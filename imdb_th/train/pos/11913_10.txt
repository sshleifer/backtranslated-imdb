This is a great movie for body builders and female action fans! I think Sue Price did a great job in this movie series (Nemesis 2,3,4) and proved to be a great fighter. She has a distinctive appearance and is willing to resist the powerful nebula (Nemesis 2). Although it is not a valuable movie and Sue Price's acting skills are not the best things to find in my life. But the movie itself is a wonderful thing, a precious gem for fans of action figures to create a woman's body! Now, some parts of Nemesis 2 are copied from other famous sci-fi movies, such as Terminator or Predator. But that's not the point. A.Puyn is shown in this film as a very talented body builder. Her energy and body abilities show us that she is doing the best. I really enjoyed this movie and watched with the same enthusiasm. Nemesis 3 (a boring sequel) and Nemesis 4 (a sequel that is more interesting than 3). Unfortunately, it doesn't appear on DVD :-(
