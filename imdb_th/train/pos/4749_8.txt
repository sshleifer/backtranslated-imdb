I enjoy this movie very much and it is difficult to do that when your brother expresses a stupid comment within 30 seconds. But I like this movie, mostly because I am used to action movies HK. In general, most movies like this do not look like the story, so look for actions that are not interested. And the illogical action is correct. You will see Jet Li Jump spin, kick, shoot, shoot, jump, jump, jump and not countless bullets. It is true that the film was launched to a wider audience after Li was in Lethal Weapon 4. That's one of the reasons the movie's ratings declined. Most people may expect to see movies that are as beautiful as movies in North America. But you have to remember that most Hong Kong movie budgets are not as high as North American movies and the style in Hong Kong action movies is often very different, which often requires a lot of wire work. You should see this, just try to ignore the copy. <br /> <br /> My rating is 8.
