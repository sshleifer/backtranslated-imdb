I saw this item about 3-4 years ago. It's a funny dam! When I first saw it, I played on ETV (Estonian Television) and I started to like it. Terrible that the show was a bad time for me. Hyde is a cool guy who likes to sing Frank Sinatra! And he came in a stupid idea He got these glasses, which were brown. I liked it. And with the wrong group interface, we all know what he does when alone ..... He wants to be put badly. He even reached his boss at one point. He came from India. And Michael, the most stupid person in the group, may be a fool in the city and police He was so stupid that I remembered: Hyde said: Do you call the police? - No, Michael came in and said Does anyone know how to turn off the siren? He is a playboy city. Jackie, Michael's former girlfriend, then she is Hyde's girlfriend. Then Eric, who is the son of a disgruntled veteran and the son of Kitty, the maid One big pussy of him But he loves Donna, his girlfriend and the people they plan to get married. Donna is one hot girl Um, I forgot something. Hyde is in the basement
