There are many good things to say about this movie "B". <br /> <br /> "B" may be in connection. This is the best story of the genre I have ever seen. A grade effort by Universal Script is well done, with imagination and without errors. Writing credits: the original story of Howard Higgins and the story of Douglas Hodges, John Colton (screenplay), director Lambert Hillier, handles complex matters and locations It very good There is no cross-loading of extras and locations. I love Beulah Bondy (the mother of Jimmy Stewarts in "It's A Wonderful Life"). Leader Frances Drake is a beautiful person and takes care of her part with grace and pathetic for Karloff's husband She Lugosi as well. I think this is the best. The part that I remember seeing him while I said there were many good things: the discovery of radium "X" in Africa, the melting of stone statues. ((Remind the memories of the little ten Indians in there) (Agatha Christie) (Barry Fitzgerald version)) Karlof's glow in the dark. Karloff's mother played by Violet Kemble Cooper with grace and due to these virtues. I therefore found myself believing in the science that showed. Of fine art pieces
