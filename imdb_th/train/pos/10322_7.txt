The problem is that the movie came into the shirt of the concept that was created in the 60s that comic books can only "camp" (like Batman show 60s) for TV and movies. So you have a fight scene with a subtitle (come on!) Doctor Savage Savage (he's embarrassed with women in pulps, not an idiot) The Mayfair at night (The scene that guarantees to make you nightmares for many nights) and a completely different ending with the second bad guy is wrapped in gold like Herve Villechez, who poses as an Oscar. And when they didn't score, Sousa march flourished. The small "funny" song that inspired the drama. <br /> <br /> Even though this movie is ok ... it's Fun and when it remains serious, it is a very precise representation of the pulp. Except the monk that had been mentioned earlier: he had high muscles, not fat And try Tom, who is supposed to be a pale thin man with an attitude not Paul Gleason with a scarf (Inexplicable) <br /> <br /> For example, the sequence of death, green, scary and not my thing Recommended for children But they are very close to the feel of the pulp When the writers and producers make it right, they will make it right - I will give them the <br /> <br /> but if the producer has made a doctor with love and scripting, say Reeves first Two movies, Superman thinks that what we might have already I think the problem is a movie about schizophrenia. There was a clear feeling of trying to show respect in the 30s, but they tried to give an attitude that "The hero must be a camp" that Batman created Has anyone received the impression that there is a first body that has style and consciousness? Then there are people who say that "Hey, we made it funny - it worked with the Batman show 8 years ago!" <br /> <br /> The doctor spent his life thanking Earl MacRauch and Buckaroo Banzai if MacRauch didn't show respect to Doc Savage in the movie. That man will become truly crazy. So when the series actually gets on TV (Allegedly in the middle of the season in '99 -00) Doc Savage, which was updated to the 90s, will live again.
