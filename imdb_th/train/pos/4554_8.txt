There are many unimaginable stories like Christie Brown. Was born with a cerebral palsy in Dublin in 1930. His parents thought that his handicap had both mind and body. Although eventually being diagnosed properly, Brown, in the lower working class family, with nearly 20 children, had to push himself to his family to appreciate. Through the use of a fully functioning limb, only his left leg, he taught himself to write and paint the skills he developed expertly. <br /> <br /> But what makes Brown's autobiography "My Left Foot "This is a good story that is humble. Both director / writer Jim Sheridan and actor Daniel Day-Lewis have managed to tell this story in a way that doesn't scream for attention and turn around. Use the Cheesy's battle melodrama and the scene of frustration, including the moment of great victory, is an easy mistake of a miraculous story. But "My Left Foot" remains a true inspiration. Highlights Playing with anyone with severe physical disabilities is a must-do. Day-Lewis not only gives us Christie's complete picture. But he can also explain the growth, improvement and internal changes of the characters in different periods of his life He played Christy at the age of 17 when he had limited language abilities and mood swings, as well as Christie, who learned intellectually, struggling to cope with why he couldn't find unrestrained love. The latter theme is the strongest movie, and it would be good for Sheridan and Shane Connaughton to make the movie really come out. Regardless, Day-Lewis makes us understand and sympathize with all those elements. Actions that believe that you don't always have time to think "Wow, he's a great actor." These are the most admirable performances. <br /> <br /> Equally important, but with a more profound approach is Sheridan's work in the film. This story is about daily life and struggling. Although Christie has such a unique situation hindering his life, his struggles are not the same as ours and Sheridan seizes that concept completely. Christy struggles with love, caring from parents, questions about value and ability. His struggle is more physically expressed than ourselves. <br /> <br /> Sheridan gives a moment to capture the spirit of a large brown family and Christie's unique place. The drama evolved naturally when the highest tension and humor came in the same way. The dinner scene when Christie knew that his doctor / teacher - the woman he loved - was about to marry his brother. Peter is the best example of the movie Day-Lewis and Sheridan. It was created. Well, by Sheridan that it will come out when we are ready and Day-Lewis takes us from there with his amazing work. <br /> <br /> The other strong element of this film is Brenda. Tears I don't know if she will get an Oscar. But there is something about her performance as Christy's beloved and clever mother who just screamed Oscar. Her love for Christie and his constant struggles seem to be convincing and sincere and she has received many sympathy from her situation. <br /> <br /> Sting the emotions of this movie Maybe that is part of the sacrifice of trying to make a movie that feels like a human being. Both should be reconciled. But I think it is difficult to tell a story that feels like real life and another story that gives an amazing moment to convey our emotions on a roller coaster. The choice to look down after the wise person for "My left foot" Brown's situation speaks to himself - they don't have to be forced to get hit hard. <br /> <br /> ~ Steven C. <br /> <br /> Visit my website
