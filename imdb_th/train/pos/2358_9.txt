Pushing Daisies is just a lovely fairy tale with the shades of beauty and romance of "Amelie". It has a beautiful color palette, its image is thought out in detail and has detailed names and conversations that are strange and cute Than to be true, great imagination and deep love. <br /> <br /> Look at the blue sky. Because you can't find the blue in the scene or the rest (Except for some) <br /> <br /> See the strange and totally satisfying song in the scene. <br /> <br /> The score is great. There are many great songs and two leading romantic stars can't touch each other or she will die. How much sexual tension do you want? (In fact, I want them to find this way around, but c'est la vie) <br /> <br /> It's just an item that shows that it's a pleasure to spend an hour with and me. I highly recommend it. Never have other types of television before and I want to see more. It makes me feel uncomfortable in a week because it makes the company good. <br /> <br /> Bring it back!
