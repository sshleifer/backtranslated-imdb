Zombi 3 has an interesting history to create. First, it is the sequel to Fulci's popular Zombi 2, where Zombi 2 is definitely a marketing method to trick people into thinking it is the sequel to Dawn of the Dead, or better known as George A. Romero. Or not, in general, there are no movies related to others But who will be interested when making money I guess Fulse began to ignore the production about halfway through Zombi 3. When he decided to walk away, Bruno Mattei was brought up on the board to help make this movie with additional scenes to prolong. Working time <br /> <br /> The story of Zombi 3 is your typical zombie fare. Scientists develop a serum on the island in the Philippines. The terrorists steal it to release the plague and the zombies run rampant. Scientists want to create antidotes while soldiers are being purged of everyone without prejudice. There is also a short section of Radio DJ preaching about the way we treat the world. <br /> <br /> Overall, I really like this movie. I heard something scary But I found that the conversation was fun. This film seems to be an attempt to raise awareness about the damaged military. Man Playing God and others. I get the feeling that this is the focus of a movie. But it turned out in a strange direction. <br /> <br /> In addition to flicking other zombies, this is also reminiscent of Romero's The Crazies. You hear the DJ radio that announces the good news. "When you see a man in a white suit and a gas mask running towards them for help" Of course, this is a picture played with a man in a white suit that shoots zombies. After that, they stole the scene from the Crazies, one of the normal people who were not contaminated, killed unintentionally. <br /> <br /> The scary factor in this game is the zombies hordes around every corner. How cool is it? Let me count the various ways. 1. Born Zombie 2. Flying Zombie Head 3. Zombie Birds 4. Zombies without legs swim in the pool. My favorite zombie is the madness in the weapons at the gas station. He is a bad person and almost dismantled the entire building trying to kill the girl. <br /> <br /> Favorite message ?? When the sergeant confirmed the cremation, scientists asked "Don't you think that when the fly is in the air, it falls to the ground and contaminates everything?" So Sargeant replied bravely. "Now you're talking about science fiction." He also talks about "Science Fiction" that the scientist said at the end when everyone died. <br /> <br /> Special: Trailer Gallery and interviews, especially with Mattei, which he confirmed that he directed 40% of Scene but can't remember who or other important details. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: A must see for zombies and Fulci fans. <br /> <br /> Score: 7/10 < br /> <br /> Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com MySpace.com/HorrorYearbook
