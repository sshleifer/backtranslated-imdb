I saw this movie in the London theater in 1975 and never seen before. I found it hilarious. I like the originality of it. It's hard for someone to do a movie like this - and it's sad too. <br /> <br /> What I mean is that I've read a book called "The Black Hotel" - and as a movie fan, I'm always " Picture "The book is a movie rather" fine "You guys know? But when I read it, I thought this would create a great movie - but of course it would have to be "adapted" - to the point that it would have a relationship with the book. <br /> <br /> But I think why. What Of course, it can't be shown on TV Sunday afternoon. But if there is a show in a movie theater for adults, who knows what is there? Where is HARM? Dammit My freedom is over here. The director should be able to adapt the true movie of "The Black Hotel". <br /> <br /> In the ideal world, movie censorship for adults should not exist. But sadly, while I admit that with adults who have such freedom, may not be dangerous, there are people who lack the reason to distinguish between fantasy and reality and those who may be motivated to do things. Evil <br /> <br /> However, it's hard to see how "La Bete" falls into that category. <br /> <br /> From the appearance in England Although there was a '69 'nudity relaxation, but with the theoretical concept of this film, but the sensor passed any examination, he looked for a new job on Monday. <br /> <br /> But in ... There are other options. GLC. This is the local city council with a department that has the power to broadcast movies specifically for London which is considered by the audience. "Complexity" more than those who live in the forest. <br /> <br /> The movie has been submitted and certified. However, later it appeared that "the committee" consisted of only four people - three people who voted, including "president" and that day, one voter was sick. So the two remaining voters and the president sat down to see "La Bete". <br /> <br /> One of those voters thinks the same as me that this movie is funny and has Tendency to provoke illegal actions The other party lacks imagination and thinks that parts are disgusting. And the president did not understand, therefore decided the wrong side of FREEDOM. <br /> <br /> When the missing voters finally saw the movie, they thought it was disgusting. But it's too scary! The film received the "X-London" certificate and opened for a mixed response. G.L.C The film censorship board was canceled shortly thereafter! So "La Bete" is only open in London, by what can be called FLUKE! But I'm glad it was It's great! If you haven't seen it yet, do so. It's a fantasy and it's less disturbing than what you see in today's news ...
