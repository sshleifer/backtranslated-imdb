Then she went to find a friend and started selling drugs. Soon she will be addicted to drugs that she is selling. Her life was devastated, especially when her children were her eldest sons, searching for truth and threatening to leave her. Then she struggled to redeem herself with the help of her children, but she was able to protect her family from the drug lords she worked for. <br /> <br /> Wow! This lifetime movie has the best show I've ever seen! Diane Keaton did too much and her character came out like crazy. But she was very convinced She is more suitable for acting than comedy. However, the best performance in this film comes from Michael Seater, who plays her eldest son. He was perfect as a responsible son who was still young. But trying to be an adult in the family His performance was exceptional in the scenes in which he confronted the mother about drugs. Colin Roberts, who plays the youngest son, has done a great job. <br /> <br /> A movie that should be worth watching.
