My favorite movie all the time Everyone involved in the Oscar event can do both front and back cameras. The perfect screenplay and the relationship between Lady Caroline and George Riggs in a totally satisfying way, unlike the novel. The attention to other leading characters that were drawn into the screen writer for screenwriter Peter Barnes and the intense visual beauty should be awarded an Oscar for director Mike Newell. It was Joe Lawrence's best work and changed my opinion about Joan Plowright. When watching this movie at least 50 times, I didn't find any mistakes. The song by the famous composer Richard Rodney Bennet is a miracle.
