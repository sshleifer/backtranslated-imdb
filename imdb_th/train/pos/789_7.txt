The interest is a combination of drama, comedy and ironic stories that I find that English is very good when it's related to the heart. Known as director John McKay, writing a great screenplay about some forty friends in a small town in England, three professional women, unfortunately, men gathered together as a night ritual. Girls with gin, fags and desserts combined with endless talk of their date, wrong behavior or the needs of their libidos. Andie MacDowell threw again around England. (Which is where I find her the most exudes) is certainly charming as the female head of the prestigious school that deals with young men Gossip, a small town and a jealous friend who doesn't agree. (Good support) conflicts with her relationship. Exposes a series of unfortunate unfortunate events and shows us many difficulties when seeking true happiness. Remember that the main evidence of this film is friendship and ending, showing us clearly that This is the type of movie that you love or hate, which is the reason why I believe there are many reviews and not very successful when this film is released. As I am sure that most are just ancient artifacts discovered at this time. I am very happy with this movie and would recommend for movie enthusiasts such as "Love Actually" and "Three Weddings and a meral". Not to mention the excellent soundtrack in recording important moments. those
