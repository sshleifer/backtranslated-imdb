The more tight the drama, the better the film of the opponent! This small jewel was promoted as a comedian when released in Sweden, so I'm glad to find that it's not the case at all. A bit funny in the small town quarrels that there will definitely be enjoyed. But the drama takes center stage when the story goes, not only for the family drama. But it also raises questions that are irritating about people's lifestyle choices. <br /> <br /> Great characters with great scenes. And they are not just strikes But still has everything in itself It made me think that if Ingmar Bergman did this (This drama will suit him!) The international interest may happen immediately. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe
