Excellent worthless, worthless and unpretentious in the exploitation of the 80s. Cheers! The opening sequence of the credits is rather giving the wrong feeling that we are facing with serious drama and groan. But you do not have to be afraid, because ten minutes later we will stay until our necks in a frantic fanatic fight. Scary conversations and free nude pictures! Bo and Ingrid were two orphaned brothers who had a very close relationship and were slightly distorted. Have you imagined that tearing a towel that covers your sister's body is fun and looking at the penis that has not shaved your hair for several minutes? Umbo did that to his sister and judged with laughter, dubbed her, that she was not disgusted. However, while the children fled from Russia with their parents But merciless soldiers killed mercilessly and fatherlessly However, friendly smugglers control them. However, they have also upgraded and trained Bo and Inggris to be a specialist wholesale smuggler. When the plot was actually canceled 20 years later, they are facing their ultimate quest as an incredibly legendary and incredibly valuable white diamond found in the mines of life. That used to have little sense as well as the structure and narrative of "white light" but of course it was fun Most of the time, you have no clue about who to beat or why. (And I bet that the actors understand less) but whatever! The violence is surprisingly eccentric and every wise plan is distorted. The script goes totally beyond repairing right away? And what will I not reveal? Bo wants to replace Ingrid and Fred Williamson at the scene with a large cigar in his mouth. The main rival of Bo is an Italian chick with large breasts. But with an ugly accent, miserable songs But ambiguously playing at least once throughout the story interesting place! God is a great experience. The original French name means "Life for survival", which is suitable, unique because it is as reasonable as the rest of the movie: No!
