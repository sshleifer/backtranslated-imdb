If you haven't seen Mary-Kate and Ashley's movies, all I can say is: This is another great and wonderful movie from the Brotherhood twins that we all know and love! It's fun, romantic, exciting and amazing. (Smart scenery)! Of course; As always, Mary-Kate and Ashley are the main scenes here! Any big fan wants to have another way? not sure! so anyway; It's a great movie in every word, so if you haven't seen it yet, you have to do it now! I mean now too! So what are you waiting for? I promise you won't be disappointed! Sincerely, Rick Morris
