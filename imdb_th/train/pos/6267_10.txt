I think the original of this film is quirky and charming, including letting me sit on the edge of my seat trying to figure out. <br /> <br /> Since I saw the original, when I saw this on Sci Fi Channel - I don't know if this remake was made intentionally for Sci Fi or not - I know what it is within the first few minutes. Because I like Richard Burgi as an actor, so I want to know how he can pull it out. <br /> <br /> The writer / producer makes the movie a little more modern by trying to explain the destiny. Karma of aliens "(They can't reproduce themselves and need help anymore) using the same pseudo-science that is packed in our ears in the 90s. Maybe it adds a little bit of polish to Movie? <br /> <br /> This film, film? This production uses a frightening edge over the manuscript - the manuscript ends with a confrontation between a young woman and an alien and a strange understanding arises even though there are no problems with the alien. <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> I remember that in this remake, the woman was quite hostile to Burgi / Alien- I thought it might end up better. But the ending was just the end, and the yarn was the yarn that swelled to form the basis of pulp science fiction. In 1958, many great science fiction stories were written in the 50s and some made into movies. > <br /> This is an exciting thing to watch like on a rainy day or something like that. I give it a high rating because all the old 50s Sci Fi remakes are good. I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> But if anyone really wants to see this story, tell WELL. I recommend the 1958 original version with Tom Tyron and Gloria Talbott, directed by Gene Fowler Jr.
