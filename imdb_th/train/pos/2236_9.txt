What I remember most about this film was that it had aired on local KTLA television (Channel 5) during the Christmas season in the mid to late 70s, mainly due to the fact that the real story took place on or near the day Christmas Eve. It is annoying to see the hell that this woman must pass as the only survivor of a plane crash in the Peruvian jungle. The graphic scene of this young girl pulling out a leech from her infected leg creates an impression on this young audience. Christmas cheer is not what I have seen at that time. Certainly not Rankin-Bass production
