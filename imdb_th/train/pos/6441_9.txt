It is in heaven {Spoiler Warning) <br /> <br /> This is a great human drama that stimulates my emotions and imagination. <br /> <br /> This is a metaphor to review the life and death of Christ Daniel is a talented musician with great physical and mental fatigue from his career and must give up. When he joined the church choir as a church choir, he brought changes in the life of the choir, just as Jesus did with the Palestinian society in the first century. They laughed.

And the connection between each other, which is the true fate of humans
