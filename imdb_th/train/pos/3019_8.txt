To begin with, I love g√∂ta kanal 1. It has many classic jokes, including the unfortunate guy in the canoe that is often wrong at the time. My thoughts, acting is not as funny as in the first movie. Actually, you don't notice him much. What makes me think bad about this movie is that the choice of the ship in this movie is only a race boat. They are sure that it is fast. But those who do not create waves like a large floating mansion used in the first movie I like The better things and these new ships make one of the final scenes look ridiculous. When the canoe man jumped out of the boat to dodge the "giant waves" from those small speed boats Being in Sweden as well as in 1974, this movie is slightly more violent than the first movie. Although this movie is excellent in all matters I just focused on the disadvantages that I was disappointed. But other movies depend on my expectations, so go see! It's worth the money
