While I wanted to watch this movie from the first time I previewed, I was very surprised with this film. While the composition and some actions of the characters look a little too much? Cartoons' dark appearance of the movie makes this experience very different. Instead of being happy, happy, this movie leads you to another way that proves to be high, but disturbing most children will not understand the darker times in the movie, which can make this movie look. For adults I was impressed with the movie by using animation and digital animation to create a smooth network of pan and tilt. The music score is strong again, proving that Hans Zimmer is the person who likes to go to the animation score and I never thought that I would really like Brian Adams's music.
