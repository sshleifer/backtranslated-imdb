I'm not a parent. I'm not a man. But I can identify with the heartache and pain of every character. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that teens should watch. It may be that they will start to see the value of the family again. I'm sorry for those who do not understand the value of love, family and friendship. <br /> <br /> It's very interesting to see Patrick Duffy in a different role than Bobby Ewing. Flex, 19, showing his excellent and sincere work He performed at an early age that he had the ability to act in kindness. He should be offered a more serious role. Hollywood Note ... his first serious role in many years and he won the Best Actor Award in the Venice Festival in 2006. <br /> <br /> This film Is a favorite of people of all ages May not be viewed by children under the age of 10 because they may fear that the same thing may happen to their families But I advise everyone in the family. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie from DVD and watched with friends many times. Because it represents important values ​​in life
