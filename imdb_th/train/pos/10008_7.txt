Did you know Robin Williams, God blessed him, was shooting himself continuously recently with the dumb comedies that he had done throughout this decade (maybe except "Death To Smoochy" which exploded when it came out. But now, the classic cult), the drama he did recently, is great, especially "Insomnia" and "One Hour Photo" "The Night Listener". Despite the moderate reviews and the rapid release of DVDs, it is one of The best work /> <br /> This was the period was <br scary though it is not a serial killer or whoever. Harm to the body for that matter The concept of this film is based on actual fraud cases that have not been officially confirmed. In high school, I read an autobiography of a child named Anthony Godby Johnson, who was affected by terrible abuse and eventually infected with HIV. I was impressed with this story until I read the online report that Johnson might not have existed. When I watched this film, the confusion that Robin Williams cleverly drawn up appeared in my heart. <br /> <br /> Toni Colletton may give a great performance. Her best as well as Her role was a far cry from what she had in the movie, such as "Little Miss Sunshine". There were times when she looked at the camera that I thought she was staring at me. It takes a good actress to take that role and it is a role that has been reviewed. (But there is still a good examination) which makes Tony Collet may be one of the best actresses of this generation. It's incredible that there are at least one woman in this world that is like this and it <br /> <br /> This is a good and dark movie that I highly recommend. But preparing to be insecure because this film makes you feel strange at the end
