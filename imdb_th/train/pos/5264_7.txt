A mini movie that creates a short, satisfying musical short from Cole Porter's Broadway song. Three songs, Bob Hope's first praise, are blessed! He played American millionaire playboy during a holiday in Paris. The film opens with him sitting at a table outside the caf√©, telling his friends about this beauty that makes him breathe out. Suddenly he found her a few yards. He came and his friend teased him and suggested "Just show her bank account." But Hope claims he can beat her in less than 30 days with "no" money! They bet on the polo horse in this regard and accept all his cash and IDs. Hoping to follow her and when they are alone, she does not believe that he will offer a sincere proposal until he sings to her "What did you do to me" by Cole Porter But she had to leave and he tried to earn money as a tour guide so he could pursue her But when she saw him showing another girl around the city indifferent, she wanted to leave him. He continues to chase her and find her and her family at the racetrack, where he bets for a small amount of money in the final match, hoping to win enough to impress her Through a series of events and matching large dance numbers, he lost the winning ticket and she decided to marry him rich or poor.
