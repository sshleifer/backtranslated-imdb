The film is breathtakingly beautiful. Goldsworthy's artwork is very useful for film media because you can see beautiful, moving and changing art and bloom I would like to recommend this movie to everyone. I can't think about it anymore. It's a type of movie that you have to watch because it's visually appealing and makes me very refreshing when I leave the theater.
