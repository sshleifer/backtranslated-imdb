As a fan of Paris Je'Taime, I went to see New York. I loved her with very high expectations. I'm glad that I walked away with all my expectations. It is funny, sweet, fast and fun. This movie begins with two hopper cars. (Bradley Cooper and Justin Bar) try to travel to the same area But arguing about where to go That is a joke and then the movie enters the best game I've seen anywhere. There are four amazing people from all good people. The four people I will start talking about. One has Shia LaBeouf as a porter at a hotel that finds love in an old lady The next person has the qualification of Orlando Bloom as the producer of music that is doing business with women, played by Christina Ricci, another element Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly. As two people are going to Brahmin, Thirbly's character is disabled. Most have Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman, a couple who fight I will let you know that Nataile Portman is the director of the first impressions of the show and wrote plays about the caretaker and Ethan Hawk and Maggie Q are excellent as crafty people. New York, I absolutely love you. If not better than 2006 Paris Je'Taime, the game is fast and the movie shows how indie movies should be. However, this film does not have many famous directors like Paris Je'Taime, which is why it is great to have a wonderful life. If you want to laugh, watch the great acting effects, see many great performances and be entertained. Then go to New York. I definitely love you.
