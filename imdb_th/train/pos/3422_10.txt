I want this on tape, not a DVD and soon! <br /> <br /> I have one grandson in the infantry division. But did not apply, even though he went to Iraq shortly after December 2008. I lost my beloved step son in Ramadi, Iraq on 09-15-05 from an unmanned missile in a green area. I have another grandson who joined the army as soon as he graduated from high school this spring because he, like his brother, has an ideal and romantic concept of service in the army. My stepson died after only 10 days in the country and he never went out to do any missions. Therefore, my nephew had no way of referring to any experience expressed in this revealing documentary from personal experience. <br /> <br /> There is nothing I can do about those who are in or are now missing. But I have one that does not raise his hand and swears in YET. I want him to do that without knowing it. Nobody does it. <br /> <br /> Please help me. <br /> <br /> Documentary film The Ground Truth is the best reference image I have ever seen. I have to make my youngest nephew see what he is going into before, but: (Don't laugh) I want my mother to see this first. Then you have to see and be able to Hear these men and women not only But their thoughts But the truth of what they will be immersed in may be possible forever Then she will have the passion to make my brother watch this movie, and when he is there, he may make his son, my youngest grandson, too. Then my nephew might start doing this seriously. <br /> <br /> (((Will there be another time to perform on TV? If so, please tell me when?))) <br /> <br /> However, my problem is my mother is doing Not the owner of a DVD player. She still uses videos. (Correct or not with tape) so I have to find a way that you can watch this movie Can I buy this from anyone in that style? If there is no other way, can I bring it in a tape format? There is a valid link that I can pay to download to my computer and transfer to tape. If so, who do I contact? I am willing to pay for the right if it is the correct link. <br /> <br /> Or if you have an alternative idea, I will consider what you can recommend. <br /> <br /> Please help me. I have lost those who love and love the precious ones. Knowing that my oldest grandson will never be the same when he comes back and I may loose him too. I can't lose three and upset for everyone who made it back. The price is too high to pay for all the boys in my family of that era. Please help me I will happily call you, emailing the number if it's the best way to get the necessary information. Thank you very much for the help you can offer. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Lori Swanberg l.swanberg@yahoo.com
