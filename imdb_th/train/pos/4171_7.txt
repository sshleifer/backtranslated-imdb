I ran across many years while on the Sunday afternoon channel. Although it was an interesting TV movie from the 70s, but the direction and score were good enough to catch my attention, and of course I was hooked and had to watch it until the end. Recently I had the opportunity to buy DVDs from abroad. Of this movie (Oops, didn't notice that there were people in the country coming out a couple of months ago) and very glad to see again (and all). <br /> <br /> I don't understand all the phenomena. In the 1970s, there seems to be a lock in the horror horror movie. A decade ago, before the 1970s, it produced a lot of beautifully filmed movies and our enduring horror icons. Afraid? Not so much. Over the years, since the 70s, we have received horror movies that are more exciting, more exciting, more productive and more complex, more fun, more fun, more fun. Effective, but again ... They are not really scary! There is something about the atmosphere of horror films of the 70s. The quality of film tablets. The creepy dark scene shines with many high-tech light platforms. "The Edge of the Dream World" Mutes the quality of conversations and strange EQ scores. A strange feeling of uneasiness and ugliness absorbs everything. Everything that works to undermine most movies of the 70s in the case of horror, working in favor. <br /> <br /> Especially in this film, the quiet and violent image of the devil dog that stares down people. That is quite fair Shocking More effective if they go on a more clear path to let the dog grow roaring, drooling, and open enemies ("Cujo"?) The creator team cleverly records that when dogs appear in supernatural ways The effects that occur while not complicated by today's standards truly let me be cold. "I'm not sure what I'm looking for." The strange look makes me wonder as if the true supernatural vision is more than a digital optical printer / confection of horror. br /> <br /> While the human characters in this film do not become satisfying, their nemesis or the world in which they live, all actors do good The pairing of brothers and sisters from the movie "Witch Mountain" is yes. The brothers and sisters are a bit of a stunt performer. But they do well. Yvette Mimieux always tries to entertain. If not interested, Richard Crenna gets more attention from the audience as the movie progresses. His own doubts as he suspected that his family was caused by a supernatural plan or that he only But succumbed to paranoid schizophrenia as well, even though his idea that In its naïveté <br /> <br /> The-End-Question-Mark ending It's one of the only things I've seen that don't feel like a cheap mechanism and makes me think about The selection of these characters will have to face the next thing and what they should do and their feelings about it. <br /> <br /> Those who say in this movie can say that Shining retina image But hey, you can say the same thing about "Blade Runner" :-)
