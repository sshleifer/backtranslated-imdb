British comedies tend to fall into one of two main categories: peaceful education, contemplation, romance and social satire. Different character and concept settings But some characteristics make most of the performances to be one of two categories Butterflies may be the best of the first category. <br /> <br /> The script has many words, including the collection of long characters by the main character Ria, who is a happy housewife. But unstable, curious about what she might miss when she started her normal life When she met a successful businessman But clumsy and emotionally accessible (Which makes him interested in you clearly). She likes toys that have the idea of ​​finding what other paths might offer. <br /> <br /> Actions and scripts Is often a matter of money, which makes people react to almost all of their performances. It is personal: I'm not blown away with it or it is closed. On the other hand, my mother likes this show. I think the level identified with Ria's dilemma is the most important factor in determining the reaction to butterflies.
