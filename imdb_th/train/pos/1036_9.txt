Watch on the Rhine is one of the best anti-Nazi propaganda films created during World War II. Paul Lukas certainly deserves his Oscar. Betty Davis shines as a great actress and beauty. I would like to introduce this film to those interested in that era and of course that is the great movie of Ms. Bette Davis.
