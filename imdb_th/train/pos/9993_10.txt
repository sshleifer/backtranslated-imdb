The most funny and funny movie Brooks I have ever seen. I can watch and watch the tape 100 times. I laughed out ** and I cried for a moment. It's a good movie and really funny and if you like Brooks, this is a must have! In the short term - Brooks (a billionaire) travels the streets like homeless for 30 days in order to win all the poverty areas from competitors. Truth bites, but eventually - it's about a warm relationship Between humans ... highly recommended!
