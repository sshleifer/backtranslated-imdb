I just threw two cents and relaxed. It was a joke. Yes, most of the characters are written and performed in a wide range. I can't think of many comedies that they can't. This is not a new version, released on video and broadcast on cable almost every week. Will I see it in the cinema? Of course I do when it comes out for the first time. It's funny ... That should be enough. <br /> <br /> Even though I don't like it, I still watch it in cable for Michael Keaton. Disadvantaged and disliked I can't think of anyone who is capable of all types. I can't think of successful people. A comedian who is also an actor (short-lived but still) who is a romantic lead actor who is also a drama actor; Villain and hero I couldn't think of it, at least not in Hollywood. Of course, no one is successful in all those categories. I mean, there is Tom Cruise. But for me, he is better than Tom Cruise rather than being a character. However, this is not about Michael Keaton and Tom Cruise, so I will move forward. <br /> <br /> Gung Ho is worth the rental. But it's worth buying because you might buy it for $ 10.00 or less than Wal-Mart. It's worth watching on the cable. (If you have cable or satellite) It's one of the fun to watch movies. You can stop your brain and just relax and chuckle. <br /> <br /> To request more in my honest opinion is to ask too.
