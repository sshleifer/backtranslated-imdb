Now in the new schedule of METOO at 4:00 pm on weekdays after "Maverick" and before "Wild, Wild West" (followed by "Star Trek") <br /> <br /> Don't know if I'm real or not? Saw the episode of it when it was opened But I love it The unusual and surreal story is set in the western legend of the Western type of "Naked City" <br /> <br /> and guests there: Dan Duryea, Lyle Bettger, Brian Donlevy, Macdonald Carey, Rick Jason (in As a treacherous Mexican man), Dick Van, Jack Young, Lord Noah Berry Jr. (A Mexican color) Martha Hyer, Marguerite Chapman, even Ann Robinson ("The War of the Worlds") Gloria Talbott ("I am married to a monster from space") /> <br /> It ran for eight seasons over 200 episodes from January 1959 to December 1965. <br /> <br /> Eric Fleming, Eric Fleming, is a person who is quite prominent as the leader of Gilfal. Once lived with the code of the samurai and is only a balance between strength and aptitude I will vote for him as president every day. (PS He has a very interesting history: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0281661/) <br /> <br /> And Clin Young Eastwood is quite distinctive, like his right hand, "Rowdy" Yates. In addition, veteran actors, Westerners and country musicians (Immortal "One-eyed, One-horned, Flying Purple People Eater") Sheb Wooley has a seasoned scout, Pete Nolan and Paul Renegar, creating the most terrifying character you can ask for as "Wishbone". <br /> <br /> The song was a great show by Frankie Laine immortal (between the theme. "Maverick" I have a Western theme song that runs through my head all day.) <br /> <br /> I hope to get every episode; I collected the whole set. good time (Not to mention the moo-ving experience) Always guaranteed because we wait to see if the children will get their difficulties before advertising. <br /> <br /> "Rollin ', rollin' , rollin '...
