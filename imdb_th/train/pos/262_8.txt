*** Spoiler *** *** Spoiler *** <br /> <br /> This movie "The Divers" is really interesting. All I know about it is that it will Related to Nazi history, underwater scenes and everyone will speak Danish But I decided to check it for one reason, the fact that the story evolved around the sinking WWII German submarine. I have a fetish for the German subordinates, especially the remains that can be blacked down. So I rarely wonder about the parts of Denmark. But reasoning that the sub-section can weigh that part Knowing that the Nordic movies are not very good and are not sure how much budget to say at least, I am very skeptical. <br /> <br /> When I am surprised, <br /> <br >> I have some ideas about an actor who is not enough to see that some people are very young, especially two main actors. This is not a problem, they both work very well. Like other actors, mostly composed of people over the age of 50, this makes interesting interactions between children and adults not often seen on the screen. Not unique already But quite rare And it is all good. <br /> <br /> For the Danish language, it is almost impossible to understand. But this has no problem. It has a subtitle. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the submarine itself. I wonder if there will be internal and underwater shots of the submarine. After deciding that their budget is slim, I think this should be sufficient, the best and the worst. The worst. I was surprised again. The exterior scenes of the wreck were beautiful and the interior scenes were very realistic. There is a fetish for German subordinates. I know that there should be a sub-face, especially inside and not disappointed. The team has done serious research. It's a good story. <br /> <br /> I wonder if more people, myself, will watch this movie to see the biodegradable scenes, so I feel I have to issue a warning. Actually during the war It is a special sub-objective. But to give a hint of what you expect, it's a cross between Type VII, Type IX and a Japanese sub-vehicle similar to I-52. It's a good design and sabotage. <br /> <br /> Set up on the Danish island or peninsula. I can't remember. It was summer and two brothers traveled to their grandfather to celebrate the arrival of the summer they do every year. Their grandfather is a strange marines. This movie is quite good, many beautiful summer scenes at the island harbor, newly discovered teenage love, weather, good diving and the general feeling of "perfect" again. It's all good. <br /> <br /> The clever plot of the island gets some visitors wondering, gathering men to hire one of the old minesweepers and crew. One of the male visitors in his 50s had a German eagle and tattooed on his back. All the senior citizens of the island remember when a German submarine sank to the end of World War II and counted But then there was a rumor about the Nazi gold at a deep level. The grandfather was one of the young men searching for the sunken ship after the German ship began to land in 1945. The submarine was not found. <br /> <br /> What to expect <br /> <br /> The key element is the experiment of Nazi, Nazi history, treasure hunt, secrets, competition, teen love, conspiracy and ... surprise <br /> <br /> *** Warning - Spoiler * ** <br /> <br /> I don't expect some elements of supernatural things to be The rules in this film and made me cautious. Not a big fan of supernatural events. But it fits well with the story and there is no problem. It doesn't look like "from dusk until dawn" that everyone turns into a vampire until the end. This is a little more subtle. <br /> <br /> Overall: A really good movie. I give verse 8, some people due to the fact that it's not a Hollywood movie with unlimited resources. I know it has a decent budget and some actors are seasoned Danish veterans. But even if this is a Hollywood production, I will give 7 or 8 worth while you Yes, the story of children in one way, but then is an adult story. It has great suspicion and adventure which I find very attractive. And again, very good movies. <br /> <br /> / Medusa 2001 <br /> <br />
