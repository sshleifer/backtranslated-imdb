This is a really cool movie! I remember the first time I saw it when I was really young and I watched all the time like once a week ... The shadow is my favorite character in the Homeward Bound movie. It's really funny and it's really wonderful that they train animals. Do all those things Some of this sad movie (like when Sassy, ​​the cat, fell into the waterfall and when the Shadow fell into the hole at the end) I saw the second Homeward Bound, but I have to say it's not as good as it was once. First Shadow is a smart one. Sassy is a good Sassy and the opportunity is a funny idiot. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedies or talking to animals. This is one of my top ten popular movies!
