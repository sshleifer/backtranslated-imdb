Saw it for the first time in 1975 on some German TV channels and was immediately addicted. After that I saw this movie about 12 times in the cinema and today I have a video tape that I watch at least once a year - this movie Great in all aspects of acting, cutting, music scores ...) These scenes are very distinctive and impressive. The idea of ​​a devastating world war started in the At the end of the thirties, it seems that the prophecy for the 1936 film The Dictator of "Everytown" is pure. Mussolini and Raymond Massey are charming heroes. In pessimism - especially the ending scenes that often cause my tears or tears to flow even after watching many movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is good on TV, but Was built for the big screen, so if you have the opportunity to watch in some theaters Please do it overwhelming
