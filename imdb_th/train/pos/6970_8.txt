This is one of the movies / pilots that if you know BattleStar Galactica, it can help but it is not necessary. What makes this story more reliable than BSG's story is that this is not far in the future. This has a depth that is quite surprising that it is not theoretically released. The lead actor couldn't choose better in the more experienced and talented actors. Eric Stoltz was great as a father to do everything to reunite with his daughter. But true or not, she is & he will do it regardless of the cost. Paula Malcomson from the famous "Deadwood" is as good as his wife as well. You are not completely sure of his motivation, whether it is love or money or both. But that's what makes this pilot more interesting I saw a star in the creation of Zoe, played by Alessandra Torresani and her performance. Esai Morales is great in his desire to see the person he loves again and how wrong it is to consider what He wants more than a moral objection. I don't think it will be a good idea when it is announced. But from a single pilot, I was excited to see how we reached the BSG stage. It's good to see Adama as a child who is affected and influenced by various types of robots that start to absorb life in recently I just hope they can follow the story so that we can understand more about how they have robots printed with humanoid. This is an almost perfect pilot and I hope they can keep up with the great stories. Even the visual effects are better than most junk you see on the big screen. If you haven't joined BSG @ try at least try it. I'll bet you are a fan & would like to see what the BSG story is.
