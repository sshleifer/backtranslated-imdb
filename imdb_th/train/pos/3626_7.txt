This effort is based on the true story of Jim Morris, a high school baseball / coach teacher who was inspired by his players to try out the advantages and fulfill his lifelong dreams in the competition. subjects Dennis Quaid does not have a stranger for the movie, playing Morris with enough confidence to make this piece a reality and the producer has created a credible work to create an event in Lo.
