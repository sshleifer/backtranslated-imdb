Another silent love movie from Hitchcock is not a mystery. But is very English Bobby Bobby Bobby (Ian Hunter) persuades the boxer "One Round" Jack Saunders (Carl Brisson) to be his practice partner in order to keep Mabel (Lilian Hall-Davis) beautiful. There are many characters and actors in The wedding of Jack and Mabel, the chaotic leader, stood at the church's corridor, registering to be shocked when he saw the image of a very tall man and a short, fat, twin-breasted man. Of course, arguing that which side of the walkway and wedding celebration should be fun? The rest of the film has Jack defeated Mabel and punched back to her or something like that. It was totally another era with the audience in the evening dress, and the boxer also dressed as well when leaving the band, camera angles, rhythms, symbolic use, all cutting, stylish and brilliant. The work of the camera and the editing of the last boxing match was very interesting. Brisson's good image is well used in this His smile didn't forget what happened around him while he was in Hitchcock's The Manxman and not annoying. But does the boxer have this dimple?
