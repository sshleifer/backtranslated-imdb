(Sorry for my mistaken language, I'm not a native speaker ...) <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a movie that almost needs a heavy reaction. Personally, I agree with all of the most advanced metrics around, but I won't use this method for quite a reason to explain the movie here. Because of these things "Perfectly perfect!" - The criticism makes some people turn (including me) <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for another "hamlet" that has the potential to compete with the theater And many theaters - then don't miss this opportunity if you find it anywhere (Unfortunately, not many people have the opportunity to see it, it doesn't seem to have a DVD and the German version - which can do quite well - without any form) <br /> <br /> In case you Decided to receive a copy: cut off the cut of the movie for two hours. (Or more) it is useless and not fun, and impresses with movies related to flow and interesting architecture And the ratio decreases to 4: 3. <br /> <br /> Greetings from Germany, F.L
