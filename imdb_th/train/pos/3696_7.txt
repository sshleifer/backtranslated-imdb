Even though I live in Minnesota But I have studied in France recently and have encountered strange gems of movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is amazing. Creative and unique movies, each director lends something different from the interpretation of love in the city of light. The first instinct is to try to adjust these small stories to be as much a story as possible, with love. In 2003, however, this effort made the magic of each segment obsolete. When brought to value by each of the short sections that bring into their own movies, love stories together tell a beautiful message. <br /> <br /> The film is surprisingly impressive - often reaching the point of Confusion - and each part of each person can be difficult to follow. Still, for watchers who pay close attention to each segment, the short outline is clear after a short period of time. The confusion is almost interesting. It puts you on the edge of your seat, waiting for what will happen next. It makes the audience wonder. "Is that really happening?" But also makes them satisfied that it actually happened. It is a type of movie that viewers can't decide whether they like or dislike movies. The initial reaction is to go and see again and again in order to see the individual's life blending together into a movie masterpiece. <br /> <br /> An interesting decision to make the movie speak. Many languages Can relate It increases the reality of the movie - here, American tourists speak English, French in Paris and others. The number of people that this movie leads to understanding the language of universal love. <br /> <br /> From Illness to the supernatural The parents' love and husband's love This film covers the whole base of Romantic storytelling In a beautiful and strange way, each event that is unique is also involved in telling the story: all types, sizes, races and shapes of love.
