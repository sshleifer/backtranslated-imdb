I have had this movie on tape for many years and started watching again this morning. (While waiting for my laundry --- scary!) Mostly because I want to listen to Benjamin Frankel's title song again. I ended up sitting for about the first half hour with confidence in the writing direction and Excellent show This film is like anyone in the 50 stars of British actors: Cecil Parker, Michael Gough, Miles Malleson, Duncan Lam, and especially Ernest Thiele. Singer, not to mention Alec Guinness and Joan Greenwood, is not a character player. But is a charming and charming actor This is science fiction in a pure and funny style as well. Forever classic and I hope no one tries to create it new!
