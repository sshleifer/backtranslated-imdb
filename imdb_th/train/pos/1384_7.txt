Also known as "water lotus", this film tells the story of two girls as they struggle to enter the world of love and sex. This story has been recounted slowly and is very good. It gives a lot of time and space to get to know different characters and grow up. <br /> <br /> Using small characters makes people play extra pressure because they all have time. The screen is more than usual, but people who play in this movie manage well. Everyone completely believes Setting up great images, especially underwater images in the swimming pool, helps to add great effects. <br /> <br /> Many movies were created on the same subject, even though they were like this. It pulls some "standard" pressure methods out of high hats and works with them. It's not bad. But it's not great as well, and I feel that it's better to do this if using a corner that is less explored. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 synchronous swimmers
