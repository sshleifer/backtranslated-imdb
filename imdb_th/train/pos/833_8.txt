First, let me say that the director has used the name to create his image. I really enjoy them. I enjoy this movie a lot. But I must say that next to Pierce Brosnan Greg Gregear is quite lacking. Brosnan dissolves in this character so well that it's hard to remember that this is someone who plays debt It also shows his range and depth as an actor. It's an indie flick, and it's a very good story to see, especially with all the mainstream movies that flood the movie during this time of year. I found that the character was well built. The spiral in the middle that I feel particularly good I really like the way the characters come out. Many times we have in these animated movies that are not real characters. But it's a walking image ... I like the different ways in this movie. I miss the side when I think about this movie. But I think this is something to watch and is a better movie overall ...
