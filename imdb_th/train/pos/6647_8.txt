Gandhi, my father is like watching a book, one chapter at a time, you read (With your eyes) and you learn more about Harilal Gandhi and for Kasturba Gandhi. In that story, little is known about both of them and this film specifically describes them. Although the name is misunderstood But it is a movie about Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son as much as Harilal and his mother Is like a leap year They come after a lot of time. <br /> <br /> My father Gandhi is about fighting inside, which is sometimes more difficult than any struggle for freedom ever made. <br /> <br / > See if you like quality cinema.
