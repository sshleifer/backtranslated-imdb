The beauty of the Clara Bow and the great attractiveness are the main reasons for watching this movie. "Hula" is not up to Clara's best movie. But it's still fun She dances. She rides horses and follows the person she loves. The film is only one hour long and directed by Oscar winner, future winner Fleming (disappearing with the wind). The film moves fast and Clara Bow has a screen If you like Clara, I recommend "Hula".
