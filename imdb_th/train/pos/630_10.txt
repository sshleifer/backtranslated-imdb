I didn't expect much from this movie. I received a ticket for advanced screening. I just left my job It's hot and I'm tired. I had to wait in the movie line for 40 minutes and seemed to have no cold air flowing through the hallway of the cinema. <br /> <br /> When sitting in the cinema, tired and disappointed I didn't know any actors at first. But the flow of the movie is perfect From the beginning, I became a fanatic of movies more and more excited every minute. I think this movie is set to be a classic fantasy / fairy tale. The performers were excellent, the footsteps were perfect and the ending was wonderful.
