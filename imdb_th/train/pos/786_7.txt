Andie MacDowell's facial expressions were excellent again in this movie. When you are 40 years old and are single for a while (Or for the rest of your life) you may feel that you are wasting This movie is a reminder that love can be found everywhere if your tentacles are moving violently. I like fast sexual encounters, which must not be a character for a school teacher who is normally reserved (MacDowell). Her former students are cute enough to remain with his teacher for a long time. <br /> <br /> There Some parts that I think are quite unrealistic or not true even though For example, in the scene in which the jealousy of another woman came and replaced the scene that caused Andie MacDowell to leave a young adult police officer (Another friend of MacDowell) allows her friend to do horrible things Is it easy for everyone not to stop in front of the car? Of course, accidents happen all the time. But I hope to see the heroine marrying happily with the first man she participates in (That's the hardest part to believe !! For this beautiful woman to live alone for a long time?) ... <br /> <br /> May be a film producer who is aware of the fact that many love between a woman and a young man not too long In addition, they know that a happy ending will not attract people, especially with over 40 envious women waiting for a miracle. The sadness that ended with a glimpse of hope for a sad woman who lost her true love was sweet. But if the man is still alive, will it last forever? How Long? No one knows. However, it's a movie that makes you want to watch again later ... maybe a year later.
