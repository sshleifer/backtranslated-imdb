Ghost Story (TV movie - 1972) is the pilot of the NBC series. The film is well written and works well and I think that when the 1972-73 TV season began, if the TV series was halfway down Better than movies (I hope this movie is in the video !!) This series is very disappointing - even with William Castle as executive producer. However, if you have the opportunity to watch a television movie about Ghost Story, try it. You will not be disappointed.
