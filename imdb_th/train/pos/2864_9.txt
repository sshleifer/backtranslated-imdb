It must be a joke that occurs around the bonanza about the death of a woman who is involved with a wagon man. After Ben Cartwright was three widows in each marriage And any woman related to Adam Hossein and Little Joe is dying because we can't get rid of the formulas of the widows and the three sons who started Western classical TV. <br /> <br /> Maybe if Bonanza is doing today, the writer will probably have a female character circulating into the life of Cartwrights. People have a relationship. Some people go well. Some are not good. It's just life. And we are calling our heroes less today, so if the relationship with one of them goes south, we do not need to kill the characters to save the surviving nobles. But that is if Bonanza is finished today. <br /> <br /> But we still expect from our western heroes and bonanza, although it will take a while and have to change the time in Of course, watching from NBC The success of Bonanza is Ben Cartwright, the noble old man and his strong son. Ben Cartwright is the ideal father of every type of TV you want to name. His entire life was spent on the building of the vast Ponderosa building for his three children. Every child has a different personality. But everyone came together quickly. <br /> <br /> Cartwrights became and still is an American institution. I dare to have more people interested in this family than Kennedy. Just the popularity that Bonanza had in witnessing that. <br /> <br /> Pernell Roberts, as Adam's eldest son, was written from the list. He was rumored that he was not interested in the noble Cartwright character, which he felt was sacred. Maybe if it's finished, he will like it more than I explained. <br /> <br /> This is just the beginning for Michael Landon, the number of hits on three popular TV shows to their credit. Landon also has a highway. to Heaven and Little House On the Prarie, where he has creative control. Little Joe is the youngest, hottest head. But is the most romantic person in Cartwrights. <br /> <br /> When Robert leaves The show continues with two young sons. But when a big block of land broke out, the heart left the bonanza. Other characters were added at that time, David Canary, Tim Matheson, and Ben Cartwright. Raising a small child, Vogel Mitch, but big, honest, but a little thick. The most lovely of Cartwrights, his sudden death after the surgery left the hole too big. <br /> <br /> So the Ponderosa Cartwrights passed into history. I get a real taste of how America brought Cartwrights to the heart when I visited the true city of Virginia. It doesn't look like anything you see in bonanza. But close to Lake Tahoe, where you see Ponderosa on the map that opens the credit is Cartwright House, which has been maintained and opened as a tourist attraction, as well as 21 Baker Street. For Sherlock Holmes fans, ranchhouse and Cartwrights are real. <br /> <br /> And if they are not true, they should be like that.
