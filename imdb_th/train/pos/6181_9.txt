A very fun movie that lets you know how to watch old music / puzzles. It may not be close to Agatha Christie or even the skinny man puzzle as a noir movie. But it's more interesting "Boys meet girls" or "Let's show" stage plays As a musical, it is not a Busby Berkley unit or an independent unit. But can add the classic "Coctails for two" and "Sweet Marijuana" strange This film performs in real-time during the stage performance, opening up the "Vanities" where murder - and soon after being discovered behind the stage. Found the murderer before the curtain is OK or unpredictable, but the search is fun, although it can be predicted and disfigured from the comic relief. (Fortunately, the shape of the goddess Toby Wing) And those who are attracted are too sacrificed Go, they are beautiful, stylish There is a beautiful choir that has been chosen better than the girls in the Busby Berkley musical during the same period, which sometimes tends to be beside the obese. Yes, this movie is better than it used to be, and Duke Ellington's numbers are embarrassing. But if you enjoy diving in old movies, this story will prove to be a very tantalizing journey.
