The author / director John Hughes covers every base (as usual) with the family movie "Sweet Sunday Afternoon". "Curly Sue" is a precocious sweet orphan who is cared for by "Bill". The couple lives smartly as they travel to the United States. The great man of fate falls on them and the yuppie lawyer is "very cute" and the rest is predictable. <br /> <br /> Children will love this movie. Related to the heroine, played by Alisa Potter, aged 9 years (who used to be "you go!" In Pepsi's advertisement). The character should have about 6 or 7 characters while she is motivated to think of go to school Some of her words show that she is 9 years old. <br /> <br /> Similar to "Home Alone", there are many slap and small punches, large punches, fat fists. Again, this is making a movie "formula" aimed at younger audiences. Entertainment and heartwarming Do not look for surprises But be prepared to shed tears or two
