I went to see this movie without knowing anything and ended up enjoying. It lacks credibility and credibility - something that the characters say and do is completely bizarre and many scripts seem to be advertisements. (It may be normal for Woody Allen or apologize to all who don't know) in the theater, laughing so hard. It's not a joke in the movie, but in all movies. The show reminded me of Seinfeld's performance, which he tried not to laugh at his own jokes - it was jolly. But if you don't show the movie too seriously, you can truly appreciate the humor of the actor, not the character. If you are looking for a random movie and you like Woody Allen, I recommend!
