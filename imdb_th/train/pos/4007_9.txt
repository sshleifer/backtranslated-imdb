The astounding and astounding work from the talented English writer Hanif Kureishi, who wrote "My Beautiful Laundrette" (this is the best thing he has done since then). It's about the smart people whose lives don't increase. Up They smelt what they had received and most were empty containers. The only character on the screen that is still alive is the mother of the title. But she felt dead inside until the rough maintenance technician showed love and awakened her to have sexual pleasure. He has his own motivation, but Kureishi treats him with compassion. This is a movie that people and places feel familiar with, whose characters are beyond the boundaries of the screen. At some point, it's like "Sunday, Bloody Sunday", but it was a totally difficult task. Director Roger Michell helped make the scenes able to create instincts. And it acts beautifully. <br /> <br /> While Anne Reid, the famous mother, betrayed her wasted life in every manner, there were no false records in the show. At her specialty, Daniel Craig, a very talented actor, shows his personality more than even Kureishi that has not yet been touched. If the film is a mistake, it may be in the manner of a talented daughter stuck in a mess with the man that her mother seduces. (Or should be another way) and even a busy life Very well played by Cathryn Bradshaw. She asks you to be stuck. This film is very beautiful to see (DoP Alwin Kuchler) and must be ranked undoubtedly the best British film of the year.
