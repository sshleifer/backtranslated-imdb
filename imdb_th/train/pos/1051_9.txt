This is an effective documentary about domestic abuse in Cameroon. "Sister sister" in law is a lawyer and female judge who succeeded in prosecuting her husband in 2004 to prosecute an unmarried spouse and win the divorce that she wanted through the Muslim Council. It is quite long - about two hours - but interesting in terms of both the plaintiff and the defendant and the lawyer representing them in the courtroom, succeeded by the female judge. It will leave you with many questions about the changes that have occurred. How did the woman come to power in Cameroon and when? There are many cases in this film that have a significant impact on the treatment of women by their spouses. Is divorce by a Muslim court contrary to the husband's apparent desire to be a one-time event? I do not suggest that filmmakers can answer these questions. They created the movie two years ago, not yesterday. And the movies that they created should be of great interest
