Neil Simon has a special ability to talk and there is nothing clearer than the songs he gave Walter Mata and Jack Lemmon as the opposite type in THE ODD COUPLE - a mixture of humor and sadness that depends on The faith of two friends who do not match the apartment. <br /> <br /> Lemmon is Felix Nigel Felicica, who is suicidal in suicide after his divorce from his wife. And agreed unwillingly to share Apartment with Oscar Madison (Matto) It seems that everything Felix says and makes Oscar go up on the wall and no one can stand with the Oscar that is a man. As busy as possible and the opposite Felix, of course. <br /> <br /> The most funny scene for me is when giggling. Pigeon's sister in the apartment above visited them on dinner day. Precious interactions between Lemmon Matt and Carole Shelley and Monica Evans are enough to bring you stitches. Pitchy, the talented sister, who made the voice for Gabble Sisters (Disney's goose) in THE THE ARISTOCATS of Disney, and here, their time is over the sadness of Lemmon in this movie - <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Neil Simon and enjoy his other screen treatments, this should not be missed. Matthau and Lemmon Is the perfect actor (Although they consider the exchange of roles before the filming begins) and of course it's easy to see why it became a top-ranked TV program later. <br /> <br /> Simon is funny that doesn't. Should miss
