No one knows the exact words about "Time and Love" by George Ede aka Father Fitzpatrick on the move. It must be you? He is talking to Charlie and Anna in the church while they are leaving? If not, I will have to rent a movie. This is a great movie. I love Serendipity too! Great love story for the soul! <br /> <br /> I found one true love. (My soulmate) and even though I have experience with him when I expect the least, I am not ready for that emotional relationship. <br /> <br /> Well, we got married and I haven't grown old enough to Give as much as i think I was satisfied and received his love for 7 years. <br /> <br /> Finally he left with discontent. But we are still painful and angry and do not believe in what it appears I have a very difficult lesson to learn, and now we have three separate years. <br /> <br /> This movie is very meaningful because I am still waiting for reconciliation with my love and true love. one Now I can appreciate the feeling that is different within me and the words of Father Fitzpatrick, really loud for me. <br /> <br /> I know that when he recovered enough to trust me again, we will marry again. br /> <br >> Do not get damaged and receive true love from receiving scholarships! It's the hardest lesson in my life. <br /> <br /> The song in this movie is outstanding and meaningful! This movie is a DEEP movie and raises the spirit. True love is worth waiting for, if it means anything, whatever happens, it will happen! Nothing is impossible, even if it is the second time! Thank You!
