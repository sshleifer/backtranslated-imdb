Through half of the "evening" of Lajos Koltai, a woman who died of her asked the body that appeared in the hallucination: "Can you tell me where my life goes?" But the woman who said it was Vanessa. Za Redgrave sends it out with the simplest and the question makes your heart dance. <br /> <br /> Time after time, movies created by Susan Minot's novels, sympathy and order It gives attention to presenting The performances are admirable and cause emotional participation as well as the latest movies. Over the past six months of the current year, there are two memorable and meaningful movies that are worthwhile in cinemas and another is being "Far from you" Sara Polley's Hollywood may change the "evening" into a famous, fluid vehicle, along with a pair of real-life mothers and daughters - Vanessa Redgrave and Natasha Richardson and Meryl Streep and Mamie Gummer Richardson is the daughter of Redgrave in this movie. (With the sister played by Tony Collette) and Gummer played herself younger than Streep, while Redgrave's younger nation was Claire Danes. <br /> <br /> Add Glenn Close, Eileen Atkins, Hugh Dancy Patrick Wilson and the big actors - yes, it should become a star platform. Instead, Koltai - the excellent Hungarian filmmaker of "Mephisto" and the director of "Fateless" created the series. Delicate too "Continental feelings" stories that occur in the environment of the Newport society. A wedding that is full of problems <br /> <br /> Missing connections, wrong choices and the fulfillment of duties on social and family pressures is a dramatic presentation. But the quality of the writings of Koltai's direction and performances that sacrificed "the evening" above that level into the rare weather of England, France (and a few Americans) sagas, families from the previous century, contemporary settings <br /> <br /> The complex relationship between mother and daughter between friends And lovers with the addition of a hard triangle, everything is clear, understandable, cute The personal songs are woven into the symphony. <br /> <br /> And with all the above mentioned things about the costumes and sacrifices, the stars of the "evening" still shine through Redgrave, Richardson, Gummer ( Exciting new songs The discovery is vague as her mother. But the actors are very different.) The Danes hold the greatest burden - until Stree shows up in the last moment and of course steals the list. Dancy and Wilson are worth the price of admission. <br /> <br /> Like "Stay away from you" "Evening" is with you in the long run, inviting the story and its characters again. Experience the emotions that arise In the next two hours, the movie will be a little longer. But after that, you will be greeted in the midst of many movies that are cold before your popcorn.
