"Panic in the Streets" is a great thriller But I was a little disappointed The central theme of the city that has been attacked by modern epidemics is fascinating. But this film has never been explored or developed at all It's good and fun. But not as interesting as it should be This screenplay is very weak and makes the whole movie down. There are no main characters that are interesting or reliable. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, this film has done very well, so it compensates for the weak script. The direction of Elia Kazan makes this film suspicious and moving. quickly There are some wonderful sequences, especially the chase of memorable climax. When his direction was combined with a better screenplay, many years later, most people couldn't do it wrong. <br /> <br /> The performance is also very good. Richard Widmark is a leader in watching and Doing what he can with the insurance character Paul Douglas spends his time shouting too much. But also doing a good job as well Distinguished in the show as two villains, Zero Mostel is well known for his role as the most powerful cartoon as one of the best characters in the movie. Jack Palance is a terrible villain. "Panic in the Streets "disappointing but still worth watching (7/10)
