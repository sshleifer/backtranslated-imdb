Larry Fessenden was mostly commented on this forum. The worst mistake is the marketing of movies and the way DVD may be targeted. Obviously, this is not a real horror movie, at least not for those who expect anything that will be filled with blood and instantly satisfying. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is a movie that looks like Will be told from the heart of Miles, things that children do not understand, often in the minds of children and eventually overwhelm the fear and the terrible world that they cannot understand Obviously, Kim's mother is a psychologist. But she has no clue what happened to her son's heart This is a story of alienation. It is clear that Father George is a far away person who may be a workaholic who seems to be living in a different world. <br /> <br /> The fear of miles reaches a critical point at the end of the week in the country. As part of the New York state with a winter landscape, a barren tree plays a disaster in the imagination of a little boy. It doesn't help him find strange figures in the city. It creates more suspicion in his young mind. In the end, the world of Miles fell to him and he couldn't do anything, even waking up the spirit of Wendigo. <br /> <br /> This film has a great rhythm and performance. Patricia Clarkson is great. Where is Jake Weber perfect as a far away father who has the opportunity to get close to his son that he doesn't understand Erik Per Sullivan as Miles indicates the chaos within him? I think he is extremely effective because the whole movie is about miles in what happens around him. Finally, John Spedagosco is perfect like Otis, who is terrified by those who are not happy with the world in the way he is. <br /> <br /> Instead of putting this movie into the future, the audience should go. close
