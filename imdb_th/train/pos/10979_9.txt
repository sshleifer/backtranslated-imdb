This documentary follows the life of Big and Little Edie Beale, a mother and daughter who lived as a mansion in the East East Hampton family mansion, New York State, from the mid 50s until the late 70s. Collapsed, and one woman, 78 people and 56 others, shared an unattractive room. Edie Beale, a senior of Jackie Kennedy Onassis and her first cousin. Originally, women were expelled from their homes due to disrepair. But Jackie sends them money to repair so that they can live there. <br /> <br /> Sometimes this movie may look like a woman. Seems to have the best mental health But sometimes this movie is difficult to look at. "Little" Edie blames her mother for her current status and her mother shot back that Edie would not succeed as she thought she was. "Little" Idi is often trapped in the past, often focusing on the choices she had made decades ago and prefers to show pictures from her youth, which she clearly sees as a beautiful debut. Her mother seemed to give up her fate more to live the rest of his life. There is a clear hint about the fascinating life that both women have ever taken from the images that show the happy family to Edie's grandiose old paintings next to her bed. From what we see of the house, most of the rooms in it are empty, cracked and cracked walls, and Edy "Little" left food in the attic to feed. And of course there are many cats running around. <br /> <br /> The heart of this documentary is incredibly sad. While both women seem depressed, especially in their lives, the dirt they live in is most scary. It is not clear, especially if there is water flowing in the house and you will get the impression that their family is essentially abandoned. <br /> <br /> However, as a documentary, the film is a miracle to see. And highly recommended
