This movie is the best movie that Jim Carrey had ever created. Carrey didn't have a normal look at this film. He was both funny and sad. Carrey plays as a journalist named Bruce Nolan. Nolan blames God. (Morgan Freeman) For everything that went wrong in his life Then God came down from heaven and gave Bruce's power. As I said earlier, Carrey works very well. I still think Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston are great as actors / actors. The plot is good because there are many sub-points in the main points. This movie may be a joke. (Bruce's dog) including sad stories ("Separation") The script works well as well. I'm glad they created the sequel of this movie. I rate this movie 9/10
