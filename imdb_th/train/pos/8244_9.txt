love it! Will not like anything - you get your suburb, you get your zombies, you have your family problems, you get your social conflicts, you get one Retro-1950 Fine texture of meat eating style under the class About whether they are the next meal crust You can't ask anything anymore. <br /> <br /> A great actor, Carrie Ann Moss is absolutely perfect as a social climbing housekeeper. She is both a savage and an accomplice criminal. Every friend's dream, Ksun, is great because the son tries to be as normal as possible to live in a nightmare and succeed. He has a real screen. Very beautiful and natural photography The rest of the actors were so wonderful. Henry Czerny plays a suspicious policeman with a sharp instinct and nausea as if it were his daily character. Billy Connolly is happy like Fido. Good actor: I hope he plays the role of "Braveheart" with director Gibson. My feeling is that William Wallace will be closer to the actual character. His Fido is only accessible to the touch. <br /> <br /> In short, is Great and great satire on morals, values, social pinning, feelings, growth, coping in uncertain times Actual reality show
