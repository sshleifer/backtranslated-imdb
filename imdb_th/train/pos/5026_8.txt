This is a great movie that everyone should watch. It plays like Dean Koontz. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton's performance is great, which looks like he believes what he says and does. <br /> <br /> I don't know why the audience. Therefore having to read in support of the religious murder in the movie, it is a trilogy, a surprise story But what is the fictional story? I think that's what makes this movie very good. Spoilers do not read more if you see a movie. Throughout the film, the audience was shocked by the illness of the character, Paxton, the impact on children and the way children deal with this evil behavior. And at the end it became real God placed him on a mission to rid the world of demons. Paxton did not have the clairvoyance that other viewers suggested. Of course he received information that he had never known before. But this movie shows that God "protects" Adam through a convenient video quality problem and lacks the memory of the second FBI agent completely. This film does not support the murder of Christians. But is just an unexpected watch
