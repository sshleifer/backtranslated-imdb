I'm glad to see this short movie. I am always disappointed that the short film is hard to meet, so when I saw this and saw that it was nominated for a short live action movie at the Academy Awards. Understanding <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple. The director, writer and actor Nacho Vigalondo tries to figure out the reasons why people split into songs and dances like they did in music movies. The result is tremendous entertainment, and the song is really catchy. <br /> <br /> It's a short film that is well-made, edited, and all actors work great. And the final match of this film is perfect. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie.
