I don't understand what it is. Fans of this type don't like about this movie. it was really fun Special effects are excellent. In general, I agree with the reviewers and IMDB voters, but not at this time. I waited until it came to the home video, which I felt was another reason why I didn't enjoy this movie. I believe that special effects movies must be seen on the big screen. But not so For me, this movie compares to two movies that were released at the same time. Blair the Witch and the Mummy Both movies that I think are terrible. Blair may be the most exaggerated horror movie of all time. Mummies make a lot of money and it's a pure ruins. People like it because of special techniques. Movies like The Mummy and The Haunting aren't rich in character development. With that comparison, mummies are B tickets to the E-ticket of Haunting.
