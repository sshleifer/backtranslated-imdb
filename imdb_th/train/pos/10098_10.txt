Dominion Tank Police There is no doubt one of the most amazing performances ever produced. But not only in animation circles While the first part (Acts 1 and 2) mostly consists of action and fun, the second part is more severe and should not be treated as the second part in the same way as the first part. The true details of this world and the character of the character are excellent. You must have a special level of intelligence to appreciate the complexity of the second part (Acts -3 and 4). I have some complaints in the first part. Tank Bonaparte literally skips the tank shell and it doesn't make sense. Some people may ask about the credibility of the Bonaparte jumping on the wing of an armed helicopter, although it is cool.
