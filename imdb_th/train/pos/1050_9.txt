This remarkable documentary allows us to see the lives of brave women in the Cameroon judicial system - police, lawyers and judges. Despite the great difficulty - the lack of a method of desperate poverty in many languages ​​and many legal aspects, depending on the region of the country and the religious / ethnic background of the plaintiff and the defendant - strong and strong women These differences. <br /> <br /> This is a rare thing - a truly inspiring movie that will return a little faith in humanity. Although the cruelty that we see in justice movies will be grateful to these passionate and hardworking women. <br /> <br /> I hope that this movie will be released in the United States extensively. The more people who watch this movie, the better.
