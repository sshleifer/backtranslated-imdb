This is a practice for all Bolan fans. Some people may think that it's a little bit of a story and it's only about the ego of Ringo and Marc, but I think it's like other concert videos. I like music videos for children in the revolution, especially with Elton John and Ringo Starr. This clip has all the money. I can't believe that they didn't release this version as a single. This movie is really great, especially for us Danish. Now I didn't live in the early 70s, but the Danish people in general were completely fired from what happened around them. The media have not played or played any popular songs since then, including Marc Bolan and T.Rex. They play only a little with The Doors, but are only popular songs. So I know from my father who saw this thing for him to return to be a part of his youth. He never received experience. <br /> <br /> I won't do it for too long. Avid of Marc Bolan, you must see this You may find it boring or as mentioned earlier. But at least you can see one of the best musicians ever. <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes me a little disappointed is that Ride A White Swan isn't on the tape. But I forgive it since Jeepster and Get It On play wonderfully
