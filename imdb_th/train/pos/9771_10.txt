Interesting and innovative! At the beginning of the Whoopi Goldberg case, under criminal evaluation, the author draws parallel lines between Theodore Rex and 1941, Orson Welles, the classic "Citizen Kane". Writers are justified in drawing parallel lines. Seems to be different But the general audience is often deceived to see the image of Hollywood too much to appreciate the deep similarities between the two movies in "Citizen Kane". Work and followers like Whoopi Goldberg in this movie. This movie is about finding love in everyone's differences. It examines the fear of being abandoned and the need for love and acceptance in a society dominated by greed and self-absorption. Anyone who paired with Whoopi Goldberg and Theodore Rex, invented a formula for all ages with the only reasonable comparison, Bogey and Bacall, Hepburn and Tracy and Hall and Oates. If you love to watch Examine the philosophies of high levels of Seloulo, the deepest driving force of mankind, Bergman-esqe, but not depressing. You should watch Theodore Rex immediately!
