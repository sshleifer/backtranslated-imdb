This movie is a movie that everyone must not miss. Having sex should see a true documentary from the military's perspective, just like everyone in America. The previous examiner completely missed the issue - the point is to reveal the truth about teaching our soldiers to kill those who are not terrorists. But just living in our "enemy" lands and things done with the military We must support our forces by bringing them home immediately before others are killed or injured. This also shows that the government does not help veterans who are mentally injured with PTSD stress disorder - post traumatic or physical wounds with missing limbs. Julie A. Roberts, Streamwood, IL
