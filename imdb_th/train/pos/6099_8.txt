I still have grained, late, no wires, the cheap VHS dubbing of this list from waaaaaayyyy. Go back when the ads were late and all when I would be up to the strange hours they would hit this list I can compress it. <br /> <br /> This series is not about Freddy Kreuger - only the first two parts that are related to him are everything except the announcer of Rod Serling-esquire. Each episode is a different nightmare, using the traditional horror theme of a terrifying childhood, dating, eating, dating, money, death, dating and ... Um ... dating <br /> <br /> From when the teenage boy accidentally said "I will love you forever" with the wrong woman and stuck with you (At least for a moment they grew together ...) to the young waitress back home Only with a stranger who will find himself in his cabin where he has a trophy room filled with other waiters and I am the only one that I can remember clearly, which compares the blind date with hockey. (And injuries and penalties The most scary thing in the series <br /> <br /> One episode has Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator and others) as a pizza dealer that is inspired with a delicious new secret ingredient. Not original But still creepy and fun .... <br /> <br /> Even though some episodes are great My personal favorites are "It's a miserable life" that a young man caught in a burger shop with his parents when he wanted to go to college. Stuck with talking to himself and showing a small puppet with an old cheeseburger - until one night when a stranger came through and suddenly his life was not the same No, not just Freddie, the gun too - turned out to be an incredible story - that's the last thought through the boy's head ... with bullets. <br /> <br /> The second half of the same episode. (Many of Freddy's nightmares episodes are the main two short stories related to the Strip) His girlfriend, who has been injured But not dead in driving - and who goes "hospital from the heck" - they stuffed into the most disgusting hospital, and then there were some people from which your mouth was sewn off - or woke up Come in during the surgery - let your girlfriend die and try to lure you into the little morgue. /> <br /> Again, that's what I like. <br /> <br /> Some episodes at that time. Very stupid, like almost everyone they do is available in the video. They took someone who had problems as a representative of the series, and no one liked them. They thought the show was bad. They didn't add more videos anymore. It's a miserable life, only available in PAL DVD in England - but I will still buy it.
