I know that in the beginning, this movie is not a box office movie. But during the recent news of Hollywood (Which most have published cool recipes, things "drifting), the feast of all saints, of course, in this tragic context deserves a second opinion, movies - like a book - losing the anchor in the background of History But it shows a unique American dilemma set against the terrifying American institution, the uniqueness of human slavery and some of the tragedy (And funny and touching) <br /> <br /> And deserving of being outside, Robert Ri'chard, the youngest, is the leading protagonist, Marcel, whose idealism is truly universal when he begins Only the 'era of his arrival' would be cruelly disappointed in what became his true education in the form of the cultivation of southern Louisiana at the end of the antebellum era. There are Ri'chard blondes (scared). I expect the clown, fop, caricature - I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee at the end Ben Vereen, Pam Grier, Victoria Rowell And Jasmine Guy lend bright images and awesome skills As an actor in the backdrop of curtains, voodoo, Creole "noble" and rebel Haitians gathered in the love of man. And racial turmoil in a lost society But still with us
