Is not one of your difficult stories and that is the true strength of this movie There are at least two relationships that writers with less confidence will increase all predictable romantic tensions. They not only But helps the audience to feel like this But also create surprises at the same time There are a few Disney-ish moments, especially near the end. But they will manage Overall, it's worth the rental and it's fun to relax. <br /> <br /> BTW If you get a DVD, watch the segment that the director taught you how to do aloo gobi. It's great! Next time we will make it a day before we plan to eat it because this is one dish that is definitely better with a full night in the fridge to spice it out!
