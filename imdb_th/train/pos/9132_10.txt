I will start by telling the story of the first encounter with the song of the Prince. It was in the bar on my 39th birthday and there was a woman dancing bare breasts with "1999" playing on the speakers. I asked someone who was the singer. I said it was a prince. It's great to make me distract from beautiful dancers and not to the top. Later, I began to hear other Prince songs and "dig" them. When the purple rain came out, I still knew very little about this Minnesotan. The movie blew me away. I became the # 1 fan of Prince in the "War Baby" era. Immediately, I found out that one of my cousins ​​was his secretary and she took me and my nephew to be the VIP concert of the Prince we sat. Next to his mother ... how cool it is! When returning to the topic, I agree with Siskel & Ebert, called Purple Purple, as an instant classic. I have seen it more than 17 times and absolutely love it. I think the performance of the Prince is good. Apollonia is a little difficult. But in all of those performances, John Gielgud couldn't play 'The Kid', so Prince wore the role of the movie. (Never slow at all) and excellent governance I have been ranked in the best position for movies, music all the time. The last time I watched it was after about 7 years and still delivered me proud of a fellow Minnesotan Prince Prince and wanted to tell him personally. He walked in front of me during the above concert and said "Hello" to my nephew, but not me. He was talking to his mother. I was crushed a little But he is also number 1 with me
