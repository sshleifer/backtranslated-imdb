(No need to summarize the story because others have already done it) <br /> <br /> It is understood that many viewers find mistakes with this movie, as we are with the whole sense of Current cinema Compared to the backdrop, movies like Ecstasy seem to be straying from other planets. I think there are many worthy reasons why <br /> The most important, this film exposes poetry because the camera pan slowly along the hills around the trees, clouds, etc., giving the feeling of peace and nature. A world that combines men and women together These combinations show the style and dimension that are almost absent from today's technology-driven cinemas, which are quickly edited to distract the audience. In addition, the story is conveyed with the eyes and not with the ears, almost without dialogue to explain what happened. This number is another departure from the current actual fare that the image seems to count when they are excited with the audience. But perhaps the most insecure - sometimes the movie is quietly creepy, not in the sense that the movie is quiet because we expect them to be But in the sense that the characters do not speak when we expect them Therefore, the burden of the story is divided between filmmakers and viewers. The past had to choose his image with art to convey the story while the latter had to think of those pictures because they would not be explained. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to make this film snub-making as just. Pointing out that movies like Machaty come out from aesthetics that are different from what we have today I'm not claiming better or worse. However, I would like to claim that Ecstasy represents a very lost perspective from the current movie experience, which the value of such contemplation is frequently dismissed as slow and boring. <br /> <br /> This movie is not Masterpiece But sometimes reaching the highest point of art, as well as the scene in the beer garden that is beautifully decorated with the last crane rising to reveal a beautiful scene The slow pan of the countryside, with the pantheistic celebration of natural life and restoration, is also shown as a miracle. These scenes are scenes that do not overwhelm you. But gives a half chance by accumulating a quiet experience as a memory of their own, such as various "jaws". <br /> <br /> On the other hand, some movies are as heavy as Machaty. Stacked on the image, especially in the last order It's hard to know what will make this appearance somewhat disruptive. Perhaps the symbol may be related to the heroic dimension that works hard for the heroes and the general people - the theme. Then, was promoted by influential Soviet theaters. However, the appearance of this place is quite boring. <br /> <br /> However, I must admit that I had to adjust to see Hedy LaMarr in the movie. But now I have to admit that in this process I get more than just secretly playing in the forest.
