I never wrote a review about IMDb, except that I was very surprised by the goodness or badness of the movie. This film is in the first category. Every year I try to watch those nominated for a great foreign film award at the Oscar, even those I know I will not like. "It's in Heaven" seems to fit the bill. The plot sounds sweet and sensitive and slow .... For my taste, which runs to the traditional dark and / or brave foreign cinema (Michael Haneke, Francois Ozon, many modern Japanese / Korean cinemas ) "As is heaven" does not sound particularly interesting .... it was not released in the United States, so I sat down to see the VCD that I found in Singapore to prepare to After a dull start, "As It Is In Heaven" becomes a rare movie that you get inspired by what happens on the screen. Weak scores: The characters in the movie are all "stock" characters - the injured in the dream, Town Bully, the brutal wife, the young woman who yearn for love, who has a moral belief .... Thank you, most of them are my favorite. As well as writing and good deeds Inga Olsson, as wife of Minister Inger, will be nominated for an Oscar for her performance in English. Highlights: Music is beautiful and the main song sung by Gabriella is amazing and memorable. Truly And watched the 87-year-old actress, Olga, who followed the dance steps as well as the younger women! I will not talk about the ending. But I will say it's reasonable They have many things that happen in the last hour of the movie and you are not sure why they happened. Although there is no explanation by words But everything is reasonable when the movie enters the right era **** from ***** may be the strongest Swedish movie I've ever seen
