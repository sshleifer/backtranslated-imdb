(Spoiler ??) <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how to think about this movie. Children movies are not too much. Should keep an eye on parents because of course it is death and death But I was surprised that I received a little entertainment. <br /> <br /> I was a little disappointed when 81 minutes (even a little without credit) and the trailer made you think I was the main animal. But alas, they tortured him. Until the end of the movie The two people captured the movie 2 stars connected, but I would recommend the movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 9/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Replayable: 7/10
