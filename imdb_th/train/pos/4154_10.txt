This is one of the best episodes of all time. Officer Sean Cooper was killed in his patrol car. In 68, a prisoner who died in a state prison revealed that he had stolen one heroin from the car after the shooting. His case was reopened, with the assumption that he had been damaged as a policeman. <br /> <br /> An additional investigation against him as a police officer and a human being revealed that veterans involved in forbidden love This kind of love is considered shameful and at least still hidden at that time. <br /> <br /> While this is not the type of love that I personally support, he is still a cop and a human being. should not Not being killed for it The audio track is great. (Makes me see the DVR) and the choice of black and white mixed with colors to emphasize one object or give a specific feeling to the scene is especially interesting, I will watch repeatedly!
