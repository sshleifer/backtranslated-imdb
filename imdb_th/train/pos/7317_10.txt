This is a movie I've heard about my life growing up. But never seen before until a few years ago Its reputation is truly moving. I know Michael Myers. Seeing the mask. See the ad for all the crummy-related sectors that followed. But I grew up in the decade that Jason and Freddie have captured horror games and never thought of a Halloween franchise before. Boy, I was cheated with the cheapest thing. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a truly scary movie. Now, according to today's standards, it is not graphics and internal organs. But this movie presented at all levels, most other horror movies failed to achieve today The atmosphere that John Carpenter created was very eerie, and the fact that this city is located in a quaint town in the middle of the west is a testament to his ability. The light effects shone down horribly, with "shapes" appearing and disappearing into the shadows as needed. Mercilessly simple and powerful music scores add to the doubt. <br /> <br /> Every player's performance is very good, with a nod to Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance Ms. Curtis. Laurie Strode is very good because she is cute and weak. Everything is even more frightening when she gets Michael Stalk walking because the director and the audience have invested a lot with her. We want her to survive and escape. <br /> <br /> Donald Pleasance plays as Dr. Loomis, the man in the mission and working well He added urgency to the situation that the city found itself in because he knew that the evil that happened on their streets <br /> <br /> Overall, not only But is a great Halloween horror movie only It works on many levels and attracts viewers and does not give up. This should be a standard look for anyone who wants to experience a truly scary movie. And in a more shocking time, try to look alone by turning off the lights Don't be surprised if you think you see "shapes" lurking in the shadows!
