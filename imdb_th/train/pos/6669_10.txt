I watched this movie on the day it came out last year. I think hilarious Now it's in the video and I see it again. I love this movie! Sometimes what they do is dumb. But that is what makes my favorite movie ever. Special effects are available. But the sharp conversation will make you crooked I am the type who will say that I am inspired by this movie, so if you like drama and other things, avoid But for everyone else, enjoy! The performance was excellent. Hank Azaria is the best hand. (He is not a communist or a fruit) followed by Ben Stiller (Er, wrong, I made it sick) and then William H. Macy gave his best performance (outshining fargo) praising everyone from macy to garafalo. But I think Kel Mitchell is quite good like Invisible Boy. Two things: The most boring part of this film is the plan of love between Stiller and Claire Forlani and the parole of the buck. Some scenes develop endlessly. But it bursts out. Kinka and especially writers often drag on the scene until the buzz is gone. But they switch and you are more ready I swear after seeing this thing, you are tired from the explosive climax. (Which I think is really cool) The camera is also very beautiful. In addition, Tom Waits also has a great performance. (He has a cool, wonderful hero for him) and like others who say that the best part is when the characters show humanity to them. Captain Amazing is quite funny (especially his words about Casanova about With his perfect plan - I'm rolling) and the hustle is quite cool like Casanova, one beef: the most funny comedian who has ever lost But his heart is in the right place So overall, a great movie I gave this star twenty stars and hoped that someday everyone would see the best satire of this film, a six million dollar man. Laugh now as I think 20/10
