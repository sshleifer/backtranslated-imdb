Male makes the poem dangerous: <br /> <br /> Man or woman? Who knows, <br /> <br /> It turns out that 'it' is both. <br /> <br /> Sleep in the soil. <br /> <br /> Then they leave br> One of their UFOs <br /> <br /> Negligent sex is another great season I like this because the story is the way that you are not sure about what will happen next. It's all original. Teaser is very fun with the blindness and reflection of the disco light. I really have to learn the secret to the truth of Benzer. I like the atmosphere in the small village of Kidded and Mulder and Scully sneaking around in the middle of the night. It's so exciting This is one of my favorite seasons. In Episode 1, I think what I like about it is how they become aliens at the end and leave the crop circles. Many people see this as a non-fairytale episode involving aliens such as "The Unnatural" or "Space", but I think this may be a myth that is easily related. Maybe the sex service provider is like an alien bounty hunter and seems to be someone? Next, I will give Episode 9 of 10.
