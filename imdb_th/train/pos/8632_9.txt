This is a humorous story about morality, so sometimes the bitter touch of tenderness arises. But the lighter brightness causes a smoother and smoother satire. Until then, a moment will stop your heart. Written and directed wonderfully, a jewel that shines perfectly with beautiful performances by everyone. Jean-Louis Trintignant is as wonderful as usual and Romy Schneider is the perfect pearl and shine that should not be missed A truly wonderful movie !!
