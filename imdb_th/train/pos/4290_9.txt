I think Charlotte Gainsbourg is one of the best performers in the world. I do not understand why some people say she is not boring .... ??? Maybe the person who says she is boring may be because he / she is bored. She is a great actor and this movie is great. It has many wonderful ideas and very good actors. The direction is great. I photographed myself in a complicated French environment and perfume, flowers, church problems and so on. When she went to the sister's shop, it was amazing. Everything is excellent We have many wonderful actors for a long time. Alain Chabat and Bernadette Lafont are perfect. I like him more in his next movie. LA SCIENCE DES RÃŠVES and Eric Lartigau work very well. <br /> <br /> Ana
