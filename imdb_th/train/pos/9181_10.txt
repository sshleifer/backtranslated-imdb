I don't know what Jane Eyre is before I watch this drama. I have read and watched many classics before and I believe that most classics are boring, exaggerated words and exaggerated stories with a fairly interesting plan. This drama Jane Eyre changed my concept. <br /> <br /> Selah Clarke is a great actor. Her accent is pleasant and quiet. But the close nature that is in harmony with the character of the little girl Timothy Dalton is an amazing Rochester. His passion and power in the film made me believe that he was born to play the role of Bruce Master of Thornfield Hall. I couldn't sleep all night after watching this drama. The story is haunted and inspiring. The characters proceeded expertly and the story was great. This is the best version of Jane Eyre that had appeared on film. <br /> <br /> I read the book later. Jane Eyre is now my favorite movie and book. If you want to see a masterpiece that will change your life, see the 1983 Jane Eyre version of the BBC.
