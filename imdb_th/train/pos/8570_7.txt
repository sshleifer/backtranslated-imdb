I immediately noticed that this movie was not based on Dodie Smith's novel. In any case, it was a good idea that Pongo's son and Perdita had his own puppy. Of course, the most adorable Dalmatian is the perfect little snowball to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Speak straight. I don't know what to think of when Kla. Will seem totally changed In fact, I tend to think about the possibility that she is friendly. But now she quickly turns into "herself" again and announces that she is Cruella again. I almost start worrying with Chloe's Dalmatians And Kevin had a better dinner than I expected I also like parrots playing as dogs, and it's incredible that dogs learn a lot of tricks for this film. <br /> <br /> Sure, I'm satisfied that Dalmatian has been rescued again. But I want to know what will happen to Crea Ella after she loses all of her assets. And at the dog house can do with a lot of money. <br /> <br /> Finally, it was quite touching that Snowball had a spot at the end of the movie.
