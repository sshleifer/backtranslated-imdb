But I want to say that I disagree with Moira again. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie. <br /> <br /> I'm thinking about it this morning. Those who lose money on his debit card through fraud and want to say 'Keep your money in your pocket' and realize that I'm talking like James Mason. <br /> <br /> Even though he doesn't say those words I still think he will! I never forget that In reconciliation with his son, Hywel Bennet: 'There is always money in your pocket!' Good advice. <br /> <br /> Not enough children to have a father with an un-forgiving attitude. Or any father. <br /> <br /> It will be good for us to return to the status of 'thee' and 'thee' in our language to show that we care about it like 'tutoyer' in French or 'du' in German <br /> <br /> Appendix: I just know that many of my words about James Mason in The Family Way! <br /> <br /> I think it is. Because I mix Susan George with Hayley Mills well, wrongly. <br /> <br /> I stand by those comments. <br /> <br /> And the season. The spring and port wine is similar to The Family Way. <br /> <br /> When you bring your girlfriend to the picture in those days, you have something to say and talk about after that. Your knowledge about the world and your personal development <br /> <br /> The drama experience is almost the same. And they are important in helping young people grow. <br /> <br /> I think it doesn't happen now that teenagers can go to the pictures as we do.
