I have a personal interest in this film when I was 17 and just out of high school. I got 20 jobs at Century Fox as a trade union member and Hodgarers. At the end of my first day (Sweeping the deck of the aircraft carrier) I was told to take the luggage the next morning with enough clothes and others for a week or two. When I arrived the next morning, there was a bus waiting and about 20 of us headed south to San Diego. We stopped at the base called Camp Callan or Camp Hahn. When we entered Camp Pendleton, we would find a few miles to the north, a large sea base. On the beach, we started to build what should be the base of the Japanese Pacific island. We take about a week or ten days to install, which includes water storage tanks, guns, guns, trenches, sand and shelter. All of this is a very high cost, sometimes 'golden time' which increases our hourly wage by three times. Our food is still the first rate = main ribs at noon, etc. - which is amazing because it's a war time and very difficult to get good meat from home. <br /> <br /> When the work is finished, I wait enthusiastically. The movie will come out about eight or ten months later. Then I waited enthusiastically through the movie two hours before my craft finally appeared on the screen. Then no more than three or four minutes (Probably less) because the movie's hero struck the base and blown it to the smelter. Quite disappointing, but still fun. <br /> <br /> In spite of disappointment, I enjoyed the movie and didn't see it since. I learned later that the film was played by the government and Fox received a positive charge which could be considered as our expense and extravagant lifestyle there. Bob Weverka
