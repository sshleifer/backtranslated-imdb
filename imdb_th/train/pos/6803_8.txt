In her first film, Romy Schneider flashed the Queen of Victoria as she was brought to the throne at the age of 18, learning to rule even though the politicians are celebrated. This romance is irresistible. Watching this movie about the English dynasty that speaks in German will enhance its charm. In the front there is one thing to wonder why the Austrian movie was created about the British Queen. But then someone remembers that in the year 1954, Austria remained under the occupation of the Allied forces. Perhaps this is one of the reasons for the existence of this film.
