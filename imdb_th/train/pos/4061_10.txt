This is the best dub that I have ever heard from Disney, including the best adaptations since the greatest violations ever have in the character theme soundtrack. The dialogue in Kiki Delivery Service Urrrghhh <br / > <br /> This has a different atmosphere, especially the deviation from the common heroine. This has both heroes and heroines. (Although I did not really support the use of heroes and heroines here since Miyazaki came out of the traditional and general themes) as usual after being introduced by Spirited Away, surprised by Mononoke, worried by the Grave of Fireflies and deep contact with Majo no Takkyuubin. This person started with a little doubt on my part. Wondering whether or not to be the first person of Ghibi? Finally, like yesterday and Whisper of the Heart, I ended up scoring 10 points. I gave 9.8 points, but there were 0.2 more there to share good feelings by stimulation. Let people watch movies. <br /> <br /> Any spoiler. I see this as a sad movie. Dead people in this story. The lonely robot, the place that was abandoned and it ended with destruction. As if humanity cannot live with too much power The collapsing scene makes me feel the end of the Metropolis. It's a sad story. The story is clear in most reviews and sound rules (as always) Joe Hisaishi belongs to Uematsu, Kanno, Williams caliber who can bring movies, games, events to life, even if it's a delectable moment. <br /> <br /> This is a good feeling. The movie that used to be part of the US cinema in the classic era (It's a wonderful life, etc.) Things that change ....
