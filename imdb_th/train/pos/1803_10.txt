My dog ​​has just passed away and this is a movie I like as a child, so I have to see it to try to cheer. <br /> <br /> (Beware of dogs, I mean spoilers). This is not Not just for children and it's far from ordinary people. It was set up in New Orleans in 1939. First of all, the dog didn't show that it was a special family member in this film. But as an adult with his complex life to deal with <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Charlie is not different from the dishonest and cruel business partner like Carface. He is a greedy car driver. And just fleeing the death row as he said at the beginning of the feature The difference between Charlie and Carface is that Charlie is able to learn and be willing to listen to others. Ann Marie and his best friend, Carface, won't listen to even the ugly fat dog with big glasses that are close to him. <br /> <br /> Carface tries to kill the hero because he wants 100% profit in Their business and Will not pay only 50% - a very unusual way for a German Shepherd to die In addition, being eaten by prehistoric crocodiles that have lost your life because you can sing that song is very difficult whether you are a dog or not. This is a cartoon and that's why it's reasonable here. <br /> <br /> Carface's revenge is through murder, while Charlie believes that success is the best revenge. After surviving death, he started the business by finding a loan from Carface, a highly talented child with the ability to communicate with animals. They won the competition. The whole group and Charlie told her that he would give money to the poor. - Hints. Hint: Charlie and Itchy lived in the garbage collection so poor. He spent money on casinos / bars / theaters and not "poor" others. The reason Anne Marie has the ability to talk to animals is that she has compassion and she listens. She teaches Charlie's ethics by pointing out gambling, lying and stealing. Charlie tries to do it by buying her dress. She added a code of conduct that his business wanted while Charlie managed and Itchy gave the construction. <br /> <br /> Carface used violence and property damage to destroy Charlie's business, which was not protected by the government. Charlie lost everything and what he left was this little girl. Finally, he had to choose between her life and his own. He grabbed the watch from taking care of himself first and put it down when the girl began to sink. Both the girl and the watch were overwhelmed and he had to choose one and he chose the girl. <br /> <br /> The good part about this film that focuses on the person's ability to learn is right. Must be from the wrong time And the ability of children to cope with the natural occurrences of their pets is that it never shows who is dying! The clock symbolizes his life and the clock shows that he is submerged and stopped. All death is directed, even for the villain. I didn't cry in this movie until now and I received more. I had to write it and share with you.
