Everyone in the drama, from Tsukiyama to Aoki and Toyoko, is the person we know in everyday life. They are very natural and the change of Sugiyama is incredibly convincing. The score is very moving, it makes me tear. The choreography is beautiful without looking strong. Dancing and the beautiful charm of Chiang Mai made me shocked. Tamako is a very delightful character. You almost saw a charming student on her face while she remembers seeing "King and Me". Aoki's character is both hilarious and pathetic. Masako is an overwhelmingly natural nature, like a confused wife. You almost want to hug her to give you confidence that everything is right.
