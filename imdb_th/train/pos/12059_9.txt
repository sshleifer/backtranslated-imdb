I like ghost stories in general. But I like the cool, cool, and creepy love in English. This one has all counting features. The innocent young lawyer ("lawyer" in Britspeak) is sent to a small village near the seashore to settle the elderly and the property of the woman who died. It was during the 1920s that many middle-class Britons went on vacation in the sea to "their health". Okay, guess that there's nothing. "Good for health" about the creepy Crythin Gifford village of the bustling elderly village in the Victorian land, which is located on the edge of the muddy salt. When the lawyer saved the little girl's life (no villagers would save the endangered token - you'll know why in the next film) he intends to cause anger of evil spirits. She is a person without soft leather. But is the shadow of evil and evil The viewer saw her only a few times. But you feel her malice in every frame While the camera crawled into the lawyer while he read the legal documents, you would expect to see this black woman at any time. When the lawyer goes out to the garage to open electricity for an old house that is creepy, the camera is stuck with him and you think she will appear there as well. Waiting for women in black to appear with suspicion We've seen many elements of this story before. (The lock room that no one came to fog, innocent innocent people who ignore the warnings of the people in the area) but the director manages to combine them all together. Watch stories with friends so you have someone warm at Will grab while waiting for the woman in black dress ..
