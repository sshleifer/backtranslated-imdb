Brothers with mental power (yes, really). But for Debra Viking's love But still a secret from their childhood that makes them more likely than their power. <br /> <br /> There is a real touch. Acting like a Greek chorus singing) but with humor and love The soundtrack is similar to the way that American Werewolf in London uses Wolf music. All the songs they will receive ~ But with the fire ~ and I don't think I will forget Dennis Quaid (Dennis Quaid) set his own trailer Is rockin 'to' she is a woman '~ priceless;) <br /> <br /> missing lines from the words btw ~' when you have a clown, you won't go back! '<br /> <br /> I love this movie. (I ordered a DVD from America) and if any comments written by someone who is happy with Legally Blond 3 don't let you down. Try it. :)
