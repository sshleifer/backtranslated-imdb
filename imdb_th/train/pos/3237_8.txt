From my experience in Finland for over a week, I would say that this film shows the very precise nature of Finnish society. Especially the young couple's phenomenon with serious problems with babies is something that I am very familiar with since I saw this same thing when I was in Finland. Relationships and problems of people, institutional vulnerability, marriage, culture, drinking, unemployment and increasing money problems are all very good without any action or exaggeration. <br /> <br / > There are some issues in Movies that do not need to be understood and tied together easily, but a large overview is worthwhile. Not each short story that is exciting or profound But as mentioned above, the big picture does not fail to deliver the feeling of "real life" and attract viewers. I think in a peaceful time: what happens in the lives of these people on the road? This is what happened Such movies are good to increase your imagination. It is safe to assume that this movie can be used in many countries, but it reflects Finnish in particular and is quite good. <br /> <br /> One comment about Show: Finnish fans My cinema, I have never seen these actors do anything with other movies. But I found that acting in this movie is next to the perfect picture. May not be a masterpiece But is a very good effort by all the crew I will keep an eye on the release of future directors and actors .. <br /> <br /> 7,5 / 10
