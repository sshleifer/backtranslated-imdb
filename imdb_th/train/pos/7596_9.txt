At first, I was immediately impressed with what I expected from the series. Mystery awaiting revision and many good plays! I like the fact that they gradually reveal stories about the characters! Explain enough to be excited! Of course, this show has some drawbacks! In the first two series, there are some characters that do not appear in the third season for some reason! Many characters have good delivery. But some people are not there! Like Rose and her husband! Where are they? What happened to them Maybe they will come back later! But it's not a little consistent! That was said "lost" is exciting every episode (Especially in the first two seasons)! That is a very difficult thing to do! I noticed that in the third season, the focus will focus on character development rather than the mysterious side of the show! This is not a bad thing! It also helps to make some episodes not boring! One of the elements that can be considered the highlight of this show is the great character! You will love these characters more! Good or bad! But in the end I want to see some mystery that will fix and shut down! The danger of "getting lost" has been canceled due to the reduced ratings approaching! And that will destroy!
