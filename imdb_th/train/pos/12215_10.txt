I love this movie from the opening sequence until the end. I found that the style of the director / actor who told me directly / the audience was very involved. <br /> <br /> The thing that I think is the most exciting and refreshing about this movie is ignoring - And the challenges of sex and patterns in the classroom. The character's character is expressed in the form of strengths and lack of judgment and acceptance of characters and characters, each other, allowing me to embrace them. And gave himself drawn into their world. Without having to preach and with gentle and cute humor and cuteness, this film has the power to open us to new possibilities and give hope to a world where people see and accept each other. Is a valuable and unique person I hope to receive more offers from creative directors with this ability.
