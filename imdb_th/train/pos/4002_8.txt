At the beginning of the movie, we watched May and Toots prepare for a trip to London to visit the older children. One can see the Toots not in the best health. But he went together When he died suddenly, the world of May began to break out of control. <br /> <br /> The movie directed by Roger Michell from the movie Hanif Kureshi is a study of how this image is. With a new status in her life and she woke up to a world she had never known until now. <br /> <br /> May's life as a suburban wife may be boring. Obviously, her sexual life was nothing. We will know that she has a short love relationship and nothing. In May, losing her husband, she could not go home, so she didn't think of her granddaughter's house. It is in this setting that may begin to have a desire after Darren, young and hunky, occasionally loving her daughter. <br /> <br /> Darren woke up in May, a passion that she never knew. May respond by changing yourself before our eyes May at the beginning of the film, stupid, began to dress up, becoming a woman of interest and interest. She became the head that fell to the heel with this young man, which made her desire never felt before. <br /> <br /> Knowing that there are many cases that are similar to this. See May's reaction Her chance of having a normal relationship with Bruce is a disappointing ending in May, which realizes how good her sex is with Darren. We think that the younger man is just this in order to satisfy himself and the possibility of extortion from May. Finally, Helen's daughter discovers what her mother is doing behind her when she discovers the erotic paintings that her mother has done. <br /> <br /> This film is a director's victory. In Ann Reid, Michelle met the best actress who brought May's role. Also amazing is Daniel Craig. He knows how Darren will respond to the situation. Anna Wilson Jones, while Helen is important to the story while she is the one who has to confront her mother about what happened after her. Oliver Ford Davies plays a small role while Bruce, an old man in Helen's class, is quite powerful. <br /> <br /> This movie is a reward for those who can. Agree with an open mind. <br /> <br />
