It may have been a remake of the story of the fall of 1987 after eleven years, as the director Mabel Cheung claimed. Mabel used rock music as a medium in this film to show her personal attitude towards life in which love The desire and frustration that followed plays an important role. Rock music may not be the best vehicle to convey profound feelings. But it is not appropriate to use it because the life of an underground rock musician is stronger than general music The director focuses on describing the deep love and arrogance of life more than just rock music. The love between father and son, lover, and friend is delivered neatly through the best performances. Mabel didn't try to make rock musicians as artists. In any way, she tried to create a real life on the screen, using a lot of effort to work on the project and gather information in Beijing's underground pub. <br /> <br /> Daniel has given the best performance in every movie. His story His natural stubbornness and tranquility perfectly fits the blue mood of this film.
