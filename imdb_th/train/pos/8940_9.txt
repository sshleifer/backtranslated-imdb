The autobiography of this film is still one of the most readable books I have ever read. It tells the amazing story of the two brothers, both those who receive loyalty and respect, work well in their 70s as teachers and dentists, then live another 30 years with dignity. Ruby Dee stole this movie. With her excellent performance as a traitorous dentist Bessie, she not only expresses her anger, anger and her great wisdom. She lets you know where they come from using economical words. DIHN Carroll has the feeling of being a sister to the teacher completely. But I'm afraid she never made me believe that she was over 100 years old. No matter - the story is worth telling. Amy Madigan is too violent and intrusive in acting and is not safe in the first half of Movie as a reporter for the Caucasian NY Times. This is just a slight distraction. The whole story is fascinating, and even if two or three people get a little bit of damage in translation But most of them do well. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this book to everyone I recommend. Which book I can't do anything except this TV movie in the purest air. But of course, it can convey the right taste for its own worth.
