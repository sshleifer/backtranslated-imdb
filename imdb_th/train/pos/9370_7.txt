I have never heard of this before seeing it. I wonder if it's an independent film and I'm right. But with a good actor, I decided to have a chance In general, Michael Williams (Nicholas Cage) is in Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for a job and owner Bar Wayne Brown. (JTW Walsh of Pleasantville) is the owner. He receives a large sum of money to hire to kill Suzanne, his unfaithful wife (Lara Flynn Boyle). Causing him to become a counteroffer. He decided that he had to go out. When Wayne learns of his true identity, he chases Michael, firing a cannon until he enters the car with Lyle from Dallas. (Dennis Hopper) But things get more complicated when Michael realizes that Lyle is a hit that he misunderstood and he quickly flees. He returned to Susan and knew that both of them were in danger. They planned to leave the city together and increase the difficulty again by falling in love. However, before they leave, Susan insists that they go and steal a lot of money in a safe place. Of course things will not go smoothly and Wayne and Lyle follow them and Lyle forces them and now Wayne is bound to receive the money that is buried. In the end, both Lyle and Wayne get what they deserve. Michael and Suzanne take the train together. But apparently she was interested in more money and she also received what she deserved, also starring Craig Reay as Jim, Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart as Vice Matt Greytack, Dwight Yoakam as a person Driving a truck and Robert Apel as Howard. Performances other than the weak Boyle, everything is good and elegant, and it makes the movie noisy quite well for the black comedian. Very good!
