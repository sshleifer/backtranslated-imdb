I hope to watch this movie when on TV. Need to get a DVD, I guess. The range of different types of people is great. It told me that everyone can be a dancer if they try hard enough. My favorite character is Mr.Aoki. He is very strange but full of emotions. It is a perfect movie that has excellent dancing. Unfortunately we didn't have the opportunity to see them go to Blackpool. Will make it a perfect sequel if they have But I think it makes you imagine what might happen. <br /> <br /> A simple and innocent story. He was still loyal to his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> I didn't see the Hollywood release. Not sure if i want I don't enjoy Jennifer Lopez. I think Richard Gere is more original than Lopez. I have a feeling that the remake is not easy and innocent.
