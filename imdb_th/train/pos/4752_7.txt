A story about the efforts of Mars to occupy the world. (Things that have to come back badly on Mars) Two state soldiers examined the scene of a UFO crash. Everything that is landing will be buried under the ice at Tracy's Pond, but there are snow footprints leading to nearby restaurants. <br /> <br /> The foodies don't have customers from eleven o'clock in the morning. There are now a number of bus passengers waiting to be allowed to cross the bridge with weak structures. The bus driver confirmed that there were six passengers on the boat, although he didn't notice who he was. The problem is that there are seven people waiting to continue their journey. One of them is aliens. But which one? Everyone is suspicious. Of course, there is a crazy old man (Jack Elam) who seems to be sub-exercising. There is a group of business people who have to come to Boston (John Hoyt), a young couple in Honey. Their moon (Great performance by husband Kipling Ron.) Except for couples, no one else noticed. And even couples are still skeptical The bride and the newly created husband: "I will swear that you have a mole on your chin." The story continues to be lively. But a little scary - the phone rang without reason. The light turned on and closed. The juke box opened itself - and there would be no serious action. <br /> <br /> It was a thoroughly enjoyable band and revelation. The climate is ridiculous. There is no "depth" that can be seen. It is not a moral message about masked people disguised as normal citizens. It is not a warning, just a fairy tale that deviates and fun. <br /> <br /> I always enjoy it when it's open It is very interesting to see John Hoyt being a frustrated and impatient businessman knowing that in 1954 he was a Roman Senator. And here he is - with three arms. <br /> <br /> Oops
