Myself and my 20 colleagues can't get this great Parker Posey CLASSIC! I try to rent it on the DVD, but it doesn't look like - too bad, because I'm sure the feature will be "special" !! :) We all recommend this uber-cool funny flickerino for dating or even a very night home. Only comfortable! This will be the perfect movie to watch with your cat or even partying in a "Girl Girl" partying party, just like in a cute movie. To the end Oh, and watch out for the surprises that are remarkable and end up in difficulty ... Keep the way to The Sixth Sense. You've just defeated this movie! Sorry, no offense, just call it as it is! Taken from old-fashioned jokes lovers, not better than "Party Girl" with Parker P! Feel it! Sincerely, Ronald Marie MacDougall (aka DJ Cyber-Rap)
