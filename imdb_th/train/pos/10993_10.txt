This movie is a gem because it moves with softness. But the sharpness <br /> <br /> I warned the audience that although it was charged as a spy, Corporate Spy and Ms Liu were there. It's not about the explosion, the car chase. Or bullets that can fly You must be patient and observe the details here instead. It's calm because that's what the main character is. The audience must watch him and think that this story unfolds. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to give spoilers - because that's breaking the point of view. The plot is what you have read from other posts: the average white-collar people, seeking change and adventures, signing into corporate spies. Just go somewhere and secretly record and send the information. <br /> <br /> Take it from there. <br /> <br /> This movie starts with a surreal walk - with the background. Of the chaos of an organization that surrounds itself with the subtle suburban paranoia> <br /> then starts to accelerate Something is a parody character But they all fit and they are fun And the soft piano sound in the background is perfect, just like a soft soft key set that is scary: all is not right at the beginning <br /> <br /> and ultimately: not all Looks like /> <br /> Comfortable and turn off the lights to see this thing - and turn on the sound: This movie requires you to listen.
