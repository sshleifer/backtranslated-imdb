If you like "Othello", you will love this movie since the half of the movie revolves around the production of the musical. <br /> <br /> This film has great actors with Signe Hasso and Shelley Winters as the life woman. Colman, while Edmond O'Brien plays a brave media representative. <br /> <br /> Two of my favorite players are Millard Mitchell as a frustrated journalist who finds a corner. And Joey Sayer Carey, a police player in the case <br /> <br /> A wonderful raw moment in this movie with no realism.
