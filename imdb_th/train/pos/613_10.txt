Please, future writers, producers - learn from this movie. <br /> <br /> I've never seen before in bold and original stories created for large movie screens. Bold because the script makes the steps in many fantasy movies safely avoided - step into something new, creative and brave. When you think 'Oh, I've seen this before.' Or 'I'm sure this is what will happen now' - StarDust will make you more unexpected and relevant to you. <br /> <br /> Top actors Great - even the smallest episode can be shown with the ability that is full of fear for this filmmaker. Robert De Niro is beautiful and is shown with the power that he stole. The performances in each scene he entered Michelle Pfeiffer is the perfect witch and Claire Denes is a great choice for Yvaine. The innocent and other big name lovers have an outstanding role. I have something that everyone is trying to do best for this movie. But again, the story of Neil Gaiman, all the little things he 'invented' for this universe - just wonderful. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on the day before today, one day before the preview. Official And hope that it will be very successful With a lot of humor But there are tense moments like the lovely tender scenes in Yvaine 'frivolities' by Captain Shakespeare. Lamia the Witch's passion - impressive and memorable. <br /> <br /> For me, this is an entertainment movie Number one in 2007, see and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> 11/10 - Peace and outstanding love <br /> <br />
