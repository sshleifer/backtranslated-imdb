My school drama club will put this program in the spring of 2002 and I hope that we will do this recently. I watched this movie as "research" for my role (Rosie Alvarez). And I want to say that Vanessa Williams is the coolest person! <br /> <br /> Wow! The casting for this film is correct. (With one exception) Jason Alexander, Oh, there is something he can't do? He is the greatest Albert Peterson ever - especially I love his funny facial expressions and dance during "Put on a happy face!" He's great! As I said earlier, Vanessa Williams is the coolest person. She is a beautiful rosie and the change from the secretary is completely convincing. Tyne Daly is a cheerful man like Albert's nasty and George Wendt's great mother. As annoying McAfee (but I love acting Paul Lynde's in 1963!) Brigitta Dau made me crack like Ursula Merkle; She really hindered it! And Marc Kudisch is a wonderful Conrad Birdie ... "Experiencing!" <br /> <br /> There is a single selection that I do not understand and as you can see from the previous comment, Chynna Phillips didn't understand Chapter Kim McAfee - That's what I mean. She's very cute and talented. But ... She looks too old for the role. Eh, maybe I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> Okay, I would like to recommend this movie. It will make you smile. <br /> <br />
