First of all, I want to edit in another review of this movie, which says that the last time the music that won the Best Picture Academy Award is 'Gigi'. 'My Fair Lady' won in 1965 and 'Sound of Music' won the following year. That said this movie is absolutely fantastic! The story from the novel has changed somewhat. But that's because of the limitations they have on the stage that they haven't changed back to the filming version. Anyway, I don't mind In fact, I think that all production flows better than novels. I like Nancy taking Oliver to the bridge with her and being killed there instead of in the apartment. The deep thing in this movie is what makes me laugh. I love the time when Bumble and Mrs. Bumble start from the beginning of the governor's office. The underscore of the time is great. My favorite three actors for this movie are Jack Wild, the best Dodger player in every movie, Ron Moody, a playful and humorous Fagin player. (This character works much better than him in the book) and Shani Wallis, Nancy's strongest and most troubled model. The only reason I gave this movie instead of 9 instead of 10 is because the two numbers are called 'Concider Yourself' and 'Who Will Buy'. I tend to hate when choreography in a musical drama is like a person working. Home and work every day It looks scary and wonderful, especially when they dance at London Meat Co.. They should design regular choreography for these scenes. However, this movie is a rare treasure that will stay with us. Hope forever.
