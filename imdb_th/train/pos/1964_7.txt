I cannot accept the negative comments of other investigators. They are too important, probably because they are stuck in the past. I want to see comments from people who have never seen basic instincts 1, may be very young people? I left the theater. I'm happy that I was not influenced by IMDb critics. 14 hours later, I still tried to find flaws in the plot. But I can't think seriously My advice for everyone is to see for yourself and decide for yourself. <br /> <br /> It follows a pattern similar to Basic Instinct 1, but the plot is less confusing. It also makes me wonder at the end. But in a more pleasant way Sharon Stone is sexy and wicked like before and she wore 48 years well; This role is still determined by her. David Morrisey is satisfied. Even though he is not Michael Douglas, the supporting actor, I like David Thewlis as a police detective.
