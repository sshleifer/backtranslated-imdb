The name says it all. <br /> <br /> I'm not a movie critic and I'm not acting like a madman who commented on this movie. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the movie This is not 'without a multi-million dollar budget. But the plot is very good. The performance is excellent and the movie is great! Looks like you will enjoy creating this movie so much! I voted 9 out of 10 because the sound is just one channel instead of both. But I think this may be a mistake in recording DVDs. <br /> <br /> I'll definitely check out other movies produced by Brain Damage Films! <br /> <br /> Dylan O'Leary Actors and teams I thank you!
