The film has very simple and intelligent evidence - an unemployed man trying to steal from a convenience store and the shopkeeper caught him in action ... The thief ran away with the shop clerk immediately after him. While the shop clerk had a problem with a low-level Yakuza (gangster), they watched Yakuza's hunt for a robber hunt for a convenience store salesman. Then the story moves into high gear in the form of Tom & Jerry (cat & mouse), but added with a dog chase after the cat. Act 2, all of D.A.N.G.A.N. runners (can be translated into English as "Pinball Runner") is about chase and chase. It continues to the point that at the end of chapter 2, the butt forgot why he ran and Yakuza Don. Can't remember who he was in the hunt for 2 people and he couldn't remember why they had escaped from him. <br /> <br /> Similar to SABU POSTMAN BLUES's most recent film. It's just a chase. And action that is funny, physical and dark humor permeates the audience to participate The missing thing is the ending, where the chase stops when the three men are exhausted and become one of the busiest Mexican fighters you will see in the movie that looks as though Sabu is showing respect. Tony Scott True ROMANCE (written by Quentin Tarantino)
