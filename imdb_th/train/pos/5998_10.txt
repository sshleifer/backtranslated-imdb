The treatment is an amazing movie ... It's suspicious and true! I was lucky enough to screen the movie 'The Cure', which is NYC's premiere and it disappointed me! I heard that I received the prize from that festival and deserved it. The first thing that I think is interesting is that the movie Eric Giovon works amazingly. The filming style of the love scene in this movie is amazing. Love scenes are necessary in this film and Jafri gets the point of passing, but also makes the tastes of Giovon and Jafri create a great creative team and they should work together in future projects. Judy Maier's description of the elite Great, but at the same time, it makes me feel that the main character feels I am a very difficult critic. But I must say that The Cure is one of my favorite movies .. just love it! If you haven't seen it yet, try it now!
