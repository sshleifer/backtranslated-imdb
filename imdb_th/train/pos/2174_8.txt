I think I really love this movie. "Prix de Beaute" was originally a silent movie. But later was dubbed in French in 1930, although more people dubbed her voice than others. The fact that her vocals were dubbed by the legendary Edith Piaf helped us unconscious With deception <br /> <br /> This is the story of Lulu and we saw her first time at a resort with a male boyfriend with her man, Andre. (Georges Chariot) and their fellow Antonin Lulu came into the frame as a pair of legs: we saw her in the car, turning into her swimsuit. Lulu was free from the expression of her body, and this was not good with the boring Andre. 'Miss Europe' position, we know that the happy ending will not sit at the end of Easy Street. <br /> <br /> The film seems to focus on men who like beautiful women. The beauty of the bath And the reaction of men who stared at them But at the center of it is the beautiful Louis Brooke. <br /> <br /> If you don't mind watching movies from the past, then consider watching this movie. Louise Brooks isn't the name of the favorite. Most average movies may be easily realized. But as soon as you see her, you will be fascinated and you will want to be more curious. Try to watch her in 'Pandora's Box' as well. Is it correct? Many scenes appear to be displayed at too fast speeds. This is probably the way they were shot. I don't know. But since it's the only way to watch this movie, it's worth it to swallow it in a bitter grain.
