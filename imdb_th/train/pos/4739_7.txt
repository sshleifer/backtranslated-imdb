Very good martial arts movies and Jet Li are the best because the teacher Bruce Lee. Li is great because it is a librarian / police who has a low key role which saves time and time again. He has a sensational status and appearance and believes as a kung fu king that you don't mess with. Francoise Yip is beautiful in the traditional sense of the unique race because of its rich heritage. Charming at the same time that I find that I have never forgotten the bad guys, sunglasses and long hair as well. But I can't find his name on credit. Can someone help me? Thank you! Enjoy the Hak hap or the Black Mask, regardless of any language. Great entertainment!
