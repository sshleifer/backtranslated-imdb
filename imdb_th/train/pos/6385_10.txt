This movie is great! It is a wonderful interpretation of ancient myths. Animation is rather strange But nothing new from Disney is better than expected. Of course, for Disney movies without singing, <br /> <br /> The animation behind the scenes is fantastic. It's a different level of work for Disney people. Some characters look like little boxes, but they are created for the beauty and greenery of the scenery. Most songs are useful. But it's suitable for movies This is not a movie that wants the character to collide with the song <br /> <br /> Perfect 10 of 10
