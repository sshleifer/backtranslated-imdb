"Cinderella" is a movie about a young girl whose mother has died and her father remarried. When her father died, Cinderella's stepmother was very meaningful to her and made her work around the house like cleaning after her two evil men. One day the king sent a message to every single woman to join the Royal Ball in honor of his son to find a wife. Of course Cinderella didn't go. But her mentor did Cinderella was very upset and thought that there was no way she could join the Royal Ball until her fairy appeared. So she uses magic and makes Cinderella a beautiful woman. But she had to return at midnight because that was when the magic changed While at the Royal Ball, Cinderella wasted time and time midnight, so she ran out of the palace and lost her shoes. Then the king ordered Duke to find the woman wearing the slippers. Duke searches every house But eventually found a woman who was Cinderella's. <br /> <br /> Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luske directed one of the best Disney movies in 1950. The magical fairy tale at the beginning of the movie Cinderella is a servant to her family and no one loves her. But with a little magic, her whole life changed around and eventually found love. <br /> <br /> What I like about "Cinderella" is the song when Cinderella's godmother. Appearing with her magic, she also sang Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo. When I was a kid, it was one of my favorite songs to sing around my house so I would never forget it. I still love when Cinderella and the prince sing this song, so this is love while they dance because they know that they are in love. Overall, this movie is my favorite movie when I was a small child because every girl wants to have a fairy tale life.
