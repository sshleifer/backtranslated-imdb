I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because it was truly sincere in acting. The writing was great. James Arness was a great actor and he performed here. Brian Keith is too old to be Davy Crockett and everyone can play Davy but Fess Parker. <br /> <br /> The actor Another great move in this move is Raul Julia, who delves into Santa Anna. Those who lead Mexico through the busy times <br /> <br /> While some people might think that this movie is slow But there was a battle as it turned out. Boredom followed by fear. <br /> The thing that impressed me the most about this movie is that it makes you think about the cause and the way. That some people are willing to die in what they believe today and age when no one stands for what I find it refreshing Think that there are times when people die for freedom, no matter how you feel about the politics of that era
