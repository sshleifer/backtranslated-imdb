Some actors wonder bars. (There is a musician at the end of the day) In Quentin Tarrinno's words are "the best rock movies ever created ... era" <br /> <br /> Think 8 Mile but without rapping. - Young musicians try to prove themselves to the local community while struggling to cope with broken houses and rival bands. Throwing real interest in sex and a truly wonderful performance. This is the true 8 miles. <br /> <br /> The prince gives a stable performance as well as Morris Day and Jerome Benton. Good script, good direction. Great and beautiful performances Don't forget the best rock / pop songs / sounds you've heard.
