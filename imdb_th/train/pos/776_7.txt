I think the concept of the plot is perfect for exploring the emotional experiences of the people involved for the first time, and secondly, while others write the implicit opinions of this relationship. (Incest and lesbian) in Romanian society. <br /> <br /> So ... start with the second view ... so short it can't be seen ... < br /> <br /> For the first time .. as I said it has more potential ... I think that such a relationship has more tension ... more tension ... and the tension that may arise Can't get through ... <br /> <br /> I think the soundtrack should be good. A few songs on the background and theme (which is good but not enough and not always in the right time) ... Yes ... I feel a lack. Better soundtrack .. <br /> <br /> Actors ... I think they are somewhere from 7 to 8/10 ... not charming enough at the crucial time .. <br /> <br /> including 7/10 .... mostly for the story
