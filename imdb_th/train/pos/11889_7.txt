Conversations that live well But it's boring. Basically, in an interview with the chief Isabelle Hopppert, writer / director, Pietet has autobiographical details. From the most sympathetic character, he didn't watch anything - and it seemed that he was a problematic person, while Huppert also said that Pialat often disappeared for many days during filming! <br /> <br /> The performance is excellent as well. Despite a relatively young age, Huppert and Gerard Depardieu (as the title character) are at the forefront of modern French stars, a status that has a different success. Both of them still hold to this day / > <br /> I have 3 Pialat's movies in my "VHS To Watch" division, even if it's in French without English subtitles; Due to this fact But still the truth of LOULOU's repression despite the inability to refuse art - I can't say that I'm rushing to check them now ...
