This movie is scary - in a way that 'is terrible, it's good.' <br /> <br /> The story has been revamped from many other movies that I didn't want to describe. It is a sword / magic image. There is a child hoping to realize his importance in this world. There are adventurers "nomadic" evil assistants / wizards, princesses, hairy animals .... br> <br /> The first time I watched this movie was a cruel winter. I don't know why I decided to watch it for another five minutes before changing the channel. But when I entered the Gulfax website, I decided to stay and watch until the end. <br /> <br /> Gulfax is a long-haired white creature similar to Chewbacca. But not nearly as useful or entertaining to watch He looks like someone is wearing a white fluffy rug tied together and forcing the actor to wear it. There are many scenes in which the actor seems to be unable to go inside or he almost falls. Although he is not in the movie much But some scenes are worth it! Watched as he tried to talk to Bo Svenson in comparison to Solo-Chewbacca At a higher level! <br /> <br /> I really bought this movie because that character and still exists! <br /> <br /> Gulfax may seem sh! t but he made this movie !!! The only reason I have never seen a sequel or searched out is because he doesn't exist! Perhaps there should be a final movie ending. The Gulf Max will come back to expect much!
