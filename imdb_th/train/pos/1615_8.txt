A wonderful romantic comedy about an Italian widow (Cher) who plans to marry a man she is familiar with (Danny Aiello) until she falls in love with an angry brother. The script has many clear lines, excellent performances, accents I used to say are perfect characters and movies are beautiful. New York never looks good on the screen. The main thing to see for Cher and Olympia Dukakis - both of them are excellent and deserve the Oscars they received. Beautiful and funny movies. Must see!
