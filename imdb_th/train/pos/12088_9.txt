Hardcastle and McCormick are great TV shows. <br /> <br /> Yes, it can be very predictable, like The Dukes of Hazzard, Hunter, The A-Team etc. etc. <br /> <br /> This is a list Good clean TV The relationship between Hardcastle and McCormick is quite fun. They often pick up jabs to put together many times, which adds humor to the program. It has been chased many times in almost every episode. But who doesn't like a good car chase Especially with Coyote! <br /> <br /> I hope that they will create a clean TV like this. Today I recommend this!
