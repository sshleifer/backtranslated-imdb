Don't care about this and have fun with Fred Astaire who made A Foggy Day and another dance with Joan Fontaine, who was unlucky. Here we see that Astaire does things that are "dancing" in a purer form than in his movie with Ginger Rogers and before he learns how to fully utilize the potential of the movie. Best of all: the fact that we saw Burns and Allen before the comedians, their husbands, wives, radio / television do the kind of dances they have to do in music and don't have the opportunity to do. (George used to be a tap dance instructor) Both of them and Fred's numbers are the focus of this film and should be worth the wait. The first trio is warming up for the "Chin up" carnival, where all three sing and dance through the player and other attractions seem to be happening. Fred Astaire's fans and Burns & Allen will find it. Worthwhile under the "plot" I've seen this 4 or 5 times and found that the fast forward button is useful.
