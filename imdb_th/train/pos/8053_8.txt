This movie is Sammo's great comedy. This is not a parody of the dragon. The main character (Sammo) is obsessed with Bruce Lee and imitate him freely for his size. A little story about his fighting methods makes the person he loves in trouble - then fight. Oh, the fight scene is fast and has a high impact. (White people playing boxers, it seems that he is hurt by Sammo's kick.) <br /> <br /> The most fun bit of this movie is not really intended. There are men looking for Jim Kelly (one of the three experts hired to lead Sammo), but he is Chinese in black with African wigs. Come, they don't have real black people in Hong Kong in 1978, right? I guess I've seen "Chinese people" fake white in hell in old American movies. <br /> <br /> This is one thing for Sammo or Bruce Lee fans.
