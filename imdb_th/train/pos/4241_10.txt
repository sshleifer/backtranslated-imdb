I love this movie !!! The character is the person you feel. The young man came back from serving still in love with the woman he had left behind. Tom Drake is always perfect as a romantic leader like Donna Reed is the love of his life. The image he gave her as if he had been starving for her eyes, including her hesitation and confusion. The strange characters left in the store were perfect when they tried to gather them together. However, the most impressive scene is the young couple at his grandfather's house. I laughed in some parts, crying in part and enjoying watching this movie thoroughly. In fact, I watch again about 5 times. Of course I have to watch all romantics.
