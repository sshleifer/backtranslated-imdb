Man's Castle is a great example of a pre-movie movie. It involves real events with a fun and incomplete character. Spencer Tracy plays Bill, an independent spirit without a dime in his pocket. He made a living, worked oddly, and traveled to a new city when he was bored with the environment. One night he met Trina, the standard beauty that was cold and alone. She refused to turn to prostitution so she didn't eat for several days. But both were well together and built relationships His free spirit tempted him from her, so life became a stone. But there was a real spark between the two, even though they were in the river hut Of the silver screen His characters are amazing and relevant. We can see his thoughts on his face, making him easy to identify, even though we believe that he behaved badly. Excellent kids in pre-movie movies Her character is very cute. But still far from perfect, making her a favorite
