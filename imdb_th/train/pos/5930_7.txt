The maternal and maternal son (Alice Krige and Brian Krause) suck the lives of the virgins and their newest target, beautiful but lonely. Never been a great fan like King, Koontz or Barker, but B-movie written by Mr Dung. Really not as close as it should be. Yes, sometimes it's evil. But there are some impressive things: good old tombs, eerie soundtrack and candlelight - Gothic houses, glass scenes showing evil villains' shapes, of course. This movie is contaminated by potty dialogue. Mr Dung's and his passion for toilet flushing to avenge the obese people and lead to a subdivision of a rape teacher that is pointless. But with roses in the manure
