One of the best musicals that has ever been here is an example of how producers and directors are not afraid to choose actors for their abilities instead of what people expect. The light and the scene are unique, making it a very interesting effect. (This has a special name that I can't think of). This dialog also has a unique feature that doesn't use abbreviations. This film has a good and interesting playing rhythm from beginning to end. True happiness is music. The array of the number one song from the beginning to the end, which is completely rendered and prepared. This song is very original and memorable, and I think it is superior to many musicals from the thirties until the sixties. Of course, it has original music and more beautiful music than most musicals that may have only two or three songs. Not bad for directors who do not have experience in this type of film. Another quality is that it's fresh every time you see it.
