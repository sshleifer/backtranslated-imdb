Red Rock West (1993) <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage has been involved in serious crimes without having to know before, and Dominos leads to an increase in danger, adventure and adventure in the wild. With chaos, Red Rock West is often brutal and sometimes hilarious, and Cage pulls out the ingredients with his bitter wit and is easily beware. <br /> <br /> Is the plot above? Yes. Dennis Hopper is a frenzied killer. Almost like it or not? Yes. Can Cage have a chance? Well, you have to watch and see. It never gave up and it surprised me the first time I saw it. In the second visit yesterday, I was surprised how good it was, how well it was created, and it was creepy and funny at the same time. <br /> <br /> Director Ron Dahl (Assistant writer also) is more known for his television work, but with the Rounders and the film, he shows a sharp hand with exciting plans. It has been helped by humor by means and cartoons. Lazy bar, wonder police And don't miss the pendant inspired by Dwight Yoakam as a truck driver
