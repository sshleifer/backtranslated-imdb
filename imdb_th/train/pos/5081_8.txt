This film is excellent and even ends with less faith. But still worth watching The film begins when Claudette Colbert is about to marry Robert Ryan. When the minister asks if anyone has objected or not, a man jumps up and declares that Colbert cannot marry because she is married !! Colbert insists that this is not true. But when they investigate, they find that the justice of peace and many others remember her marriage and still have a marriage license signed! Slowly, it became clear that Claudette's mind slipped and the people around her were seriously skeptical of her consciousness. Then, when the first husband was killed, all the evidence and suspicions fell upon Colbert. <br /> <br /> The film is a mysterious movie that is thrilling, suspenseful because what I have described is only half The first of the movies. The following are intelligent and fascinating things. Unfortunately, the conclusion, though, is worse because of the driving force behind all of this. "Right out of the left field" - and being dazed because it's unexpected and impossible to guess as Information provided to viewers However, despite this, this movie is very good. I can still apologize for the limp ending. In particular, Robert Ryan works very well as a fiancee "knuckles", although apart from him, other performances are also great.
