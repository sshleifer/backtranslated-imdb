I don't know why people want deep meaning in the movie or think it's worthless. <br /> <br /> What about entertainment? Something that Morgan Freeman was excellent. He was given a chance to show off a little. Paz Vega, his star, received a career promotion and Brad Silberling won the title to attract people to watch his movies. <br /> <br /> I think It's a good movie Some humor is pathetic, some bitter. But nothing superior I was especially kicked by Jim Parsons as a receptionist at the construction company when he looked at Freeman, who was cute and said "You made me want to be a woman." He was just hilarious. The fight scene between Ms. Vega, her husband-wife and his girlfriend is also excellent. <br /> <br /> In short, a charming, charming movie that will make you smile. You can do much more than that.
