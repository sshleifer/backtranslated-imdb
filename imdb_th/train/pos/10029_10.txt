Why do people talk about it? It's not a bad thing, like The Godfather. Titanic is the greatest movie of the 21st century, with great performances, musical effects and everything. This movie was left by everyone because one day, some people said that they didn't like it anymore, so most of the world decided to agree. There is nothing wrong with this movie. All I can say is that this film is not only But it is the movie that won the most Oscars of all time. The most money that has ever been made and sad is one of the lowest-value movies I've ever seen. In addition, it is the best movie of all time. The only film that is close to being like Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings trilogy or whatever, by expert Hitchcock or Spielberg or Tim Burton. All of these are good movies and directors. But no one can compare with James Cameron's Masterpiece TITANIC
