I saw a perfect son about three times. I didn't see that this movie was a gay movie. I wasn't gay. But I don't see it as a gay movie It's a movie with a gay character. I can't see why every movie that has a gay character should be strictly gay. I found that this film is sympathetic to the study of death, death of people who are your relatives. I think Theo quickly changed his life after physiotherapy because he wanted to look at his brother who was dying in front of him, giving him an assessment of his life again. I found the conversation at the scene when Theo told Ryan that he would be a father to move. Ryan said he didn't want to know about things he had never seen or shared with anyone It's scary and sad, right? I recommend movies
