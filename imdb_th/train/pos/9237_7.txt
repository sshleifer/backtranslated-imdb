This movie is quite good. Half a year ago I bought a DVD. But first, I think it's the original movie. I've seen the series and it's a good movie. But here they put "The Living Legend, Episode 1 and 2" and "Fire in space" together, just as they did with the first movie. But with other episodes, but still a good movie Only the ending is strange. (You don't see what happens to Pegasus) but I still think it's quite good. Actors and special effects are good. If you haven't seen it, try it. Starring: Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, Lorne Greene, Herb Jefferson Jr., Tony Swartz, Terry Carter, Lloyd Bridges, Jack Stauffer
