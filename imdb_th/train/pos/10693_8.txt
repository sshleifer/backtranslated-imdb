This is a great little movie, unique and creative, with great stories and great performances! All the characters are great and the stories that are strange, fascinating, and interesting, plus Nicole Kidman are amazing in this story! It's very difficult to explain this movie because it's a very strange story. It's a funny / romantic one minute. Then it becomes a thriller. Next, however, it's still all the same fun. Plus Nicole's Russian accent Very reliable Chaplin and Kidman have very good chemical qualities and I like Vincent Castle's performance! Plus a plot of twists that really surprised me! The ending is very cute and it can't be predicted at all! You will feel sorry for Chaplin and how he was deceived and I think every character is really cute, including a good ending, especially this is Nicole's movie. But she held it with an incredibly sexy performance! This is a great little movie, unique and creative, with great planners and great performances! I recommend this movie! That direction is great! Jez Butterworth did a very good job here with an excellent camera, a strong angle and made this film a fast step! The performance was great! Nicole Kidman has amazing beauty! And as amazing as ever, she's incredibly sexy, cute, has one of the best accents, adds many appearances, has good chemistry with Ben Chaplin and has a very mysterious character! She is amazing (Kidman's Law !!!!) Ben Chaplin is excellent. Here he is very fond of, with cool characters, good chemistry with Kidman. The only thing I don't like is He brought out anger in Kidman, even if what she had done wrong and I like that he finally avenged! Vincent Cassel is great as the main villain. Yes, he is OTT, but he is very violent and creepy. Sometimes this role is suitable for him. Mathieu Kassovitz agreed here but nothing to do much. The remaining actors are ok. Overall I highly recommend this place! *** 1/2 of 5
