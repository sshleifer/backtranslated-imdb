I enjoy this movie It's funny, cute, stupid and fun. There are some actors and critics smashed for reasons that I don't really understand. It's not "The Grapes of Wrath" or "Casablanca" or even "Moonstruck" but it's a fun movie. <br /> <br /> Julia is a wonderful person who plays in spirit. This is a stupid thing that must be sure, but this is not a high drama. I accidentally watched the movie review, probably the only good thing I received, then ran into it one night when looking for a movie. I never heard that it should stink until I see it and I'm glad to see it. Finally bought a VHS tape on the bargain stack and I watched it a couple of times a year.
