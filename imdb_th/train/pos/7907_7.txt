I can not agree with the score given to this movie less and I believe this is an example of the fact that most of the viewers are really short-lived around the world ... You forgot that the movie was an art type One before some entrepreneurs try to create entertainment only? This movie is not entertainment, at least it is not easy for the entertainment you get from movies like Titanic or Gladiator. It has a different style. It's shocking ... That's why you mostly hate it: because It doesn't try to make you satisfied. It's just a strange story that I accept, but in the end, it's just a strange story. It's not a big story or even a great movie. But I believe it's worth 7 stars for the courage of both the author and the director. From copying and creating a larger studio This movie is for me, a European-style film produced in the United States and everyone involved in making this movie deserves respect. Whether it is courage or humor that is unique
