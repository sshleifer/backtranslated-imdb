Some posters seem to be offensive because this is not Mark Twain or Rodgers and Hart, but obviously it's not the same. You will be watching for a long time to find Rodgers fans and Hart that is even bigger than me, but Burke and Van Heusen did not chop the liver for sure, unless they knew the Der Bingle inside and fine tune the song - but beautiful , Moonlight becomes you, it is you always, day after day, etc. - to match his personal style and here they come with good things - and unfairly abandoned - ballads, once upon a time And The visit, including philosophy. You stud your feet on the moon and do nothing. The subtle plot was not seriously intended - why the other person finally made Merlin, if not all, in other versions. He was a friend / advisor to Arthur - so if you start to wonder why Sir Lancelot was sold To the historians as the best of change, courage and objectivity in the school of bully, you will not have fun from things. The movie is fun In balance, it does what it should do for entertainment. Good luck.
