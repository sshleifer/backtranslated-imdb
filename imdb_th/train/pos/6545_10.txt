I really enjoyed this movie. Most reviews are not good. But most critics think the movie should be a drama, a concept This movie has a little drama. But the rest is clean and fun. Forget about the beautiful woman Julia Roberts. Emma Roberts is a beautiful and more beautiful girl than you. Emma had a lot of fun watching the role of Nancy Drew. It was good to see a new face. I believe you will go a long way. <br /> <br /> Nancy Drew may not be dependent on the book. But the story is still good There is also a good mix of actors, other characters and supporting actors such as Pat Carroll, Barry Bostwick, Rachel Leigh Cook and Chris Kattan - not credited. I was surprised that Disney didn't release this movie. Some people may not like this movie because there is no gender, violence and curse. This is a good family movie that is rare at this time. So take your family to watch this movie and judge for yourself how good it is. I can't wait for the sequel.
