This film is Damian SzifrÃ³n's second film, after studying the great characters in "El Fondo del Mar" with "Tiempo De Valientes". Between them I saw Szifron's talent to present all the characters in a light way. But enough to make us emotionally shared with them He has great control over them, so he restores the good direction in the great movies and scripts, combining characters, laughing and crying with true feelings and inviting audiences to join them in their emotions and evolution. On the screen> <br /> Spanish-English landscape of Buenos Aires at night replaces the Hollywood scene and places of interest as well as other places. On this film, we have the courage to compete with the machinery of Hollywood <br /> <br >> But I want you to see the film's main character, because I've never dealt with such lovely people. It seems that the script is suitable for the actors and vice versa. I believe by making movies like this, Argentina depends on the competition.
