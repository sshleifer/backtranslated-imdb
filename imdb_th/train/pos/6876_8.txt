"The Groove Tube" started on video in the first episode "Video Theater" here in Boston. In one room, there is a TV screen on the high side with seats in the old cinema in a small group facing the screen. There are old refrigerators with Pepsi and Yorkshire Peppermint baskets. In the second room that is smaller, there is no seat, there is a large pillow that is the 'smoking room'. That is the higher people in it. That action was added to the hilarity of the video. <br /> <br /> I am a 'watcher'. The scene I like the most and remember to this day is: Koko The Clown, The Kramp Family Kitchen (Kramp Easy -Lube Shortening), Safety Sam / VD PSA, Chevy Chase hitchhiker w / nude running through the forest, ballet finger on In the end, what was revealed to be a naked woman's body The last item is incredibly late, reminiscent of Ernie Kovacs. Now I lost a lot of readers under the age of 48 ("Who is Ernie Coffs") but trust me? It's a joke. <br /> <br /> One reason I am a 'watcher. Frequently 'is that I and my friends will bring another virgins "Groove Tube". Come see. We will sit and watch the tricky faces of "Virgins" at PSA "Safety Sam" will play when the camera gradually zooms in "Sam". We will wait for "OH!" Of 'pure' face recognition. Each time is more hilarious than the last time. Will take a friend to see the show repeated what we have done To receive this joke, you have to watch the video. <br /> <br /> Yes, some things are old. But mostly plays drama, movies, television and now is a video Just watching a video that happened in 1980. <br /> <br /> I've seen "The Groove Tube" in the cinema as a movie, which is a small transfer from the original video. It was cut and lacked the original high-end scene. <br /> <br /> The first "Saturday Night Live" performance with Chevy Chase immediately said that "That is the guy from" The Groove Tube "" So it is the ancestor of Chevy. <br /> <br /> I can't look short without hearing the voice. "Wearing your hands with Kramp Easy-lubricating oil wrinkled ..." and thinking about the formula "Kramp Holiday Loaf" makes me laugh always in the bake shop. Need a storage box in the grocery store. <br /> <br /> Early era 70 is a terrifying moment. "The Groove Tube" is fresh and gets 'humor'. It offers 'hip generation', humor that is not in other forms / media. MJH
