Simple movies at first, simple movies at the end. It has endless boredom and feigned. But most TV movies have any methods. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve works as well as a former prisoner. The marriage between her and the woman he worked for me felt a bit weird, but I believed in the time that I could believe it. <br /> <br /> Now I see the 'tv' version that has been received. Editing, even movies that were created and played in 'tv', I found it strange too, but I felt that if I saw all the parts, I would give a similar score. <br /> <br /> JT Walsh works well, not Baht at his best, but still .... /> <br /> 7/10, good job <br.
