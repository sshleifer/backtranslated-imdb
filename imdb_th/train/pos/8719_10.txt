I was amazed at the improvements in the animated film. If you sit close to the screen, you will see details in the grass structure and surface. The details, colors and shading are less important than Toy Story. I will never know how. I hope PIXAR will make a documentary about how to produce a movie so I can know how the film was successful From this movie, I think the future animation movies will be judged on the basis of this film.
