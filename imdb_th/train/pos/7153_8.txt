My wife is a teacher and she is very familiar with this story and read it in many layers of her, but has never listened to everything that is interesting to me and I bought a DVD to find that this is a movie that should not be an alley I <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie has a lot. Set up and I find myself thinking that I'm right. It started a little slower and I had to admit that I was a little bored - but curious enough to be with it. I'm glad I did because it ended up being a very satisfying and rewarding movie. Of course, I will watch this story again. <br /> <br /> The casting is very good. Since I haven't read the book, I can't guarantee it. But I must say that Jon Voight is truly happy. You like the characters you should hate, hate the characters you should hate and laugh at the characters that should be funny. <br /> <br /> I can see that some people may not like this movie. Sometimes It's boring, especially at the beginning. All the events can divert attention. (Although they are essential to the story) When the story begins to come together at the end, I think you will be rewarded with a hoe for your patience. When everyone spoke and finished, I thought this was a very good movie - 8/10 <br /> <br />
