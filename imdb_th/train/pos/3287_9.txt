My friends and I chose "Paperhouse" from the Random Movie Division to visit our weekly horror place - we have never heard of this before. And the movie didn't disappoint, even though I still didn't call it a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Anna Madden, age 11, draws a house and visits her dream. She definitely slept when she saw the house, but actually in the sense that it was almost like a completely separate reality. Which, in the view of the later events, does not seem to be a far-fetched way However, she found that she could add to the house, the content and the environment by adding just the picture. <br /> <br /> While this incident, Anna became increasingly ill and beyond that he became obsessed. With her house and drawings Moreover, she and her mother dealt with her missing father as well. He had a job that had to take him out for a long time. But there are people who get the impression that there are more stories. <br /> <br /> Ok, so the drawing is good enough - but actually there is something really. Is dangerous about it For example, Dream World is surprisingly surreal - the house is just a gray block in the middle of an abandoned field. People who do this movie do very well to make us feel uneasy with this alternative world / continuous dream ... <br /> <br /> One thing Anna adds to the house is Mark boy. Who seems Is the patient that her doctor talks about (I won't give up, you know he is like the same child). In fact, Mark can't walk because of illness. In the world of Anna's drawing, he can't walk because she doesn't attract his legs. She blames herself for his real-life illness and tries to fix the situation ... but everything starts to be really strange. She also brings her missing father into the painting with a terrible result. A bit scary with my father. <br /> <br /> I don't want anything, so I will stop there ... There seems to be a lot of things going on in this movie. I'm sure you will have children. Analyze this thing with your friends. After you look - is it as simple as it seems or is there a real layer of meaning? I don't know what it is. It is quite interesting. There is "Nightmare On Elm Street" of good quality about this one point. Truth and dreams intersect. I love things like that. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that it feels like it has ended many times but not. I am satisfied with the end there is. (Some of your delicate types may want Kleenex useful!) Although it has a variety of conclusions However, it didn't feel like being pulled out when it ended. But while you are watching and it gradually fades away, it is a little nerve. <br /> <br /> Still "Paperhouse" good movie. Very well done and acting - especially Charlotte Burke, while Anna - is the top notch. Burke, who had never appeared before or appeared in movies, was a real gem. I don't know why she has never done anything else. In any way, she is reliable and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> "Paperhouse" is not a horror suspense / other type of movie that has a clear horror period - but you can still watch with your family and Don't worry that your brother or grandmother will receive positive results from blood splashing. <br /> <br /> Give your chance, you won't regret! And maybe you should read the book ...
