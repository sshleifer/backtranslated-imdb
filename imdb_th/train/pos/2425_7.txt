I caught this movie in IFC and I enjoyed it even though I felt that the editing work was quite rough. But may be contemplated I have a little time to find out what happened at first because they seem to be presenting the plot of a nonlinear linear model of Pulp Fiction. It seems to be a little forced. I certainly think that this movie is worth watching. But I think it should be a little cleaner. Some scenes do not seem reasonable. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see the lowest score here. It's not outstanding But there was no serious problem. I gave 7/10. This film shows at least that Laurence Fishburne can perform when he wants. They have to tell him not to watch the Matrix movie.
