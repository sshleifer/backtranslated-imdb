Norman, that is you or not (this is all three hands, so bring it with a grain of salt). Adapt to a African American family from a Jewish person when it makes the transition from the stage and on the screen. It is also one of the movies that were filmed in video format, so the print from the theater was not that great. Even though the performances by Redd Foxx and others are quite good, <br /> <br /> All I want to tell you is that this movie is a moment: It reflects the attitude in the middle to the beginning. 70 about discovering that you have a gay son or daughter in your family For just one reason, it is quite interesting. If it is not a "Hollywood", a little skeptical, I check the lines about curtains, etc., which are not too deep. <br /> <br /> But ... the movie This shines in some areas. There is a scene on one side when Redd Fox tries to find his wife who fled with his brother (!) To Ensenada in the Pinto soup. The cross-border telephone conversation is really memorable. <br /> <br /> But ... The best scene in the movie is when Wayland Flowers and Madame do the gay routine that he had done in gay bars and nightclubs. For my best knowledge, this is the only time that is normally filmed. And it is a slightly cleaner and shorter version Even so, it is an ancient Madam and should not be missed. People still steal stripes from Wayland. This man is truly gifted. Have fun watching movies!
