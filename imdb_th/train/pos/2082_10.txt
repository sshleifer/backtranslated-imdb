I read the beautiful novel of Pearl S Buck for the first time in my nine-level history class, and I enjoyed it every exciting role. It's almost inevitable that Hollywood will receive it and considering that it was created in 1937. Great results. <br /> <br /> Things to be accepted: In 1937 there was no question of Asian casting Actor in an important Hollywood movie In this way, making the final product more interesting if they can use the actors that are more realistic. <br /> <br /> With the obstacles that must be overcome, producer Irving Thalberg and director Sidney Franklin (in the group) Others) Take the problem to choose the best actor and star. Paul Muni plays Wang Lung. Muni was at the peak of his power as an actor during this time and almost played whatever he intended. When you go through makeup (It's good But there is no one really wrong for the Chinese people.) His performance is most suitable for his work. <br /> <br /> Then there was Luise Rainer, the Oscar award last year for Her performance in THE GREAT ZIEGFELD, the actress of the Vienna actress, is growing and she plays the role of Plum from Olan even though she lacks experience in Hollywood. Her performance received an Academy Award for the second time for the first time in history. <br /> <br /> Many criticisms have been performed in Rainer and Orion's performances. Scarborough won here She was called a wood and a note. There is a small truth in that, however, that being said, all you have to do is go back to the book. For Rainer, although not Chinese, is played as Olan But Buck wrote her In fact, it's a great show and one of the best transfers from the book to the screen I've seen. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the actors is MGM. Name the actor and actor, the biggest character in Hollywood at that time, and the great budget that will pay for the best and eventually they get the best. <br /> <br /> This film makes it Oh, some of the novel's richness comes from the yard to the flesh, and he married a concubine, which was devastating for his wife. But her feelings as being the only woman not about him In this film, Huang Lung, a penitent, came back to find his wife when she died. Both pearls that he had had from years ago realized that it was too late for her to be true love. <br /> <br /> Repeatedly, yes, but that's Hollywood. Considering the obstacles that they struggle with this movie, they may open the screams of laughs. But despite the obvious differences of the true Asian people in the show But this movie was surprisingly well done at the age of seventy-three years In fact, the most amazing thing about this movie is how good it is when it may be disastrous.
