In my opinion, this film is despite the shortcomings. (Which I kept * a few *) the most masterpiece and great and glorious art piece <br /> <br /> The thing that Mr. Bakshi did here is to create the most beautiful movie and show the talent and His versatility as an animated film director He does not receive credit for 1/100 of the credit he deserves for recording the art of movement for an adult audience. If not for Bakshi, I do not believe animation will survive the Disney attack. Moreover, the Lord of the Rings not only But he created only beautiful animated movies But he created a whole new art form - unfortunately he never built it from the ground. <br /> <br /> Most people will complain about using rotoscoping in this movie. (The use of live action images that are used as background images and are often animated using techniques from what appears to be a small amount of staining for full-blown movements) but I feel that those who complain About it, it can not accept non-standard art forms. No, this is not Disney animation. No, it's not a live performance. No, it's not "cheating" - it's a form of art that is fascinating and amazing. Something fresh and new that feels like home completely in such a wonderful story. "The Lord of the Rings" The use of this technique as a pioneer of Bakshi makes the subtleties of Middle Earth alive as a dark and mysterious way, especially the darkness of Tolkien's life, especially that Nazgul. Received recognition in the way that traditional movements <br /> <br /> Peter S. Beagle's screenplay (According to very little I understand in the first draft by Chris Conlingling) is the adaptation of Tolkien's work It is possible that he will use the dialogue directly from the novel and feel at home in the world that Bakshi created. There are many cuts that are made to fit the first book and 3/4 into the movie for 2 hours and 15 minutes only. Minor changes in the story There are some holes that can be augmented: the reforging of Narsil, the gift of Galadriel, Huorns in the Battle of Hornburg, but again with the time constraints he has. In history) these things can be understood for sure (Although it makes anyone wonder if they can explain in the sequel) <br /> <br /> There are also scores. (One of my favorites) by Leonard Rosenman (who also scored for Barry Lyndon and Star Trek IV (the score from his LotR work clearly). It's lively and brave and brave to speak perfectly It stands on its own as the band's victory. But when combined with the image of the movie, it will enter a new world of perfect perfection. Far from the general fare in many closed Hollywood lands. <br /> <br /> A great voice actor. Especially the note is John Hertz as Aragon, who absorbs the essence of Strider. <br /> <br /> The character's design is amazingly exotic. But remember that it is the duty of the director of adaptation to show you what he / she envisioned is not something you might imagine and Aragon is therefore aware of the distinctive feelings of Native Americans and Bo. Romir This may not be what you think. But I can admire Mr. Bucy, who shows us what he "sees". It may also be noted that he spends time with Priscilla Tolkien for a long time developing a character set for movies. <br /> <br /> One word far away - the order of Flight to Ford, in my opinion is Of the most beautiful sequences that had been captured in celluloid Bakshi was not afraid to slow down for a moment and his expertise showed clearly from the incredible tension that can be created. Bakshi's artistic talents and Tolkien's incredible work in this sequence to the unrivaled glorious peak. <br /> <br /> The latest DVD release (2001) by Warner Brothers. Very absent While we can thank eternal that this film is finally available in widescreen format But the package is very special It was great to have the director's opinion able to see a special 20-minute picture that was removed for theatrical performance. Another delightful thing is to have a live-action scene which later moves. The presentation of the DVD release is the most horrific voice-overs at the end of this movie, which is a simple dub from the final frame of the movie. This model has been plastered and rendered poorly during the highest score of music. <br /> <br /> Of course, the greatest tragedy of all is the sequel that has never been created. We will not be able to see the meaning of Gondor's Bakshi, Shelob, Faramir, Cracks of Doom, Eowyn's battle with the Witch King or Gandalf's encounter with him. We will not be honored by the image of Denethor or Palatir or the path of Bakshi's death is a shame that exceeds all the embarrassment that we have to accept at the end of Peter Jackson's sparkling and glittering Hollywood version of the action movie of the event. Come in all Tolkien's masterpieces. <br /> <br /> David
