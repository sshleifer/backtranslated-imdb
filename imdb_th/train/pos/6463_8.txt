This is one of the movies that you miss when you wake up the next morning. It will give you a warm, warm, frothy feeling and make you smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Of course, we get the character and the story in general.>> <br /> Come from Sweden and Having lived in the United States for a while, it's a joke for us. "The dead husband is about to kill him", "She (Gabriella) is dying and then has a bigger end of life." We know how these things work. Everything comes together at the end and it is Making the characters quite simple, they look so good that you don't think so twice. There is nothing left for your imagination. The closest may be Siv. She makes you ask yourself if she really loves Daniel. But that's about it. <br /> <br /> But this movie is beautiful. And the cute character Michael Nyqvist is truly genius with his unique look and Frida Hallberg is charming and easily accessible. May look good. <br /> <br /> But most of this movie makes you feel and that is the most important thing. You cry, you laugh, you hate and you specify I don't know about you But that doesn't happen often
