And this is someone me and not just me as I see at IMDb or when leaving the cinema Why do people like it? Obviously: Everyone knows zombies right now. (At least, horror fans with hearts and others through the invention of "Dawn of the Dead" or Resident Evil movies, for example) <br /> <br /> Everything about zombies ... that is until this movie entered. Come And you will see zombies in a new perspective (perhaps). This is not a horror movie, even though there are violent scenes. But it's a joke Precise words And it's never exhausted! That is why I give a very high rating. Incredible use of wisdom. The performance is excellent and the script has no errors (clear) ... Opposite: It's a gem and if you care a little zombies, you should see it! And even if you don't like it, see! Because it's a great movie (funny)!
