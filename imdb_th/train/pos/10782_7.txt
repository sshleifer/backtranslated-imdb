Michael Stearns plays a person who is frustrated and has an interesting attitude about sex. He had no problem dancer naked. But when a woman starts having sex with a man, that is when he loses it He believed that when a woman actually had sex when they lost their "naive" and / or "beauty" feelings, then he walked through the Hollywood Hills that followed the faraway lover. Dead people with high-powered rifles that have scope. <br /> <br /> The main reason that seems to be the subject of this film is to indulge in sex. The activity is repeated and the "story" comes out as an idea later. This is what makes the opposite sex man happy. Many people are very pleased because we are treated to a lengthy naked scene. (Women here have very good San clothing) and sex for use as a main drug. Of course, seeing a fair deal through the boundaries of the terrifying factor and demonstrating the compulsion to peek (For one thing, Mike stared at his lover through the boundary for a moment before pulling the trigger.) In the end, it was repeated with a lot of intrusions. Will be a terrible waste, enjoy this one or another It includes a lesbian appointment that causes Mike to interrupt and make him unsure of how to respond. It spread out at a very slow speed. But will be tangled together It is a bizarre and distorted rarity. If there is nothing that will cause some viewers to stare at the screen, of course. <br /> <br /> 7/10
