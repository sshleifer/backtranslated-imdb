I love this movie It's a clear motivational movie. It fills you with pride. This film is worth the rental or purchase value. It should be in every home. The best movie I've seen for a long time It will make you mad because everyone has a meaning for Carl Brashear. It's a story of romance, drama, action and many funny jokes that will keep you on track. I use them all the time. They help me work that I want to do. It shows that everyone can achieve their dreams. All they have to do is work successfully. It's a long film. But every time I watch it, I never notice that it will be as long as it is. I'm obsessed with it. It will go fast. I love this movie. I watch it every time I can.
