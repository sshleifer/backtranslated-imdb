Bonanza continues to keep an eye on running again. <br /> <br /> This series records the adventures of the Cartwright family who lived on a farm near Virginia City, Nevada, in the Civil War era.

Little Joe, the youngest, is a big, charming, handsome man who is opposite to a woman. These three brothers enjoy a variety of love. But their love is often killed at the end or the marriage is impossible, for whatever reason. <br /> <br /> Actors are the protagonists of their roles.
