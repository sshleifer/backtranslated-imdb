I just watched me. Q. Again, tonight and forget how much I love this movie. It is a wonderful entertainment and makes you feel that everything is right with the world. I love the allusion to Mozart throughout the debut with "Einstein" playing "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" on his violin hum Eine Kleine Nachtmusik humming the IQ during the IQ test of Ed Walter. For I love women who demonstrate cleverness and support a career, especially during the 1950s, when the film was set up (I was a teacher but at home to raise children, so please don't think I am an active female priest.) It's great that a man who "Just a Monkey Grail" finally saw that it was the same as Important and worthwhile as Katherine's fiance, clinical behavior researcher Message to me is that we are not what we do. But what we are determined by a lot - no label, there are many little gags and one liners that are almost nonsense if you don't watch and listen carefully. <br /> <br /> I have caught some Things in movies that are not specified in the fool's face In the scene where Ed Walters will speak at the meeting, there are 3 musical instruments (protractor, ruler, etc.) hanging on the right side from the chalk shelf. In the next camera shooting, there are only 2 credits in our video. It shows Tony Shaloub's character as Bob Watters, not Bob Rosetti. While he introduced himself in the movie and is here in Imdb <br /> < br /> I would like to recommend this movie. It may be part of the fluff in some estimation. But with more content than many that give credit Not only that, what the great actors gathered here, watched and enjoyed!
