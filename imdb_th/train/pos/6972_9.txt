When Caprica (S01E01) performed well as a pilot, now is the same content as the DVD pilot release. When it was mentioned, episode 01 gave an important background to the popular "Battlestar Galactica" series. (Both the original and the remake of 2007) It applies to most 2007 series, as well as the popular sci-fi plans. At the end of this series will explore the life or the "virtual" environment. Received many backgrounds in the Adama family, including relations with the creator (Battlestar Galactica series) that have yet to be revealed Most of the early episodes revolved around the popular topic of "virtual" life and (as expected) the early life of the colony and the birth of Zylon. <br /> <br /> All I like now Although it is not a new material for myself or anyone who has seen the pilot launch of Caprica. In the case of a large number of pilots, Episode 01 allows us to stop the cliffs for the audience to follow (sci-fi community). 8 stars
