I just bought a very low-cost Dreamcast and went out to town to find games to use them. I bought Soul Calibur (Classic). Then I stepped across the Resident Evil Code Veronica domain. I have Resident Evil. 1 & 2 and have played Res Evil 3 many times, and I am impressed with them all, especially the number 1 that has to go down in history, is classic. <br /> <br /> But none of them, 3 of them came. Close to Brilliant G's broadcast efforts ory Gameplay If buying a Dreamcast for this game is worth every moment and effort, ive never been fascinated by computer games that make me obsessed. <br /> <br /> The story continues. Continued from the second story, which Claire Redfield searched for her brother (Chris - from the first story), presumably lost under the conspiracy of a terrifying umbrella company. Little is known about this company except the fact that you, even if you destroy them 3 times in the previous story, <br /> <br /> So help Claire with the best assistant of Steve. Unlock the truth of reality The location of your brother The 2nd disc helps you control the frenzy: if you manage to go far without having to run out of room in fear, <br /> <br /> The controls are very smooth and the movements of the characters are realistic. When The characters notice the danger. He / she faces the direction that comes from PURE GENIUS !! <br /> <br /> Overall, I gave this game 10/10 because it's just a game of the year, a game of the decade and a game. The best in the world !! Please buy this game as soon as possible.
