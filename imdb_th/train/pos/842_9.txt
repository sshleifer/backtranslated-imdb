Matador is a world that is full of wit, humor and paranoia that surpasses ordinary people due to the two interesting and serious performances from Pierce Brosnan, who has never been better. Play as a gay neighbor of Jack Nicholson in as good as it gets. A great advantage is writing as well. Smarter, nasty conversations, and sometimes accompanied by Brosnan's gusto and friendship. The slow creation between these two different people creates complete confidence along the way. The story changes unexpectedly and makes the audience guess what goes next. <br /> <br /> Beautiful art from directors such as music, intelligent editing and unorthodox filming. Good tone for this movie and for a long time you don't know how to film. But that was thanks to a very well written script that made the audience (I'm anyway) on the edge of his seat
