I remember seeing this when I was a child in the UK who was fascinated by Laurence Olivier's stories and lectures. We will talk about other things at the school the next day. I imagine that the ratings for the first performance are very big. This is just the best comprehensive documentary series, even if they have to cut this into a bone that they can capture a lot. The interesting thing is that the struggle of the United Kingdom and North Africa is very important. But Americans are still not widely known The series captures the rivalry between Mountbatten and the American generals. The suffering of German soldiers on the Eastern Front, Japanese prisoners of war cruelty by American soldiers The image of the Holocaust made me a non-Jew of Europe, feeling forever guilty about treating Jews. I don't know why this is not the number one ranking in IMDb. Maybe they are showing prejudice to the spoiler documentary - we win.
