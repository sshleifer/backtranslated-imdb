My favorite horror movie This is the masterpiece of Carpenter. <br /> <br /> Halloween night of 1963. Michael Meyers, the little murderer of his sister. Halloween, 1978. Michael escaped from Smith Grove Hospital. Halloween night. Michael returned home to kill again. <br /> <br /> The story is completely simple. Michael walked and killed the nanny No bells or whistles It is the terrifying atmosphere of the Carpenter that creates tension. As well as great horror movies delivered in advance by phone But it seems that they happen randomly. Never let the audience have a chance to guess the movie. <br /> <br /> The dark light shoots and (most importantly) the eerie music creates an awkward scene And the most uncomfortable that I have never seen in a movie Have a body number But compared to slashers slaughtered after this, it is relatively small. And most murders are almost bloodless Fear is not in death. But I don't know. <br /> <br /> The performance is very good. PJ Soles presents a limited sense of humor (and one of the best deaths). Then there was Jamie Leigh-Curtis (at that time). Her performance at first seemed shy and unsure. But you know quickly that it is suitable for the character that she is shy and not confident and is not ready for what she has to face. And of course there are actors like Donald Pleasence, who is designated by Dr. Sam Loomis (Maybe a little uncertain) Relax in peace. Mr. Pleasence <br /> <br /> If the movie has a dangerous flaw Since the release of this movie many years ago, almost countless clones, copies, imitations and imitations, and stolen (often bad), the best movie bit until almost everything about it became Is familiar Combined with changes in the expectations and appetite of the audience, this movie has discovered the power of diluted raw movies. In order to truly appreciate it in this era, it must be seen as it used to be a unique thing. <br /> <br /> No less than this, I have no reservations and recommend this movie to everyone. Looking for good things Scary time Maximum confidence <br /> <br /> 10/10
