This anime shook my socks seriously. When the anime first launched, I felt too slow. The story is still not going forward and Shiro is an impressive male lead actor. When he learned more about follow-up and you learned more about the Saber War and the Holy Grail War itself, the story unfolded and you can see the various aspects of it moving together. It's wonderful. <br /> <br /> In addition, I feel that the way the characters develop is very true in creating a model that people develop in the real world. Nothing stupid completely happened; The development of Ilya and Rin is interesting, but I think the way that Shiro and Saber grow in some of their personalities is interesting to watch. There are a few "surprise" people who appear (Gil Gameh?) Seems to be unique from the rest of the actors in some way, which means that we don't have a Bad-ass B "as soon as A dies. <br /> <br /> And I love music The opening song has vibrations and the theme of the decoration from the last episode ... pushing the theme of the final episode more seriously. Great. Type-MOON!
