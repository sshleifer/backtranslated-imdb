I watched movies while recovering from major surgery. At the moment I know that it's just a movie "B" Western Space. I love it. It may be the lack of a flash of high dollar productions that my imagination is not less. Sadly, our society has a lot, reducing a little effort is too easy. In the same way that I can enjoy Shakespearean performances at the school level, I can appreciate many levels of achievement for the benefit of art. I am a policeman and found that there is a relationship with the retired LAPD. A dream like he haunts me that I will not be able to in times of crisis can respond to save others. (Or of myself) while it is a romantic ending that Tennsworth had to get rid of the bad guys (predictable) My world is too insulting.
