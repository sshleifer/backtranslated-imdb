I lived in those times, and I think the list is the heart of that era. I think it should deal with more Afro American issues, but I think it's very comprehensive in the program. It's scary to sit and watch the riots on TV. Hopefully they won't go as far as your family is at home. I think Jerry O'Connell has done a great job, which is the vet's picture back from War I went to school with those returning Some people change more than others, and some people don't. It annoyed me when someone commented that the problem was not comprehensive enough or not getting enough entertainment. Living through it and expressing opinions I think this movie is excellent and everyone in it works great. Thank you for traveling (sad and good). Memory channel
