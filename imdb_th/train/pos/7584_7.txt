Production of PM Entertainment This has enough ammunition to make John Woo say "Enough!" Sure, it's not as beautiful as Woo can deliver. Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is a uniformed police in the near future. When his wife is framed to kill the governor by a team that uses a similar cyborg, it is up to Eric to clear her name. Wilson will pull Van Damme's duties as he leads his evil heroes and robots. Why does the institution fail to observe so it is beyond me? As a production PM, there are many car chases, car bombs (4 in the first 5 minutes!) And shot outs. I like the van that turns in the middle of the car before it can approach the explosive truck. Another thing I like is the young lady in the neighborhood came to make her karate perfect in the simulation of Don. It's just a chance to show off the cheap LAWNMOWER MAN effect around 1995.
