Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) meets a mysterious woman (Faye Angel) in the bar and invites her to watch the show with him. She agreed that they would not exchange any information about each other - not even the name. Sometimes these are the best days. However, when he returned to his apartment, Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez) and his team were waiting for him. Scott's wife was killed His excuse is a mysterious woman. But no one remembers seeing her and hence, Scott was sentenced to death for his wife's murder. The Secretary of Kansas (Ella Raines) didn't believe in his fault and set out to find a woman who could save him from the death penalty. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie and the audience is 100% behind. Kansas's efforts to get the truth We followed her through memorable scenes, such as finding the Mac the Bart bartender (Andrew Tombes) at night and the awkward place that Cliff the drummer (Elisha Cook Jr) took her to drink. And dance while he is jamming with friends. This is an image that indicates the sexual desire that is clearly a prominent part of the movie because everyone has sweating and rhythmic throughout the duration of Scene Ella Raines is a female lead and Thomas Gomez is a pleasant cop. Alan Curtis begins with an innocent confusion. But when he was arrested, his performance turned left as he became displeased with Kansas without reason. God knows why she is stuck with him. <br /> <br /> This film doesn't make you guess who the murderer is, as we know about halfway through this movie. In fact, it increases the tension and the dramatic development of the story while we are in Kansas to find out what happened and then to hell! It's a great movie that has a wonderful scene. But even though Elisha Cook Jr. will have a memorable role But I never liked him in everything I saw him in .... someone handed me a neck .....
