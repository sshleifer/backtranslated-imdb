I am about 12 years old when I see cartoons. "Kasper the French ghost" thinks it is the first version because Casper doesn't look right. * The same way that Porky Pig doesn't look * correct in the comic of the 1930s. br /> <br /> However, now, in the afterlife of the friendly Tom's girlfriend, about him beating a small fox, which he named Ferrari. I remember being happy to see Kasper having friends because people who watched that cartoon never knew that most people fled from him screaming "Ghost!" Casper and Ferdin had fun. Together until others appear ... I hate to leave you with a semi-spoiler But the comic is only seven minutes long, so you must not be too vague. In addition, anyone reading the cartoon's IMDb summary can infer what happened next ... <br /> <br /> The ending is a miserable story. In fact, it's sad that I've felt that I watched cartoons. But that means it makes me move, which may explain why I decided to write a comment about this cartoon. Or the fact that I remember this cartoon because of the emotional impact on me - I haven't seen it since then But the comic ends with a fast rhythmic note and I'm happy to see Casper and Ferdie happy again. <br /> <br /> I'll give this comic 8 out of 10 stars after Warner Bros. cartoon. " Peace on Earth "This is the shortest movie I've ever played.
