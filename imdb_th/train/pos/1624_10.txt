Old Mill Pond is a tribute to African-American entertainers in the 30s, rather than insulting all competition (Stepin Fetchit, even caricature), except that I just talked about having a frog or fish version of Fat Calloway Cab. Waller, Joesphine Baker, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson and Louis Armstrong. Happy Harmonies cartoons from Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising are perfect music to entertain the characters. They sounded like the real thing that I half thought would be If not, they certainly imitate flattering Even the lazy and lazy Fetchit character received an exciting workout when he was chased by a tiger while "Hold That Tiger" played with scores. Highly recommended for animation fans. 30s and jazz music
