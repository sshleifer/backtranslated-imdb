Very funny movie The classic comedy movie Eddie Murphy of the 80s. I saw when I was a kid and I had good memories. The irony of the classic Murphy did not fail. The comedy was very good. Many actions that represent him in joking about everything that is dangerous The results can be appreciated only partially. But the second film from 1986 to the present has changed The atmosphere of the movie at that time was good and the special effects were good for the movies of that time. A good movie to watch and enjoy admiring the taste of Murphy, a ridiculous actor who has just disappeared. The last part is the poem, the actor who likes and plays the Tibetan monk. That's it.
