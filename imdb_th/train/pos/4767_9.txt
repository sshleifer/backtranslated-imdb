I do not see what this program is about OC Secondly, The OC happened in California. The north coast occurs in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> And why does Fox show like other shows on the same network? I think this is a great program with most good actors. With a good storyline and storyline I like the events and the way people care for them and work for them. The latest episode is surprising how the story is. It can't be predicted like most stories on most shows. <br /> <br /> I hope Fox will keep it in the air.
