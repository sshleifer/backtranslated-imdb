This content is a "sequel" that is much better than the first action movie 101 Dalmatians. It has good dogs, good actors, good jokes and the right pain! <br /> <br /> Cruella DeVil, who has received a very important treatment, is now a dog lover and is very kind to them. Many people, including Chloe Simon, owner of a dog that Cruella had tried to kill, didn't believe it like this. Others, such as Kevin Shepherd (the second owner of Chance Dog Shelter), believe that she has changed. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Dipstick and his friends gave birth to three cute Dalmatian puppies! Little Dipper, Domino and Oddball ... <br /> <br /> Starring Eric Idle as Waddlesworth (hilarious Macaw), Glenn is close to Cruella himself and Gerard Depardieu is Le Pelt (another bad name should Give a clue.) This is a good family movie that has excitement and much more !! One disaster of this movie is that it has a lot of pain. But not as much as the last movie This is more fun than the latest movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy "102 Dalmatians"! :-)
