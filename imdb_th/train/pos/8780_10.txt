This film is one of the greatest sports movies ever created by Hollywood. It's a great story about one of the greatest sports in American history. What makes James J. Corbett's story particularly interesting is that Corbett introduces the style of boxing that continues to this day. In the sense that James J. Corbett has been truly invented But going back to watching the movie, all the performances were excellent. Alexis Smith was beautiful. Of course, she looked like Nicole Kidman. And even though it was time But the story is resistant to the test of time It's not going to hold down. The image of John L. Sullivan's Bond Bond must be one of the best images of real sports in the history of the movie. When combined with an excellent screenplay, this film is forbidden.
