Jane Austen will definitely agree with this! <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow did an excellent job showing Emma's attitude. She is a funny person without being too stupid, but elegant. She speaks English accent reliably. (Not a British person, maybe I'm not the best judge. But she fooled me ... she was great in "Sliding doors" ... Sometimes I forget you are an American ~!). <br /> <br /> The best is Jeremy Northam and Sophie Thompson and Phyllida Law (sister and mother of Emma Thompson. ) As Bates women They almost steal items ... and Ms. Law doesn't even have a call! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
