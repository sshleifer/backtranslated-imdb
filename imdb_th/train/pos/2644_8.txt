I do not know what it is. I found it to be the love of this movie. But the first time I saw it, I wanted to see how it ended. I'm not a big fan of Paul Winfield or the war drama. But I truly wondered when Winfield would find his child. All he knew was that the boy had green eyes. Truth be told, I have never seen this movie in the past year or have not appeared on TV for a while. But this movie is the story of a man's Odyssey after the war. Winfield shows a sympathetic and heartwarming image of a man lost from his memory There is a reference to this film that he is looking for the last piece of human morality after this war and the reality he faces. Why is this movie still not playing on DVDs or videos? It's a mystery to me.
