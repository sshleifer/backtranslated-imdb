Of course, unlike anything else directed by Lynch, there is no supernatural, no violence, no vulgarity. However, it is a beautiful flick. It's a bit slow But may intend because it is the story of a 6 week old man's journey The characters are people every day, so they can believe. The performance was good and the final scene was incredibly impressive. Everyone with siblings can relate to it. Lyle and Alvin don't need to say anything else. For a moment they will come back in the old days and all the battles will be forgotten.
