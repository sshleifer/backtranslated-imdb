This movie is wonderful. <br /> <br /> The plot is unusual. <br /> <br /> The sequence of actions that have been planned. <br /> <br /> But if you Can make it light enough to laugh It was a very exciting play that included Keystone Cops and Lone Ranger. <br /> <br /> Stupid baddies, bad guys, too bad. Black actors play normal characters rather than black patterns. <br /> <br /> The combination of babies adds a good touch. Sympathy can be a little difficult. <br /> <br /> I must not agree with the performance. Overall very good. I want to fight with Judge Reinhold. <br /> <br /> And in the end, that's the mark of a really good movie.
