I must say that Umar is the sexiest woman in the world. This movie is cute, uber and I mean uber cute. It has all the "sex" content that most Ivan Reitman comedies have but something very special. Uma and Luke all have convincing chemistry. But seems to be superior to each scene Both seem to create this bizarre, distorted and interesting relationship with a powerful "sexual" tension that you laugh until you can't touch your face again. Anna Farris and the rest of the actors seem to play. The role of each other perfectly and even the small role of Wanda Sykes will make you laugh. Although this type of comedy is not for everyone But I have to say that I go with people who often don't enjoy these movies and they laugh like crazy. This movie is definitely not for everyone. Especially young children, because some time periods are too small ... try to say ADULT for younger audiences Overall, I was surprised by this film. The difficult ending I found was a little weak compared to the rest of the film. (3 1/2 * from 5 *)
