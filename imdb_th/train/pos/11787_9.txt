It's a short film from David Lynch with just 8 minutes, but it has "Lynchian's all ingredients"! It's mysterious, dark, inconclusive, creepy and strange; And before the blonde girl starts talking, it is a little scary! A special soundtrack to create a strange atmosphere because it's scary and mysterious? <br /> <br /> Regarding the setting, it doesn't have a "traditional" red curtain, but it has a purple painted wall that makes it equally effective. The girl was locked in a dark room and she requested help. Then another girl who mysteriously started talking to her said that she was there just because of her fault? We don't know what happened or what will happen next? It ended up not solving and puzzling as a good movie Lynch must end! <br /> <br /> It is very short, even with acting that is skillful. Girls are professional actors. But I think their performances will be better in the short term.
