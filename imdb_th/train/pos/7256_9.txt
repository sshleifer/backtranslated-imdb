I saw a long dead date when it first came to the cinema. I think this movie gives a good military perspective. It is a realistic story of a man who made war. The story moves quickly, showing the group of people behind the enemy line and trying to return to their battle line with hostile prisoners. The characters are well developed and reliable. <br /> <br /> David Hemmings is a good actor and has a leading role with confidence. Like Alan Dobie (as the German Helmut) I was surprised. That i can't Find this movie on VHS or DVD and I feel that it has become a forgotten movie that is sad because it's superior to other war movies I've seen.
