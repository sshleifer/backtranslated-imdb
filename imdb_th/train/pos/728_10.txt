Ramones, whom I think is the founder of modern punk rock, has given their unique voice to the horrific distorted movie about a rocky fan (PJ Soles) who faces mercy. Mary Woronov Rock <br /> <br /> There is a soundtrack full of amazing music. RRHS is interesting in the concept and operation. It's full of rioting jokes. (Eg mouse trial) teen spirit (It may be the opening of my favorite movies all the time) and the strange moments when closing the walls (cramped scenes) If you are looking for movies that create pure fun at the molecular level, don't look elsewhere. But if you are looking for a proud and amazing epic, you may have to look far further. <br /> <br /> "Hello everyone, I am Riff Randell and this is Rock & Roll High School!"
