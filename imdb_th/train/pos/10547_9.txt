I watched the preview on the DVD after watching the movie and I think everyone who saw before watching the movie would be surprised and might be disappointed. It makes the fact that this film is "By the director of Cube" and made it look like a horror movie, when in fact it was a ridiculous joke, but it was) reminiscent of Rosencrantz and Guildernstern that were dead <br /> <br / > I love the way the story is built slowly. At first, then gradually increasing. I also enjoy the truth without any explanation for what happened in the movie. And the fact that the story plays an important role in the same scene is just respect that the film is similar to Cube. I recommend it
