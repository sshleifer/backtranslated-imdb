It was a very long year in which I reviewed the final film in 2004. Panaghoy Sa Suba (Call of The River) was ranked second in the latest Metro Manila Film Festival. As expected, it did not perform well at the box office because it was too artistic for general moviegoers, especially since MMFF was a season where many families went out to watch movies. <br /> <br /> It's It's quite interesting to watch movies that aren't played in the Philippines or England on the screen. I think Cesar Montano works well as a star and director. His wonderful vision and creativity helped the film really. He is also very effective as a lead actor and can show the various emotions that are necessary for this film. In addition, there is a good work of young actors Rebecca Lusterio. She has done a great job in designing Duroy's sister Bikay. I hope to meet her in many other film projects in the future which may be other types I think the fact that this movie is in her native language really helps her. <br /> <br /> The camera image in this movie is very well done. The scenery is breathtaking, although I feel that if less effort will look completely different, <br /> <br /> In terms of the story, I feel that the writer can delve deeper into the life of the character. In the movie, I will definitely not praise the story of this movie.
