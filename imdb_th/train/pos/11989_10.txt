Thank you Jymn Magon for creating Disney's best 2 cartoons. This show has been greatly improved over the years. When I was a child, I didn't like it because I thought it was Ducktales' story, which was a Disney thing I loved at that time (like Grandmoffromero) after that, although it was good but not good. But after reading the review here, I decided. Will give you another chance & buy a DVD set & see all the pilots on the first day I received & was very surprised It is still my favorite episode, even if the series continues to live. And at the end of disc 1, I know that this will be the top tenner. <br /> <br /> The characters are complex and charming. My favorite thing is to be a wildcat. He is very cheerful and cute. My next favorite thing is Baloo, the best pilot in the show. I can see why 'ol Jymn created a show around him. Then, as Kit Cloudkicker He & Baloo had the best relationship in the series. After that, Louie Jim Cummings worked perfectly to falsify the original sound. After Rebecca She makes me laugh so hard and I believe that eventually she and Balu are married and eventually (for the hero), Molly, even though she is my favorite. But I still like you I think she is a very cute character (better than Webby from Ducktales) and the evil character is very original. Don Karnage & the pirates in his air always beat me. Kahn is cold and ruthless and the Thembrians are often <br /> <br /> As you said before, Bear, Romance of Red Chimp) There is nothing to touch (The Old Man & the Seaduck, Paradise Lost) for a fun, funny and exciting adventure. (To find the ancient mistakes This is just a few episodes that I like. However, Talespin is the best of Disney, apart from Gummi Bears for some reason for this? GB has the right character (Cubbi) in the right amount, while TS has not enough wildcat, but in the end, Talespin is still classic. BOTTOM LINE- 10/10 ranked the 6 best cartoons of all time.
