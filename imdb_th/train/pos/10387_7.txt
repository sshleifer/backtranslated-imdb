After reading other reviews here, I was expecting something really scary but was surprised. Reality check: The original series is not as good as this. I think some people can remember with love more than they deserve. But in addition to chasing the car and Daisy's legs, the script was weak and acted poorly. The Duk boy is too smart to fear the backwoods and the dejected Bosok, too, to be a demon, and the rogo exceeds every moment of the screen. It is really amazing that the series will work as long as it does because it doesn't have a story during the first series. <br /> <br /> Go back to the movie. If you watch this movie in your own way, it's not a direct comparison to that you remember that the TV series is not bad at all. The true star is definitely General Lee. Hunting and gripping is great and that's what D.O.H. is about. Johnny Knoxville is his unusual identity and along with Cne William Scott as Bo's cousin makes this movie a real joke. Jessie The cute Simpson is a cute person like Miss Daisy, Burt Reynolds, causing Boss Hog and MC to develop a lot. Gainey makes Rosco P. Coltrane a nasty person as he should always be > If you don't like humorous humor and stunts in your car, you probably Not see this movie because of you. Should know what to expect Otherwise, if you want action movies that have a few laughs that don't have to think hard in the brain, you can see the fun filled with an open mind.
