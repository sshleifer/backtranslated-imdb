Just like the classic Bugs Bunny cartoon, this movie has a lot of humor at all levels. I just introduced this to a 10 year old daughter and a 11 year old son. Both of them enjoyed this movie - laughed out a few times .. And my daughter is not a sci-fi fan The movie makes me laugh even though I've seen a couple of times ... Humor at the adult level. (That is a joke that adults receive only because of a better life experience. Nothing is bad. Equally fun for adults. For example, adult humor, the sound of Tuesday depends on the characters of the film / actors. Blaznee, a Martian pilot, has a voice and courtesy of Jack Nicholson; The scientist of Dr. Peter Seller's Strangelove. The special technique is great for this film. The lack of top 10 actors actually works according to the satisfaction of the film and the actors / actors have a good role - in fact, I would say that the producers choose their actors and skills according to the needs of the role above the power. Pull the box office An example is Wayne Alexander's "Vern" character.) I have to write this review ... Kids are playing this for the 3rd time in 4 days with dinner now. Suitable for rainy days or weekends. At night, there are no movies that I get bored of.
