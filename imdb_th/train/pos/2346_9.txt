Sweet pilot The performance came from Tim Burton's better movie ... Edward Sissorhands, Big Fish, Charlie & the Chocolate Factory. Filming, subtitles, external music makes Tim Burton scream. There must be a strong connection or influence. I am not researching enough to know where it is. <br /> <br /> As I saw in the forum, yes, Anna Friel is playing as a poor man, Zooey Deschanel every time. I saw her on the screen. I saw Zooey. Don't understand. I'm wrong. Anna Friel works very well. Her character is cute and very cute and you will stick with her easily. It is a distraction that I always think of. "Why aren't they Zooey Deschanel?" <br /> <br /> Lee Pace also works well. I try to remember where I came from and just look at it. Wonderfalls !!! Excellent short series, short-lived from 2004. If you enjoy pushing Daisy, you have to rent Wonderfalls, which is another work of Brian Fuller? (A little shop of horror) Again, the actress has two disadvantaged characters who never fail to perform.
