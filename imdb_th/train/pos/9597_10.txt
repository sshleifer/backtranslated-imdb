This is a documentary film that everyone has to fear that young people have lost their tastes in real life adventures and morality. Darius Goes West is an amazing roller coaster story. We spent the life of Darius and the crew when they started their journey throughout their lives. Darius had Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a disease that affects all the muscles in his body. He was held in a wheelchair and needed attention all the time. So the crew of this young friend might manage to take him on a 6,000-mile journey back to the west coast and back. Watch movies and experience this great adventure - laughing and crying with the crew as they handle challenges that can't be imagined all the way and enjoy the final victory when they return three weeks later. Their home town And great surprises!
