From the first scene, you will receive clues about what might happen here. It became clear when the story continued. The performances are excellent throughout and these actors touch your soul. Even though I knew what would happen, I felt very confused with motivation. I am still confused as to why Ben did what he did. We can see in his face. "Second thought" but the best sacrifice seems to contradict his emotions and feelings. It is very interesting and impressive. But it made me confused Maybe that's the purpose of the movie. I like this movie and Will Smith can choose a good movie. This guy knows how to entertain the audience!
