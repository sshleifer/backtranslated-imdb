The movie Stephen King is a joke with me. I really love them or hate them. Productions that some surfers like (Like the desperation and storm of the century) I didn't have fun. In fact, I like it very much. The sleepwalker is the person I like and see regularly. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Mary. They are sleepwalkers, the shape of animals that change, even though humans appear as cats like animals. They are immune to the cat's scratches and whenever they move to a new city, place traps to catch and kill animals. When they moved to their latest city, they needed to find a virgin and when Charles met him, he actually fell in love with her. But his mother wanted to raise her The story revolves around what will happen to the girl. Charles will trust her or use her to help his mother. <br /> <br /> Although this story has too much sex, some people may find it not interesting. Because of the scandal Like the story of Stephen King, most are located in small towns with many interesting characters. The performance is not the best and there are no special effects. In any way, all things tend to be 'gels' and there are adjustments that can be viewed and enjoyed. <br /> <br /> Recently, it has been shown in BBC1, Sci-Fi and Sky Thriller / Horror
