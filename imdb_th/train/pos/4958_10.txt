Full revelation: I am a sarcastic person. I like the tragic ending and my handkerchief is dry. I didn't cry when Bambi's mother was shot. Will Smith Happiness's new movie seems to be an excuse for Oscar. Essentially, I was born without a soul. <br /> <br /> Why do I like "10 or less", maybe an espresso? The two layers that I made before the performance or (possibly more), maybe it was possible that even the most troubled movie fans could use sweetness from time to time. <br /> <br /> And It was sweet from the moment The "he" with "red" (The incident was far from Nora Ephron "meet cute"), this view happens to travel closer to two strangers who learned to pay attention. (Helped by Phedon Papamichael's cinematic style camera work.) <br /> <br /> The main argument about this film is that the information is too far. Does this movie get pulled far? I don't know. You told me. I haven't met Adrian Brody at the market. (However, not because of lack of effort) I enjoy considering the potential adventure or not. Is this important event happening? As soon as I do .. that is the most criticism of "10 or less", it is short .. They fail to take into account that even though we mock, have imagination. And sometimes it is worth the price they will be with them 82 minutes per time
