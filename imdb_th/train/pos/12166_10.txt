Very strange and interesting movies It is a story about a very awkward and painful man trying to lead his life as a fundraiser / salesman. The director is able to capture a very interesting sound that serves this matter Original and unstable while still experiencing a lot of humor in the pain that comes with life There is an outstanding test room sequence and makes me laugh out loud, which is not what I do as often as I should. One of the more memorable movies I've seen for a long time. It's not out of my mind and I hope to try in the future by Bronstein. Great performances all around. Simple lines "I'm really grateful." Now is a symbol for me.
