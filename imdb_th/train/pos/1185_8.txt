Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger changed the role of Goody - badies they held in "Every brother has courage." Taylor seemed uncomfortable in the role of the bad guy. But Grainger shows his role perfectly. However, the real hero in this story is bison and northwest. This film is perfectly created with the atmosphere of the time that has been miraculously received. The direction is tense, and although the film doesn't have light entertainment, it's a way that I think is a big movie, but wisdom is not unfair.
