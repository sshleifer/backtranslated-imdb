This is one of the best episodes from MOH's second season. I think Mick Garris has problems with women ... He kills them all. They are often victims (Screwfly solution, Pro-life, Valerie on the stairs). I remember At the time of Argento in Season 1, not at all. Publishers) I think he enjoys watching women burnt, tormented, destroyed and I don't know. At least "Right to die" is one of the best things by turning. Good and graphic scene and mind to his mind (Especially with the photos from the great cell scene). Acting is like a regular series. I might be the worst, such as "Pro-life" or "We scream for ice cream". In addition, I think the plot is It can be created for the movie and not just the horror of the series. The series is terrifying to kill and destroy women, destroy animals and continue ... In the first season, it's better than the second with episodes like "Cigarrette Burns" (good Most), "Homecoming" (the most funny), "Imprin t "(really shocking)
