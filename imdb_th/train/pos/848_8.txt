The turning point in "The Matador" came about halfway through the movie when Danny, a man without sophistication from Denver, sat on the hotel balcony in Mexico City, enjoying a quiet moment. Someone knocked on his door and knew that Julian was the killer who paid. He refused to answer. But is he really? <br /> <br /> Richard Shephard, the director of "The Matador", presents us with the character Julian Noble that cannot be exchanged. In fact, we have seen him in practice and do what he does best. When Julian met Danny at Camino Real's bar in Mexico City, he made six nuts and told the new acquaintance what he had done to earn a living. <br /> <br /> Danny, who sold the company program The Mexicans, however, seem to be competing with local suits that seem to be ahead to receive the contract. Danny is a naive person who is a victim of the special abilities and charms that Julian is fascinated with. It was not until the time later that the cold winter night that the murderer appeared at Danny's door asked his friend to return to favor and take him to Tucson. At this point, the secret that binds them together is revealed in an unexpected way. <br /> <br /> Pierce Brosnan acts against the genre. Just watching him walk through the hotel lobby in Speedo and his boots give the right impression about his character. On the other hand, Greg Kinnear plays the exact role of this match. Hope Davis appeared only a few scenes, causing us to mourn why she was no longer living. Philip Baker Hall created the image as a coordinator between Julian and his assignments. <br /> <br /> Richard Shephard brings his own style of work with content. The musical score is by Rolfe Kent and David Tattersall's sharp movie shooting helps to increase everything.
