We often talk about the landmarks of the cinema - Kane, The Godfather, A Bout de Souffle. However, one movie is often overlooked by "serious" film critics too. I'm talking about the classic Doc Savage course (MoB ) <br /> <br /> This film is not only But only exciting No need to talk about kung fu. <br /> <br /> It also has the greatest soundtrack in movie history. Although it is quite rare But this movie is worth finding - it will reward your search efforts ten times
