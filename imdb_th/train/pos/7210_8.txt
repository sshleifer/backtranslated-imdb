New York playwright Michael Ken (as Sidney Bruhl) is 46 years old and quickly fading. When the movie was released, the most recent drama of Mr. Ken appeared on Broadway. TV inspectors poked at Ken and he was drunk. Passed to the Long Island Railroad land in Montauk instead of living in East Hampton. Finally, when he arrived at home, Ken felt comfortable with Dyan Cannon, the wife (named Myra), the wife of a highly stressful heart disease patient. Ken and Miss Cannon talked about a new play called "Deathtrap" written by Christopher Reeve (as Clifford "Cliff" Anderson), one of Caine's former students. Both believe that Mr. Reeve's "Deathtrap" is What is needed to revive Caine's career <br /> <br /> "Is the trap set? For evil jokes, who will do it? <br /> <br /> Directed by Sidney Lumet, the long-running Broadway attack of Ira Levin, not far from the origin on stage The actors have fun and the story of the story continues to bustle. One thing that doesn't work (for me) is to end the call with a curtain. Of course, it plays better on the stage "Deathtrap". It's a fun movie to watch again. The show is dead. But in understanding the past, Reeve's greeting to Ken at East Hampton Railway Station should be made easier by smiling "Hello". The place is not really East Hampton, but windmills and pools. Water is similar. And the love scene shot with ballyhooed is very scary But the drama is very good "Even the talented director can't destroy it" and Lumet doesn't disappoint. <br /> <br /> ******** Deathtrap (3/19/82) Sidney Lumet ~ Michael Caine , Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Irene Worth
