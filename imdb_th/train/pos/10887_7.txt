Horror movies are being shot and everything is not smooth. It's about a scam killer. The director told the killer in front of the actors and the team. He was mad and killed two people. He committed suicide and the film was not over yet. Twelve years later, a group of students decided to try to finish it, but there was a curse of people who tried to finish it. Students don't care about that. Guess what will happen next. <br /> <br /> This plot is an old hat. But this is not bad for what it is It has done well with young actors and is reasonably capable. No one is good but no one is scary as well. It also avoids the necessary nude female scenes. (And not necessary) it moves fast, good blood and blood and the script does not insult your intelligence. In addition, Molly Ringwald has this time in her life playing as a fading actress. <br /> <br /> There is no good vibration. I give 7 questions.
