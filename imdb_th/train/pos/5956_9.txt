Yes, this is a movie with a very low budget. Therefore, acting is not an award-winning content, and sometimes the action is slower, as filmmakers filmed sequentially and not one of the millions that have been edited into movies This film was made for that, with an outstanding script that cares about blood sucking seriously, explaining and developing a full plot from it. In addition to vampires, we also receive detailed genetic information, law enforcement and martial arts enforcement, martial arts, philosophies and good metal music. Glorious to Dylan O'Leary, the director / writer / main actor. It was beyond me that this man could accomplish these duties and make it better. I think to thank this film, you must have knowledge in every type of theme to see that writers do a lot of research and know about all of these things. There are excellent camera work as well, interesting camera angles and underwater vampire attacks - something I've never seen before. But is a homage to the underwater zombie attack in Fulci's Zombi. Casting is good as long as sexy women are sexy. The main vampire looks perfect for this chapter. Victims of women seem weak My only complaint is that a horror flick with a small budget should have more nudity. If you want to watch the original vampire movies with great stories, this flick is for you. I am looking forward to seeing future projects by Mr. O'Leary.
