I can remember this game It usually sat on the shelves alone until one day I decided to try something new for change and get this game. I stared in fear because it was the first game for PS1 that I had 4 discs. When I played it, I couldn't put the controller seriously. <br /> <br /> The story of this game is very good and distorted. It's almost as good as Final Fantasy VII Storyline, and that's hard to achieve. When you play the game, you will be involved with the character so much that it is unbelievable that it's only a PS1 game because it feels like a movie. And I believe it should be turned into a movie. <br /> <br /> This game is very bad, a game that has never been heard before and almost no one plays or likes it because it is one of the games in which they sit. The end of the rack with 50% off the sitting signal. Try to sell. I am one of those people who always look at the end and try them out and most of them become really good people. That's the way I enter Final Fantasy VII. Look in the catalog and search for it. But this is different from Final Fantasy. <br /> The Legend of Dragoon is the only game or RPG game that is surprisingly much better than Square Enix. I wouldn't be surprised if it was created by Square Enix, but it's not any game that I played hardly better than the Final Fantasy series or Dragon Quest series, but this game is But the thing that really confused me is why it is so little known and not receiving praise, which should be <br /> <br /> The graphics are quite good for PS1 games, but what do you expect from it? It's a PS1 guy created in 1999. The story that I have said is amazing, almost winning the VII. The character is great. You share with them a lot and their actions. <br /> <br / > Of course, 10 out of 10 definitely deserves more praise.
