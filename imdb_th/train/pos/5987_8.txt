Gabe Ryan (Frankie Thomas) left the reform school and returned to the slum. His sister (Ann Sheridan) doing his best to prevent him from suffering But seems to follow him In addition to his relationship with the termite gang, Gabe is also followed by real-life gangsters who plan to set fire to a random building to collect insurance. They need someone to blame for arson and gabe is It depends on whether the termites will work according to the law in favor and give the gangsters only desserts. <br /> <br /> The dead end kids scenes are quite good. The boy went to the furniture of the new residents on the street and proceeded to be his own. They talked with a luxurious accent and talked about drinking tea together. Bernard Punsley slept on a chair. Then the children started fighting with the new boy. But after he proved himself to be a good fighter, they asked him to join the club. <br /> <br /> The starting scene was quite good as well. Seems to be dangerous at first <br /> <br /> Later, when Billy Halop learned to be a young mayor, he had a dream about learning. This is a wonderful scene with a small hologram of children walking on his face and shooting questions at him. <br /> <br /> Angels wash their faces as good names because of it. Play from the success of Angel and dirty face. And really tell what the child is doing Notorious for bad behavior in and out of these boys' suits doing well in this movie But instead of being tricky, it creates great laughter This is an example of what many boys will become in the The Bowery Boys series. We also get words that can't be read from Leo Gorcey.
