It's a delightful movie. Not only characters But lively But still live, reflecting the truth in daily life and family conflicts Each character brings a unique personality to the story that the audience can easily connect with the people they know within their family or close friends. <br /> <br /> The story is true Life Can absorb and be part of the drama, laughter and tears while the plot of the movie develops The script works well to capture the emotions, actions and reactions of conflicting characters, commenting and editing. <br /> <br /> Not epic. But it's a very good movie to watch with loved ones. Knowing a lot, nodding, hilarious and 'ahhh' moments to share and enjoy
