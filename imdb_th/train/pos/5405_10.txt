My brother and I have 4Ever Pokemon on DVD. We watch it like a couple of times and it is the best. It's terrible. New Pok√©mon aren't talking at this time. I'm going to get used to it. <br /> <br /> The gun stripped of iron is a good thing when he catches Celebi with his dark ball. Good Thing Ash and Sam manage to get him out of his control. > <br /> There is only one song in the credit called Cele-BRATE performed by Russell Velazquez. <br /> <br /> Pokemon 4Ever has become a success since the previous three movies and people will love the movie. Always
