KELLS's secret may be the best movie I've ever seen since the story of Belleville. Although having a very different style, KELLS is used in conjunction with TRIPLETS and (KUNG FU PANDA), the second order of KUNG FU PANDA. The dramatic artistic direction, design, production, background and layout of KELLS are quite extravagant - almost as gothic C in its form (Quite reminiscent of Klimt), which has an excellent overall view and beautiful in the Celtic & illuminated design. You fall in love with the characters from the moment you meet them. You are drawn to every detail of the story and every stroke of the pencil and brush. What Tommy Nora Ross Paul and everyone in Cartoon Saloon (and the extended team) have accomplished with a small budget / movie with a very small team. It's amazing. The support from our animation community is excellent. This film is amazing and noisy among our colleagues in introducing this film spread like wildfire. Congratulations to KELLS from many awards. Annie's nomination They are all nods that deserve ...
