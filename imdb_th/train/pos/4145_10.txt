This is not a masterpiece theater. You shouldn't go into expecting that. This is an innocent girl who enjoys the best actress. Like others say, this is the movie Baby Mama intended to be. And the only downside I saw in this film is that Tina Fey wasn't there - she was also the smartest and smartest female star in the world. This film has pure purity on the surface. But if you look at it, you will know that it has a lot of meaning and meaning to all of us who hope that they will return to do it again. Pure fun and I recommend to everyone who is looking for Great escape 84 minutes
