Great! That's all I can say about this movie, but imdb wants to text at least four lines, so I'll do it thoroughly. The actor is great (Jerry O'connel is so cute!) The song is great. (Sixties have the best songs ever. Imho) Historical content is interesting and the way they create actors in the 90s. It seems that they were there in the 60s and most important - The story of the main character makes my tears and that is the greatness of the drama. But in one word: very good!
