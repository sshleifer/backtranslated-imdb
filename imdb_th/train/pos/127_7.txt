Zentropa has a lot of similarities with The Third Man, a noir movie created in the midst of post-war European ruins. Like TTM, there are many creative camera works. There are innocent Americans who have feelings about women that they don't really understand, and their innocence is more outstanding than the native people. <br /> <br /> The third person has a well-designed story. Zentropa Quite disjointed in this part Perhaps this is intentional: it is presented as a dream / nightmare, and making it too intertwined will result. <br /> <br /> This film is horribly scary - "noir" more than one touch; No one sees the sun shining, scary but interesting and scary.
