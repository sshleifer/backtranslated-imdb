House of the Spirits is a story of family, South American politics and supernatural power. Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons present Isabel Allende's novel to life with love and wonder. In my view, this is one of the best films of the 1990s. Jeremy Irons is Esteban. Trueba aged and many mellows believe while Meryl Streep in the role of Clara. Keeping her gentle, warm love for a relatively short life Winona Ryder and Antonio Banderas create a couple who are struggling for acceptance from a family in a racist culture. Glenn Close, as Esteban's sister, gives a very impressive performance. Portugal's countryside is a reasonable substitute for countries outside Latin America. The setting of the house of Clara and Esteban's ranch is powerful and the US cars of that era add to the post-war atmosphere.
