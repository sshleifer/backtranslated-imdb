This is the best movie I have seen for a long time. Not only is it the best movie in this genre? (Filming in school) The way that Ben Coccio (director) decided to film it was beautiful. He was filmed using a teenager who was still in high school. He filmed in the actors' room and used the true parents of the actors to become parents in the movie. The actors were also filmed with video cameras as well as in the diary videos. It's almost really good (if that's the word). There are a few slip ups, for example when Cal calls the brads (?) Land rover range rover (or vice versa because I see it).
