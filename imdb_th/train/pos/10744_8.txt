The event on September 11, 2001 does not require special human attention in the follow-up of new firefighters' training or the progress of two French brothers. In my view, it is better to leave this. I think the director is trying too much. Maybe they feel that the event that day needs a backdrop. One police opinion - "This is not just Disney World" but clever. <br /> <br /> However, it is interesting to watch the event. The filmmakers are in the right place at the right time. There are no other pictures from the day that matches what they shoot.
