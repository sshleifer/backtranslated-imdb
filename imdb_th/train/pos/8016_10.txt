Don't think that this movie is just a movie for other children - the whole family can enjoy. It is a strange combination of movies as if it had a movie inside. But at least it was reasonable at the end (Unlike modern movies!) It gives all the elements of the movie. (Good plot and good character) - It makes the Muppets star a list of celebs * that this movie will cry.) What is surprising is the fact that it can be a roller coaster. The somersault of emotions, sad emotions, warm and funny - something all creates a fun family movie that everyone can see together. <br /> <br /> * The movie star is the top star of today. There is only one real star in this movie !!!!
