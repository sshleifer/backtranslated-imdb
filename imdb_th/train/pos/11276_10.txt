May be hard to believe But this film was condemned as immoral from the pulpit more than any other movie created before the bluenose Hayes Code was set. Yes, of course. Humans <br /> <br /> I didn't do this. They have many reasons: <br /> <br /> List: Jane likes sex. She and Tarzan woke up one morning in a shelter on a tree top. She stretches sensuously and with a hypocrisy. She says "Tarzan, you are a bad boy!" But only having sex But still have strange sex too! A few years later, under the Hess Code, people (Especially women) should not be seen as sex. <br /> <br /> The show: Jane likes a devilish person if wise and witty (Tarzan) for nine-five civilizations - a respectable man (Ho Bert) At first, Holt made her look good with beautiful dresses from London. When Holt tried to kill Tarzan and Holt and Jane were both convinced that he was dead. But when she realized that her man was still alive, his interest in civilization disappeared from her. And why not? The relationship of Tarzan and Jane is cost-effective: he lacks the "civilized" insistence that forces him to confirm himself to be "Head of the wife" in the boot, he does not have many "civilized" hangs like jealousy When Holt and his friend arrived in Tarzan, greeted them both informally, knowing that Holt was Jane's old flame. When Holt dressed her doll in a London dress and danced slowly with a portable record, Tarzan fell from the tree and pulled out a knife. Envy? Nope, he was just careful with strange instruments because he had never seen it before. When explained, he was cool. <br /> <br /> List: The Holt civilization is dirty. Tarzan is cruel, innocent. When Jane sneaks into Holt's tent, Holt goes out to see her shadow as she turns into a fancy dress. On the other hand, after Tarzan pulls out a series of fun, kicks her into the swimming hole and dives into it. After that, she has the most tastefully erotic nude scene in the entire theater: the couple spent five minutes in Bal Lovely water bath Filmed in three versions - clothed, nude and nude - that scene was cut before the film was released But now there is a nude image back to the video) and when Jane emerges and when the tiger emerges Jake Jane clearly shows that her irritation is caused only by being close to a "civilized" man and having a hang. "International confidence" Where is the love of the heart of seminary? Nowhere Another reason why the line is considered sinful. <br /> <br /> List: The idea that man is the crown of creation and animals are here for the use and comfort of Only human Holt and his friends want to be guided to the "Elephant Cemetery" so that they can dig ivory and take it home. They want Tarzan to guide them to the cemetery. Your readers are thinking "Chubby opportunity!" And you were right. He was shocked. He exclaimed "The elephant is sleeping!" Which he explained everything. Jane explained the feelings of Tarzan, which two "gentlemen" found to be ridiculous. <br /> <br /> List: Jane, a civilized woman in the past, has more expertise than two civilized men she joins. Holt and his friend sounded it and found themselves besieged by friendly tribes and wildlife. Jane is a person who takes great care of her while the children are alarmed. She is responsible for barking, directing them and sending rifles. <br /> <br /> Items: Jane's outfit is a poncho that doesn't have anything. under (The original idea is to let her topless, with leaves blocking her nipples, which is the case in a short scene) <br /> <br /> Finally, many men complain because this film is called "Tarzan And his partner "more" Tarzan and his wife "No comments! <br /> <br /> Of course, Tarzan, who has been nursed back to health from his monkey friends, helps rescue white hunters and bring elephants and African holders back to ivory. They steal to the holy place when it comes to the end. <br /> <br /> So you have it. Completely subversive movies Like other movies about women that are complex and interesting. (See, for example, possession with Rita Hayworth and Raymond Massey), which consisted of a slippery musical style in the early 30s and was suddenly brought to an end by bringing the Hays code <br /> <br /> joie de vivre This movie shows the best from the famous Tarzan version of Jane. Tarzan yell feels good, which is a pity for being abandoned in the future. <br /> <br /> We listen to the artistic freedom of Jane. Sex story
