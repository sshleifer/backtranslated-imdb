I just came back from the cinema late at night and it was a quiet way because most viewers pondered, even though the black and white partition images in real life, independent movements, etc., which are reminiscent of life. 'Our ancestors have to face! In the background, you don't have a phone / fax / internet at that time. But for the sound of truth and non-violence, the film blends the spirit of truth that is difficult in the midst of the rigid kings. <br /> <br >> Gandhi is a diligent lawyer in South Africa who stands for His fundamental ideology and confidence at all levels in the dissemination of the same subject with humility and knowledge which the speech In the general screen.It has the best speech with a little sense of humor & a threat to the British Kingdom in India. There is a good saying when he says that we pray quietly with the British in India right now at Gandhi. Politicians set for India (Continued satisfaction) <br /> <br /> The great backdrop of a large family with a large number of children needs to speak of the divine interest and love which is obvious which requires it in the hypnosis of The unfortunate child who was left alone For unrealistic ambitions, Harilal knew little about his aptitude and he was taken with a little emotion in his life and failed in front of his father's large idol. He tried to escape from the word giver. Consultation - The ship, which is the basis of any neighbor's success in the streets of Gandhi House, when Harilal drained the frustration in the open, which means that he became mentally weak and did not Receiving mental insanity to the level in which he was forced to convert to religion and alcoholics with debt and disobedience He continued to show his heartfelt love for his mother through stupid scenes and even Gandhi's humble expression in the way that Harilal forgave him. No conclusion was found in his heart. While he was afraid of his father, Gandhi always <br /> <br /> could not distinguish the fact that Gandhi couldn't share his love with him as he expected & was driven to rebel when he didn't understand Sending funds The study, from his father to his cousin. He saw an opportunity that failed to study lawyers in England. <br /> <br /> This took a lot of time when he was thrown into the road as a beggar when all the Indians were celebrating Indepedence. ! The life of the poor Never change anything that may be possible. But in the manner in which the sad death of Kasturba & Gandhi showed himself to be quiet in the end, Harilal's final turbulent thoughts were dying, showing that he was backward for the audience. Father of the wrong country? He was smart enough to have a strong mental strength to lead an army and use his brave military son as a weapon to show to the British forces and rival that when taking into account the interests of the country, there is nothing. Come on Although Mahatma's mind had to live outside his family and see that the innocent people could not see living inside .... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, they The innocent Hariel still destroys the effort. Of the ancestors that resemble many Mahatma families in the present life and have led to drugs, alcoholism and God only know what to think !! This is a message to all brave sainik (soldiers) - respect. Please respect the father of the nation! And happiness will be received, or is it a disaster in waiting?
