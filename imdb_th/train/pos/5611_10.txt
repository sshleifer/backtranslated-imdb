I saw this movie when I was playing with the idea of ​​moving into my own apartment and starting my own life. Maybe that's the reason why I'm serious. I believe in the mental deterioration of the poor character in Paris with the construction site all the time, dust, dirt, selfishness, vulgarity, malice and decay. I give credit to Polanski's art in his direction, his playing and his inescapable script. But I fainted in the last scene that was horrible and had to be restored from the cognac in the theater manager's office. Fortunately for me, my own life doesn't become a disaster like this. (Until now) but I still give a lot of respect to artists who can show illusions and soak up the reality (fake) that he is trying to convey In simple terms, this man is the first genius and is credited for the human race. This film is the sum of great performances and excellent casting. While some performances are made in English (scenes with Shelley Winters and Melvyn Douglas among others) and others in French. (With most other characters) and Polanski make voice in English and French To change the voice from French to English and vice versa during the appropriate scene while watching the wonderful transfer on the Paramount DVD. This film is part of Polanski called "Apartment Building Trilogy "Which consists of" Repulsion "and" Rosemary's Baby ". Unfortunately," Repulsion "has not yet made the proper DVD transfer in the region 1. Need to say these three movies And create a beautiful boxset
