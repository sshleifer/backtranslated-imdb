I'm glad the user (as of today) who likes this movie is coming. I do not understand people who do not like this movie - it seems that they expect to receive serious treatment (?!?!?)! C'mon How can you take evidence of a snowman killer The filmmakers knew that this was a stupid evidence and they didn't try to deny. Sending the scenes that have to face the truth makes it funny! Yes, there are many times that a low budget shows. (Such as the bomb scene) but I think the expensive look will be taken away from the fun of the movie So if you like B movies and attractions that attract your attention, you will like "Jack Frost".
