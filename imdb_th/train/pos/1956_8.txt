Actually, I think this movie is an example of a goal that is easier than a movie that is not really good. In fact, this film has done very well in many ways and is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Yes, the script is a little complicated. This film has a noir atmosphere that is centered on a bad woman. Like all old noir classics as well, there are movie scripts that twist you around so you never know how to make sense of it at first and may stretch if you think too deeply and try. To Put all the pieces together. That is the type In general, the script has enough surprises to make the audience guess and surprise without abandoning the audience. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is an easy target as well. The truth is that she looks good and she speaks full of dialogue in a way that will make the zhuzh a mysterious, sexy and fun thing. <br /> <br /> The direction is too good to allow it - you. Must have the audience interested in "She or she?" Question two hours In addition to the winding scripts and fun performances of Keystone, this can be done effectively through directions by creating a dark and totally noir atmosphere that is modern at the same time along the industry line with the stone. Sexy curves Always beautiful frames, press to stop anywhere and have something interesting in the eyes. <br /> <br /> This film also creates something that is gimmicky in the first movie effectively. Especially sex. "Katherine Tramell is bisexual ... very shocking!" Received more treatment as is true here, and in general, the sex of the film will be used for better results. It's still shaky. But did not do that for shock and buzz as he had done for the first time I will not say that it is not a mechanism because we see each other better. This movie should be fun. <br /> <br /> And it's a fun movie. It may be an easy goal. But if you look at what it is: noirish, femme-fatale is self-propelled, crooked, sexy, impractical or not, she's a harmless person (no pun intended)
