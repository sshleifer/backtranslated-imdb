When the DVD was released, I went to the market and bought it. And I think my money is the right way as I expected before buying What a wonderful movie I can say for Will Smith. He's always a great actor, whether it's in the movie. He always gives braking performance to record. I think this is a movie after August Rush, which makes people cry while watching. The way the director described the story was really great. His previous life and his new life in the movie have been accurately described with the audience. Although I can't find any errors in the story or the way they shoot it, I think the DVD should be a household because this will be a good thing for your collection. It's not a movie that needs popcorn for entertainment. This is a movie that allows viewers to learn the lesson. Now, what lessons can you see while watching? And I recommend people who are movie critics. Please see this. If you can find reviews about this movie, please talk to me.
