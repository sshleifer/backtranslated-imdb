The booth creates a novelty for your typical J-horror movie. This movie makes you wear the shoes of the protagonist. The director wants you to see what the protagonist sees and thinks. <br /> <br /> Stories about the perceptions of those who work, live and love our protagonists and the way they perceive the people around him in DJs, old-fashioned radio stations The story comes back to the layers of the main characters, such as the onions in the flashback, while the movie follows the path and then we learn that things are not as they see it. Most movies originated in a small, obsolete radio station studio with a very bad history, in which the main character was forced to broadcast his talk show because the radio station was under the search again. It comes from a narrow space that this movie created and makes you feel uncomfortable and paranoid. At the time that our protagonist was unable to determine whether a strange event in the old studio was caused by ghosts or conspiracy of his co-workers, or it happened in his heart What I like about this movie is that the filmmakers make you look through the eyes of the main characters and make you paranoid like the protagonist. This movie is a smart movie that takes a short time of 76 minutes.
