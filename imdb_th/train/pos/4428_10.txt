I disagree with other opinions that are completely related to this movie. Visual effects complement the supernatural theme of the movie and do not deviate from the plot. In addition, I like that this movement is different from Crouching Tiger because this time, the action of the sword is not late. Most characters and you can see <br /> <br /> I think Western audiences are very confused with 2 scenes, one of which is related to the monks who tried to burn their lives and other matters related to the villagers praying. treatment It is the end of the world. Such scenes come from some interpretations of the message in Mahayana Buddhism. (Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China, Korea and Japan) and other scenes related to quirks in the Japanese calendar ... People think that the world will really come to an end ... Gojoe has an action. Story and picture to attract all audiences I strongly believe that with some skilled fixes can be sold in the United States, my only complaint is in the final fight scene. (I can't give anything - sorry)
