These things were floating in my head for almost 10 years. This piece is really memorable - Id love to see another current example of cg showy offy stuff. In fact, I like to be part of it. <Br /> <br /> If I had the opportunity to say what I wanted and then I didn't have to write all of this to "10 lines if the message" as this website wanted I mean really? This makes me discouraged. I mean, good luck for people who make movies that I like Minds Eye - and it takes 3 times to have enough chapters. I hope you don't make me misspell - yup you do
