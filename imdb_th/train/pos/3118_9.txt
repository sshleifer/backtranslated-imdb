I do not hesitate to watch The Bourne Ultimatum a little. <br /> <br /> But it's an exciting experience and I don't have problems that I don't understand. What happened because I didn't see the first two movies? Each part of the story is easy to understand and I fell in love with The Bourne Ultimatum before reaching the time! I do not think I will be able to watch movies that are elaborately created and remarkable, especially action movies. Since I am often shy from action movies and thriller movies, this is good news for me. Ultimatum is one of the most impressive movies. It draws your attention from the first moment to the last minute before releasing. Loan <br /> <br /> Matt Damon is a great person in the role of Jason Bourne. I heard a lot about his great performances in Bourne 1 + 2 and now the top performers. Normalized this is another one to add to his list. I hope to see his movie again in the future. <br /> <br /> The sensational performance has been handled in a stylish way - each movie is made out of a great and I'm shocked by the movie's impression. This story is good.
