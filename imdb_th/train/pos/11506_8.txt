"Kolchak" is a TV drama that does not correspond to any category. Horror, episode one, funny one episode, raising awareness in society and what we have is what I think people are not ready. It's really a shame when I started watching these programs on the Chiller network (I've never seen the original). I know it's really different and interesting. <br /> <br /> Starring Darren Mcgavin as Kolchak, the correspondent of Foreign news agency and Simon Oakland, as the head of Tony Vincenzo, who is angry with him. This program tracks the exploitation of news reporters in Chicago, more often than not. Part of the story by himself as he searched for a windy city to find a creepy day that crashed at night. The basic charm of Macgavin separates the expression from each other. It's a fool who always wears the same suit. You can't help but love him. His jokes are excellent and back and forth between him and Oakland. Unbelieving editors are seriously hilarious. <br /> <br / > Most of the stories are quite good and the performance is very good. The 70s is not a great time. * For special effects and performances that suffer for it. But if you suspend your beliefs, there is a fun series that awaits you.
