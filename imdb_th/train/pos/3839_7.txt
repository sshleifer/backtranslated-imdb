Most people know Paul Verhoeven as a good (and bad) sci-fi film director in Hollywood. But recently he created a thrill in his native land. This is the basic evidence of a bad woman, nothing new or enchanted. Verhoeven thinks that he can make it better by adding sequences of dreams, which instead of defining the main character and his situation just as a means. To push the predictable plot The screenplay is a dialogue that helps to reduce the effects of interesting stories. What makes the movie at least have a great performance. Jereone Krabbe is great as "Tortured artists" and supporters are also good. In addition, the movie of Jan De Bont adds life to the movie, at least helping Verhoeven to look at least capable as a director. <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> * * 1/2 / * * * *
