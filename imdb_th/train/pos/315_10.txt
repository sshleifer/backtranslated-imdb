I absolutely love this soap. It's one of my favorites Would highly recommend :) ... I love Brazilian soap. They handle real life events. I'm really sorry that the soap ends but I'm sure I can find somewhere. For those who have not seen, please try. I love the characters, stories and things that happen in the end for the villains. The only thing I will change is the end of Xica and her long love. I can't wait to see it again and recommend very much. Xica has been by far the best soap I've ever seen. Forget everything :) GO XICA .. Hope you guys like it too.
