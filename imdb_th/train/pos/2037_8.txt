Christopher Smith is an obvious fan, and this is clear in his first horror flick, 'Creep' 'Creeping', although the data is a bit loose. But proved to be worthy of a true classic It is less than the horrors of the United States recently (Amityville Horror remake, House of Wax remake). The dark and gruesome story follows Kate (Franka Potente) through the maze of underground tunnels and abandoned railways. Deserted as she Try and escape from the attack of the killer. Although bad reviews define this movie But I truly believe that with the limited budget and the production of the United Kingdom from director Smith, the first time that 'Creep' truly lives by its name It gives a quick, more bloodless action from the beginning, sometimes too quickly, because the story is patchy in some areas, but with the perfect position and the best character I have seen in the episode. This 'Creep' delivers certain scenes that are certainly a nightmare.
