Pacino's full score in speeches over the dead coffin; Shakespeare's Mark Anthony will be embarrassed !! <br /> <br /> Is it Paul Schrader or is Ken Lipper who should be praised for his incredible conversation?

Interestingly, this film is a movie that focuses on men very much - women are only organs.
