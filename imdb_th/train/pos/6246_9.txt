It's not a great idea to watch Hundstage if you're not sure about 100% mental stability because it will be a severe test for this movie. I must say that Hundstage is an art movie instead of an entertainment movie, so most viewers will not have a "maturity" level to reach the delightful side. Tarkovsky movies are similar but somewhat different. I cannot say that I am very fun to watch it. But it is a very unique and interesting experience for those who are suffering with the old ideas that Hollywood offers only. Hundstage thrusts your finger into your brain and causes your brain to scratch. You can't sit and watch it. You will use exclamation or look with eyes wide open throughout the story. The movie that is similar to this movie is Nachtgestalten But it is much better and less intense For example, this is not for children or those who are gentle or bad. Most viewers should give 10 or 1 to this movie. I give 9 because I have seen many phenomena in one movie in another movie and it is better. But this piece is an outstanding piece by itself. It should be viewed but should be prepared to see something disturbing.
