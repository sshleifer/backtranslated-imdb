The general storyline in the film consists of the main characters who leave behind the chaos of the city and find themselves in the tranquility of nature. In the power of Gangwon Province, we showed two stories of people doing so trying to find themselves through a trip to a popular Korean park in the mountains of Gangwon Province. However, instead of the epiphanal period, we have two characters that travel to nature as another form of escape. <br /> <br /> The pace of this movie is slow and introspective. We learn in the end what truly brings to Gangwon Province and we learn how they connect. For those who want Hollywood's attractiveness and movies to give a clear answer, this movie will not be satisfied. But for those who want movies that make them think suspicious, affecting them many years later, this movie will be even better than that desire.
