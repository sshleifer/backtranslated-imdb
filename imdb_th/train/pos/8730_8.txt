Many Americans will say ... What to show my open comments. Yes, I know that my comparison does not doubt that it is an insult to the fans of Akira Kuroza. But if you analyze this movie, my opinion is correct. We have farmers who go to the city to ask for help from locusts that want to steal the produce from the village. The big difference is how the story is used. Our samurai band is a traditional circus performer that has a very complex mixture of personality. But in the end what the village wants is a hero Please see this amazing movie again (Seven Samurai clearly) and search for another movie that stole the story and try to get the same magic effect from Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece. With Antonio Banderas Michael Crichton copying the story to write his best seller But he didn't find the third foot of the cat
