This is the most scary game I have never played before. It's not the average to shoot everything that moves like fps (which I normally don't care about), but gfx acceptable, interesting weapons and magic, great surround sound. The atmosphere is all incredible. I love Scrye, which allows you in some places in the game to see or hear events that happened there in the past. The only game I have to stop regularly after playing for a few minutes because of the concentration of the atmosphere. I am a great fan, especially the stories and movies of Clive Barker and participating in horror stories like this makes me want a game that focuses on the atmosphere 9/10 (-1 because I'm not a fan of fps and the game may A little short?)
