I used to watch this program when I was young. Although I can't remember much But I must say that it is a very good performance Also, I don't think I've seen it every time. However, if you ask me, it's still a good show. I can't remember the theme song. The costume design is excellent. That show is also the highest level. I just hope that some networks will bring this series back one day so that I can see every episode. Before I sum up this story, I want to say that I will always remember this performance in my memory, even though I don't think I see it every time. Now, in conclusion, when and if this item was brought back on the air, I hope you catch it one day before going out into the air.
