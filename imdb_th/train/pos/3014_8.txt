This amazing survey is an early example of what will soon become a popular movie. I am happy to see William Powell handle the detective story with charm and charm and without the stupid attitude of his character Nick Charles (from the series "The Thin Man") in While the story is good in itself, I think what makes this movie really fun is the direction that Michael Curtiz's amazing imagination from the point of view of this picture is a completely textured movie. Curtiz show command center incredible. Curtis shows that he is one of the best directors in Hollywood. It is highly recommended if you are a fan of this type of movie.
