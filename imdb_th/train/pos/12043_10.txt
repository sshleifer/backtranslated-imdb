... on the TV stage or in the book 'The Woman in Black' is a remarkable ghost story Other reviewers have already said about this movie. But I think I will add a little bit of my review as well. The movie created for the TV was initially deliberately slow in the main character of Arthur while he was operating as a lawyer in London in 1920. I can understand why this is not attractive for everyone. However, for me, I love the English storytelling style, which is similar to the BBC's "Ghost Story for Christmas" adaptation of MR James's great adaptation. She was sent to the provinces by his boss to clean up the business of the deceased client. The relentless third action was created to conclude the spine tingling ... As the Londoner, I saw the play. I own a DVD-R book and have a short audio book on my iPod with the exact things for me 'The Women in Black' in any media is a ghost story that is of little value. It is time for us to launch a legal DVD Region 2.
