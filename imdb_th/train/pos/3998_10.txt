I missed this movie when it came out and discovered that it was as late as last week. Thank you friend's advice. I can honestly say that I cannot remember another friendly drama that is very well done. Writing is sharp, realistic, realistic and uncontrollable. Movies and editing are customized. But was inspired by the visual narrative that can be controlled from close-up photography and excellent photography The performance is also excellent, with all the characters being truly painful and weak in the most interesting form that the movie can offer. They reveal their innermost weaknesses with unprotected raw vulnerabilities. Real victories for Roger Michell and Hanif Kureishi and other teams must see for serious movie lovers.
