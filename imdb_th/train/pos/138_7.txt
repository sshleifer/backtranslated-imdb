I do not understand why other comments are focused on McConaughey. He has never been an interesting movie actor before. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie is writing and wisdom. Alfred Molina and Patrick McGaw created a strange comic pair, not a stock type. Although unable to tell if their characters were well developed But it doesn't make them less funny. <br /> <br /> The version that I see is in HDNET and has subtitles for Spanish conversations. Problem. Using Spanish is more accurate. <br /> < br /> movies with very low scores, judging by members with very low scores that IMDb has given me Huge income at the box Lahore office was much less interesting.
