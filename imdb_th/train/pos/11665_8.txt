I will not know about the film if not being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Film "Oscar". Fortunately, it has passed that I can see this small treasure. <br /> <br /> A story about Brendan, who is the grandson of a formidable abbot and protects the city of Kells. Before the abbot's main occupation was to build a wall to protect Kells from the Viking attacks. One day, a famous illustrator from Iona, found refuge with them. Aiden opened Brendan's eyes to the art of illustration and tempted the outside world. While he tried to recover the ancient crystal that cannot be valued with the art that is meticulously illustrated in books Out today. It is a very tedious thing because the illustrations are created in geometry and design, ignoring the same realism as symbols. The movement of these lines reminds the style of simple animation. But flowing in the beginning sequence of "Kung Fu Panda". However, it is a beautiful color that is the main source of doubt for the audience. The red color used in the Viking invasion sequence is haunted by an unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Try to capture the quiet jewel of this movie. It's a welcome respite from the bombing of current animated films such as "Monsters vs. Aliens" and others like no other. The sparse Celtic music score is effective in stimulating the sense of imagination that makes movies. OK, the subject may be a little shallow and the ending is a bit desirable. I want to know more about the books that Brendan and Aiden are working on. But the clear star of this film is an art style that is clearly amazing. It is said that it is based on the art of the Book of Kells.
