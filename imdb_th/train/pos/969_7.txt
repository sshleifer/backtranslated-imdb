Miike created an adventure movie for children, unlike The Neverending Story. In fact, it was one of the director's least favorite movies. Although the worst Miike is better than many good movies and The Great Yokai War, there are many things that Should be recommended At least loud and terrifying, like a small American flick. I might think that children would like a lot of things (DVDs have English dubbing), but as with all Miike movies, it tends to be very slow. This means that you have strange things that sometimes have a loud action scene and the next scene will drag forever when the characters chat. The story itself is not good as well, and the shortcomings caused by Miike's discontinuity make it look ugly. What I like most is from the technical aspects of things. This must be Miike's most expensive movie, and it looks fantastic. "Yokai" is a Japanese spirit and they come in strange forms and designers. Clothing, special technical teams and others related to the design were very well done. I've seen movies in 1968. This story is based on (Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare) and the monster set of rubber that you can find has transformed into a more reliable agency using modern make-up effects. I like the look of people. One bad (Or girl in this case) Agi that plays dark eye shadow, tight white dress, white hair, honeycomb and whip. She is played by Chiaki Kuriyama, which you may remember as Lucy Liu's teenage teenager in Kill Bill: Vol 1. The hero of this film played by Ryunosuke Kamiki, the voice of Spirited Away of Miyazaki and Howl's Moving Castle.
