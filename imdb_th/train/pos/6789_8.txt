The Legend of Dragoon is one of the lesser known games that people either love or hate. Some people claim that it is similar to other games, too, that is Final Fantasy series - which is understandable because it was originally intended to be a Sony Final Fantasy. Actually, I can't comment on similar things because I Not very familiar with FF games. <br /> <br /> I think my favorite aspect of this game is the battle system. You not only have the ability to transform into a more powerful dragoon style. But every time you attack, you must pay attention to complete the attack by pressing the button at the correct time. Not only that, sometimes the enemy will attack you back in order, which means you have to press buttons to avoid damage. Even using certain attack items requires a little button press. If you don't want to attack, you can always prevent it. But reduce the damage that occurred in half a year But also increasing the level of your life without the need for a cure. <br /> <br /> FMVs are quite good - the quality is close to Final Fantasy 8's. They should be better and better. Translation makes something something is needed. Not only raises questions about the relationship of interesting characters But there are some grammatical errors that should not be allowed to pass. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I think is interesting is that you lose the main character. One dies and the other is generally useless with the feast and leaves. While the death of one character often says that there is no point, it makes you know early that the character while the hero is still the next human being. People who replace the missing characters will get all the statistics, so the transition to the game is quite smooth. Perhaps one of the complaints about my character is the love interest of the main character. She is the best thing of a woman who is helpless that needs pathetic help to the point of pushing the player to shout in frustration. While you can use her at your party, you are weak like crazy - I don't even know what your horse's power is, as I don't like you very much. I've never used her. In contrast to the characters, Rose may be my favorite female character in every game. She is not a ridiculous person, and her magic is very useful. Meru is also strong, while sometimes being an annoying talkative child. <br /> <br /> Character designers often like to make themselves. Women's drama looks beautiful or whatever and doesn't think much. For the true benefit of the set Seriously, without armor and touching most of your skin will not be useful when fighting monsters. But I will give them props because they have women serving as knights in various countries. <br /> <br /> I can't comment much about the story. I have to go I'm not sure if this will say something about my story or game style. <br /> <br /> It's all a very fun game. It has bugs But for me, it's just the right balance to think and press the button and kill the monster.
