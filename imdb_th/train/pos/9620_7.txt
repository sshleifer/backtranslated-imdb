There are many "Hollywood" movies created right now, which not only But tortured to watch But does not affect anyone's life True, movies don't always have a deep meaning. But it is good to know that there are still filmmakers who are interested in telling "human" stories. I will not leave the evidence of this great movie. In my life and I am also a 32 year old movie too! One of the top ten mistakes in my favorites, including: In Waterfront, Sunset Boulevard and Black Narcissus to name just a few "moving" movies, this should become one of your favorite things. If you have a heart!
