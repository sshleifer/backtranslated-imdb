Passport to Pimlico is a game for all British movie fans. Not only is it a fun and entertaining comedy But it was a retrospective film in the past, with a sad attitude and situation, now just a memory of British life. <br /> <br /> Stanley Holloway Which, after an unintended explosion of explosions, discovered the medieval treasures belonging to the Duke of Burgundy of the 14th century, which were buried deep beneath their small suburban streets in the last 600 years. <br /> < br /> Treasure is an ancient law decree signed by the King Edward IV of England (which had not been officially abolished) to indicate that a particular road in London had been declared a Burgandian soil, which means that in the late Pemberton and other local people are no longer British volunteers. But the inhabitants of Burgundy and their small streets, which are independent nations, are in their own right and law. <br /> <br /> This thing requires resi, a brutal and poor war. Well, because they believe that they are outside the law and jurisdiction of the UK, so in opposition to drunkenness, they burn books, rations, destruction and ignoring their clothing coupons, ignoring British laws clearly, etc. United Kingdom <br / > <br /> However, the things that happen are forever, the black market and the dishonest rogue after the suit and cross the 'border' to Burgundy. Better to take refuge from the law and limit the war to avoid their products. And the other half of London's consumers follow them to avoid the divide, creating small, peaceful, peaceful caves, robbers and crowded crowds. <br /> <br /> Attracting attention From Whitehall. They are saying that because of this development is "It is now a matter of foreign policy in which the King's government is not willing to participate" which makes the residents tall and dry. However, they declared a legitimate border area and set up a fully-equipped customs office at the end of the road, mostly for smuggling inspections, to ensure safety for Pimlico residents. <br /> > Finally, the border was closed at the same time, beginning a massive siege with the Bugundian people who slowly ran out of water and food. But there was never a real battle less than in the English style As one of the Bugundian residents "We are English and we are always in English and just because we are in English, we are fighting so hard to be a Bugundians." <br /> <br /> Feelings that reflect around The capital, when other people in London learned about the poverty of Bugundians, they all felt compelled to help them by throwing food and supplies for barbed wire. <br /> <br /> Will Whitehall, who is fighting against, so the attacker may have been brought here for centuries. Finally, the knees of this new foreigner, especially those in English !!!! <br /> <br /> About the great fun and a wonderful time. Not to be missed
