It is one of the better Indian movies I have seen recently, instead of crappy music and dance or slum dog movies. All actors show the right emotions at the right time. It is a highlight of a good movie that makes the audience go back and research the stories that I have examined with Harilal. I certainly enjoy the style of Akshay Khanna's performance deeply and interestingly that he has a complicated relationship with Father Vinod. Khanna's own, though not as amazing as Gandhis and wondering if it helped him write this chapter. I was impressed in the direction and the 2-inch thumb for Anil Kapoor to produce a movie that was level.
