Simon Pegg plays Sidney Young, a new generation of entertainment writers who started their writing career for grass-roots magazines that specialize in obscuring the shallowness and shallowness of rich and famous people. He is doing a career from a famous Lamphun, although he has a strong desire to be a star. This film is based on the strange occupation of Toby Young, a small UK magazine called Modern Review, which gives a nasty comment on all the unexpected things until he closes the magazine with a verbal bullet to his friends. His work - the guardian, and then went to a remarkably failed work as a writer of Vanity Fair, which is part of his life. <br /> <br /> He was excited to work for the first time in a big publication. (Referred to as Sharp Magazine in the movie) and despite the anxiety he was smiling on his first day He met with the editor-in-chief, Clayton Harding. (Played by Jeff Bridges) who is as good as nails But he is the type editor he wants to be a fool like Young to work in magazines He offers a little in the form of the immediate acceptance of Young, but he has something that can be described as a free acceptance of comedy outside the walls of Young and inappropriate behavior. <br /> <br /> Comedy Amused in this movie, mostly due to the misunderstanding of Young or the indifference to the generally accepted public behavior and strange etiquette associated with dealing with people And celebrities, but for reasons of Sidney in the show, a strange and nasty outside an interview that he believes he hates the culture of celebrity, and he seems to believe in the words of old age? 'If you can't beat' em, join 'em ?? And then beat 'em "<br /> <br /> The complicated story is two very different women. There is a charming regular woman in a magazine called Alison Olsen (Kirsten Dunst) which At first, he was shocked by the arrogance and the ways in which Sidney's hypocrisy and model Sophie (Megan Fox), who represented the famous culture, did not need to speak. For Sophie, who has the look of the stars <br /> <br /> Sophie is amazingly beautiful. It's true. But met because there was no single idea that was shaky in her head. Alison was an ordinary woman. Not interesting or interesting But Dunst's acting makes her a real person. The relationship with her will be the whole reality of Britney Spears's marriage. But this movie still maintains certain level of confidence Sidney's pain didn't pursue her. (How do I feel?) <br /> <br /> H ow to Lose Friends and Alienate People have interesting and honest places, satisfying performances and even though it becomes a joke. Your standard romance in the third scene But there are many interesting and interesting characters For example, Danny Huston gave us a great performance in the story of Alison's love and respect for Big Big Lebowski (starring Bridges) with White Russian, who currently plays Absolute and Kahlua. Here in China there is an equivalent cost of about $ 350, but my kitchen has never been there. <br /> <br /> I waited for the day that Simon Pegg would break out a bit because I loved his movie. But I'm not completely sure about his range He plays as a serious character in Hot Fuzz, but only has a relationship with the madness that surrounds him and eventually becomes himself again, which he has in Shaun of the Dead, Run, Fat Boy, Run and now how to lose friends He is a rising star. It will be interesting to see what he can do again.
