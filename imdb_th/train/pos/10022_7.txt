Aro Tolbukhin burned seven people on a mission in Guatemala in the 70s. In addition, he announced that he had killed 16 people (he had killed a pregnant woman, then he put it on fire) <br /> <br /> This film is a documentary that shows Aro's personality through several interviews. People who know him and in some scenes that actors are based on real facts. <br /> <br /> "Aro Tolbukhin" is a serious task, so analysis is not a distortion. This terrifying testimony about childhood injuries that can turn humans into monsters. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
