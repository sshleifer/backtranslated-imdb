I have seen this movie by luck because I am going through a period in which I have received new discoveries for Bill Pullman and want to watch all his latest movies and thank God I do! This movie stuck with me ever since and remains one of my favorites! The story revolves around two girls who start an amazing journey abroad, where they learn the true meaning of freedom. <br /> <br /> Alice and Darlene are trying to spend the day. Stop together But their journey ended with more complicated stories The struggles they face as they are arrested in Thailand and become very active and violent prisoners. The performance is excellent. The images are not extraordinary. The soundtrack is great and is suitable for movies and messages that are delivered. Absolutely powerful. In fact, I can't find the right words to explain that this movie made me feel Every time you see I know that some people do not appreciate as much as I have in movie ratings. But I swear that you have to watch !!! I promise to stick with you!
