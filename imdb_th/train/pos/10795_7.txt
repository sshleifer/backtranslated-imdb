Overall, this film is quite good, as well as good action scenes, with explosions and enough fighting scenes. But Chuck Norris did almost everything except bombing and shooting a few characters. This film is similar to the events of September 11, with a terrorist-like trash, sending videos to President (Urich) and threatening to cause an explosion. Jusson Mills has an excellent action role, taking Rashid's role and various player roles, but lacking Chuck Norris Judson to take over most of the action, leaving Joshua (chuck) with Que on her computer But overall it's like real and not lacking action But do only in your part, Norris I gave this movie 7/10
