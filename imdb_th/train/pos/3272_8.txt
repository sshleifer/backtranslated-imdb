Came from the same director who used to play "Candyman" and "Immortal Beloved". I was not surprised that it was a good movie. But it must be one of the best movies in the late 80s - partly because that was the worst moment in the past decade (Not talking about "cinema" in Iran or Sweden here ...) The performance is not great but stable - which is different from what some people claim here. (They must dream that "Amazing acting" like Anna.) An interesting fantasy story that doesn't end in a clever way that connects all loose ends together neatly. These unanswered questions may be left with the aim of allowing them to be based on individual interpretations and nothing wrong with such topics. "Pepperhaus" is a combination of movies and horror stories for children using Sound and music effectively I like the fact that the main character is not your clich√© movie that is a shy person who is shy. But a great social secret But being a normal child, very refreshing. I'm sick and tired of writers who portray childhood that is not suitable for themselves in their books and on the screen as if someone is interested anymore to watch or read about children. Another lonely childhood, as if it were like that. The background of the character monopoly in good potential The scene with Anna and the boys "snogging" (rather stretching) rather makes sense of disgust and fun that is vague - because she thinks she should be only 11 years old, but can guess that Burke is 13 years old or 14 When this was filmed I do not know why they do not upgrade the character's age or get a younger actor. Obviously, Burke is not a child. Why does the director make the children older than what they play? So dilute the realism. I will never know.
