This is a good job. Sexy and engaging enough to keep me interested Its main drawback is that it seems that it was made for TV: full screen and even though there are many sex scenes, there are no nudity. (But the boys came near!) Strange as well, because Netflix shows that it has been rated R. <br /> <br /> Still, it's very good and I hope Alicia Silverstone will create. More movies like this <br /> <br /> One Netflix reviewer is part of the series. But I can't find the series that is possible But I want to know because this movie is very good. <br /> <br /> Walt D in LV 2005/08/23
