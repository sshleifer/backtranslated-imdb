New York, I Love You is a collection of eleven short films, each of which has a length of about 10 minutes. Shorts are not absolutely relevant. But all of them have something in common that is love Everything is about finding love, whether it's about a couple or just a couple of people who talk a few things. This movie is starring Shia LaBeouf, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Orlando Bloom, Chris Cooper, Andy. Garcia, Christina Ricci, Irrfan Khan, Robin Wright Penn, Julie Christie, Ethan Hawke, Bradley Cooper, Rachel Bilson and Anton Yelchin. With stellar actors and interesting places, I expect great movies; The problem is New York. I love you. Don't increase. It is still the sum of parts. Some groups are original and interesting. But some groups have no meaning (Orlando Bloom / Christina Richie and the Ethan Hawk / Maggie Q group) This horrible movie is definitely uncertain and has a very experimental tone. It's a wise story, it seems that there are some things that movie students can gather together. Having said that, this movie has a good time as well, which is one of the best parts of a couple played by Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman. They walk in Brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary and it It was a time like this that made me an audience, hoping that this film would be more consistent because there were many potentials here. But when I was dissatisfied when the overall story ended for me, the movie and soundtrack helped everything. The editing is perfect, the way to shoot movies is very impressive and the soundtrack is intangible. In the end, New York, I love you, it feels like a movie, and most of the experience is high and low. It's the way people look at movies as a whole to determine whether they enjoy it or not. It may be worthwhile for some people and wasting time for others. <br /> <br /> 7/10
