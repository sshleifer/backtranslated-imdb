The Secret of Kells is one of the most unique, beautiful and remarkable animated movies I've ever seen. Before watching this movie, I was convinced that there was nothing to give up for money and it was a win in this category, but I found that Kells was a serious fighter. <br /> <br /> The secret of Kells tells The story of an orphan named Brendan who lives with his uncle, the abbot of Kell. The abbot is the beloved guardian. But may be too rigid and involves adding a wall around the city from the attack by the Vikings more than he is nourishing the imagination of children When the legendary brother of Aidan (Which looks like Willie Nelson) appears and takes the boy under his wing. Brendan travels to the forest and meets a lovely wild nymph named Eisenling who likes him. (And save his life More than once). With the help of Aisling, he tries to save the city and helps Brother Aidan to write a mysterious book in which the legend can be turned into light. <br /> <br /> See my full review of The Secret of Kells.
