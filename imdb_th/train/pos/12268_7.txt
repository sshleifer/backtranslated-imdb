Seven young people go to the forest to find bears. They all stagger and brutally murdered by the raging Vietnamese veterans. "Trampa Infernal" is a fun Mexican movie and reminds me of "The Zero Boys" quickly. And there are some good death scenes such as the neck, slit or neck ax. Unfortunately, there are not many wounds, so the fans of Grand-Kongyol will be disappointed. However, if you are a movie fan The Mexican horror flick is rather vague (I only see "Alucarda" and "Don't Panic"), so this should be another reason to watch this fun slasher. My rating: 7 out of 10 Recommended Highly
