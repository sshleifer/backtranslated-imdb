Spacecamp is one of the movies that kids like and mothers and dads can enjoy. Growing up in the 80s that I like this movie, it's a plot and every actor. I just bought this movie on DVD, so when I have my own children, they can enjoy watching this movie a lot. The plot is fun. A group of children begin their journey that they had never expected before when they were rocked into space by an overpowering robot. At first they were in auh, but when they realized that they didn't have enough oxygen to make it go back in panic when they recovered enough oxygen from the space station.
