Robot Jox does not suffer from stories or bad effects. I mean, this is 1990. If you know what I'm talking about, RoboCop 2 still uses stop animation because most movies do throughout the 1980s. If you look at the greatest blockbuster during this time, they Most of the things that can be done with special effects are provided at the time. It was not until Terminator 2: The Day of Judgment was released the following year in which technological advancements were made and the storyteller began to use that motivation. But you will have a fond memory of Transformers, Gundam Wing or Power Rangers. If you watch this movie The enemy robots are very scary. It makes you don't want to confront a man without a really good backup plan. And there are some great moments in this film. The traitor / spy is working in the midst of them. The person you think is on your side, backing you all the way, may be someone you don't expect him / her to be and it's very difficult to think so. Do you disagree?
