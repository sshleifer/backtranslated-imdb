A very funny east-west movie that was influenced by GM's Flint, Michigan plant shutdown in the eighth decade and the rise and consolidation of Japanese car makers in the United States. Located in western Pennsylvania, there are great performances from Michael Keaton, Gedde Watanabe and George Wendt. Music from the legendary Blues Stevie Ray Vaughan.
