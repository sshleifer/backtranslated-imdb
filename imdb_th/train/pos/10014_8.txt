The night listeners paid attention to Robin Williams, shining as a radio presenter in New York City that attracted his friendship with a 14-year-old boy (Rory Kalkin) who was very ill. Williams never met this boy because they had just contacted by talking on the phone. However, Williams' ex-boyfriend (A good job from Bobby Cannavell) caused doubts about this boy, which prompted Williams to arrange an appointment with him on his own. The following had a permanent impact on Williams in the way he had not expected. I'll leave it like that. Toni Collette is a star. <br /> <br /> I enjoy this movie. Toni Collette gives a memorable picture of Culkin's adoptive mother. Listener was inspired by the actual events and it had almost horrible silence. Sometimes it can be predicted, not thanks to some reviews that I read before watching movies and because of reasons. But i like it anyway I enjoy the role of Williams in this role more than his comedy character, so it is an additional bonus for me. Recommended 8/10.
