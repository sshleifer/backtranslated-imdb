Previously I had seen two pictures of him, so I agreed with Altman. Even though I had previously identified his "boring" movie style, you must be in the right mind to admire his crazy talent. <br /> <br /> "HealtH" is too low. And not very reliable In fact, I don't think it will be released to the VHS. Why is that? When these crappy movies get DVDs published every day, this movie is left without any good reason? Actually, I have no problem with this movie. It is fun and funny constantly. Almost every scene has a mysterious interest, for whatever reason, whether it is a wonderful conversation or a delicate performance. There is real skill here. <br /> <br /> And Paul Dooley's limit at the bottom of the pool halfway through is an interesting thing. <br /> <br /> If you can make a gem. Not perfect But it's better than most sludge that comes out on DVD Hell, I'm happy with the good VHS copy of this thing. <br /> <br /> It's usually in the Fox Movie Channel, so be careful.
