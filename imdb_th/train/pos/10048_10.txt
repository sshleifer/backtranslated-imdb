Every time the conversation changes "Favorite movie" I will talk about the Titanic and at least two people will speak. I didn't pay for them because I knew that five years ago, these people were very impressed with that movie. And they were too shy to accept. <br /> <br /> I just watched the Titanic for the first time in a long time. Expecting to enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that this film had no power at all in the last five years. I cried again .... in all the same places It made me go back in 1997 when I remember the movie that no one thought would break even though it became the most popular movie of all time. Movies that spread to public consciousness, unlike other movies I remember (Yes, more than Star Wars) and today, many people won't accept that they enjoy it. People come to match - you don't look good when you badmouth this movie. You look like a humble person. <br /> <br /> There is no perfect movie and this story has a slight error. Some conversations are smooth and some of the issues surrounding the two lovers are too elaborate. However, there is nothing that can be distracting that it will damage the film. <br /> <br /> Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are great. Leo is one of the best actors in his generation. Wait until you see him in the Gangs of New York before you call him nothing more than a cute boy. Kate Winslet is very strong in this movie. This movie is really yours and she holds it beautifully. <br /> <br /> James Cameron manages what many believe is impossible by creating a credible Titanic. complete The sinking scene is horrible like last night. Everyone can say that the bad effects are above me. I was permanently pinned. <br /> <br /> This movie is another memorable scene. The Titanic left the port in Southampton. Rose and Jack at the boat head "are flying" "Iceberg, right?" The screw hanging from the ocean is incredible. The screams of the disaster after she went down And the ending that made even the most famous man in the theater shed tears. <br /> <br /> The music that is the victim of the movie's success is an important element. James Horner's score is perfect. And the love theme is beautiful and sad. Pop version of the terrible Celine Dion must destroy this great song. <br /> <br /> I confess that I am a Titanic movie. For this reason I had the opportunity to see the boat while we had never seen it - in all its beauty. Maybe watching it might affect me more than some people because I have an interest in the boat all my life. However, I wonder how many people I see cry as a Titanic fan. I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that has never diminished the tragedy. This movie is made with humanity. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers say it's better than I ever did: open your heart to the Titanic and you won't be disappointed.
