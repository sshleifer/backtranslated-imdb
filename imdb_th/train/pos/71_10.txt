I don't want to believe in comments about movies. <br /> <br /> When I read scary comments about movies, I wonder if you actually watched the same movie that I really do. > <br What I watched is incredible! I think the actress and director have done a great job in the movie. <br /> <br /> I have never been happy to see any actress before. I must say that it is the most convincing movie I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> What I don't see is why everyone has a problem with choosing the drug of Dinah in Trying to commit suicide from the comments that make you listen. It looks like it's an actor's choice and her stupid choice. I do not understand. It is a movie written by others and directed by others, so it is the mistake of an actress that I can not see. I think it is a truly believable movie that I will see again and recommend. The comment is what is and it's too bad that there is a lot in mind. I hope to see any actors soon. I think everyone has a great role. <br /> <br /> Busy Philipps will be the highest-earning actress in one day and I hope. That she will laugh on everyone's face that criticizes her! You go girl!
