Different from many other movies which disturbed by their dissatisfaction, naked (dog biting people) or their true violence (most Peckinpah movies), helping to recover with absolute credibility, buggery scenes Quite frankly in dissatisfaction But the impact of this film is caused by the slow accumulation and the remarkable feeling of separation between the four people, both before and after. Everything starts wrong. During the time that the canoes passed under the children on the bridge, which did not accept even those who had previously played music as before, is a symbol of human love for them. The tensions will continue to increase throughout the journey, and canoeing continues, even in the final credit-ending, to make the character of the character's test horrible. This movie has been a great help from the leader's play, especially Ned Betty and Jon Voight, as a victim and unwilling hero, respectively. Burt Reynolds also I have never been better than this. The cultural influence of this film is demonstrated by the number of people who understand the reference to 'Banjo territory' - perhaps just Get Carter only makes an effective ax mission in the region's tourism industry. I thought of a few movies that made me severely depressed after they finished - the pressure atmosphere of Se7en is the best comparison I can imagine. Although it is great in itself But liberation is classic, above all, because there is no sufficient comparison point with it - it's unique.
