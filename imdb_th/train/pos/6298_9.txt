Good fun. I went with 8 friends to see an example of this movie. We look different. But after 10 minutes, I wondered how I got myself at this time. The jokes became funny and they were still funny throughout the movie. In the first part, you just ask yourself about 'malinski' and 'bellini' (there are many examples of this jargon) and because they repeatedly joke in search of this malinski, all the main characters will be brought. Used as the first, even less than the next Until half of the movie ended, we didn't even know the name of this film because there was no open credit and we watched this sneak peek. But we are sure that there are good times. The house is loaded (about 250 people) and I think half of them don't like it and the other half loves movies. If you like strange funny movies with wonderful conversations, you will love it. In addition to Clooney, this movie deserves better than 5.6 IMDB. The rate that is available when I write this, but when more ppl see, I'm sure it. Going up 7.0, there is a reason I guess I will give 8 out of 10 (10 out of 10 after a few beers) <br /> <br />
