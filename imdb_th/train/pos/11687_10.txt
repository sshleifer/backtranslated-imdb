My favorite Chris Rock is different according to my movie. I hate him after Lethal Weapon 4. But I hate everyone in that movie. After that, I like him when he is himself and does not hold back Like in Dogma, this is his best. But did not expect that this would be a good thing, laughing all the time. Chris Rock presented a wonderful story that was supported by the funniest comedies I had seen sometimes. .
