Divorce Tour! Ok, boy who plays Oliver is a very cute person! Start with the best movies, colors, costumes and the most impressive performances. This is a must see. I have seen many adaptations of this great novel. But this one stands above all of them and is a stage play that needs to be booted! It's an expert. Fagan never let his characters do music. You never know if you like him or not, the same feeling I received in this book. In another version, you hate him from the beginning to the end. Bill Sykes .... When you read this book, it has an average value and so he is in this movie. Oliver Reed is brilliant. His wife directed this masterpiece. I went to see his last movie, Gladiator, following his many good performances. The music is suitable for time and emotions. Who will buy this beautiful movie, you should!
