I am a big fan of the series as a child, and after that, it has always remained in my heart as one of the memorable cartoons that made a difference in the early 80s compared to the previous animated series. (Heidi, Barbapapa 'Saving ... which I mostly love) I found that other similar Japanese cartoons released later could not match Mazinger Z because they started to reproduce in the same format. <br /> <br /> That novelty may be one of the best features of Mazinger Z. Another advantage of it is its ability to create extravagant monsters. Many strange devices and strange characters In fact, we are eager to see each new sector to find out whether a new demon or evil machine is waiting for us!
