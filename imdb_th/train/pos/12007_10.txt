This is one of the movies about spirits I've seen. I headed to Saint George, about 150 people, and we saw this movie in the center of the visit of St. George Temple. In addition, there are people who are not religious and resist some Mormons in the audience who feel the spirit of the movie and get a touch of lovely songs and affirmations, stories, pioneering stories and difficulties that They face because of faith. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie for everyone who wants to understand more about Joseph and the difficulties that pioneers have to pass. In the end, it was different from American history.
