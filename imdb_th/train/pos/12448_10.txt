before; I am a big fan of Modesty and have read comics since I was a child and I found a movie earlier about our heroine who is not happy. But they failed this ROCKS! <br /> <br /> Okay, let's go: Ms Blaise worked for a casino, a gang of robbers, and she started gambling for her friend's life. If the robber wins one round, she must tell him about himself. If she wins twice in a row, one employee will be free. (Sounds stupid, yes, I am not good at explaining anything ..);) <br /> <br /> She told him about growing up in the war zone without parents or male friends. Old in the refugee camp and the way they escape, live according to the laws of nature. They find food and he teaches her to read and fight. When they approach civilization, they are at war, and when they are rebel, they are shot and the old man dies, causing her to meet the city. <br /> <br /> Then she met a man. The person at the casino, now she is working and the story ends Polite and witty as polite. <br /> <br /> Feeling awkward. But when he heard enough, he spoke with a slightly broken accent, speaking out loud, but of course there was some accent. (Not to mention that it is strange that everyone speaks English in the Balkans ..) <br /> <br /> The performance is really good. Even the young, blessed boy Blaz must applaud! <br /> <br /> The part that I like must be where she ripped her dress in order to kick the foolish robber! Great! : D I can't wait until the real adventure begins in the next movie. <br /> <br /> Watch it. You won't be disappointed!
