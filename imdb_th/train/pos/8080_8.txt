I use it after a moment to read reviews about these movies that do not reflect my experience at all. For me, Amitabh is better than some of his most famous films. He is a brutal villain without penalty. For me it was a fresh air that saw him in the role that his villains were not undercut in some way. <br /> <br /> Aryan boy may be above his head with this actor. I think maybe the director would be able to do better. But the truth is that the best part of this movie is Shernaz Patel. She is an uninvited heroine who is a true veteran with too many qualities for every role she offers. But I must say that I am very grateful for her contribution when she plays Virendra Sahi's wife. But she did everything with confidence I'm sure that she goes straight to the head of most viewers. <br /> <br /> So if you have a habit of sitting for the average Bollywood, you won't get much from this movie. But if you constantly search for something, this may cause you to get something missing
