But this is a great martial arts movie. Liu Chia Liang is second to none. As a fighting designer, only Sammo Hung is the best match. This is an instant clarity from the display of his proud technique - instead of a flashy camera angle, etc. - during the fight. That direction is tightly controlled. But motivate the audience with speed and movement only But also makes her intrigued by the precise skills shown This film also benefited from Liu's involvement in front of the camera. Liu's performance in the party scene in which the film opens is one of the highest points in Kung Fu movie history. Liu is supported by the beautiful and talented Hui Ying Hung (from My Young Auntie fame) and 'Hsiao Hou', which has amazing acrobatics and is suitable for many outline projects. But with the development of characters and morals along the way and the most appropriate solutions Humor in this story is also the best. If you watch a kung fu movie only once, this will be a good option - it has everything.
