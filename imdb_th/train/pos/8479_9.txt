Watching the children many times as a child was an experience 15 years ago and now I have found it again. If there is a risk, will show excellent lessons about morality and life for families with young children. While it was still an adult, I was lucky to learn from it many years ago. Trying to find it today is hard enough. ..But believe me it's worth it, regardless of age. Anime fans, in particular, will find this to be a great item for Masami Hata's film work Impressive artwork and unique design "Chirin No Suzu" represents a rewarding experience. While some lyrical songs are not very hot when recorded in English But even the voice acting is still better than the release today. Unfortunately, it was printed in the mid-1980s from the Columbia RCA home video and was not published in any new format with my knowledge, at least in the United States. Looks hard for it and you will be very satisfied! It is an important place that is rich in art, fun and important in Japanese animation.
