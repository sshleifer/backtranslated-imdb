I don't want to comment on how good this movie is or what defects are because I'm not a professional film critic and I don't have enough knowledge to make movies. What I know is that creating this type of movie in your first match is a great success and I congratulate the director. However, in some of the criticisms I have read, critics have complained that Hiralal's relationship with his brothers is not emphasized and that his brothers have been removed from the whole story. Now I want to raise the point here, as the movie name suggests, not a movie about Hiralal's brothers. It's a movie about the relationship of Mahatma Gandhi and his son Hiralal Gandhi. Nothing more than this. If we start complaining about some characters that are not acting in the movie, it would be unfair because these characters do not match the image, no matter how they relate in real life. So I think it would be better if we stick to the idea and stop responding to the critics in ourselves. <br /> <br /> Have fun !!!!
