While I love movies, haunted houses such as Amityville and Poltergeist, this was done for the TV adaptation of the Susan Hills book that is filled with Hollywood horror. <br /> <br /> Excellent performers, Heartbeat and other TV dramas) Excellent performances and wonderful settings (Which shows the life of the 1920s reliably). It has the perfect combination that will attract the audience into the powerful ghost story. <br /> <br /> Herbert Wise doesn't want blood, violence or blood to Send the cold to the spine of the audience. The girl in black uses your imagination as a form of fear and fear and her appearance will not disappear when she first appears. <br /> <br /> The main character, Arthur Kidd, is a lawyer. Learn about his invisible demon. In his mission to manage real estate The widow died and Arthur spent a few nights in a boring house where he noticed many strange things that could haunt him for many days. Some scenes are unstable and uncomfortable, especially the lock room that opens itself, which turns off the generator and closes Arthur in the dark. This film is even more painful for you when you wear Arthur's shoes and his efforts to shake off this ghost. The author put many interesting things into the story, for example, the appearance of a tin soldier. One is eager to learn all its meanings. The fact that we have never learned about a widow, let the imagination and make it more insecure. <br /> <br /> Most widows look terrible and scary. The scene after the winding generator sent the chill to me, a woman who appeared from anywhere in a crowded land with great wind? When living with such features by myself, I can appreciate this separation method. And the scene in the hotel may be the most horrible thing I have ever seen. I do not want to watch or hurry. I woke up at night, often thinking that she was behind me in sleep. <br /> <br /> Women in black are great TV movies and are missing gems. I agree with internet advertising for this movie too much and can see why people are disappointed after spending the best 50 pounds, but I think the internet has lost a hidden gem because it makes this kind of movie. . I think it's still wonderful and doing wonders, and I think it's the greatest ghost story of the last century.
