This is one of the few things that I can watch often and laugh out loud. In another place, I have read complaints about racism and sexual discrimination from moral and politically correct prigs. There is no place here unless you define women as housewives and peoples as families that use colored housewives. <br /> <br /> That line is hilarious and every leading actor is never better than Melvin Douglas. Especially good. <br /> <br /> If you have ever thought or tried to build a new house, you will be relieved to know that no matter how much the process is angry. Wolf, you may feel that you are not alone!
