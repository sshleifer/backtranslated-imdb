This film is a good example of good storytelling. The performance was excellent. The story is inspiring without excessive manipulation or being fake. There are a few points that they may make people better or worse than them. But considering that it is a Hollywood movie, they show remarkable restraint. There was no single explosion that appeared in the movie, even though they had only one chance. The movie, while there is no doubt that has become an action movie The story is therefore created to focus on ordinary people at normal times, unfortunately. Well done!
