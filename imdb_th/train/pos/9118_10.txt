I watched this movie and selected Owen Alik Shahadah's special work. It was very interesting from this man. Now he is probably the world's most important independent African filmmaker. And I'm not talking about the creators of the black film I'm talking about, the filmmakers who are rooted in culture. The idea that anything testifies to the diversity and range of African themes and movies. 500 years later, it's an African issue. But the idea does not fit the mold Showing diversity in art This movie is all African actors. But this topic is the topic of human beings that most of us can relate to I love a little humor in it and Kora of Tunde Jegede is great. It's a modern jewel.
