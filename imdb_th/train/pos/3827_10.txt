I don't know what other reviewers are saying - this is a great movie and creates a sense of age that feels like traveling time. The character is really soft. Mary is a strong pair of Byron Clare, a child and annoying. Paulie Polidori is a disdainful, insulting person ... everyone is beautiful, curious and degraded .. Not Gothic scary remains <br /> <br /> Gothic works as a piece of independent shock movies and I love it for different reasons. But this thing works like a film. Merchant and ivory, and from my reading, capturing the best of things. Summer must feel like a romance. Yes, but rekindles my attention in the life of Shelley and Byron every time I think about this movie. One of my all time favorites
