In Mexico City, the former CIA murderer and now a decadent alcoholic man, John Creasy (Denzel Washington), was hired by industrialist Samuel Ramos by the advice of former friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken ) To be the bodyguard of His youngest daughter, Pita (Dakota Fanning) and Lisa (Radha Mitchell), his wife Pita, changed the behavior of the cold Creasy, causing him to live and smile again and he felt very much in love with her. When the girl was kidnapped and Creasy was informed that she had been killed by a villain, he vowed to kill each person responsible for the kidnapping of "Man on Fire" almost as a masterpiece and would become a masterpiece. Future classics The story is wonderful, not repeated, and even though it takes 146 minutes, the audience doesn't feel that time has passed. The actors consist of great actors and actresses. Their performances stand out, focusing on Denzel, Washington, Dakota Fanning and Radha Mitchell. The movie has a great time and the screenplay has an amazing line. I like when the character of Christopher Walken explains to Manzano (Giancarlo Giannini) that Creasey's special character is death and that he is preparing his masterpiece. I agree with the user who commented that "Man on Fire" is one of the best movies if not the best movie of the year in this category. My rating is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Chamas da Vingan√ßa" ("Flames of the Revenge")
