Another funny movie about a brave little country struggling through the modern world forest. (For forty years old) A world that is wise and withdrawn to guide them. This is a good list of cannons. Ealing Terry-Thomas shone as usual as the leader of a manless man. To the disaster when the country that he should start attracting the attention of the world, Ian Bannan is a very romantic leader. One of his quieter performances as a corrupt politician and John Le Mesmeria, the brilliant leader of the revolutionary party. There are lots of fun especially for the audience. Maybe not in the top of the classic Ealing, but rather high.
