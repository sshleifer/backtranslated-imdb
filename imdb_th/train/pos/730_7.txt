I like this movie. I remember there was a scene that did very well in this movie that Riff Randell (played by PJ Soles) was lying in a pot smoking a cigarette on her bed and she began to see images of Ramones In the room with her singing "I want you to be close." ... something very cool. <br /> <br /> It's fun, lively, strange and cool. Yes, I will admit that the ending is the way to the top and far away ... but it doesn't matter because it's fun. This is a very fun movie. It's Sex, Pot and Rock n Forever Rocll <br /> I read that Cheap Trick is a band that Originally a star in this story But I don't know if it's true or not
