If the answer to this question is yes, you should enjoy this great movie. I just saw it a few hours before here in Paris. (Where the action of the movie happened) and I still feel the big injury that I received in my eyes ... What a shocking thing! I have never seen beautiful black and white photographs and dramatic changes in the way of making cartoon movies. I strongly believe that before and after "Renaissance", which is similar to what we see with Pixar's movies or Akira's experiences GhostInTheShell This is a real progress in the small world of animated movies and I hope this French project. (Small French studio unknown to a few young people with a dream named "Renaissance" ...) will be successful Vive la France!
