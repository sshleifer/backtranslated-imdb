This movie (With the alternate name "Martial Law 3" for some reason) introduced me to Jeff Wincott for the first time and it was a great introduction. Although I have never heard him before But he seems to be a great fighter Action scenes in this movie are great! There are many people as well. The battle for recruitment at the Peacekeepers headquarters is very good. There is just something about the only man who hit the shit out of a group of people who really enjoyed And for the rest of the actors: Brigitte Nielsen is a good choice for the villain. This role is suitable for you. (But others can't.) Matthias Hughes works as well. He is a great fighter and has a character like a man and is a good rival for Wincott in this movie.
