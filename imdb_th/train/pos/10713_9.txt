The angry boy who lost his parents sadly was cared for by his grandfather. They helped to find common common points in folklore in Gaelic language that was passed orally from generation to generation of islanders. Although tragic episodes, such as mountain clearances, have features in the story. But with a lot of humor and fun in them It's all filmed in the sky, so there is a double beauty. The mountain scenery is amazing and is a rare opportunity to hear Scottish Gaelic speech. I am a British person, so I have to read the subtitles. But the Gaelic speech is great The performance is just what you expect from those who are not carefully selected actors - in other words, you're watching what actually happens - people who care deeply about folk tales and history. The Gaelic community, especially in Sky, worked countless miracles to create this film. Everyone who has the least interest in Gaelic, folk history, folk music, oral culture, Scotland, English history, many cultures or social justice should go to see this movie.
