My long-time love for Lucianna Paluzzi, an Italian actress who helped to improve my youth with her performance in May Fri 1965 "Thunderball" took me to a rather strange place. In this case the British curiosity point from 1959 "Carlton-Brown of F.O." Which features Lucianna in one of her previous roles. She plays the princess in this picture, although the picture shows Terry-Thomas and Peter Zeller's abilities, which both of them have certainly increased. In this cute and funny movie, we often learn about the people who are like the island of Madeira of Gaillardia, which had been a British colony until 1916, and then was forgotten around the world. However, forty-three years later, it became the center of global attention and international intelligence when discovering valuable cobalt sources and Her Majesty's Queen. The Queen sent Carlton-Brown's international office. Terry-Thomas performed this role as well, as did the seller in his role as Prime Minister of the small country Amphibulos. The second film of the seller, 1959, about a small country match with the world and another story is "Of course, I roared") Ian Bannen almost stole the performance here as the gentle king of Gaillardia and my daughter Lucianna was as interesting as having her secondary role. This film exhibits a very dry sense of humor, although there are some laughs that will have (Reception at Gaillardian airport, for example, and especially at the Gaillardian style parade in May) and the stubborn prime minister who sold his English with cracks and sweat stains that seem to stop Another memorable character in this great pantheon of actors. Even if there are times or two that can not speak gibberish on English lips But I found that this image is a modest and well presented entertainment on a clear Bay Anchor DVD.
