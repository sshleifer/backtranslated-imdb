This is a great movie and is a treasure trove that we can only watch through sporadic screenings because it is not available in videos / DVDs. He left (Although there are many things going on in the meantime, and they are not alone in this time period) giving the feeling of closing and feeling That's all right with the world. If you have the opportunity to watch this movie, try it. I can't wait to see it again and hopefully it will be marketed in general.
