Many years ago I checked this classic, I decided to go back to investigate more in depth. But first, some internal notes from film critics. <br /> <br /> This movie series is one of them. I grew up with it, making my childhood happy, making it scary, miss this thing today that we don't see very clearly as we go back today.> <br /> Talespin or Luftens Helte Called in Denmark, it is a wonderful animated series. It's like Chip and Dale Ducktales and a lot of old stuff, so it has a strange feeling around me. Remember this series as much as I want to remember. <br /> <br /> But in my opinion, it's great. It comes with some text. Old things to be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Now I don't want to listen to old or anything. But I felt like leaving my hand with these cartoons. Today we see something like Ed E dd and Eddy or something strange like that. We have new or almost all new programs like Hannah Montana or something like that But I feel like we don't have the same spirit in the cartoon or the actual performance as we did on the first day. <br /> <br /> Now I may be wrong. But I felt like the time had changed a lot to conclude that I would be excited to see these series, such as Talespin being released again on the TV screen instead of something new. One night, my childhood cartoons were returned to the children that I had one day for them again ...
