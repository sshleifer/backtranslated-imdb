My rating means SG-1 4 Stargate's first season that is fresh, creative and fascinating. When the actor walks through the door, you never know what is happening on the other side! Starting from Season 5, the show starts with different interests - still good, but different. <br /> <br /> The series follows the adventures of the human team. "Stargate" The backstory of the series depends on the characters and events of the movie "Stargate", which the device was discovered during archaeological excavations in Egypt. < br /> <br /> The episodes are light (Naive and easy to see) and very creative Many creative stories can easily make a great sci-fi movie. The next thing that is not always predictable Their tone is serious. But the dialogue has incredible flair and humor They enjoy watching. <br /> <br /> Start somewhere in the season 5 series. Develop as a continuation story by fighting with one enemy (Goa'uld, the the Ori). Said more complicated (Emphasis on politics / strategy) and interdependence The characters remain excellent as before. But the performance varies naturally They showed creativity and humor that brought the series throughout 10 seasons. <br /> <br /> If you are a sci-fi fan, watch the episodes of the first 4 seasons and You may be attracted If you like the development of the story between the two sides, you have 10 seasons of performances to look forward to.
