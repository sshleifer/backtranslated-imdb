I have to watch this movie in preview and be amazed with it. It's not a typical romantic comedy. I can't remember laughing heavily in the movie. But was impressed Laughter doesn't come here - they're observing laughter. "Oh my God, I think I'm the only one who feels that way!" "A man falls in love with his brother's girlfriend." The whole family has a role in the relationship here. May be the best combination of laughter and warmth since "As you fall asleep" <br /> <br /> Steve Carell is deeper than he has ever been and is the first time I really like him. The actor is a drama actor with experiences that I like in other roles. But they blend to create a trustworthy family. Dianne Wiest is as cute as her mother, Juliette Binoche. (Who knew she was a joke?) And even the scornful Dane Cook gave a warm performance. The soundtrack of Sondre Lerche is great and I will buy the second CD that is provided. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this song.
