If you can't enjoy the chicks, stop immediately. However, if you enjoy movies that display complex characters and give special performances, read more. <br /> <br /> Ann Grant Lord is dying, her two daughters arrive at her bed. Ann started talking about her past people who didn't know her daughter, and they asked if these lost acquaintances were real or imagined. They realize that these people from the mother's past are true. <br /> <br /> The story changes generally during the year. Fri 1953 and about 2000, with a slight twinkling of Ann's life during those years. It was in 1953 that Ann met her love of life and experienced the greatest tragedy in life. <br /> <br /> One of the two best friends from Ann Lila from college is Lila is getting married. Another best friend of Ann is the brother of Lila Buddy. Lila and Buddy are children of the wealthy Newport family, while Ann is a cabaret singer living in Greenwich Village who wants to be free. But still being bound by many 1950s conventions <br /> <br /> Ann came to be a maid to honor Lila's wedding. She found someone who would become the main character in the lives of the three - Hare. Ris is an adult son of a former servant of a family who grew up with Lila and Buddy and went to be a small doctor in New England. Ann immediately became fascinated by Harris, which caused great difficulty in the fact that Lila was always in love with Harris and remained the same. Buddy still loves Harris, but in 1953 he changed the path of Harris's homosexual desire to be his good friend, Ann, because he couldn't accept himself that he had sexual desires for men. another person Buddy expresses his inner frustration by being a bad boy who is alcoholic and has broken alcohol - much to the shame of the right and scary parents. <br /> <br /> There's no need to say these things are all shown and Repressed Emotions lead to tragedy - after all, this is the flick of the chicken. <br /> <br /> At the present time, Ann's daughter has become distant from their mother and is suffering, realizing their own lives and doubts. Konstantin is working for emotional fatigue trying to maintain the perfect mother and wife. Nina, who always feels bad, can't keep the relationship. <br /> <br /> Stimulate all these relationships in the last fifty years and you will see interesting societies, values, and effects on personality. And the actions of the people involved. <br /> <br /> All the performances in the evening are great. But there are many performances and special scenes with two family relationships that make this movie very special. <br /> <br /> Claire Denes plays the role in the 1950s and she does it in a style that Showing the clever woman in those days that contradicts what she should do compared to what she wants to do. Her performance is not easily forgotten <br /> <br /> Vanessa Lisa Redgrave plays Ann Dying, whose mind And changed from the present to the past into a fantasy flight and, of course, Redgrave pulled it out with Stirling style. <br /> <br /> Natasha Richardson - Reverend's real daughter Dagreve - played the role of Anne's daughter in the movie The scene between mother and daughter in this real life that plays the legendary mother and daughter is a fascinating story. <br /> <br /> Tony Collet plays Ann's other daughter, Ann. Nina spends most of her time in depression and regrets herself while blocking the good people who love her as well as her mother and sister. Collette is perfect for this part. But I have never seen her perform poorly or unbelievably, no matter what role she plays. <br /> <br /> Mamie Gummer plays Lila in the 1950s and shows us more controversial women. The expected role in her life is better than her good friend Ann. She's very good. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep - Gummer's mother - Lila's play. At present there is nothing to say about Meryl Streep. She used to give a clever performance and reward. <br /> <br /> Director Lajos Koltai said in a special DVD that he found Glenn Close to play a relatively small part of Lila because he felt she was an actor. Only one person can imagine that he will One scene in the film Of course, he was right and the acting of the scenes in that scene made you remember all the other scenes. Close is Lila's right mother and you have been shown to be a treasure. <br /> <br /> There's a scene. The other three scenes in this film combined with the scenes with the top closed captions which made The whole movie should look On Lila's wedding day, Ann came into her room and crawled into bed with her friend to talk about Lila's mistakes about the upcoming wedding with a man she didn't like. This scene occurred fifty years later when Lila came in and crawled into bed with Ann, a dying friend, to talk about the life they lived in. In this background, Streep and Redgrave are enchanted. <br /> <br /> At least another memorable scene for me - when Buddy announces his love for Ann. Hugh Daisy, as a close friend, gave us a heartbreaking show of a young man torn from his conflicting sexual feelings. His performance is superior. <br /> <br /> Flick the chicks? Yes. Special movies that are acting, directing, and unbelievable scenery, yes or no. Definitely. I can't recommend too much dinner.
