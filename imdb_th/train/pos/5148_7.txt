I don't know what it is about this movie. But movies about history or religion are often criticized with precision Of course, it's not 100% accurate. Today, it's hard to create a movie that is 100% accurate. Even "experts" don't agree. So I like to judge movies with things that try to say more than choosing all inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> So I started by saying that I like this small series. But I agree with the criticism that his childhood passed too quickly The series should be his first three-part story. But if they don't have more money to shoot the story anymore, I'll criticize that ??? <br /> <br /> There is only one problem I have with this movie, and that's the fact that it's right Told in history how to book, especially the second part, which is only the sum of the events I like to see Hitler more humane. (Additional scenes that he suspects himself, etc.) Noah Taylor did that in the movie 'Max', which seems to work better. I think However, I'm glad to make and own a DVD. Just remember to make it clear what happened and saw that Carlyle gave him the best. 7.5 / 10
