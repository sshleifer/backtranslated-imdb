Shortly beginning, this film is a true picture of a man named Gary. Clearly, it was random in the parking lot of the television station Gary worked in Beaver City. Gary is slightly different. He is an impostor and a Chevy driver named Farrah (after Fawcett). Lo and the director receive a letter from Gary later, inviting him to return to the beaver to see the local talent contest he has collected. Gosh. Two shorts that follow is the story of Gary. The same story that you just saw first is the picture of Sean Penn and Crispin Glover, the second title. If you are in the mood to create fun for someone, this is a movie to watch. I laughed twice as much, especially the performance of Crispins, which can definitely stand. At the end, I had to go back to the film again to see the true Gary and all his ignorance, even though Olivia was the focus. But I wanted to see one "fictitious" shorts wearing Gary Barry's jacket, which is ridiculous.
