Originally, I went back to 1996 in a one week period at the cinema. I was impressed and didn't feel much change. <br /> <br /> Documentary about Edward D. Wood, Jr., famous for his life and movies There are interviews with people who work with him or know him, including: Vampira, Dolores Fuller, Bela Lugosi Jr., Loretta King, Gregory Walcott and Paul Marco. Interested in (some) but is it really necessary? I used to watch all the movies of Wood and they were scary. Ambitious wood But not capable enough to accomplish I will not say that he is the worst director. But he was there. Do we need docu from filmmakers who are very ordinary? I like the fact that they didn't try to make Woody a saint. More than a few people were interviewed. (Especially Lugosi Jr.) hates that man a lot and it is loud and clear They also ignored his film in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 70s. Still, it is interesting if you are a wooden fan. The best interview is Vampira (with tears from the wood) and Dolores Fuller (an old girlfriend for a long time).
