They start to be enemies and end up as best friends. If this sound is like a Disney movie, it is (made through 20 Century Fox only). This movie trailer is one of the best things I've seen for a long time. But this movie is not in the expectation of the sample set The problem lies with the fact that filmmakers don't decide who is the target audience of the movie.
