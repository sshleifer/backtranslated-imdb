On the night of his bachelor party, Paul Coleman (Jason Lee) meets a beautiful dancer Becky (Julia Stiles) at the bar. They drink a lot and the next morning he wakes up in bed. His future husband's mother called him and informed him that his Karen fiancee (Selma Blair) might arrive in his apartment and he asked Becky to hurry away from home. Sooner or later he finds that she has a crab and later in preparing his wedding dinner. He realizes that Becky is a Karen cousin. This is the beginning of comedy movies that are very funny with hilarious situations. The first attraction of this movie, of course, is the trio of actors and actors Julia Stiles and Selma Blair, who is a great and beautiful actress, and Jason Lee who is amazingly funny Good show I laughed all the time. But there are some really hilarious scenes For example, when Paul finds Becky in his bed When he found her color; His imagination in many situations in the pharmacy, trying to buy and get explanations about the crab; Most scenes of neighbors, ministers; When Karen call the department store Or when the police found a suspect who attacked Paul I can count more scenes, but better than the readers rent or buy this movie and have lots of fun. My rating is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Louco Por Elas" ("Crazy For Them")
