CREEP is a deadly horror movie created in real time that doesn't require anything more than just showing people being attacked in an empty subway platform by mutant humans for 85 minutes and it is like that. Nothing more, no less than this The director Christopher Smith draws the drama as far as he can by introducing a character who has reason to stay in the subway after being locked. He also left the origins of Creep with an ambiguous intent. (Illegal experiments that took place in the 1960s underground were hinted) and a few mysterious works Sadly, he undermined himself to the end by stopping the distortion that a genetic disorder would appear again. Yes, you heard me right - I want a distorted ending! Franka (RUN LOLA RUN) Potente is as good as an awesome female lead and the rest of the actors are okay.
