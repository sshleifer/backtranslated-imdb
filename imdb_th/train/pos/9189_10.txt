Let me start by saying that after watching this episode for the first time on the DVD at 10 pm, one night I couldn't sleep until about 3:00 pm. <br /> <br /> This short review may There are spoilers. <br /> <br /> I have been a big fan of The Sopranos and I for a long time. Can say that this is the best episode I have ever seen I'm not saying that everyone should feel this way, but I do now, just like the weekend I spent with my family watching my own father unconscious in the ICU before he passed. <Br /> <br /> Now start with Tony, in fact, reserve: He is a salesperson. The person was mistaken for a man named Kevin Finney. <br /> <br /> Ten minutes after I knew that Tony was dreaming or I was watching another program. It's not like the normal Sopranos and I like it. <br /> <br /> Option 1 is confirmed when Anthony (or "Kevin") looks up into the sky as well.

His boys bring AJ. House and Carmelella overcome the stress of resting in the hallway: a unique moment now. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the episode, we cut between the real world: the family dealt with the potential. The negative effects of this coma and Tony's backup reality, which is consistent with what has happened in his heart and in the real world around him. <br /> <br /> From that point on The protagonist now: After AJ finished telling his mother that he was studying, she went to see the grass field sitting next to Anthony. <br /> <br /> She approached Tony and said the best. Now: "Anthony, do you hear us?" Tony's world, he entered the dark and opened fire. He took off his shoes and went to the phone. He tried to call But he couldn't - as if he were trying to say something to Carmella But he couldn't bring himself to do that. <br /> <br /> He sat down and looked out the window. The glittering light that appears again now seems to call upon him from the other side of the city. <br /> <br /> "When the weather is cold, I want to die" by Moby. this And help to create the emotional roller coaster of the episode. <br /> <br /> 10 from 10 <br /> <br /> PS: Look at the next episode.
