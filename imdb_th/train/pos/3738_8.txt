TIGERLAND / (2000) *** 1/2 (from the fourth) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> For many years, viewers have seen and understood every war movie. Issues Possible perspectives and somehow, manufacturers and writers often come up with new ways and innovations in drawing soldiers on the battlefield. Joel Schumacher ("8MM," "A Time to Kill" ), One of the most risky directors working, found similarities to "The Thin Red Line" in the way that his new drama "Tigerland" stepped into military shoes The film, written by Ross Klavan and Michael McGuther, has more courage and sarcasm than "The Thin Red Line" or even "Saving Private Ryan", although the dramatic impact of the movie is slightly reduced due to the content of the proposed content. But of course, we clarify the new perspective of the war man. <br /> <br /> I want to know Joel Schumacher's experience with these armies, who are undaunted and cruel? I'm sure some of them But the movie watched a world that did not give up through the eyes of a young man named Roland Bozz (Colin Farrell), who is against the idea of ​​war. His personality immediately responded to many other characters who became his best friend, Paxton. (Matthew Davis) and another Wilson (Russell Richardson), which often changes moods The war that appeared in this production was not found on the battlefield. But in the training camp of the Louisiana Teaching Camp between the concepts and fears of soldiers in training This movie is about preparing for war in particular. It will end when the soldiers finally enter the war and, unfortunately, because seeing the characters that are actionable should be a good return. <br /> <br /> Take a picture of the place in 28 days by Using a 16mm stock and a minimal budget, Joel Schumacher shows the brutal, distorted and brutal atmosphere precisely using hand-held films, unique lighting techniques and direct sounds. Schumacher's rough and glamorous pictures make the movie feel like a documentary. This unusual filming style has helped make hard core realism difficult. There are graphics in rough language. The wave of the four-letter word makes the audience confused. Some people are shocked by what they hear. Even the most violent vulgarity did not make the dialogue to be heartbreaking, true and emotional. <br /> <br /> If anything, "Tiger Land" gives a little appreciation to our soldiers. The country at the beginning of the battle Such courage must be enlisted in the time of war by knowing the difficulties and risks that arise. Such thought-provoking ideas arise from the heartbreaking performances by young actors who want to show a variety of trainers. This movie is not intended for all audiences. But it is something that young men should consider before joining the army ... and adult viewers should see the courage needed to do so. <br /> <br />
