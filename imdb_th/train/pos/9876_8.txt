The presentation of Lily Mars is a cute little movie that presents Judy Garland's comedy skills along with the standard singing time The plot consists of Lily Mars tagged after producer John Thornway for her big break. I think the comedy is light and nothing too heavy here. I really recommend this movie for everyone. Judy is amazing in this role!
