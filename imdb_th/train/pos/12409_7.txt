Prisons are not often presented during conversations about the eighty best horror films, and there are good reasons because that's not one of the best movies ... but when you delve into the classic movies that decade must offer One of the best-known movies / small films This film is related to this film. For a start, it was the first attempt for Renny Harlin; The director with the ability behind many action movies, including Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Sea; And secondly, we have an initial role for Lord of the Rings Star Viggo Mortensen. This movie is not absolutely original. But the plot is interesting We focus on the newly opened prison after many years. This was a prison where a man named Charles Forsyth was sent to an electric chair after being surrounded by the governor of the prison. By nature, the spirits of the dead are not resting peacefully. And when the old laboratory opened again, the spirits of the dead prisoners escaped to avenge <br /> <br /> The film is not the movie The Shawshank Redemption, but it tries to create a variety of characters and while The main issue of this movie is always a horror story. The prison drama behind it makes it an interesting base. This is a good job as well, apart from the basic location, the film has no "plot" to go, and we rely on the interaction between the characters to make things interesting. This movie is a strange story. But it is never too true, which may be the reason why this movie is difficult to remember However, the murder itself is quite good and creative and important. When the movie continues, we will begin to delve deeper into the story behind the vengeful ghost of the prisoner, and while it is reasonably interesting, something about this is not reasonable and makes the film less. Even so, everything was in trouble and reached an exciting climax and overall I must say that the prison is a worthy movie to follow.
