Once a year "come" this movie and make everything easier for you You don't have to try to think it's good. It's just You enjoy it while you watch and you bring it home with you. I can not say that it is all flawless, but near the show - excellent. The story - attention and with elements of doubt. It is a story of a small family that is quite predictable. But not an important secret It is a way for a blind girl to access it. I was impressed by the way the director demonstrated the deep relationship. (Blind woman and her cousin) The only thing I don't like is that the actors playing with her mother are too strong and unnecessary. Keren
