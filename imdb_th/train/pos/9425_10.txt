Extreme comedy series from the 90s (including two sets) that suffered from the UK rankings due to poor scheduling. When you face the created comedies like 'Minder', even the best new comedy still struggles to get noticed. <br /> <br /> Luckily, I watched the series from The first episode followed with greed. I talked about it with friends and family at that time. But everyone seems to be watching something else Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> Next, I like both series and never forget. <br /> <br /> Then I searched on the internet and found out that a big fan was trying. Making both series to be released 'On his own' <br /> <br /> Both series are now available on DVD. <br /> <br /> http://www.replaydvd.co.uk/joking_apart_S1 HTM
