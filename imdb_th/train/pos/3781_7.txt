I dare not say that this movie is better than the original. But it is very good for it The comedy in this movie is as good as the original. There are many scenes that make me laugh. Just think about them. <br /> <br /> The story in this movie is even more strange. That is what makes it great. Peter Hewitt works great in directing this film with great actors. The main actors from the original movie go back to the characters in this film and everyone works great with their roles. I don't care what anyone says. I think Keanu Reeves is a great actor! I enjoyed drawing his Ted in both of these films while I was with Alex Winter's Bill. I am very happy to see George Carlin come back to play Rufus. Very cool! Hal London, Jr., who played Ted Logan's father, did a very good job. The scene in which Ted possesses his ancestral body and Hal London, Jr. begins to act as Ted is a wonderful scene and he draws it out very well. I can't speak of William Sadler as a Death. He created my movie completely. The remaining actors are quite good. <br /> <br /> If you like the first part of the Bill and Ted series, I hope you like this movie as well. But don't expect it to be as good as the original I hope you enjoy this movie. Thank you for reading. <br /> <br /> - Chris
