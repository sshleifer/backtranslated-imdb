Spider-Man is in my opinion the best superhero of all time and this game is the best superhero game ever. Although it may be quite easy But you have to play many times to get all the clothes and comic book covers, which are easy to navigate through the game. It may seem difficult to control at first. But when you get it, you have to be a web-slinging like Spider-Man himself. <br /> <br /> The bosses, while the level is quite easy, fun. Scorpion, the first boss, is easy to beat unbelievably. Believe that it shouldn't be like that, as the fans of the comic books know, Scorpion is one of the most dangerous spiders of Spider-Man. Rhino, the second chief, is also very easy The third boss is venomous, which in my opinion is the easiest boss in the game, of course, should not be the fourth boss. This time he is a bit more difficult to overcome but still easy. The fifth boss is Mysterio, which I think is the most fun boss in the game. He is also one of the more difficult bosses. But again, still quite easy The next boss is Carnage. You can easily guess, easily overcome, but Carnage is really fun in fighting. The 7th boss is Doctor Octopus that is like other bosses. It's easy, but not as easy as other bosses because he has armor. The 8th Chief and the last one is exclusive to the game, never in a comic or comic book. I will not make you lose for those who do not play the game. But the boss is the only boss in the game that is not too easy I give 8 out of 10 reasons I don't give 9 or 10 is when you get a set and all comic books, then it's boring. (Doing everything will take a while) It's not as accurate as comic books or cartoons. Show bosses too easily and they should use Hobgoblin and / or Green Goblin as boss. I think it would be fun to fight with people. Flying in the air! They don't use them in the sequel of this game as well! Green Goblin is a villain in the upcoming Spider-Man movie. So hopefully they will create a video game from the movie.
