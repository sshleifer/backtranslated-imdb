The second film of Woody Allen in London, the murderer of Tha Tarot Card is killing prostitutes in London. The journalist who wanted Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) was advised that he might be Lord Jackman. She began to love him. But fell in love quickly She got help from the magician on the stage. Sid Waterman (Woody Allen) who didn't like what he saw It is shorter and moves much faster than the old plot, but I have entertainment and it makes me guess until the end. It's not a joke But it is a mystery with only a few good humor (All from Allen) It's not one of Allen's best. <br /> <br /> Most of the performances are very good. Allen is terrible, but he has played this role for millions of times and it is boring. But Johansson and Jackman They look amazing and give two convincing performances. Allen (surprisingly) works for their sex appeal - there is a sequence in which they both are in a swimsuit. Of them to show a good body, ask They The only real debit is Allen still not sure how to shoot London. He is not as "Match Point" as though - maybe he will be better when he goes. <br /> <br /> Worthwhile to see me for 8 items.
