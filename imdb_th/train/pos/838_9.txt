*** 1/2 Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Adam Scott, Philip Baker Hall Directed by Richard Shepard <br /> <br /> The stories and movies that have been well developed meet Brosnan never. A better role in the movie "Bond" after his 2004 "After the sunset". His latest role brought laughter and good times. A professional male actor, therefore, Julian Noble, who works in Mexico City, finds the opposite of himself, a businessman with high concerns like Danny Wright (which may be one of the best roles of He), as well, two pairs on the screen create laughter, humor, riots, and can not laugh. Davis is one of her best roles since "American Splendor" once again offering charming and sharp acting. One of the funniest and best movies of the year My final score 9/10
