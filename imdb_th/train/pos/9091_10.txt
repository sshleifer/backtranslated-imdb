Great movie With everything you need in a movie Great battle scenes and many other acts of suspense and romantic love stories <br /> <br /> Like the old movie of swashbuckler, all entertainment from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Quick fixes and you will never be bored anymore. This story is like a classic story of a royal problem. The actors are beautiful and the scene is beautiful. The costumes are beautiful and the acrobatics are imaginative. Special effects are amazing as well. <br /> <br /> Gary stretches to be very impressive as an actor and looks gorgeous. He seems to be a sure bet for Super Stardom. <br /> <br /> John Ris - Davies is a great person as he is. He is one of the great actors of our time. <br /> <br /> And Cindy Burbridge, Ex Miss Thailand is a wonderful and perfect person for a leading lady. <br /> <br / > I found that this movie received many awards and I can see why <br /> <br /> All of this is an amazing independent movie. See it for sure. <br /> <br /> I recommend and give. TEN + !!!
