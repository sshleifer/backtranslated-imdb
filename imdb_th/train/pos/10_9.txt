I am a man not given to women movies. But this is a special issue that is very well done. I do not have a personal love for Jane Fonda as a person, but she does a good Hell of work while DeNiro is a great person. Everything is doing well: acting, directing, setting, shooting, casting. If you can enjoy the stories of people and true love - this is the winner.
