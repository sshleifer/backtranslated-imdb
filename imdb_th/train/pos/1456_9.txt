This type of documentary often has many opinions. This movie seems to bring all the comments and let the audience decide what to do with the information provided. It is a sad story that these poor people have to work in this movie, acting well in acting on the sweat of an ugly shop. Mardi Gras: Made in China is a great way to show the world that little things like beads for celebrations can affect the lives of many people in other countries. <br /> < br /> I have to watch movies for English classes that we take to talk about sweat shops and some people try to get rid of them and this movie helps to get the topic. It's a very informative movie and I would like to encourage everyone to see it opening your eyes.
