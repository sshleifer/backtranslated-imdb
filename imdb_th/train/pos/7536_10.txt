The opinion of the person who said that Pat Robertson is evil and his program is evil, nothing can compare evil and righteousness. His definitions of evil are contrary to evil. The Bible itself says that on the last day, people will call good and evil! He didn't even know that he followed the Bible prophecy! If you don't know God and refuse to know him now, it's okay. He still loves you But in the end, when you bend your knees and you will do it, it will be too late for you. God does not send anyone to hell, even you! You will go there for your own decision. May God have mercy on you and give you the Damascus Road experience. Mission 700 Club and Pat Robertson are one of the reasons I am still here. On the edge of alcoholism, adultery and possibly death, God reached through the TV screen and used Pat Robertson to do it and thank God that he did! You have the right to say what you say. But you have no right to curse with your words God has mercy on you
