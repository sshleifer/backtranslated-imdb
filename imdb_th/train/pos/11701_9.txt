This is a great movie for Generation X'ers. All that is different from America in 1972 compared to our 21st century psychosis. You can recognize that what America in 1972 lost is like watching a movie. this story I found that the clothes and the car style brought me back to like the memories of the country better now. Just think ... Go back. There are only 4 or 5 television stations to choose from. There are no AIDS. Muslim terrorists Road Rage, 911, Bird Flu, Snipers on the Expressway and so on, etc. The Vietnam War has ended. There will still be 7 years before Star Wars will come out.
