I remember watching "Gung Ho" as a child and mother and wondering why she would cry in the last few minutes. Of course, I found the movie both hilarious, especially the character's character. It wasn't until I was older and again watching that I knew that this item really was deep Which Keaton reluctantly surprised me with his real-life delivery patterns and Watanabe added humor and pathos to the mix Relief <br /> <br /> I think this movie is one of the most evaluated movies in the 80s. We can all learn lessons from the unification of Americans and Japanese people in This movie ... Sometimes you * can * have "the best of both worlds" and now I understand why my mother feels like she did during that time. I want to have a car as well.
