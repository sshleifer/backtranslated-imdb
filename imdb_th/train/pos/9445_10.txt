This is one of the best movies I've never seen before. The first time I saw it, I was about 9 or 10 years old. I started looking for some time before the rape scene. And when I saw it, I was shocked to think "What is this movie?" Today I saw it from the beginning and really understood how good this movie was. It's exciting, frightening, shocking and a unique way. But the best thing about this is the ending that the audience shows that this experience will haunt the characters for the rest of their lives. It will torture their consciousness and they will worry throughout their remaining lives about the bodies found in that river. And there is nothing they can do about it, it's what they have to live with This ending is one of the most unhappy endings in film history and clever and scary. <br /> <br /> And the performance is great, especially Jon Voight and Burt Reynold, a magnificent performance in the movie. In summary, John Boorman created one of the best movies throughout history. The movie based on Dick Chaney's novel must be viewed for all movie lovers.
