In addition to delivering Susan Hayward's wood throughout this film, it is as good as the movie in the Bible. Henry King manages this movie with respect to the epic in every small scene and Peck is always flawless. Exciting Alfred Newman vote and memorable twenty-three hymns, even many years ago The scene with Goliath is a scene that doesn't have much. But not everything that was done in the era in which this movie was not doing well This fits well with the scripture poems of the day, "The Songs of Ruth" and "Esther and the King". It is worth watching and Raymond Massy is as good as the prophet Nathan. The film was rounded up by Judge James Robertson, an aristocrat like Abishai and Jay Meadows, as David's first estranged wife, Cole.
