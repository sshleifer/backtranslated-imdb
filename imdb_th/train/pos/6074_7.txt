Laurence Fishburn is a good actor and deserves respect for trying this. But he was not in class with Shakespeare as great as Olivier and Wales And he still suffers from Kenneth Branagh. This Irish man is excellent and stole the show completely. Olivier realizes that his production potential and makes Iago with someone he knows he can go on stage I almost didn't realize the possibility of Iago, Shakespeare's most evil character. But Branagh shows us the depth. Pleased to see the view of Venice as well.
