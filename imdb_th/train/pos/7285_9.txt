This movie scared me when I was a child. It's not "Citizen Kane", but it has moments. Arm tear scenes are good. The plot is good, even if the character is not - may be involved in the performance. Enter the name of the leading person in the role and see what you get. This is one of those filming, editing (with nothing less) and distributing in a few months of film category. I rate 9 movies from this genre and age.
