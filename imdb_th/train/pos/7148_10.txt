This movie is a story that I highly recommend. It's about the Stanley Yelnats (Shia LeBeouf) boy who was convicted of a criminal offense and sent to Camp Green Lake, a detention center. There he was forced to dig a 5-foot and 5-foot hole in the diamiter. At that time he met other boys of the camp (Zero, Magnet, Armpit, Squid, X-Ray and ZigZag). Not for 'Create a character' but to find the treasures of outsiders Kate Barlow throughout the film (and books) Stanley learns more about the past than about himself and more about digging holes. I gave this movie 9.5 because I was very careful when talking about movie books. (I want the movie to follow the book for sure), but it's still doing well.
