This movie should be right for you. It has an overall meditative quality, ranging from music to beautiful photography and listening to what is often thought about by the life that Andy Goldsworthy will say when he is working or during an appointment. If you are familiar with Buddhism, that is the feeling I received from this movie. The uncertainty of life, the beauty of nature, the interconnections of all things, etc. However, things that I do not understand, confuse and eventually force me out without finishing. (I saw more than an hour) is a duplication of All matters You will know why he has received a few duties and why he can live with this kind of work. Art has come to life. But all his talk without conclusion led to the end.
