As the jacket announced, this film is "Beautifully shot and expertly edited" and yes, it's stunningly beautiful. The timelessness that we perceive in the stoic rocks and in the relentless decline and the flow of water frames, temporary works from the hands of Goldsworthy, so that in a long time they point to eternity < br /> <br /> Fear us with the touch of grief in or in the words of Matthew Arnold from "Dover Beach": <br /> <br /> Listen! You heard the roar of the gravel that the waves pulled back and darted out when they came back on the high island. Started and stopped and started again with a slow, shaky rhythm and brought an eternal letter of sadness. <br /> At one point at the end of the movie, Goldsworthy said "Words do their job. But what I do here says more and more "As a saying by myself, I didn't break the law and didn't think for a moment that I thought he wasn't polite because of the combination of style and time and change. And the surfaces and colors and elements that Goldsworthy created carefully and intuitively. <br /> <br /> At one point he said "What will be here ... and what is not" that is his core. <br /> <br /> I think that the twentieth century artists realized that the greatest art of ephemeral How great it is compared to the time of the vast universe So they began to reflect on this understanding by organizing unintended work before. The idea is that, emphasizing that the short-lived is the greatest work of mankind, the sense of immortality of art is shown. <br /> <br /> Perhaps part of the performance of Goldsworthy's work in This type of expression He tried to collect some forms of straw or leaves, where the currents came to them or placed in rivers where they were to be carried away. And in this process combined elements and unity together. <br /> <br /> Both times and times are necessary for us to understand our world and the places inside. And it is important that these works must be done in the context of nature so that the things that are written are set within natural things Therefore, the walls of the stone and the eggs of stone that Goldsworthy created were quiet and hard. But we know that they are not eternal monuments But will be in an unspecified period and then spread to the same status as Exists before we come. <br /> <br /> This is the art that should be like the soul. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, Goldsworth's work is the understanding that Incompatible It is a purely experience of time and style. In the sense of his work, "answered" Shelley's famous poem "Ozymandias" by speaking, even though the tide washed away the work and even when the river dissolved the expression, even though the art would live because of our experience In the same way, one thinks that the paintings on the sands of Tibet are carefully and carefully measured, and then when they are finished beautifully and preciously, they will receive the wind so that we can know that <br /> But in the modern world, these artworks are durable in photos and videos. Goldsworthy is a successful photographer. (From the need for me to speak) and all of his works, even those who failed him, told us that there was a photograph so he could look back on the emotions that were reflected and see what he could do. <br /> <br /> Production of this film directed by Thomas Riedelsheimer Along with beautiful songs and haunts by Fred Frith that shouldn't be missed Is one of the most beautiful documentaries I've ever seen and is one of the best spirits
