Very wonderful, strange, romantic, exceedingly Italian. This film is so light that you float out into a reality that is refracted and you don't want to go back to boring. Kitchen sink in the world of bakery and hairdresser and plumbing. But the person who shines brightly Credit should go to the screenplay or direction or not your choice - they both have no mistakes. Let me go back to New York City that is far more than the mirror.
