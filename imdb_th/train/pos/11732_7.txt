Ok, I saw this thing in the cinema when it came out and I don't know why. I didn't see it But I ended up on this page because I thought I was thinking about this movie - again, I don't know why. But the fact that I remember that it was said a lot. <br /> <br /> The jokes are hard, much harder than any drama. Doing the right thing makes it seem easy, but wrong ... Is there anything worse than a bad comedy? Steve Martin is interested. You are in this category again for some reason. <br /> <br /> Elvira Mistress Of The Dark must do it right. Do it quickly with the tongue on the cheek and know that it's not Philedelphia's story. It's entertaining from the beginning to the end. Brain Donors is another suitable person in this category. (Most of them are unreasonable jokes.) <br /> <br /> One point of conflict - the end. It seems that the writer / director doesn't know what to do to be funny. At the end, trying to become a love story by undermining the swift, quirky dialogue to that point. Then there was a scene "Tasle" while this must be seen. (Male opinion) It is above and outside the place. It's a shocking story. Need to write again for the end. <br /> <br /> This is not a funny genius like Spinal Tap or The Producers or The Holy Grail, but if you don't try to distinguish and let the fun play come to you, you will Laugh, I can guarantee
