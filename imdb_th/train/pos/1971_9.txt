I don't know what people complain about. I watched movies yesterday and I like it a lot. Stone once again delivered a great character. She is a good person, like in the first basic instinct. She still has a smart answer. But there is a trick Although Sharon may be 48 years old, but she looks amazing! I don't care if she will disguise herself as Barbie. She looks good and that is Basic Instinct 2. Give everything you need from the beginning. Sex, violence and a good ending that will make you think and talk about it for hours Half of the people commenting on this movie haven't seen it yet. So don't listen to them
