When I miss the return of Jedi, I think it's an epic. Yes, Ewoks are there. What? They are interesting things in the movie. (Not to mention that they are similar to Vietcong that can destroy an army that is technologically advanced with traditional actions.) Jedi is definitely darker. An amazing stage) is the best part of this film. Palpatine is evil and evil. Vader looks like Mr. Rogers compared to him. When talking about Darth Vader, it is a remarkable character. Vader is a truly modern Greek tragedy, and I think people are now able to understand and appreciate especially after Revenge of the Sith. His redemption at the end is moving and brings happiness to you. The best part is, of course, special techniques. It is amazing that the movies from the eighties still stand against the test of time with the scene in Jabba's palace (Leia looks amazing in a bikini metal) and of course the three-way fight at the end still Lookable in the deep scenes and emotional moments of Jedi. (Mostly between Luke and Palpatine and when Luke reveals the truth to Leia) and the incredible special technique is the end of the franchise
