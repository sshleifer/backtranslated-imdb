At this point, it seems almost unnecessary that Jon Bon Jovi gives a strong and seamless performance like Derek Bliss. His ability as an actor was previously recognized by the critical acclaim of He collected in other movies (The Leading Man, No Look Back) but in the event that everyone still wondered, Jon Bon Jovi can be shown. He can do well and expect to happen to him. It's easy to separate Derek from the guy in VH-1. <br /> <br /> In general, I won't watch horror movies. I expect them to focus on blood that is more exciting than dialogue and plot. The thing that made me the most satisfied about this movie is that it has a realistic plot. Not as much blood will become the focus of this film and not the quality of movies that are annoying, annoying, with a budget, higher technical impact, so blood fans may be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Unlike the action movie such as U-571, the dialogue will sit in the back seat to blow up the guy. "And what really happened to them? Some scenes were left unexplained. (Like Derek's hallucinations) but you will get some sense as if they were laying the foundation for the sequel Unfortunately, Hollywood lacks interest in this film. The sequel will not happen. These cases forgive when knowing that vampires may be a continuous drama. <br /> <br /> Is this the best movie I have ever seen in my life? Isn't it a good way to spend about two hours of entertainment? Yes. It will not let people who are afraid of horror movies, sleepless and it will not let the horror movie lovers completely disappointed as well. If you are somewhere between horror movies and horror lovers, this movie is for you. Expressing happiness with balanced effects and stories. <br /> <br />
