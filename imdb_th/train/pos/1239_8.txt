I think this movie is quite good, will add to my "clasic collection" after this time. I believe I saw another poster that warned Picker that some people still are movies. Perhaps some mysterious scores may resist "logic", but there are many religious stories that accept "beliefs" that fail to pass the smell test. If you accept any belief that you are a member, you can definitely accept the movie. It is just me or someone else observes that Aja-Yee Dagger is the same knife that Lamonte Cranston has a lot of control problems in "The Shadow". There is no mention of this in regard to trivia for a particular movie. This (IMDB), but I will bet the dollar for the donut which is the same pillar.
