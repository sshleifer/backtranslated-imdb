I can't believe how many people hate Hal Sparks! He is my favorite host. I hate gossip, celebrities and don't like talk shows. But when Hal Sparks hosts a talk soup, I have to watch TV for me. I didn't miss it when he ran and was sad when the host started pouring in. (Although most guests are still working well) <br /> <br /> However, for everyone who doesn't like Hal Sparks, I think they have never seen this special weekend before. They are episodes. Talk Soup that contains the best clips from all week and full of funny pictures. The original bit that Hal Sparks did was hilarious. One of them was possessed by a bad comedy demon and in a shaman like the scene, his head spun while he told a joke about airline food. There was one episode that was dedicated to creating fun for Multiplicity because many groups of Hal Sparks had made many doubts throughout the studio. <br /> <br /> OK, maybe it doesn't sound. The jokes describe them, but all I know is that apart from Talk Soup, the other two programs that I watch regularly over the years are The Simpsons and Late Night with Conan O'Brien. So if you like the comedy style of those performances, you may like Talk Soup. During the last year Sparks <br /> <br /> said Henson and Tyler were good hosts like together All three families brought something different from the table. But they are all good comedians in my opinion Of course, over the past year, Tyler and my guest interest in this program began to fade away, but every time I saw The Soup, a successor of spiritual performances and then a new host was able to laugh. <br /> <br /> Ok, I wasted enough time talking about TV programs that were not aired anymore and in the channels that I always insulted. Go see something else!
