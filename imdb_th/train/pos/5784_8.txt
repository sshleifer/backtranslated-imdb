I noticed that many people posted messages in "Kerching!" The board seemed to hate this show, which I actually found very surprising. I think this is one of the best British children's performances. It's a shame that it is ending because it's so funny. (If it is sometimes wonderful) and has a great character The main character is a little like Del Boy, though much smarter. With his 2 best friends, he tried to make a million pounds for his mother by starting an online business and using the alias of "Rudeboy". His friend Seymour is (Those who like to cook) and Danny (who is a simple and comic relief character) throughout the show. Some characters have new characters and new characters. But it is always fun and updated
