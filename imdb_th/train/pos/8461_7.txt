Since the title is in English and IMDb lists the main language of this program in English, I will pay attention to the English version of Gundam Wing (2000) as presented in Bandai's DVD series. My real reviews For this series under the "" Shin Kid√¥ senki Gundam W "of IMDb (1995) <br /> <br /> There is a slight change in the plot of the script and the adaptation characteristics. English and Ring, then depending on your own taste in the choice of language will be watching this show, the Japanese language can stick to what they want. But for a "realistic" experience, I recommend English tracks from all characters except Heero Yuy, not Japanese. (Most of them are Caucasians, in fact, with two non-Japanese Asians). For one thing, the character of the character is more "direct" than in the Japanese version. The difference between the characters is stronger or acting. <br /> <br /> The wingman of Wing Gundam Heero Yuy is a well-trained soldier who suppresses his emotions. But learn the value of his humanity slowly. Voiced by Mark Hildreth. The person whose delivery looks dead may be criticized as "Bad performances" but it matches the personality of Heero very well. <br /> <br /> Duo Maxwell's Deathscythe Gundam, who was cheerful when faced with death, received a path to life in the value of life and friend He may be the best acting character in all performances by Scott McNeil who plays expertly. He may sound too old for his age. But Duo's English voice was frustrated at number one in Japan. <br /> <br /> Trowa, the pilot of Heavyarms, is a lonely spirit that has only one purpose. Get fighting; Despite his inner desire to connect with people around him, but he knows how to kill, not to make friends Kirby Morrow gives an asymmetrical performance But it looks realistic like Trowa Barton. The winner Quatre Rebarba is voiced by Brad Swaile, who has no problem in caring for the nature of the character and destroying his innocence. Of war and death first hand Another advantage is that Quatre doesn't listen to women anymore. (And yes, he is voiced by a female actress in the Japanese version) but is a 15 year old man in general honestly Strange, but it is completely different from the role of Heero and Trowa. <br /> <br /> Relena Darlian listens to English as an adult, voiced by Lisa Ann Bailey. This may not be good for youthful personality. Her at the beginning of the series But when her character grew up later, her voice was behind the suit and ended up being appropriate for the character's development. <br /> <br /> Zechs Merquise is one of the most dramatic changes compared to Japanese version Both voices bring out the different aspects of the same character. His Japanese voice is arrogant, credible and instructed to respect, in line with his high level of status and charming nature. His English voice by Brian Drummond weakened, resulting in a more serpentine and "snake-like" sound, emphasizing Zechs' secret nature about his hidden agenda and his ideal belief. < br /> <br /> The members of the OZ really mix bag Treize Kushrenada voiced by David Kaye, getting more realistic and realistic performances compared to speaking the Japanese style that is bigger than his life. According to Lady Une did not show her different personalities like the Japanese version and Lucrencia Noin ......... sounds bored most of the time. The pilots raising artillery and military leaders have nothing to say as well. <br /> <br /> I will be grateful if they take the time to give different accents of different characters to reflect the landscape. After their ethnicity, the sounds of Maganac Corp generally do not receive attention. But it may be more interesting if they get a Middle Eastern accent. Members of the Romerfeller Foundation will look better with a level of European accent that reflects their status in high society. <br /> <br /> Despite being Show from the side character In the interpretation of realistic and realistic Gundam scripts Be faithful to the original script of Japan by keeping basic ideas that stimulate ideas and content about politics, war and human nature. Sadly, it still keeps the shortcomings of the original Japanese.
