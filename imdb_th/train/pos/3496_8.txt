I am surprised that there are fewer than 7 stars for movement. <br /> <br /> But they don't understand the movies. <br /> <br /> Stories about growing up in difficult situations. <Br / > <br /> There are crazy grandmothers who want the best for your grandchildren. <br /> <br /> And there are good reasons why many critics like this movie. <br /> <br / > And the reason is because they understand the movie. <br /> <br /> I feel sorry about the score. <br /> <br /> I hope I write a short summary of the movie, but IMDb wants you to write 10 lines. <br /> <br /> I have nothing to say.
