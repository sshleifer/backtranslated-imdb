This is a movie that is quite ok ... Yes, some are particularly weak and comfortable, and the movie doesn't show the big actors (AB, SD, Tanuja). However, the actors who really impressed me here Is Kay Kay Menon (not to be confused with the singer KK) in the scene where he first met the character of Amitabh. I think a man who can look at AB continuously and not say a word and still see Be strong Users send a good actor indeed. In fact, he proved himself to have a value in Sarkar alongside AB for the second time. This guy should get more roles. He's excellent. <br /> <br /> If you read other reviews here on IMDb, you already know the plan and I agree that Akshaye Khanna is entering Pakistan. Too easy And the corner of the little love he shared with "what-her-face" is completely unnecessary But he is a fairly good actor (As seen in DCH) Sunjay Dutt always looks good and AB ... what can I say? I don't know if I'm the biggest fan of him in the world. But I know I can compete for that point. <br /> <br /> An interesting watch because it is Bollywood like "The Great Escape" and "Bridge on the River Kwai".
