Erica Gavin was arrested and sent to prison in a slippery and amusing example of the Prime Minister's exploits during the 70s, showing Jonathan Demme's first debut after writing and producing the film. New Roger Cormans' few world Demme was given the opportunity to be the first director and he delivered movies that not only But giving the nakedness and violence that is expected and delicious but charming, tongue quality in its cheeks as well; Often it was funny as if it were flashy, striking scenes, including cocky and tumultuous performances that were made for prisoners, as well as a powerful sequence of dreams / fantasies for the stupidity and strict control of the director McQueen ( The horror icon Barbara Steel did a great job in this antagonistic role.) I also enjoyed the bank robbery scene that was busy. And many annoying carjacking scenes Like in other types of movies, it is commendable that it is a picture of female empowerment as much as being truly exploited. These women are strong, they don't have to throw away trash from anyone, and they can manage themselves better than <br /> <br /> Our interesting actors here make their roles the most: Juanita Brown as Maggie, aggressive Roberta Collins as the beloved Rainbeaux Smith Bell and Coward Lavelle Gavin as a newcomer and Lynda Gold (also known as Crystin Sinclaire) in the look Bright as an accomplice from the outside. <br /> <br /> Title culminate our Demme, it ended up. "Beat the clock" while our heroines compete to protect Bell from being dropped by Dr. Dr. Randolph (Warren Miller), a type of hunter who doesn't think that will take advantage of women. <br /> <br /> When receiving a satisfactory score, "Caged Heat" by John Cales Is a fun entertainment and is guaranteed to be happy. <br /> <br /> 8/10
