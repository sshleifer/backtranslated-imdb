Tommy Joe and Matt Dillon make the world of gambling proud. The movements that have wrists must be learned from the dice throw. Craps is a skill of its own. <br /> <br /> There is a little surprise. As cynical as we are today, I fully expect that 'Good girl' will cry a lot instead of his buddy. Especially with her words about 'Go to the funeral of her best friend' when she meets Matt for the first time And of course, you expect Matt to kill the man who threw the battery acid on Mr. Allen's face, making him unbelievable. WRRROOONNNNGGG !!! The end of other Hollywood happens, but the writing is great. The acting that is carefully done until you don't know. <br /> <br /> And the music is out of this world. Take us back in the 50s when our 'local interests' were released by Ray Charles and Bo Diddley. Even the ugly little people were still in Chicago. But the club is called 'Biloxi' with a coalition flag supporting racial discrimination I will watch again to listen to music. Good thing, I have the FACTOTUM soundtrack so I can listen to it in the car. See both of you together and you'll see that Matt is ripe .... Play both characters in the bar room. No matter whether he is the owner of a bar in Paramount HOtel in New York, he may have a good opportunity to study. A great actor just came into his own. He demonstrates the elaborate performances ... good and bad in his character. His 'young boy outside the farm' is a wonderful study that is especially painful for Bassett's eyes. He also created love with confidence. Since he was in many movies with Diane Lane in his teenage years, I wonder if ... make love with the actress you grew up with. Add confidence, I will say
