BASEketball is an extremely funny movie that provides performances that generally make movies very fun. Funny material that is more than shit in your pants. Funny and very good plot. And the only thing I don't like about BASEketball is that the child doesn't want it in the movie But if the child is not in the movie, some funny scenes do not exist if you have read professional reviews about this movie. Not including them all, because basically, every examiner doesn't like this movie. BASEketball is a great comedy that gives everything they need. 8 out of 10
