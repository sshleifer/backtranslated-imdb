I have been entertained throughout this clever documentary and I just waited for a moment to pass through the pipe. (My local video chain) and it's worth the wait. I like the special documentary / interest. But this is sincerity, sincerity and nostalgia if you want to look back at your teenage life. Children's imagination is interesting and that is the beginning of a great story. Rent or buy it if you like funny and entertaining documentaries. Mr. Stein and the company come a long way, of course, from the production of CamCorder videos in the neighborhood of banks that hold and gay rings that make people gay from a single look. They all seem to be successful in the fields they respect and it is good to know that they are still good friends. The DVD contains a few additional examples for other great documentaries and also some of Darren's most notable productions, including Crazy News.
