Carla is the deaf secretary, essentially without a hearing aid. When she finds herself working too hard, she can hire Paul to help her. Paul just got out of jail and his past wasn't entirely behind him. If talking more about a story with a lot of twists and turns, <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this movie for me is the use of sounds to indicate that Carla heard and When you can't - "hearing points" (such as views), the first scene that created this, including Carla and Paul's early character development, was more interesting for me than twists and turns. Hard to follow And / or extend the reliability slightly There is also an unpleasant violence. Back to the positive side of the movie well. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth watching. Seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival on 28/28/2002
