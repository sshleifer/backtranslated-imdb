"Father is still in business" is a review topic after the premiere "Promise Me This" in Cannes. I understand why many people think too. But Kusturica's unique expression still appears in his new film and is why critics can't touch him. I have two hours of pure energy without rest, even when Kusturica is suffering from lack of concentration or fear in an empty space. He is still unique and undamaged. Surprisingly good performance of Stribor Kusturica, close-up shots and less scenery in "Life Is A Miracle" Marija Petronijevic has serious global potential. Please do not destroy it. Of course, I recommend everyone to watch this movie.
