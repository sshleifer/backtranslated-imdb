Thanks to smart scripts and stable hands from writer / director Kevin Mayer, "Perfect Alibi" is a mysterious horror movie that is entertaining and pleasing. The movie begins systematically and creates steam when the clues begin to reveal that there is nothing that will be Teri Garr and Hector Elizondo as great as they collaborate to unravel the mystery that reminds me of Nick and Nora Charles. From the movie "Thin Man", Kathleen Quinlan is the best wife of Alex MacArthur and the character role played by Charles Martin Smith, Bru McGill, Anne Ramsey and Estelle Hare Rhys There is even a pendant by Rex Linn. Overall, I felt like reading a good book beside the fire.
