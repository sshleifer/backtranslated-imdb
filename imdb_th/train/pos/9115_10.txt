This idea is a short movie with a lot of information. Interesting, fun and make the audience want more The manufacturer has produced excellent quality short films that cannot be compared to other short films I have seen. I rated this movie at the highest level possible. I also suggest that it will appear to office managers and business people in any establishment. The thing comes from the fact that people who have never listened to their voices will never hear. It is a lesson that must be learned from the office that wants to move forward. I hope the production will produce the second part with this 'idea'. I hope to see the sequence. Congratulations to the Halaqah media again in creating a film of excellence and quality with lessons in mind.
