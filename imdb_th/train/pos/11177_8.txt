***** Spoiler here ***** <br /> <br /> What are you really afraid of? Killer shark or ghost trying to bring the message back? May be a psychiatrist who uses weapons Touch this base, fear the first adult, then take it to a place that most people can't tolerate to explore. <br /> <br /> I have read comments about this film, including performances that are not. Good decision, etc. I Do not agree The show is the first rate for movies like this. It may not be possible for many to imagine the desperation caused by this situation. But the events of the movie not only But there are reasons they may be unavoidable if such a situation is possible This is the real horror movie of "Pet Sematary": not pets and people returning from the dead as an evil killer who hunted knives and scalpels. Might become a desperate crime that Louis Creed did, despite warnings or even in the past The heart of the protector tries to compensate because it cannot be prevented. And the results are horrible In fact, when the movie dives to a slasher land near the end, it is almost diminishing, even though I believe it has the perfect reason to get there. <br /> <br /> I'm a horror True morale and I confirm that Is one of the scariest horror movies ever created If you don't think so, look again after you have children.
