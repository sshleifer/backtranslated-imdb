This film is a great film about a brothel in a fishing village that can best describe the constellation, scene and direction of Kurosawa's old work, combined with the human psychology topics of Dostoyevsky Miserable and cheerful The screenplay is excellent. The scene is colorful and some scenes are still stuck in my mind. The story is interesting and unpredictable - each character is developed and interesting - there is little action, so if you don't like all the feelings you have It's not about the mysterious Geishas and the samurai, proud of their bushido pouring out all. But about the work life and the type of people found anywhere, anytime A lovely and fascinating tribute to Kuroza that is definitely worth watching.
