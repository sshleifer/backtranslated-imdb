I watched this concert on public television and knew I had to have The boys gave a wonderful and exciting performance to everyone at the Royal Albert every time. Pure as well - no synthetic sound, no laser light and no smoke, no big entrance (And serious irrational viewers and admiring everyone who dropped a bottle of rocket at home) if you're a creamy fan (or if you've heard them only); If you are a blues fan If you are a rock and roll fan You won't be disappointed when you watch and listen to this DVD. You won't lose this DVD because you won't lend to anyone at all. (This DVD shows selfishness! Tell them to get yourself!) It's too good and repeatable; You will want to have easy access.
