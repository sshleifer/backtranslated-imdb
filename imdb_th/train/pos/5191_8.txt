Scott is correct The best sword fighting ever in this movie is in the middle of this movie. Fighting with swords and many fighters is not as good as it should be. However, the middle fight is best compared to Japanese samurai movies. The Chinese fencing scene, in my opinion, never surpassed Japan in terms of entertainment. Especially in the scene where a man has to fight with an enemy group, a great Japanese movie like Lone Wolf and Cub series. But the true intensity of those moments makes them better But this is one example that China's fencing is superior to Japan. The scene in the middle of this movie is a five-minute battle with the most amazing dance moves ever. Other battles in this film are also good. But even if they suck this movie will get 7 for that scene If you don't see it, you'll need John Woo as a man.
