It took a long time until I was able to find the title in a special videothek in Berlin and I was lucky to find the English version with the Holland language command. I think it's one of the best horrormovies ever. It's strange to me that some people call this movie as a black comedy. I have to admit that I can't laugh when I see it for the first time. (And it's the same as the second time!) On the one hand, Trelkovski seems good and cute, even in his shy behavior, but on the other hand he dances this child on the playground and doesn't have an explanation for things. that But the most bizarre thing is, of course, his transformation in Simone Choule and the fact that he doesn't know who he is. His hallucinations are scary in this movie. Of course it was in his heart. But it is this flat that reveals his feminine side or before he moves in - I think that's an interesting question. His shizophrenic behavior is difficult to understand and is a very scary thing to see. Two sides or his own body to fight among themselves As a result, he cut his hand first and then jumped out of the window. But the gruesome vocals meant that everyone would say again and again ... whether his soul was in a cage or something? And these hieroglyphs and other things in Egypt? In fact, he / she looks like a mummy in the hospital - that's not an event. But is a clue in my view
