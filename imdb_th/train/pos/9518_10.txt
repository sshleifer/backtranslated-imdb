A great description of the bad aspects of that era. I like the picture a lot - suitable for stories linked to graphic novels. <br /> <br /> I think Tom Hanks is a great person in this story Which he did not choose fully for himself) but still wanted to have a normal life for his family He did the best he could to see what happened. Do not want to destroy the plot - but you have to watch this movie if you are a person who wants more than a movie than normal action / gangster shooting style. (It's violence)
