I grew up with this set I'm about seventy-eight years old. I still remember episode 1 called "New House". It scared me! I almost still heard the statue laughing like crazy. And the end, oh my God! Blowing spirit into the children's room: Yikes! This is a classic TV and is one of the quality series. I have found a DVD collection for sale on the internet: 2. Really, my question to readers: Has anyone bought this set? Is it illegal? Both sellers claim that they have very good copies. I have an incomplete DVD of the episode " The New House "and other slightly better episodes But if anyone knows that these things are clearer than this, it is worthwhile to buy and share with me. Kids. Excellent series. Intuitive and courageous. Thank you in advance for fans who have low scores on this issue - in fact I like to talk Chris Walker.
