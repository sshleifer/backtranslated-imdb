Yes, it's correct. I firmly believe that both the N64 and the strange looking controllers are designed to make this game possible. It's amazing. The first time I saw it there was a large environment and colorful characters, and it's amazing now. The playback controls are perfect, beautiful graphics and the intricate charm of Nintendo. But cannot deny Must have for N64 owners and reasons for receiving N64 for others.
