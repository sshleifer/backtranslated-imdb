Yes, Be My Love is famous for its famous and popular Mario Lanza. His voice is strong and stable, so powerful in the fact that MGM decides to use him in The Great Caruso. Lanza thinks he is the spirit of Caruso. After reading the book of Kostelanitz, author of Lanza's biography, he explained that vocal training and teaching continued to become Caruso's vision to Lanza. But that story is not entirely true. Blame it in Hollywood! I used to practice his singing many years ago and quite well myself until I lost my voice due to emphysema / asthma in the last ten years. Accessing the high notes of Be My Love is not easy but beautiful!
