I just finished watching this movie and found it very fun. It is a small, quiet movie that doesn't make you obsessed with special effects or "big" performances. It takes you into the lives of people living in a small village in North Rainforest. Caroline <br /> <br /> Henry Thomas gives the same good results as a non-Maverick Raymond Toker who finds that the baby is abandoned in the Toker forest. The baby takes him on a journey that will have a profound impact. His life, David Srathairn plays Truman Leicester Connecticut man with the motive fluid potential. And David plays the bad guy for perfection. <br /> <br /> What's more, you see this movie. Filmed in a location in North Carolina with traditional beautiful music
