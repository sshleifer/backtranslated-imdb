Ghosts That Still Walk is one of the movies that attracts you and will not let it go to the end, especially when you see it as a child. Seeing movies as adults, you have to admit that it's not a scary thing. But is an interesting story and contains many great mysterious scenes (Especially the scene with creepy mummies) <br /> <br /> One of the best scenes in the movie is without a doubt the scene with Grandpa and Grandma in their new RV; The scene is rocky, exciting and very scary. In addition, the scene in which the main character discovers his mother's secret is quite scary. <br /> <br /> Okay, acting in movies isn't a great thing, and sometimes the movie looks a little boring But overall, Ghosts That Still Walk is fun. Unfortunately, only a few people see this movie. The film deserves better. I just want to say: Flocker, you are doing well! And for everyone that Hollywood producer came out with; If you want to make a movie, create a new movie!
