I am happy to see that she has black hair! I have been a fan for over 30 years and have been bored with the previous two attempts to film the story. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that the screenwriter updated the time to include the computer. Do not waste it. In fact, I watched the movie twice in a day, the exact sign that it was standard. This is what I do with my favorite books as well. <br /> <br /> I think every character has been well conveyed. I must disagree with the comments made by previous investigators about baddies. Must be ugly. Did he read the book? <br /> <br /> I think this is a very good movie and hope to get the next sequel as expected.
