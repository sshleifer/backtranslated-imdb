Steve Karel created a career from acting to the first bizarre young man in 'The Daily Show' then has many supporting roles. In Virgin Karel, discover a clever and hilarious chapter that takes advantage of his strengths perfectly. Karel plays as Andy Stitzer, a middle-aged man who has a quiet and lonely life. Andy is a strange person, but in a good way, people are awkward. One night while meeting with his colleagues for the first time, Andy accidentally revealed that he was a virgin. His colleagues David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) started teasing Andy about his situation. But it was clear that the three had respect for the proper human being that Andy was and they decided to help him by helping him to end his innocence. And start Andy's mission into adulthood Andy is the innocent, quintessential and most humor born of his innocence until the situation he finds himself in the movie. Some humor is rude. But most are funny stories that do well In addition, I found some of this movie really impressive because Andy found himself developing both a romantic relationship and friendship, perhaps for the first time in his life. I didn't try to portray a love or drama movie; It's a joke in your seat. It's also a good joke that I've seen. There is enough heart for you to care about the characters A good comparison will be 'The Wedding Crashers' from early this summer. Virgin has similar humor. But may be more rude in its jokes I especially like the ending of this movie, which I think is the perfect way to finish the movie. It reminds me of 'Something About Mary'. Very light and fun. It makes you laugh and smile, which is what you should feel when making a funny movie.
