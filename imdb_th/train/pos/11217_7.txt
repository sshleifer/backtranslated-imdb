Being an otaku since Robotech's days, I can still say that Gunbuster is one of my favorite cartoons of all time. When considering when creating animation with superior quality No loops and sequences to reduce the quality of art. Although the final episode is black and white But did not distract from watching movies Although it has been described as "sappy", it should be remembered that women do not respond in the same way that men do. Since the main character is a woman, it should be obvious that she doesn't have to turn to the "man-man" tactics to get respect from those around seiryuu for Noriko. Accidentally playing Akane in Ranma 1/2 Noriko is a 3D cartoon that has acquired her personality, collecting the essence of a brave girl who seems to be completely helpless at first. But ultimately succeeded through her strength The only thing I have is that the mecha looks like a teddy bear. Even the Gunbuster uses a rather suspicious "Homing Laser" and "Buster Shield" (which is nothing more than having a gauze wrap machine around yourself In the true Dracula style) I wonder if the scene should be funny. But it broke me But all I will rank Gunbuster in the top 20 anime forever
