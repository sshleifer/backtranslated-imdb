"One match, no appointment, no exception." Must see if you are a Marine or a sniper. Thumb up! Excellent overall story, excellent camera work, great drama, action, detail and more, quite close to the real thing. But this is not a movie that will make it bad and choose errors to fix This is a sitting and has a good 99 minutes. The story has depth. But this movie is not about making you think It's about enjoying the lifestyle and actions of sniper sniper 2 and 3, it's quite good to follow. But at first it was still the best overall movie. Tom Berenger performed well in his role and showed the hidden side of the sniper life The plains of dealing with all death Must see for gunmen fans
