Yes, as other reviewers have already stated, this may not be the ancient L&H, but it is still far from their worst work, like in the 20th century. Stupid ... I mean foxes. This film has all the basic ingredients for what is wrong for boys. But it is a method and real intention that makes them funny They didn't play to laugh like other comedians, but they worked and the situation was quite serious and that was the essence of their eternal humor. In this film, they are faced with some fundamental problems that we may encounter today, namely work-related stress. First, we will go to check by the doctor, and he will determine the rest that is needed and may be by the sea. That is what Surreal has brought to all of these things. L&H often uses the most possible and exaggerated situations. But never reached an incredible point, except maybe once This makes us laugh because we can relate to ourselves, causing shyness and trying to escape. That is what made Stan and Ollie universal in their appeal. In this film, all these ingredients are presented in a beautiful and satisfying form. It's not the best of them compared to previous work, probably because this is the last film they did for Roach because he wanted to reflect on the "big" studio and into creating unique features and wanting to rush and Complete the contract The big mistake! They should live together and continue for another five years. What the world may not have received from considering this as an alternative Look, laugh and enjoy their last performance.
