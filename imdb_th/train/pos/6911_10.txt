While "The Kiss of the Spider Woman" makes Raul Julia a political prisoner in an unidentified Latin American country, this time he works for a dictator in a Latin American country. In particular, the dictator died. Julia then replaced El President with a Broadway actor. (Richard Dreyfuss) filming movies in the country Then Dreyfus must figure out how to be a dictator while balancing his own life. <br /> <br /> Is it appropriate to change the tense situation in Latin America to become Joke? "Moon Over Parador" did very well, no matter what they did in this movie, they pulled it out. It shows why Richard Dreyfuss is one of the greatest actors of our generation and what we lose when Raul Julia dies. Definitely worth seeing Starring Sonia Braga (Co-star with Raul Julia in "TKOTSW"), Jonathan Winter and Sammy Davis Jr. <br /> <br /> I agree: The first woman is hot.
