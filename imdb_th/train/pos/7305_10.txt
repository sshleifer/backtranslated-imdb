In 1978, the phenomenon began. John Carpenter's "Halloween" release allowed people to queue around the block to see the evil that was made by Michael Meyers. Critics like it. The world loves it. It's been imitated and has become one of the greatest movies in film history. <br /> <br /> Story: 15 years after the murder occurred, four friends (all girls) Is raising children (And brought his girlfriend) on Halloween night after fleeing the hospital the night before. Michael Myers returned to his hometown to chase these people. He killed 3 people quietly and fragilely. He didn't speak. He hides .... <br /> <br /> There is only one friend who escaped after being saved by Doctor Loomis (Michael's follower and doctor) <br /> <br /> There is a reason. One of the reasons why Halloween works well. Ease. We don't know Mi. Where is chael? We don't know why he killed and scared us. This is the only reason that makes us afraid. <br /> <br /> John Carpenter wrote and directed He created unbearable tensions throughout the story and feared that sometimes we couldn't see it. And the important point is truly shocking. <br /> <br /> This horror is necessary. It's scary and serves well. It's still a mystery Michael is a power, not a human being. The power that cannot be denied. <br /> <br /> The sequel that focuses around Michael and his "history" is too much. This film focuses on the fear of the unknown. Maybe that's the reason why this is a masterpiece.
