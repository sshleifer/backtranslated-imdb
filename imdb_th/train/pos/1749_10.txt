Steve Darren proved himself to be a great leader in inhaling fresh air. I make myself wet, it's hilariously smart. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the movie name says it all: Andy Stitzer is a 40 year old man working in an electronics store He is a fool who loves video games and cartoons and has the largest collection. His colleagues working in the shop with him found that he was a virgin during a sex chat filled with poker games. Andy had to go through a joke like hell. But in the end he was lucky in the end. <br /> <br /> Leave the baby at home. But take everyone in the family to watch this romantic comedy for adults It will keep you stuck and cracked from the beginning, and when it's time for you to ask you to wear your extra thick underwear. The only thing I can say about it is too bad. Steve Darren is not accepted as a dump. 20 years ago, he won the best male performance next year for the MTV Movie Awards. Dollar bets that you have received very hard. People <br /> <br /> I give this one a perfect 10!
