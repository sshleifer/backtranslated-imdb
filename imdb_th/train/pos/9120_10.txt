This film speaks international language. Can relate to yourself, community, society or the world wide It has a way that not only But opened many questions only But also asking questions to find and ask the right questions to get to the point of self-reliance / ownership of the image in the movie, mentioning the prototypes around us which must be recognized as a cycle of destruction Clear, recurring, antagonistic of innovation, creativity and growth. Factors that interfere with the natural flow of things must be clear and managed. That idea is an experience movie and not just But being seen as an internal voice / conscience from looking at it makes sense
