How many of us wish to leave social and cultural obligations and be free? Most of us I doubt Will we dance? Not a movie about dance It's about learning about ourselves, recognizing what we are looking for in life and having the courage to search for it. Mr Sugiyama is a middle-aged member of the Japanese society where ballroom dancing is seen as a behavior. <br /> <br /> One day, Tsukiyama saw a beautiful young girl leaning out of the window of the dance school. He fascinated her and eventually enrolled in dance lessons. He was ashamed of dancing and was afraid of laughing. He hides the fact that he is attending dance classes from his co-workers and family. <br /> <br /> There is a hilarious scene in the men's office at the office when Tsukiyama and Watanabe, colleagues That the dance interrupted Dance steps There are many other funny and warm scenes. <br /> <br /> The ending is not a fairy tale. But it makes the audience feel good. <br /> <br /> This movie helps me understand Japanese. A little better Is a movie that looks warm and worthwhile
