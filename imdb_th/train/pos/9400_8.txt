If a man in a white suit is made in America, will you not see Danny Kaye or Jerry Lewis trying to wear Sidney Stratton of Alec Guinness? <br /> <br /> This is one of Alec's best Guinness movies. Walsh and one of the best things that Aink Studios in the UK has ever appeared It fits perfectly within the time frame of the government, new workers and societies trying to create It is amazing that during the time when the capital and labor crisis can be settled, <br /> <br /> Alex Guinness, this young man, is fascinated by the idea that he can invent unnecessary clothes. Must be cleaned Every foreign matter in the minute that touches the clothes <br /> <br /> He is stubborn and he is successful. Of course, the implications that are not caused by thinking about clothes that affect society In the end, everyone chased him like a refugee, almost like Peter Lorre from M or Orson Welles in The Stranger or even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist. <br /> <br /> It is the mark of the top comedy. Visiting a potentially serious situation, such as a chase, as described in some serious movies that I mentioned can be played for laughing. Poor Guinness's set not only repels white and stains But it still shines like neon signs. <br /> <br /> In addition to Guinness, the best performances come from Cecil Parker, while Oaf is another. Joan Greenwood is the daughter of Siren and Ernest Thesiger, the largest clothing manufacturer in the United Kingdom> <br /> <br /> Think about Paramount, borrow a suit from Ealing and give John Travolta on Saturday Night Fever?
