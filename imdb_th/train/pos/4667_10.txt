I just found this movie on the VHS. After finding it for many years, I was not disappointed. It will be better every time you see Peter Ustinov starring and co-writing the original screenplay. (Academy Award nominees) Other stars you have ever known are Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Cesar Romero Ustinov as an accountant / Yakler. Recently released from the famous Wormwood Scrubs prison in England. (He embezzled from the headquarters of the conservatives who chose because he was a liberal). He began searching for a new employer from where he could embezzle and discover that the computer is the wave of the future. He is a social engineer entering the London men's club and learns the identity of the best computer expert in the city. He stole the identity of one of Caesar Smith, who had just left the city to South America to follow the hobby of gathering butterflies at night. In the forest. He talks about his path to Ta-Can-Co, an American group of companies led by Carl Clapper. (Carl Malden) Klemper hired Smith and showed him around the computer center, especially the safety features that include blinking blue light. Ustinov asked the computer how to overcome security and the computer told him that "Disconnecting the Blue Light" Using hacking techniques from 30 years in the future, Ustinov invaded the computer system and program to create a check written for various counterfeit companies. Notice the number of businesses that Ta-Can-Co appears to be doing with Ustinov's fraudulent company with help from his secretary Patty Terwilliger (Maggie Smith). Ustinov tries to avoid being prosecuted. And live a happy life forever To tell you how to make funny, intelligent, and modern images
