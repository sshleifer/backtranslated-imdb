Rock 'n' Roll High School is one of the best movies ever! I think the only reason it's great because The Ramones! You can't create the same movie and put something like Sex Pistols or The Clash instead of The Ramones. It's probably not the same. Young, clint howard, Vincent Van Patten, Mary Woronov, Paul Bartel and the monters of the hall just added to the movie. All movies are about The Ramones ... especially Joey! So everyone shows that high school Rock and Roll if you're a big fan of your real PUNK. Not a new shit, sister ... but loud and fast. The only way Ramones can do. R.I.P (Relax in peace) Joey Ramone 2494-2544 Dee Dee Ramone 2495-2545!
