As a big fan of the first Lion King, I definitely look forward to watching this movie. But I know it's not as good as the original. I know many Disney fans are careful to shoot movies directly because I have mixed feelings with them. <br /> <br /> While watching The Lion King 1½ me Try to think of what I own. Perspective about this film Will I be a very religious person about The Lion King or will I go to play in some scenes or will I get this movie to see another story of The Lion King? Most of the time I find myself hugging me. <br /> <br /> The Lion King 1½ definitely has a cute and funny time. Timon and Pumbaa stole the performance in the first movie and deserved the movie that was centered. Around them People just love these characters! The favorite part of this film includes the montage of Timon & Pumbaa that takes care of the young Simba and the surprise that comes with a good pendant. <br /> <br /> I can do without jokes in the bathroom. Many like the real thing The reason everyone bowed to the baby Simba at the beginning of the Lion King 1. I think that type of porch is for the younger set. (Which ultimately is the target audience) I don't think many children are concerned about Disney's profit margins directly. Movies to video) <br /> <br /> However, I would say I'm quite annoyed when they connect directly to the scenes from the original movie to this movie. I am just familiar with the manuscripts that those scenes emerge like the thumb that hurts for me. Some things are different from music or the sound that distracts me. <br /> <br /> For music, it's not too bad. But don't expect the classics to come from this movie. At least LK2 has a good ballad "Love Will Find a Way." For the sound, it did very well in this movie. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella work as well as ever, and even new actors, Jerry Stiller, classic comedians and Julie Cavner. (Well known as Marge Simpson) also works well as well You can enjoy these great audio capabilities as well. Check out the Virtual Safari on the 2nd disc of the DVD. The feature is really fun !! <br /> <br /> So in all cases The Lion King 1½ Not a perfect movie But it's cute and fun. I think many Lion King fans will enjoy it and thank you for what it is - fun and admirable in the Lion King masterpiece from the point of view of our funny friends. <br /> <br /> My IMDb score: 7/10 My Yahoo! Grade: B (good)
