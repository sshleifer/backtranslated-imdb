Considering the opposite situation of 2009, the truth is that we have a black president. This film has a historical significance, quite powerful. For entertainment, I found that this film is engaging and disgusting. I was certainly brought back by the blatant people at that time. But found incredible music and dancing In addition, it is quite cool to see Sammy Davis Jr. as an actor, a very young child. He plays Rufus Jones, a consoling young man from his Mammy. He says, "Why do you sometimes become president?" It was ridiculous in 1933 that it was a parody and thought of being cute, charming And funny The majority of this film is a continuous scene that can be imagined by the government as if the black people were the operators. They showed the government's seat as a revival Baptist church. <br /> <br /> The truth is that when I stumbled upon this movie, one day it pulled me in. It was very good and fun. I believe that if we can overlook racism, we can watch this movie for everything it gives us. In fact, realizing that not only But only ridiculous to have a black president But it is normal to just make this movie more relevant. It shows a clear time for our collective consciousness.
