I love this movie because in my mind it seems to be able to completely capture what I think of life in French colonial Africa, like in the 50s. A glorious ending within the last 5 minutes of this movie, you have to pay attention to what happened intently. I never felt more impressed with the "wrap" of the movie. I remember shouting "Wow!" When I knew it was over. While my two daughters slept on the bed !!
