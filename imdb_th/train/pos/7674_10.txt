I have the privilege to see "Holly" at the Edinburgh Film Festival last week. It's a powerful and moving story! Holly is a 12 year old Vietnamese girl who was sold as a prostitute by her own family and lived in a brothel in Cambodia. Patrick (American) came into Holly's life and decided that He wants to help her. When Holly was sold again, Patrick sought her. We follow them, traveling through Cambodia hard and hoping to meet each other. <br /> <br /> Holly is one of millions of children that are sold and trafficked every day. The film presents this difficult problem without crossing the line. I walked away wanting to know more about child trade problems and asked how I could help. Everyone should watch this movie because it is a beautiful story and unfolds issues that we should never overlook.
