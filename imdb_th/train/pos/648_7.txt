I decided to watch this because of suggestions from this website. I must say it's worth the effort. However, you should be careful that this movie will take about 210 minutes. If you don't have the power, keep it on the tape and watch for a few nights. <br /> <br /> Now, go to the movies. "Spoiler" and if you don't have a heart: <br /> <br /> Alexander is a clumsy, flirtatious and gig shield. He lives with an old woman named Marie. Marie is the owner of the retail shop and she gives Alex. Alex spends the day at cafes and restaurants. This story shows that Alex used to make Gilberte, which he had lived with. Gilberte left him to find a less attractive man that she didn't love because Alex had hurt and abused her. At this point, Alex is willing to take the job and help raise the child before he discovers that Gilber has canceled and plans to marry someone else. <br /> <br /> Accidentally Alexandre finds her. Nurse named Veronika and they quit the relationship. Veronica fell in love with Alex for the first time after having all the bad sex she had with men in the past. Marie and Veronica fight for Alex's love. Finally, at the end, it is revealed that Veronica is pregnant with Alex's child and Alex asks her to marry him. We consider (as mentioned in Gilberte's situation) Alexandre will get a job and be a supplier. Love and the new family that he met had hope! <br /> <br /> With the name of "La Maman and la putain" I deduce Jean Eustache related to the character of Veronika of Françoise Lebrun. She is a prostitute and she becomes a mother. So, mother and woman are the same person? Anyway, I know nothing! Most French movies (Not all) Very talkative, politically pointless, sermon, drama, not interesting, melancholy and full of words. Lebrun and Léaud play well, their insolent characters and make movies together because of some scripts. The part started to disappear slightly and disjointed. <br /> <br /> Not difficult. 7/10
