A unique movie about a confused woman (Lindsay Crouse) who is involved with a sharp male prisoner. Joe Mantegna gives the Academy Award for the highest ability in the group The first hour is absolutely fascinating, while Mantegna shows Crouse "the ropes" of his anti-game. The story begins to unravel later. But still stands as a unique image of innocent people drowned in the dark world Definitely worth the shot
