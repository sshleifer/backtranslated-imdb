I rented this movie from Netflix for two reasons - I was in the mood that I thought would be a stupid Sci-Fi-asco 50s and because it was the first Superman movie. Needless to say, after about 15 minutes, I found myself fully involved and very surprised. <br /> <br /> Experimental oil wells had penetrated the world about six miles and were closed sponsors. Down Lois and Clark appeared to receive a lap. But disappointed that the deepest drill that will never be able to use anymore One day later, a strange event at the pond made it more suitable for Superman than Clark Kent. It seems that the radioactivity of men has invaded from their home, six miles deep, near the core of the world. <br /> <br /> Supermen and Mole Men are simple pieces launched in 1951, starring leading actors That served in World War II. The moral of the story seems that Americans have the ability to be fascist like everyone else. In order to drive back home in a Superman style that is straightforward, Reeves accused the hunting group of Mole Men as 'Nazis' at one point. <br /> <br /> Even in the 1950s the basic science of movies This story does not exist six miles of penetration through the earth's crust, not even breaking through the cloak alone. "The center of the world" - in which case there is no forgiveness. - Please note that this film is based on the Golden Age comic book. <br /> <br /> The film has an irregular rhythm, although Molemen are interesting, but Creepy and well demonstrated, but there are scenes of Corman-esquire Many scenes that take too much time to show our strange behavior. The script is intelligent and economical. According to today's standards, low cost to be fair But at this time, the special effects and the cost of the film are quite good. Movies are usually very good as well, and the performance is much better than expected. I was especially impressed with Reeves, Jeff Corey and Walter Reed.
