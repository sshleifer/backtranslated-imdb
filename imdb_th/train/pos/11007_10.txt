The appearance of Jeremy Northam about Morgan Sullivan, crafty with gentle manners and watching him let the debris and pieces of his true identity under the influence of a single malt He offered her to smoke at the bar as an old habit without thinking or even asking, and he lost his face, neck and lips. No matter what the brainwashing will be, love has a way to strive. Love can not "brainwash" with his two fake wives. At a gradual stage, he began to deal with his glasses to walk and talk differently, and even his face looked different when the movie went. Great music, sexy hypnosis and driving properly sometimes The use of black and white and gray tones extensively makes this movie a "Noir movie" is almost a tradition of classic thriller. I would like to see more loopholes in Lucy Liu's image whenever she sees him in many chaotic states, those she loves and those who perform her mission according to blind faith. Her performance is less. She couldn't compare to the abilities of Northampton. But I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and enjoyed the knowledge of other films written by the same author
