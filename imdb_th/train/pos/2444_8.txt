"GEORGE LOPEZ" in my opinion is an ABC classic, of course! I didn't see every episode But i still enjoy it There are many episodes that I like. One of them is that Amy (Sandra Bullock) walks into moving parts. If you want to know why you must see by yourself Before I finish this story, I want to say that everyone always has good performance. The design of the production is excellent. In summary, although now can watch new episodes But I suggest you catch it in case it goes out in the air well
