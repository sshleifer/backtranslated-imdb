It is a great pleasure to see a large piece of art that has been converted into another piece without distortion or invention. I do not guess how this piece of literature can be rebuilt as a movie that should be worth watching. If you love Bulgakov's books, you will understand and be afraid to see the wrong interpretation that occurred for the art film project, rather than bringing the profound meaning of the story to the screen. There are some examples of this story with Master and Margarita. Complex and profound, while this story is a movie that has nothing to come out It's like the filmmakers read Bulgakov's work in the same way that the band conductors read the score - without missing a note. Why can't we find this talented person here in the United States? Now my favorite books and movies have the same name.
