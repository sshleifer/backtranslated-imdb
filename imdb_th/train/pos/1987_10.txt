This movie is great! I can't beat it. I think I'm too old for a musical. But this movie deserves credit here! My favorite thing is Jack Wild. I am a British actor lover. You can't stop me from looking good-looking young men. I never knew when Jack was doing this movie. He was sixteen! He seemed eleven years old. He's short. That's what helps. Try posting your answers, posting friends, so I can relate to your experience. Oh, and about Oliver Reed, that guy Billings. I think the drone look is familiar. Is there any idea that he had starred before? If so, post it up. I really want to know.
