I was really shocked to see the number of comments affecting this movie. This film is not intended to be a movie that "Think deeply" which is what most investigators seem to think should be In fact, it appears that if any movie that does not create a life-changing understanding and plot of scary and distorted stories, they will give you a score of 1 or 2. Don't leave the movie because you don't like people. <br /> <br /> This movie is an action / comedy movie, and that's all that is intended and for Action / Comedy is very well done. Actually, I'm quite surprised that I enjoyed it. It's as much as I have never been a fan of Jamie Foxx and has no plans to use than it has <br /> <br /> featuring unexciting. General criminals leave prison and are thrown into the plot of the bad guys while trying to clean up their actions (see Blue Streak, Hudson Hawk, 48 hours, etc., etc.) but it's also warm. Technological twists, now "bad guys" are actually "good people" and "bad guys". Actually, it's uber-geek. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx plays a really funny person while at the same time quite smart and The main character is serious and does not try to refute the humor on the side of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a deep hidden plot, such as in "The Matrix" or a drama like "Mice and Men" So this movie isn't right for you. But if you enjoy the action scenes, excellent shooting, fast-paced and occasional humor that is thrown away, this movie will not let you down. Usually, I give about 8 points (in the same level as Die Hard Trilogy) but give 10 points to try and bring the score to the level that should be <br /> <br />
