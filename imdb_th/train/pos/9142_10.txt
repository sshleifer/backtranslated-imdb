Purple rain ... what can I say? But I think all actors choose well. This film has a wonderful story. I like it! Since I watched that movie, I was stuck in eighty and I'm only 13! My favorite part of this movie was when his father died and he collected all his songs and Apollonia sat on the stairs with his ears. Critics say it's a drama. But I think it's more love Murphy Brown has done a great job in the movie. He really acts like himself. I'm glad to see this movie. Purple Rain song sings beautifully. I cry more than once
