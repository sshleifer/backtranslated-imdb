After examining this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years, I must say that it does not lose any magic or martial arts actions that are so striking that I remember from my childhood. The story of the dying martial arts instructor sends "unfinished" students to the 5 members of their past poisonous tribe, so they do not seek the fortune that Master's friends kept hidden. Fearing that his last pupil was not trained enough, he ordered him to be a friend with one of the five "poison" in order to eliminate the other four. <br /> <br /> I can't say enough. About choreography or cameras, working on good movies in their own way and quite possibly one of the best martial arts movies ever made in classics !!
