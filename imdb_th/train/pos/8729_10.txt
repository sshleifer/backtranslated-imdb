Bug's Life is a very good animation feature. This movie is for young children. But it is a great movie for people who are my age A story about an ants named Flik. He brought a disaster to his colony when he destroyed the food that was a better locust He was exiled and he had to find a bigger error to solve the problem. This movie is a classic movie because it is a good movie and a Pixar movie. The animation is excellent, especially in the late 1990s. The story is good, but a little more detailed enough. Performing with sound is as good as most animated movies. Good music. Listen to nothing special. But it has been nominated for one of the music categories Overall, this movie shocked me. This is a good movie for every family. I rate this movie 10/10.
