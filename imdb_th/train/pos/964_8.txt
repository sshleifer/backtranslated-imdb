"Yokai Daisenso" is a children's movie by Takashi Miike, but as you would expect, it may be too dark and scary for children. However, older children may eat this thing well, that is, if you play it, it is called English. br /> <br /> The story of a boy who moved with his mother to live With his grandfather after divorce During the festival, the boys village was chosen as "Kirin riders", which is a great honor. But with that honor, danger and many adventures, of course. <br /> <br /> At the same time, evil acts are in the hands of women. In the white mini skirt, the Koji boots and honeycomb hairstyles teamed up with the evil Yogi to change people's discontent and leave things to do with them. And this evil shows the city of flying in the form of monsters that head to the city of anger Tokyo One scene that is quite funny. There are two Derelicts watching the monster flying over the city ... One says, "Oh, it's just one game." <br /> <br /> The little boy has made friends with Yokai, who is an animal. One kind of strange, mostly kind, separated from humans and all the Yogi groups in Japan gathered to fight evil. <br /> <br /> <br /> In many ways, Miike & crew Bring the Yokai movie in the late 60's / The 70-year-old and a genre action adventure that modern kids (old) that incorporates a mechanical monster that made me think. The look and feel of this film is great. Some fun and humorous effects will pass through the child's head, but older people may enjoy it. For adults, there is nothing like this. If you are a fan of Japanese monster movies, you will enjoy this story. <br /> <br /> Cool and fun things. But maybe that is just Miike .. and the driving is fierce 8 out of 10
