This is one of those amazing rare moments on TV that I want to catch VHS forever. Will it not air again? <br /> <br /> It's very creative and I remember it aired. Once a week and waiting for the next episode I want to see it again I want to buy I need something that I don't have. Don't use it with EBAY. <br /> <br /> So, as much provocative as one of the best series in the 80s, it should be a classic. But lost in space At least this website and Wikipedia talk about it. Sob. <br /> <br /> It's the most attractive, funny, flirting and original story. Probably not like the original manuscript of Sherlock Holmes. Actually, I think Quintin is much more attractive and has a better chance with his female lead.
