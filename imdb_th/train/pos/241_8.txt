I'm bored that people will judge the movie. "Their historical accuracy" is a movie that people !! Writers and directors should rotate their own stories! There are many movies that are all wrong about history, Braveheart, Wyatt Earp, Gangs of New York, Geronimo: American Legend, The Last of the Mohicans .... All the great movies that There is a slight discrepancy in the past. If you want to see a few great actors doing what they do best, I suggest you watch this movie and not worry about the accuracy of the facts. Just enjoy the quality of the movie, the story and one of the greatest actors of our generation.
