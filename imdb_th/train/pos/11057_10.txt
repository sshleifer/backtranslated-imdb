I am 10 years old when this program is broadcast on TV. Which I like very much The actors are very reliable. Alexandra Bassedo is very beautiful .... I just ordered a DVD (15 episodes). They have no magical power. They have superior human skills. (Strength, hearing, vision) The three actors are very good when they believe. There are good stories in each episode. At that time, there were no special effects or explosions everywhere, so the script was considered good. There are no fancy things like in other programs. They don't try to create jokes every 2 minutes to create a light show. I recommend this TV program to anyone who likes good things.
