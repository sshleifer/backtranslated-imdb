Let me set the scene It's a school holiday and nothing in the movie at all. I am with my friends, decide what to watch. We search for movies that are going to start soon and "The Grinch" will happen. We buy tickets without knowing what will happen. What we get is a roller coaster of fun. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey (which I might add as my number 1 performer in the world) is definitely beautiful as a Grinch in the movie. The best of Ron Howard to Apollo 13) The way to create this movie, the scenery, the actors, props and music is amazing. It makes this young movie alive. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the story of Grinch. While we all know that Grinch is a horrible person who can't stand the Christmas. He lives higher than whoville and never mixes with the townspeople. But a little girl is about to change the appearance of The Grinch about life and other matters very seriously. <br /> <br /> Cindy Lou Who (played by cute new actor Taylor Momsem) finds With Grinch as part of him immediately, she tries to break the wall and help Grinch move in and mingle with the people in the city. <br /> <br /> This movie is all a laugh for the whole family, kids and SOLID Guardian 10/1 0 Well done. <br /> <br />
