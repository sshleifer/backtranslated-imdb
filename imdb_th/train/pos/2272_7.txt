Nick Nolte gave Kurt Vonnegut a brilliant performance in the dark story as Howard W. Campbell, who is a double agent working in propaganda during World War II. After the war, he had an anonymous life until a rival group wanted to dig his past. Like most of Vonnegut's work, this is meditation, nonsense of war, and those who use propaganda for their own purposes. Nolte is great - self-confident and confident, like Campbell's sister, then shattered and haunted as an old man who was forced to recoup the sins of the past (7 out of 10)
