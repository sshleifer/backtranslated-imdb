Laputa: The sky castle is a blast. The message is as strong as his new work and the pirates are pure, amazing and can fly more. The art is great and the soundtrack, which has been used many times after this (I'm not sure if this is the first time I heard it or not) and encouraged me to feel the most intense emotional response of the Sheeta movie soundtrack. Good example - He lives on his own! The plot is classic Miyazaki. I will not leave it. But in the end it was really wonderful I rated Miyazaki as one of the three best with Nausicaa and Spirited Away. You may also want to check out Howl's moving castle when it comes out. (Sometimes next year, I hope) If you like Miyazaki, take a look here because it's available in the United States. Enjoy Piper A
