Quick and funny satire about "Reality TV" Original TV drama Script by playwright Robert Harling filled with one liners and ridiculous situations Their best thing is the climax point of the live broadcast that is rapidly deteriorating in a bad improv and brain transplantation. Keven Kline kills his line because he doesn't wear his glasses. Joke "Her brain will explore a few more in the next house." A great actor is on the same page as Kline Sally Field, Elizabeth Shue, Cathy Moriarty, Robert Downey Jr., Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, Garry Marshall. And Kathy Najimy is perfect It's a way to see the click of a cast like in this movie. This is a classic car that has slipped through the cracks. <br /> <br /> P.S. Score by Alan Silvestri is an additional bonus. It is suitable for TV series with colorful and beautiful air.
