The only reason I know about Midnight Cowboy is because it's in the top 100 of AFI Critic. For the top 100, it's not a well-known movie. Actually, I have to look for a hard copy. I get a half price DVD. Surprisingly, it was rated only M15 + (Uncut version) <br /> <br /> I wonder how many people will notice this review. (Like more comments) So I will make it short. <br /> <br /> This may be one of the strangest movies I have ever seen, partly because of the use of art photography montages. (Very artistic home) and unusual styles There are many things in movies that I still don't understand. (I've seen it twice) and it causes emotional confusion. <br /> <br /> The filming and acting were very good. The characters that are larger than life, which make this film memorable The main character is Joe Buck 'Cowboy' from Texas who moved to New York to be a male prostitute. He met with Conman, a disabled person, Enrico 'Ratso' Rizzo, and of course they became friends who had to go through normal escape. What makes this movie interesting is that the two characters are very different. <br /> <br /> I feel that this movie doesn't really develop the relationship between Buck and Enrico Rizzo in order for the audience to be connected. Towards true emotions Quite sad and sad You probably already know what happened from reading reviews. But it's very clear from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I think the film is beautiful and surpassed the main theme. The exclusion of humanity (Performed by the darkness of city streets, tenements destroyed) Most of the characters in the movie are outside the law (conman, giggolo.etc), but you can't like them. Joe Buck is loved because he is without Be naive and look optimistic while we begin to feel pity on Ratso in this movie. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is ranked very high. It's time in time (and even now). It's not a general movie. (Rather the art of the house) During the time when the cinema was dominated by weary westerners, music and theater plays with unusual themes such as the Midnight Cowboy appeared. <br /> <br /> On the personal level, I must say that I Like a lot of movies The picture shows the dreamy quality. I like the scenes in parties, music, images and other things in your heart for a long time after watching. However, as a movie for entertainment, it lacks a bit. (Not really my style movie) with excitement This is a movie that needs to be admired and admired instead of being an exciting action movie. <br /> <br /> Although I don't think I have the qualification to analyze this movie. But their characters and motivation are quite interesting From what I understand from the events that happened, Joe Buck was sexually abused as a child from his grandmother, even though it didn't seem relevant to the story. He is a lucky young stud that suppresses his dark memories. The religious meaning in this film is also confusing. Some people suggest a homosexual connection between Buck and Ratso, although I don't see where they get the idea. The theme of homosexual sex is generally more than touching in their conversations and later in the encounter of Joe Buck and the lonely old man. <br /> <br /> Of course, from a technical point of view, one of the best films of the decade (there are more than 70 feelings, more than feelings of the 60s) and a revolution to experience. Few other film objects dare to do. While it has a simple but touching story (hidden with a hard edge), the beauty of this film is in a psychedelic strange sequence.
