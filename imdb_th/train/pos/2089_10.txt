"The Good Earth" is a great movie that you no longer hear. There are many catastrophes and big events, but it's a love story that is not passionate. All of this happened in no more than two hours, which is short of today's standards. Special techniques and costumes are very good at that time. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that Luise Rainer has won an Oscar in a limited role. She has only three emotions: give up, hungry and broken br>> <br /> The performances of Asian and American-Asian actors are excellent. <br /> <br />
