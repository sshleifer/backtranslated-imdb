I'm watching the series back and forth as soon as possible. I'm trying to see everything in Star Trek. This is the 3rd month. And now I'm in TNG's 3rd season and I've gone through the DS9 completely. Star Trek is the greatest TV phenomenon ever experienced. <br /> <br /> "Shades of Gray" is the first episode of the TNG series. When watching these shows, these clips are fresh in my heart. But I noticed that a few of them were shot again because the movie looked better. Season 1 seemed to be gloomy and ugly for me - and the actors looked stupid as they didn't fit their own skin. br /> <br /> The performance is based on the greatest popularity of happiness. And the most sad moment in Riker's life in Enterprise. Up to this point, the Data and Riker scenes in holo-deck were the classic moments of new friendships. Another thing I like is when the second officer of the Klingon ship challenges Riker's power as the first officer and Mr Riker defeats the live CRAP from Klingon. Then the Admiral kicked him in $$, but good. All of this story is a reminder that there are so many wonderful things going on in two seasons, along with 5 more stories and a few movies! At this point in the series, they began to develop the emotions that tied Riker and Deanna Troi to Imzadi. Until this point, they had spoken the truth. But they have not yet utilized Recorded showing that ST Wiki - Alpha Memory claims that Imzadi means "first person" and states that she has a close relationship with Riker and remains intimate with emotions. Now proving that there will be a romantic interest for a long time. <br /> <br /> Here is the article: http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Imzadi by this point. In the series, the production value depends on the speed and Star Trek TNG comes into the sci-fi that it is designated as. Watching again as an adult, now I see what the great actor of the Star Trek universe has given them the need to create a new ST program.
