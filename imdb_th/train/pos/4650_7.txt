As an employee of the Swedish Air Force, I enjoyed the Gripen flight scene and Hkp 9 (MBB Bo 105) in this movie. One of the minor disappointments is the EWS jammer pod. In this case, the missile inertial Rb 75 (eccentric) is painted black with the letter "EWS 39". The white side of the jammer pod actually does not look like that. br /> <br /> But other than that, it's an entertaining movie with a fun ending. (Last minute) Anyone interested in seeing many Swedish military units, including the legendary SSG, should now see this picture. <br /> <br />
