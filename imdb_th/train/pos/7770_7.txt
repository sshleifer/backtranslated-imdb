"Written on the Wind" is the melody of Douglas Sirk Douglas Sirk was discovered by "Cahiers du Cinema", Fassbinder, etc. that praised him as the main director - I think it's because of the complexity of his film "Written on the Wind" presents beautiful colors and beautiful decorations. But I ask myself: Is it enough to bring a movie? The performances in "Written on the Wind" range from weak to fair (except Robert Stack - He believes that Playboy is the caller. Weak and spoiled) Lauren McCall said, usually appearing on the screen, he has the power in this film. Dorothy Malone, as a deceitful woman, "femme fatale" that is carefree is ok. But she lacks strength for this chapter Rock Hudson is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The story has a very interesting mix. The main character is: <br /> <br /> Strong old people <br /> <br /> His alcoholic son Kyle (Robert Stack) (never loved a disappointed father) <br /> <br /> His disappointment and the daughter of a nymphomaniac Marylee (Dorothy Malone) <br /> <br /> Lucy (Lauren Bacall ) - The woman of principle used to be a secretary and married to Kyle. <br /> <br /> Mitch (Rock Hudson) together with Kyle and the love of the elder <br /> <br /> The secret above the door , Love triangle, frustration, finisher, laughter, death, etc. - Well, when I read the summary of the DVD's back cover, I think The purpose of the treatment. My mistake! why? I will try to explain: "Written on the Wind" Seriously and trying to tell an amazing story. As I said before, the performance in general is not good enough - violence is lacking. There are many strong scenes in the story. But the actors work effectively I think there may be Italian or Spanish actors. Those scenes will be fully explored - they will end (for us) in the explosion of laughter or tears. <br /> <br /> The remaining things for We are the beautiful film of Douglas Sirk. For me it's not enough. If you want to enjoy a good melodrama, look at "Aventurera".
