Some slightly suspicious performances I remember Alexander Walker (The critics of Evening Standard, right now, he's dead) is about the film, which says it's a shame that shows that the NI Protestants are now murderers with respect to the protesters. NI All of this movie is based on Shankill Butchers (loyal people) and those who traveled to Belfast in 1970. Believe me, they didn't call for a meat trader for anything. My main lament about this film is that it does not show light or hope. It is destruction and melancholy. I mean, a small woman at the end must die. Maybe this sounds strange, but it might be witty that Prods & tiags aren't all good or good.
