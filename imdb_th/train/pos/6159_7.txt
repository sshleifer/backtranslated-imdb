This place in England during the year 1940, three orphans (Cary Charles and Paul) was sent to live with Miss Price. (Angela Lansbury) She doesn't need them. It seems that she is learning to be a witch through the correspondence course with the College of Witchcraft (OK - I know this is a family movie, but - College of Witchcraft ??? Come ON !! ) Before she can finish the course even though the college is closed because of the war (???) and she tries to down Professor Brown (David Tomlinson) and she and the children travel around on the bed with the help of a magical magician. <br /> <br /> I saw this first time when I was 9 years old and remembered. That love it Not sure whether to be an adult! The story is stupid. (Even in imagination) Children are horrible actors and one of them (Charles) is incredibly disgusting. In addition, Roddy McDowall will be charged for the third time and will appear in two short scenes. Only story! There is also a trip to the Isle of Naboombu which is managed by an animation animal. I think it might be fun. But the animation is bad (For Disney) and it has an intense and long football game between animals. Lansbury and Tomlinson are great. The song (while forgetting) is happy; The long dance sequence on Portobello Street is colorful and full of energy and special effects that have won the Oscar are still quite impressive at the end. But the story is weak, poor animations, and children like no one really pull this I heard that the extended version is even worse! I can only give 7 items.
