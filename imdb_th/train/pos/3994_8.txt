I went to watch this movie just because I was dragged there and I would go out again because most viewers were elderly and I felt guilty. However, this film is the most charming and far from being targeted to the elderly. All characters are real and very reliable and I find myself discussing movies, characters and stories after several hours. There are scenes that are quite bustling in it. But necessary and help you understand the situation better Overall, this film is a great and valuable movie that is not in the mainstream. But that does not mean that the film will not get the attention of movie lovers. It's an exciting and interesting movie experience.
