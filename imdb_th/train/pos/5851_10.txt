* Spoiler * <br /> <br /> This is just the second pay-per-view that I received. The first perfect 10 was the Royal Kong in 1991. It was filled with interesting matches. Excited that is not memorable, fun, disposable. And that's the reason I like it. <br /> <br /> The opening match between Razor and DiBiase, including Ludvig Borga and Marty Jannetty, is just a low score. They use the match, but DiBiase deserves a better pay in his final pay per match. Today, this match should have a meeting point and a great climax for the first major babyface of the razor and Jannetty. Fresh from the continent's call will have a better match with Borga, but I don't think anyone really cares They only need Borga to pay for watching television. <br /> <br /> IRS and The Kid are great, just like Michaels and Perfect. I hope Perfect will be the winner, but Michael won't give up. Notice that after this he left the WWF so he didn't have to go to find a razor. Brett Hart had a great brawl twice with Dole ink. Their classic competition That's why the cracks in that year are not a simple game. How often do you see the two legends winning this feud in their careers? <br /> <br /> Steiner's Heaven Body competition is one of the best of the year. Who knows that the stars can occupy themselves with one of the best teams ever? <br /> <br /> Many people say that the competition. The Undertaker-Giant Gonzalez is a waste of time. But i like it very much Remember that what makes the old WWF (as well as pre-WWE) great is the combination of athleticism and strange performances. Is there a spirit that doesn't like Akeem? <br /> <br /> The main activity is not bad, even if there is no status close to the year. They put Lex Luger But choose wisely to let Yokosuna keep the belt He is the first heel since Superstar Graham holds the belt for more than two months. Today, the heel is the champion all the time. But from the beginning of the WWWF through WWF of the 90s, if you blink, you miss the heel position. <br /> <br /> As a wrestling fan, this old school and SummerSlam '88 are my favorites.
