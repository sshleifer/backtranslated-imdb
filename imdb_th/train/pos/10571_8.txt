James Cagney is well known for his strong character and gangster. But he played a soft character in his career This drama is one of them and it is the first movie that is not the last Cagney to be shown in the movie. <br /> <br /> Cagney is singing in this drama. And must say that he is not that bad He played the role with great confidence. Obviously, he had a dance at a young age before his acting career began to grow enormously, so it is not uncommon for him to play a musical role in his career. Apparently he felt comfortable in a completely different form than most people were familiar with. See him. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Lloyd Bacon, which may be one of the best directors. His earliest 30s musical plays would rather define musical genres, and he was also responsible for genres such as "42nd Street". His musicals were light and fun to watch and comedy. 'Always like other things'. 30's Musicals are never about singing. This is something that is more prominent in the 40s and later created most musicals from the MGM studio. <br /> <br /> As usual, it has a light and simple story. The music world is definitely predictable and proceeds as a formula. However, it's a fun and simple story that makes this movie a fascinating story. So the characters and actors who portray them The sort of weird, though, that the entire plot line of the movie has been a sort of neglect at the end of the movie when the movie just starts with a number of musical routines. way The ending of the movie was fun and well done, even though I'm not a big fan of this genre. The musical number again also includes Billy Barty, a young man. He often plays as a boy / small boy / little boy and his other career, including the movie "Gold Diggers of 1933" one year ago. <br /> <br /> Recommended default movie <br /> <br /> 8/10
