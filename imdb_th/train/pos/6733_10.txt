There is a story about the latest movie surfing that I seem to run across without warning. I caught this treasure with a digital cable this week and it was a surprise! The focus is on the pioneers of the big wave from the 60s Greg Noll to our current Laird Hamilton from Waimea Bay to the Mavericks to the Jaws of Hell. I can watch movies about Laird Hamilton, one of the great athletes of the era. This - so the rest is gravy. There are many good surfing, including past and present surfer interviews in a pleasant, relaxed and unpretentious way. From all the surf films I've seen, this tells the story of the best big wave and I think it's my favorite story. Have fun!
