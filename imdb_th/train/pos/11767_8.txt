It's a very good movie! Made Men is a great action movie that has a lot of twists and turns. James Belushi is great as a former boss who stole 12 million people from a boss who had to fight with gangsters, his outskirts, his wife and Local sheriff (Timothy Dalton) You won't be disappointed. Jump on board and enjoy riding. 8 out of 10
