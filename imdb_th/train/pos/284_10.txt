The only season that aired in Australia and I think it's great! I love it! The whole story is great! And a more realistic view of today's teenage and family life But it still has the value of a strong family to join together and live together Their problems are real and it attracts you into the show. The show is about this family called 'day' and their lives. The family consists of Abby Day (mother), Jack Day (father), Natalie Day (sporty daughter), One Cooper (outsider son), and Nathan Day (intelligent son). With their Coopers perspective on things all over it I love his deep understanding throughout the performance. It's a great story. He is my favorite character It ended with many things that it could continue. I'm really sorry that other seasons were not created. It's a great performance. I will miss it.
