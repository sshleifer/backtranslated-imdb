The first episode of this famous horror series presents a woman who was a gang of black men who tortured her for several days before killing her. Finally, before killing her, she was finally beaten around the chair. Grilling endlessly nailing her finger The courage of the animal was thrown at her. The boiling water was poured on her and eventually her eyes were pierced. (The scene that is very hot and nasty) The creator of this memorable torture is trying to make it as real as possible for me. One thing is the closest thing to a film about the smell that you will receive without killing people on the tape. Of course, some special techniques are quite bad. But the idea of ​​creating the smell is quite gruesome. I have seen "The flower of flesh and blood" which is full of blood and sadistic But less disturbing. However, this is a must see for horror fans!
