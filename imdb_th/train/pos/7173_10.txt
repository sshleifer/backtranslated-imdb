I just watched the documentary "Fog City Mavericks" on the cable network Starz. No doubt it is one of my most enjoyable viewing experiences! It records artists in the San Francisco Bay area and the creative ability that is responsible for the best movies ever. In addition to the famous artists on the list, including the segments with Irvin Kershner, Caleb Deschanel and the segment about Pixar Animation Studios. I hope it will be released on DVD - this is a must for any collection. With the history of movies and the creation of great movies If you are interested in movies and those who create movies remotely, you won't be disappointed.
