This movie is one of my childhood favorites and I have to say that unlike other movies that I liked during that time, The Thief of Bagdad has adhered to quality as I grew up. This is not just a movie that children will enjoy. But it can also be viewed and enjoyed by adults The only drawback is that it is something that cannot see the past, bad consequences. (Compared to the current impact), just as can be done when one is a child I can't remember those things. Of course, it's been about ten years since I watched this movie when I was eleven years old. Who will see the effect? Just search for good stories and entertainment, and this is what this film has given. In my opinion, this movie is one of the first great adventure movies of the 20th century. When thinking about it, I felt that Indiana Jones was quite like this movie. There are romantic jokes and adventures all in one place, which creates wonderful ingredients that will catch you from start to finish and even if this film is old and the music and style of this film is not modern. Dusty and old All of this is due to the great story, good governance and good performances of the actors in that department. Sabu (as Abu) and Conrad Veidt (as Jaffar) stand out by providing the most funny and cool elements of the movie Great movie and even though it is' oldie 'but it is gold goldie' I hope someone will have a brain and dare to release this on a DVD someday. <br /> <br /> 8 from 10
