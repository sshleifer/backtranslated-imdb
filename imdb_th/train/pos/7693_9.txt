"GOOD TIMES" in my opinion it is CBS Hits! Although I have never seen every time But i still enjoy it It's hard to say which one I like. In addition, I really love music. If you ask me, even if I like everyone, it would be good if everyone is on the show throughout the show. Everyone always gives good performance. The production design is excellent. The costumes are well designed and the writing is very strong. In summary, although it can be seen on TV Land, now I suggest you catch it in the event that it goes out in the air
