Spacecamp is my favorite movie. It is a wonderful story and inspires others. <br /> <br /> The performance was fantastic and my wife and I went to see Thompson meadows in Cabarete the following year. Because of her performance in the movie It's a pity that the challenger's accident is delayed and causing the movie to be hurt. <br /> <br /> The 20th anniversary of the incidents of the challenger is coming. I know one of the astronauts' nominees from childhood at the Carnegie Mellon campus where my father went to school. I also know the last pilot's friend. <br /> <br /> I received a technical examination last year for the National BSA for astronomy. Scout Boy Scout and I also found Spacecamp as a great movie at Suggest that Scouts make merit badges related to the space that I teach. <br /> <br /> I ran into the astronaut late again as an adult and followed the engineering study schedule that we gathered. Rotate the Challenger blew up. I sat down with Willard Rockwell and his "invisible" engineer who was going to do things after the accident at the Astrotech shareholder meeting. Accidentally, so I was close to accidents and movies that were very similar. I made sure that I was a good student and graduated with a degree four years later. Strangely enough, the advice of a Rockwell engineer told them not to fly the Challenger in 1986 and those who created Endeavor later.
