The movie "Men in White" is one of the funniest movies, if not the most funny comedy I have ever seen! (And I look quite a lot!) About two Garbagemen who became "Men in White" and stopped the invasion from space. It is also a parody of many classic movies such as "Men in Black", "Star Wars" or "Dr. Strangelove". Anyone who says that this movie is crappy has something wrong with his head. There are many jokes and jokes here and you may get injured in your mouth from laughing too hard. (It happened to me!) If you can watch this movie on TV, watch it - you won't regret it!
