I think this movie is great. It's hilarious. Kinda reminds me of the Spinal Tap. This is a must see for rock fans of the 1970s. (I hope my friends and I won't be like that in twenty years!) ) <br /> <br /> Bill Nynia gave a great performance as a terrifying lead singer who tried to recapture that old spirit. Stephen was completely in the movie because the glue tried to hold Band together <br /> <br /> If you love music and have been in a band, this movie is for you. You won't regret seeing this movie. I know i can't Even my family found it funny and that said something.
