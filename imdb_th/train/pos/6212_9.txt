I have a lot of passion for this film, although it looks a little more 'polished' than Fred and Ginger's other movies, but I don't have to talk about Harriet Hill's minor problems with casting. <br /> <br /> Again with these movies, the plot is of secondary effect - Astaire plays a rather unlikely sailor. (Which happened to be a great former horn (of course!) And Rogers, the actor who wanted to Lively music hall Although their relationship is bright and fun to watch, they are immersed in the main story that is not related to Hilliard and Randolph Scott, who is not successful in finding chemistry. Between them <br /> <br /> Although it was a last minute decision But Hillard made a strange appearance in this story because she had no screen to give this movie what he wanted, despite being sweet and cute. This film may have been instrumental in promoting the brilliance of the braille character of Lucille Ball's world in a larger role because she just flashed in every small scene and will make Helen Broad. Derry, 'Stage Door', in the following year, is an example of a wonderful scene between two great actresses. Eventually, the characters in Scott's era eventually fall in love with Hilliard. It's hard to Believe over Astaire that is in the Navy! <br /> <br /> Now go to the important parts, singing and dancing: nothing to say about "Let's Face the Music and Dance" besides the wonderful and moving and perfectly performed and I Often ending that scene With tears in my eyes However, other songs in this movie deserve recognition as well. "I put all my eggs in one basket" is a lovely example of Astaire and Rogers' funny instincts and almost stimulates the fun of their natural dance moves. Other highlights Is "I want to be a leader" and "let yourself go", which shows that these two talents can act alone alone as well. I almost forgot to mention that this is one of the few times. (If not only) that we see Astaire playing good on the piano It seems that the talent of this man is endless. <br /> <br /> Overall, I like to 'Top Hat' and 'Swing Time' (even if it's just) because it is earthy and performs like Enthusiastic by everyone involved It's hard not to like the fun factor.
