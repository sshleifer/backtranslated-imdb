I voted 8 for this movie due to some minor bugs. In addition, this movie is one of my favorites! It's fun to say the least. The filming scene was ridiculous and I thought Gackt (the author of the book) used too much of his "Matrix obsession". It seems that their enemies are standing there ... Waiting for a shot. However, this movie is fascinated and it makes me cry always. It has a lot of great humor. It makes me laugh too. Gackt is a great actor that I have to say .. He shows a lot of emotions. This is the first performance of Hyde and he is ok. The right role for him Lee Hom Palace is really excellent. All the actors are what I would say is suitable for this movie. Don't miss!
