I will not claim to be a fan of Ralph Bakshi because I am not I only watch 5 animated movies: Coonskin, Wizards, Fritz the Cat and the Lord of the Rings and finally "Fire and Ice". What I claim is that I find that "Fire and Ice" is the most fun game of the game. It's a straightforward fantasy story of the sword and magic along the Conan the Barbarian, but beautiful art, realistic animations, and lively movie scores make it a classic charm in this movie. > <br /> is an animation I don't care what people say about rotation. But in my opinion, Ralph Bakshi uses that technique effectively here. I was amazed by the movement of realistic characters. The style of directing and designing the realistic characters of the photos makes "Fire and Ice" feel like a massive fantasy blockbuster, more economical than a cartoon. Sadly, the details of the artwork tend to be slightly inconsistent, especially near the end of the movie. Some scenes are flat, with little or no shape, or a folded cloth and a shadow on the characters. <br /> <br /> With realistic animated characters, not just action moves Only But it's really cruel I dare to compare the brutality of the action with the live action movie Zack Snyder 300. I can see that even if there is blood shed. But the blood was still the least Again, a great choice by a creative team that increases the viewing experience without doing too many things. "Above" <br /> <br /> Although I don't know "big names" in the actors' voice. Performers manage to deliver satisfactory performance; Keeping the delivery of every line, being softly realistic and interrupting only in the case of bad people. <br /> <br /> Am I saying bad people? Yes, I do. Because that's what is a story about good standards compared to evil. Nothing is original about the subject that appears to be just a mix of pre-existing fantasy film clich√©s involving armored warriors and little girls. Anyone looking for "depth" will be very disappointed. Their characters are not much developed and some people like Nekron and Darkwolf are one of the best dimensions. (I've heard rumors about some deleted scenes that describe Darkwolf's obsession with killing Nekron, and his mother was included in the final cut to increase the depth of the show). I wouldn't be surprised to find that this movie is just "Technological demonstrations" of all types to show excellent animation and art, with stories circling together and being thrown into later "proper" movies. <br /> <br /> True classic of The past "Fire and Ice" clearly captures the spirit of adventure and magic with beautiful rendering of creatures and charming characters. It is a unique vision of the world created by Ralph Bakshi and the artist Frank Frazetta with good and suspicious action. <br /> <br /> Will it follow the current animated film standards? Absolutely not. But I would like fans of general animation "Get rid of your horse" and give the opportunity to grow with you. Is a jewel of the 80s that is worth checking out
