This is the most attractive and wonderful performance that Robert Taylor had given him, even more than his great performance, while "Johnny Eager" came full 14 years after that film. His face is still a surprising thing to see. But now he has maturity that makes him a brave and violent role. Charlie Gilson (Taylor) is the last of his species, a buffalo hunter who can't kill for money. But for happiness Killing his eyes not only But only buffalo But still a human being He is a lonely person who needs people around him. But they don't like him because of his anti-social behavior His partner is Sandy McKenzie (Stewart Granger) who is not comfortable in hunting and walking because he has failed otherwise. Along the way, Charlie kills an Indian family and captures Debra Pagent. The beautiful Charlie tries to seduce her to no avail. But saw that Sandy was interested in her as well. Granger was very sad to see so tired of being hunted and wanting to go with her women and children. And playing with rhythm Russ Tampin plays as a half species, trying to live in a white world. This group is a combination of good and evil, both young and old. In the end, Taylor was hit by a ghost of several predatory buffalo before him and ran away from the girl and Sandy. When he returned that night, Sandy went out with the woman, causing Charlie to rampage to kill to find Sandy and have the woman come by himself. The final confrontation took place in a snowstorm, and the final scene was so shocking that you would never forget it. It was Taylor's movie all the way, and he was a much younger actor of that time.
