Although I bought the DVD when it first came out and watched it many times, I never wrote a review. <br /> <br /> I like it when I first saw it and I still love it. <Br /> <br /> Sadly, it seems that it doesn't make enough money to encourage everyone to follow up. I have to assume that QT still controls the rights, but after Kill Bill, if he makes a movie that is the true story of the comic book and my name is Modesty, along with the strong female lead, others who are not familiar with the characters will see things This is a let down. <br /> <br /> Peter Donnell wrote his story to focus on the psychological suspicion over the thriller. <br /> <br /> The feelings between Mo desty and Miklos is very true With the resources and the tension, vigilance and interest for anyone who does not need blood and explosions. Alexandra works great to show how O'Donnell's characters can control the situation. <br /> <br /> I found this, especially before reaching the curve of Batman and James Bond's reboot. After two previous attempts, even though it is not known to the public But this is a reboot of the Modesty character and it is really sad that there may be no movie about her again.
