Bad reviews here for this and I understand why. But consider it to be a serial killer movie with a limited budget and you may get more. Most <br /> <br /> I think it works because after that Dirty and want to take a long shower, so that is a level of success, right? <br /> <br /> I want to say that it has the right level of killing here to be under your skin. Although the show may be possible A bit uneven too David Hess is a single person so don't expect much if you like the last house. <br /> <br /> Other than that - worth watching.
