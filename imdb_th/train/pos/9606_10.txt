This is the best movie I have ever seen about Bulimia. It enters the exact point of what Bulimia is about and the way is not always about being skinny and dieting. It shows that people with Bulimia syndrome often think about things Such as life view, friends and myself The best thing and the part that truly shows what Bulimia's problem is is when Beth says, "It's not about you!" The line shows a lot about the characters and others who have the same problem. It shows that people with Bulimia problems do not have this problem because of things that are related to other people. It only deals with them and them. It shows that it's time to talk about people who have problems instead of paying attention to themselves. It shows that Beth wants to call attention at that time and she needs the attention of her mother at that time.
