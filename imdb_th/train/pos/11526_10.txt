I rented this movie from Blockbuster movies on a whim .. I like alan arkin and the cover can be caught ... I read back and immediately realized that it would be the best or worst movie I have ever seen ... I guess I'm lucky .. I laugh from the beginning to the end .. Alan Archin brings great characters to this movie. I have bought since using a rental copy for my own collection and watching it all the time .. I have recommended this movie to a lot of people and they enjoy it as much as I do ... I see Complaints about menu and DVD functions .. but it doesn't get out of the movie .. The disc was created for Blockbuster exculsivley, which is why they don't allow you to skip the example that Come .. apart from that you should not give the function DVDs to stop you from watching great movies
