To ponder about this movie, I can think of two other people who will help it become a perspective. One thing that is quite memorable But covering the same terrain is the Coup de Torchon, thousands of miles away, and bigger than that is the memorable Indochina. Claire Denis created a movie with the great support of Indochine. The complex and unspoken relationship between France and the volunteers Applying in her colony His dignity among his colleagues and his white boss I am lost with love / hate between him and Amy. It was the backdrop that gave the film the motivation for it. It was the backdrop that linked this film to Indochina. <br /> <br /> One was never sure what motivated everyone, even though the characters. Some will have to remember Colonialism It's a cynical story about the coup. They are more scandalous, perhaps more interesting in a derogatory way. But Denise gives us memories of what it was like with the tension and unraveling relationships. <br /> <br /> Black American Riding in France is the beginning and end of the movie, presenting another interesting side for the confusion that we in the Western world have when we watch Africa. He said that when he came, he wanted to call all the brothers. He is going home. But they think he's a little crazy French characters and girls grew up in Cameroon. But do not understand what it is, even if they can remember how it is. <br /> <br />
