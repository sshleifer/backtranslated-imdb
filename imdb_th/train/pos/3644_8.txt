The Rookie is based on the true story of a school teacher over the age of 40 in Big Lake, Texas, to the subject of Jimmy Morris (Dennis Quaid), a small high school science teacher and baseball coach His team loses heavily until the team finds their coaches playing in a minor league and can throw 98 miles per hour. <br /> <br /> After throwing a ball, practice and bet, Jim agrees that if His team wins at the regional level. He will try to play in the major league. The film tells the story of Jimmy as a boy who played in his first game in the field. It's a very underdog and a very friendly family movie. Dennis Quaid makes the movie valuable while providing emotion and being supported by great actors including: Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> The story takes a while to develop and some scenes are quite slow. But it works well at the end The baseball scene is fun, well filmed and shows great pictures. This film is not about baseball. But about the pursuit of a man to reach his dreams It inspires emotions and it's funny. I like it. I hope you do <br /> <br /> Starring: Dennis Quaid, Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones <br /> <br /> 4 out of 5 stars
