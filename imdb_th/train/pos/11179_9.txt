"Pet Sematary" succeeded in two main situations First of all, it's a horrible horror movie. Those who do not produce today Secondly, it is an emotional and intelligent movie. So if you are looking for chills, fear, horror and visually setting, excellent performances, dialongs and horrible effects This is the movie you are looking for. Classic now and truly must see for the awesome fans. <br /> <br /> May be the best adaptation for the King's novel. Various events felt a little hasty compared to the novel. But that does not mean that the movie received a lower rating than the success of Horror / Drama. <br /> <br /> Stephen King's novel is widely known as a good and gruesome person in Same time This movie is essentially the same feeling because there is a great character development and you can feel the love and relationship between members. Then, when everything seemed to be happy (Technically happy because the name "Pet Sematary" is not satisfied!) Tragedy changed the atmosphere of the movie. Now it turns into a very dark. This film has a terrifying feeling since opening credits, but after Gage is killed, this movie becomes sad, sad, eerie. Dealing with the loss of a son is something that can destroy all family life and "Pet Sematary". Remarkably proven. <br /> <br /> The myth behind a pet sematary is more than a myth that no one wants to experience. But sadness and despair bring an emotionally damaged father to shoot Sadly, that legend is true and the baby comes back from the dead. The confrontation with the previous pet seminary legend became a tragedy. But this time it was much worse. What will happen to the lives of all our American families? Can Pascow prevent this tragedy? What is a fantasy nightmare? <br /> <br /> See "Pet Sematary" to watch the most horrifying and impressive horror movie. You will not regret The performance is very good, even though I don't dig actors who show father pictures. He seems to be not disturbed enough when the situation asks about despair. But that's just my opinion Denise Crosby delivers a truly wonderful performance and works perfectly as a gentle, noble mother. Baby Gage is great even in his creepy part. * * * * * Shaking. Overall, this is an excellent classic of all time and a movie that is annoying to the deepest fear of people ... losing the loved ones, dead people will definitely come to life ... I don't want to be buried in semat. ary pets !!
