Homeward Bound is a beautiful movie. Did you know that the shadow fell into the canal ... Um, I cried * because I was only six years old. I cried! It took a lot of time to make me cry! Dogs and cats are well trained. Good family movies * No * For those who are not full or hated animals. But can make people look softer like me a.k.a. people like me <br /> <br /> good overall movies 10/10
