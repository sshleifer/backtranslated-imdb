One of my favorite movies that ended with nostalgia. The film about the Sullivan family is clear that Michael Sullivan (Father) is one of the main members of the murderer mafia who will say this and become an expert. One child wanted to know the work of his father. (It was a horrible mistake) so he hid in his father's car and he saw Tom Hanks saying that he would do this. <br /> <br /> In the Mafia rule, no one wins. When they want you, they take you away Of course, you can see anyone working at the mafia with the best car giant house in the world, no matter what you like. But working wrong or doing something that the "boss" doesn't want and you are fired and killed. <br /> <br /> You can see what I mean in the movie. Sullivan Jr. sees something. That he didn't see and almost all his family would be killed because of "wrong" his son did You see that Sullivan's life was chased by the mafia or something like that. <br /> <br /> This movie is very sad, showing us revenge. Almost everything you like Hopefully the men who are reading this comment will not work for the mafia and if you work at the mafia, you will get the favor and get hell from abroad before your boss and staff are killed. <br /> <br /> This movie received: 10/10
