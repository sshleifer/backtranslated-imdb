This is the second time I watched this movie. (Through the French version, compared to the first episode, which was dubbed as Italian) and I felt it would be better to watch later. <br /> <br /> If creating slowly, studying new characters Beautifully taken and the Parisian setting is equally impressive. In the long term, it's not a good Polanski, and I will give the 9th place in his work. But it is also often confident in the combination of surprisingly cool and funny In addition, every talented actor is in good form. But especially Isabelle Adjani, Melvyn Douglas and Jo Van Fleet. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Even though I was baffled by Trelkovsky's sudden force to 'change' as a tenant. Before In addition to the owner of the coffee shop opposite the apartment, where he received what Simon had had, without asking him if he wanted something different, there was little to indicate. (As far as I can see) that this is something everyone His wish! Ok, so he found that Simon's belongings are still lying in the apartment. But what pushed him to wear her dress and make herself as her (Although he began to do this unconsciously) according to his nightmare in the bathroom, the final part of the movie (which Adjani all but disappeared) was almost against the top - especially the scene where the landlord and other tenants witness Suicide attempt as if it were a night at the opera house The concept that had been used 46 years ago by Jean Cocteau in the Blood of the Poets (1930)! <br /> <br /> The end of the episode was predictable and unpredictable: what made both people live. are This apartment jumped out of the window?!; I remember that this factor also made me look first and I'm sorry to say that it's not clear now! Please note that two-thirds of this film is quite strong. But I hope Polanski will rely on a less vague plot point.
