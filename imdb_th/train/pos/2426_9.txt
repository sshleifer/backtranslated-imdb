"Once upon a time in life" is a very good movie. However, it's not good for everyone due to the use of vulgar language and violence in certain situations. The film manages to show in anecdotic way of believing "life" in the NYC neighborhood where drug problems are important. This image has been used as a decoration for the drama that is full of thought and the most vigilant, backed by powerful dialogue. (But I understand some difficulties Sometimes there is a slight overplay, but I think it is quite appropriate for the general orientation that Fishburne gives to the movie, which gives more reflection than just a good style of exercise, especially in time management Character, though not easy But it is easy to relate and actors perform well to falsify them I enjoy the soundtrack very much (B. Marsalis). If you are not too rude, you should enjoy watching that movie once, twice, three times. I rate the movie 9/10
