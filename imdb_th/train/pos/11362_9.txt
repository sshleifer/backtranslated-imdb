I believe this is the most powerful movie of HBO Pictures that has been made to date. This film should be released in theaters for people to watch on the big screen. Available in the video to make sure you search and try. Chris Gerolmo works very well with the direction and script. The performances by Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland and Jeffery DeMunn are flawless.
