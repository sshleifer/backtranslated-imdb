A woman chooses a boy to come to this world and be alone. They are both alone because the boys have gifts and curses in one package. He can withdraw the sword from his arm. There is always a wound on his wrist in the cause of this "gift" - the wound of the most dangerous weapon in his body. The first time he killed his drunken stepfather who constantly attacked his mother. He then grew up and decided to find his true father. It's as simple as a superhero all the time - he has access to justice .... but society judges this justice is not necessary and dangerous, which of course is correct because it doesn't look like in a Hollywood movie where the characters don't try to kill Everyone - Sasha (he is the main hero, performed by Artem Tkachenko). Killed if the person in his mind deserves to die. But received a penalty from the authorities and proceeded In escaping from officials and mafia, he met a girl (played by Chulpan Hamatova) and fell in love with her. Everything is watching ... not saying that this movie is about feelings and emotions. But not about action This film is full of the pain of the main character full of him and the vision of his life.
