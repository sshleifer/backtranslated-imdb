I'm on the opposite side of the previous comment. <br /> <br /> First of all, I don't think this will be a sequel to "The Jerk". I mean, it's not called "The Jerk 2". ... It is "The Jerk, Too" which makes me believe that while the name of many characters is the same. <br /> Imagine: There is no connection to the previous movie except the character name; The story is completely different. Different actors And the fact that it is some musical drama. <br /> <br /> I said to credit this movie. It has a lot of laughs in it .. Mark Blankfield is his key.
