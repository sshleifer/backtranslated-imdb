This is one of the few movies that I think rendering movies will improve from the original book. The story is clear, accessible, amusing and interesting. I like the charming show of 'The Old home guard' and 'Portobello Road', which is a combination of early animation + real acting techniques, although the date will not deviate from the charm of this piece. The background of World War II works well and is not overlooked, as this film is going on, which often happens in the story of 'evacuee'. <br /> <br /> Movies that are often insulting. Enjoyment for people of all ages Performances from actors are exceptionally well done and all the messages are neatly tied together and well designed. Guaranteed to make a smile on your face!
