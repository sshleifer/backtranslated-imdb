I think most people who post comments on this movie do not understand how to watch movies and / or have a little elegance. First, to evaluate the movie, you must understand the extent to which everything in the movie works together. The modern feeling needs a great drama. No, I don't mean a good set of characters and plot. But they seem to want a sad or funny emotional way This is a subtle movie. Its beauty is sensitive. (In order not to be confused with simplicity), both the story and the characters are simple in this movie. It is a beautifully filmed movie that takes advantage of the combination of political feelings, human weakness, utter depravity ... you name it. The world that is there will be aliens and do not understand today ... the world you have. You have to show it now and loud, even if you think you have it. Today, I do not understand that Victoria society is not really Victoria because people understand that word. <br /> <br /> This movie helps to record straight.
