Special day (Ettore Scola - Italy / Canada 2520) <br /> <br /> Every time you will find movies that touch the nerves. This one has simple evidence, almost flawlessly executed in every area and is incredibly moving at the same time. It is surprising that Ettore Scola's "Una giornate dust" is quite without anyone even hating some critics. Time Out is called 'junk' and Leonard Maltin, which is somewhat lighter. 'Satisfied but with little problems' I do not agree, not only because the film has a deep movement. But in a simple story, it shows us the insights about everyday life in Fascism, Italy, more than most movies I've seen. The movie is not clear, even a little bit, and the story is straightforward, which may explain the unpopularity of the movie. Considering the audience in the late 70s that did not receive absolute damage to the great Italian films, it was even more strange that this story was not compatible with criticism. <br /> <br /> This movie started. With permanent clip art for ten minutes From Hitler's visit to Italy on 8 May 1938, we met Antonietta (Loren), a lonely and lonely housewife with love for six children in the first Roman apartment building. One day, when her Beo fled, she met the neighbor Gabriele (Mastroianni), who seemed to be the only person in the building that didn't attend the ceremony. He has good manners, a culture, and soon she is attracted to come. Throughout the film, we heard the fascist rally from the radio of the facilitator walking through the courtyard. Scola used the camera so fun that we were part of the proceedings. After the opening scene, the camera will move along the modern apartment courtyard. (At that time), which seems to be searching for our main character, which we have not met. <br /> <br /> Marcello Mastrionani and Sophia Loren are memorable in two leading roles which are surprising. Even more because they have been perfectly selected John Vernon, born in Canada, played the role of Lauren's husband. But he was on the screen in the first scene and the last scene only I think his voice must be dubbed because he doesn't have Italian descent and has never been there for my knowledge so I can't imagine that he can speak Italian. If his voice was dubbed, I didn't notice it. On the other hand, he is completely convinced that it is Italian than any other actor. The story is simple. But with great performance, the performance is outstanding, the ending is perfect and the frame is not too pretentious But works perfectly Don't miss this. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
