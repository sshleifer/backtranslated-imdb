I watched "Elephant Walk" for the first time in 30 years and was impressed with the story similar to "Rebecca" that is extremely superior, as others say you have something sweet from your feet by you. The charm and lamentation of the mansion alternated only to find that her marriage was threatened by inevitable memories. You have a strict and disagreeing servant that will tie both together or tear them apart, inevitably climbing up with the fiery destruction of a lavish house. br /> <br /> At the same time In the eerie forest atmosphere in "The Letter", the love triangle Bette Davis is located in the Singapore rubber plantation rather than Sri Lankan tea garden. <br /> <br /> Maltin gives "Elephant Walk" only two stars and IMDb. But I enjoy it, even though it is predictable. Elizabeth Taylor never looks cute and Peter Finch works reliably because good people in general can't throw off the influence of his stubborn father. Dana Andrew, who is fond of "Laura" and "the best year of our lives" - lost as Elizabeth's frustrated friend. The real star is the bungalow. Is one of the most beautiful interior scenes in film history
