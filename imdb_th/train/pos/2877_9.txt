I don't think I have to tell you the story. For it has been told for many years and years So I will share my feelings. I saw Cinderella first when I was five. Then I was a Disney kid in a good way. Now, the animation looks like a kid and old-fashioned. But that's part of the charm now. Now, in the era of High School Musical and computer-generated images, it seems that people have forgotten the genius and essence of early Disney movies. Fortunately, I was born before that, so I was introduced to this class. And it seems that no matter how old I am, I turn back to the age of five. Watch the VHS, which is the true magic of Disney.
