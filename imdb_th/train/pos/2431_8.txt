Is famous "Famous" for the tension and cartoon style released, which the semi-main characters are in serious danger only to be rescued by the hero in the last second. This Casper is the only person I can remember where death occurred. But even if he dies, he will still be happy. <br /> <br /> A famous cartoon in the studio is probably "Moral always prevails" Popeye often goes to his spinach at a time. Baby Baby Huey is often a fox, a fox, Little Audery often "learns her lessons" and some FS comics are gloomy and depressed. <Br /> <br /> You have to give them credit. As far as I love Looney Tunes and "Tom and Jerry", I don't think anyone will put a better cartoon product at that time than Paramount. The color of the music animation (the wonderful Winston Sharples) sound editing. They are consistent and are the best example of the art form available.
