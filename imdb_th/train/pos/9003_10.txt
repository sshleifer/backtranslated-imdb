<br /> <br /> I think this is not the best movie ever created. But I voted for the 10 stars as well. Mostly because of my feelings at the end. I and everyone around me were impressed. This is something you don't feel often. All of us began to feel disrespectful and bored with sympathy, lazy management or preaching in modern movies. The story of the movie center around Jane, a young woman in the final stage of MND and the friendship that grew between her and Richard, the man who is going to collapse. This can be boring and valuable. But it is funny, humane, and lacking sympathy to overcome you completely. <br /> <br /> Performances from Branagh and Bonham-Carter That is great, especially those who believe in her role The relationship between the two raised the movie. <br /> <br /> The title comes from Richards' masterpiece, a plane made of junk and his old drawings. The flight here is a symbol for the whole of Richards and Jens' life in order to continue and can face each other. <br /> <br /> Beautiful and funny movies that I want. Will recommend to everyone Don't let the story get you out.
