I think this is a very good movie. It would be good to see a movie about two sisters who knew about the liking of the same boy before he was killed. I'm sure that if this movie was done like this, there would be a very different ending that was causing the movie to be a good movie. It shows that no matter what happens in your life with your brothers and sisters, you can pass and if they are 2 brothers and sisters related to boys. (The same man) who works through pain and pain In order to find results between the 2 of them, it's good to see a love story that has terrifying things happening in someone's life that you can still pass through. I enjoy watching this movie very much and I continue to do it. I seem to find myself watching it every time it happens. It would be nice if there was a second part for this movie. Perhaps there was an older sister and his children. This would make the story even better since he died this way. He was still alive even though he died.
