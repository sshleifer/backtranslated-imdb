The first time I saw "Movies" I liked it a lot. When I was 11 years old, I was more interested in music and dancing. When I grew up I became more interested in acting. While the first half was only a reflection of Michael's career (from Jackson 5 to "Bad"), but still providing entertainment to watch, the "Badgers" sequence may be abandoned, but the children Quite good "Speed ​​Demon" and "Leave me alone" is a joke, especially when the police officer told Michael "I want your signature here" after the break because he didn't dance but it As "Smooth Criminal" that is the icing on Joe Pesci works great as a toughening. The dance is perfect and is a special technique. The only thing I can do without a spider is that Michael's girlfriend should see this. If you haven't done it yet, give me 10+!
