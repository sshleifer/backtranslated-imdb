I grew up with this movie as my favorite movie of all time. Special effects are incredible for that era and have won many awards. I remember the conversation as if I heard yesterday. It is a great and timeless adventure. The song is by Miklos Rosza, the best in film history. Sabu is a thief. I have a copy not far away for the next trip in the memory channel. Oh, that's it! Rex Ingram wants his genii bottle!
