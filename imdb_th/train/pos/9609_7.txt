This is a very good movie. I like it very much. I think it looks accurate and not about fasting. But it's about the pain so deep that they have to find a way to handle it Eating, you can see the pain within you and hear it with her voice and you know I still think that one of the best roles in the movie is that Beth shouted "It's not about you" with your mother. Those words are true and add more to that scene in the movie I think that scene is the most important scene in that movie.
