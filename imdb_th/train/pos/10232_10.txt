When seeing most of Ringo Lam's films, I can say that this is his best movie to date and is the most strange movie. Is an ancient Chinese era that is full of kick-ass martial arts, where the underground caves filled with traps and dungeons play an important role as a big character. The action is great, the story is tense and fun, and the design of the scene is truly memorable. Sadly, Burning Paradise is not made on DVD and VHS is impossible for you to catch your hand, even if you are close to the city. China, the second largest in North America (Like me) If you can search, don't pass it up.
