For example, many pilot pilots at the opening of the Dark Angel show a combination of great potential and a small problem in finding their own feet. No matter what is unusual, but there is a feeling that it will work better if the story is tightened and focused a bit more. In today's world where something has to be found immediately or the face is canceled, the series causes minor damage without coming out to focus at least halfway along with all the guns that are staring. <br /> <br /> Nine pilots Ten minutes Gives the feeling of having two parts together and both episodes have problems with focus In the first half of the year, we were introduced to Max and fulfilled what pushed her. In addition, we have received a few interesting routines with Max using her ability to win bets, interact with PI, or discriminate domestic problems of colleagues. The problem here is that there is nothing wrong with any human being that has a normal gene on television or something like that. <br /> <br /> When we hit the second half, we get the story. Objectives and interests Max finds himself paying attention to the attention of the pirate journalist who feels that it is a life mission to save the whole world by uncovering a dirty dealer one by one. In the second half of the year, the sound resonated from him and Max cleaned up what had happened reluctantly. This set up evidence for all remaining series and can be used. But just don't click if you get my meaning It's like most pieces are there. But there are pairs that make the perfect image left Maybe they will be filled with later episodes. But beside The truth is that the content of this episode can be easily told in less than twenty-eight minutes. <br /> <br /> The last disadvantage of denial is that many support is not supported. In particular, the original Cindy is annoying and I wonder if it will change in the next twenty episodes. Although the show is not as bad as the daytime soap But the quality is not as commendable as I want Jessica Alba is not the worst performer in the world. But she came back short in terms of persuasion when the story needed it the least. <br /> <br /> The good news is that the evidence and the value of production are all top-notch. Produced and it is quite unfortunate that it was canceled in order to be replaced by other items that are not throughout the season Especially when there is ample time for both programs - they can cancel one of the disgusting debris they waved under the banner of a reality TV. The truth is that we need more performances, such as the Dark Angel that is more imaginative than the overhype that is used to attract attention. <br /> <br /> In all, I gave seven of the dark angel pilots. It was never higher than the level of television and never had the opportunity to live with the potential that it showed within its own work. But the potential is there and that is often important for pilots.
