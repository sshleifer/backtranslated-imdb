"Goodbye" introduced us to the first adventure of the holodeck. In this case, Captain Picard poses as a private detective. Dixon Hill now creates some standard forms, repeated in TNG, as well as DS 9 and Voyager. Something's wrong and the characters have to deal with the program under various circumstances apart from playing the game. (Performed by the failure of the holodeck safety program) <br /> <br /> This concept is used to expand the possibilities of Star Trek and enable mixed genres. The story of Dickson Hill of Picard is an example of a 40s crime novel and their representation on the screen is called the film noir. Usually there is a fixed antihero in the lead. (See the example of Marlow, Chandler or Polanski. Star Trek never focuses on the story. (Mostly, the situation is "How can we get out here?") But helping actors use a different approach to their characters. These "Holodeck" games are often used for recreation and reflect the personal interests of crew members. Therefore, the technical aspects are often overlooked and from that point of view, the story has never been overlooked (but Star Trek used to have technical and scientific issues before, or I mean, in addition to some appropriate concepts) <br /> <br /> "Goodbye" shows McFadden's relaxed steward Patrick, who never looks better in Star Trek (at least at the beginning) and Data has a great scene as well. (Although I find it hard to believe that pulling the lamp The plug from the wall would really surprise him because he did research at that time and customs.) Wesley continued to change the peaceful trekkies into potential murderers. (Why don't they take him to the hold'em and let the thugs shut him down?) But all this is fun ...
