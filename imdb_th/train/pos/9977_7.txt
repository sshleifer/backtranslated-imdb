Spoiler through: <br /> <br /> I'm a little person in this matter. But i like this movie It is not a classic. But it is definitely related to adrenaline driving I think it is worth at least 7 points. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the reason I like it is because I didn't see the original. Some things told me that with this kind of movie, the fans are the strongest. People who have not seen the original version and have little to compare with This is not a masterpiece. But I received it a lot and actually made me want to see the original. <br /> <br /> There is something I like about it. One is the excellent selection of Kowalkski Viggo Mortenson and bringing talent to the role. Because most movies fell on his shoulders, he had to be excellent and he was really like that. This is a great role for him. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing about Vansishing Point is the fact that it was created for television. I don't know if this is the case when watching. It seems to be an important movie, and I never guess that this is not a big screen release. <br /> <br /> I also found a very interesting story. I'm not an action movie person. But I was sucked in Moreover, the action movies in there are drama, magic, love stories, quirky people, everything you turn. (I didn't know Priestly) and it was impressive. This is not a great movie. But can see it <br /> <br /> then ended It contained a strong punch, and if anyone participated in the story to that point, it was very difficult not to be pinned at the end. I'm not sure how I feel about the ending. The meaning is that Kowalkski survived, and even if I had a lot of doubts as to how it was, it was a movie and realism, not an ingredient that is always mixed when making a movie > <br /> So I have to say that I found an incredible unrealistic end. But very impressive in the way I don't like But for some reason, almost forgotten in this movie It is accepted that there are many things that are just props for the plot. (Villains may become stereotypical anymore), but the creators have many rights, even if they make many mistakes as well. However, I must say that I will admit that I can understand why people who are big fans of the original will hate this model because even though I haven't seen the original. But I watched many original movies that I like to do with bad results. (My big hatred is the sequel) But I can understand the low score if the manuscript is of high quality. <br /> <br /> People compare this to Smoky and Bandit. Model "Thelma and Louese" as well? I'm sure to experience both. (Both of which I am a fan of) I don't think this is a great movie It is better than me on average. But still far from greatness But it is an interesting and fascinating adrenaline movie which is the main character My score is 7 out of 10.
