I love this movie I think it should be easy to see and easy to forget. I ran out after watching this thing to buy an obv DVD. Not easily forgotten. <br /> <br /> The best script and casting selection is not perfect Each character has their time, and I laughed hard throughout the film when the humor was the point. <br /> <br />
