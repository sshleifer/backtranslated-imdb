I am 16 years old when I watch movies for the first time and it is something that I like very much. Of course, you can't deny the appeal of Kristofferson In the movie - how good is that man Sheesh, he is still a bad boy that every woman wants to secretly His performance is impeccable. He plays drunk / alcohol in a way that someone can do - and he has - in the year 76. He eventually goes up on the wagon, so it's all true. <br /> <br /> The song is great and even in the following years I think Streisand is not the right person for him in terms of physical beauty. But I think it's a problem for male audiences than gals women. We just look at Kris - and naturally, men look at the interest of women - my husband can't see her movies - he doesn't like her face. But I made him sit all the way through the red Ferrari on the road so that he could see how well he did it - the camera's performance was perfect and you were in the car with him with explosive music - You should see it on my 50 "plasma - wow !!!! And finally, the transfer quality is excellent - anamorphic widescreen and very clear with good colors and very low noise, except for the dark areas that are normal for all movies. <br /> <br /> Bring good memories back. Come from my mother and I love this movie together. I bought a copy for you on Christmas day. I like to watch it with her last night. <br /> <br /> I tried the original ride with Judy Gar. Land But I think I can see this before I can't get into the previous era. Viewing all the concerts in the '76 version is the same as what I lived at the time. <br /> <br /> I'm working on my way through. Criticism by Streisand, but she only seems to talk about herself and s. Until now, she hardly spoke about Kris or details about the various scenes in the movie. Her voice sounds like now. <br /> <br /> Try it. If you grew up in the same era as me (born in 1960), you will love it. <br /> <br /> Wendy
