After '' Empire strikes back '' 'Return of the Jedi' 'is my second favorite movie from the Star Wars series. <br /> <br /> Look at Tattoine to help Han Solo from Jabba in At the same time, the galactic universe is doing in secret, creating a new space station like the previous Death Star. If this station is still under construction, all will be the end of the rebel alliance. Both Vader and the emperor were impatient due to the delay of the new Death Star and they had to kill many commanders to complete the project on time. <br /> <br /> R2 and C3po are in Jabba's palace sent a message from Luke to Jabba, which Lukes pretended to negotiate Han's life. He gave the gift of R2 and C3po to Jabba, which is part of his plan. Jabba did not accept the negotiations because he used Han Solo as a piece of his palace (Han was still frozen in the carbonite). Lando was hidden in time. Jabba and Chewbacca are also given to Jabba by reward hunters. When the same hunter tries to help Han Solo and put him in the human body again, we will see that Princess Leia, in disguise, is the problem. Jabba discovers Lea's plan and uses her. As his slave, while Han was thrown into Chewbacca's cell, <br /> <br /> Luke came as a Jedi Knight to help his friends. At first he tried to kill Jabba. He fell into the cell of the demon Jabba (Bantha) but killed it easily. Jabba remained angry and decided to throw Han Chewbacca and Luke go to the Sarlacc Beast. A big surprise from the desert, which has lived more than 1,000 years, is sub-food. Luke Han and Chewy succeeded in escaping again, and even Boba Fett died when Han threw him into the mouth of the Sarlacc. Inadvertently, Leia killed Jaeba and followed Han Luke and Chew. I like c3po and R2. <br /> <br /> Everybody is safe again. Luke decides to go to Dakota to practice Jedi and Yoda's contract. The problem is that Yoda is too old and sick because he is 900 years old and before he dies, Yoda tells Luke that he doesn't need more training. But being a Jedi really has to fight Vader again. He confirmed to Luke that Vader was Luke's father and had another Sky Walker in addition to Luke. During his last time, Yoda asked Luke to remember his advice about the dark temptations and Luke transferring his Jedi knowledge to others. When Yoda died, Obi Wan's soul appeared to Luke and told him that Luke's father had killed Anakin on his good side to become Darth Vader and he was a machine more than a man. Since he became a sith, Luke was still worried about killing his father and said that he felt his father was still kind. Obi Wan tells Luke that his twin sister is Leia and tells the reason why Luke and Leia were separated from their children. He gave the last suggestion to Luke that if he refused to kill Vader, the emperor would win the war. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the Emperor told Vader that he had to give him the look. he Appeared because Luke was stronger than before, and they both wanted to combine their efforts to bring the look to the dark side. <br /> <br /> Now we're going to have one of the great battles. Most from the Star Wars series When the rebel alliance plans to attack the new space station, '' Death Star 2 '' Luke will face Vader and the Emperor and Lea Han and Chewwee need to close the 'Death Star 2' force field. Help of EWOKS (small creatures with little bears) <br /> <br /> This is one of the most exciting star wars for sure!
