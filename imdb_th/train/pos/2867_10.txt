I lost my father at a young age. In fact, when I was young I didn't remember him. For many years I learned many things about him. One of those things is that he loves westerners and looks bonanza every Sunday evening as a complete ritual for him. I personally remember the ending of the series, which was 8 years old when the program ceased production in 1973. This past few years has made me close to my father who has been lost for a long time. It has the right elements to make a successful transaction. Laughter, tears, your seat edge and It makes you angry sometimes. Memories of the original performance not long after the death of our beloved "Hoss", Cartwright, Dan Blocker. One particular episode and the end of the blocker credits and faded to black and I still can Remember that my eldest sister with tears in her eyes saw this. I remember it was yesterday on behalf of my deceased father who didn't come here to say myself. We love Bonanza. Nasa.
