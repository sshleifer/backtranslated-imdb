A very interesting series, I've never seen a combination of drama, action, suspicion and sci-fi before. The screenplay is very clever. I don't know how the creators created all these amazing stories. Every character has a strange past, stormy relationship problems, it gives the human feelings necessary for creating familiar characters. <br /> <br /> The most incredible thing is the fact that all the characters are related: numbers that they had encountered before without knowing and SRGB others secure the mystery and originality of Darma is an element that does not make us lose /> <br /> Mr JJ Abrams script you <br think about the creation of this remarkable story.
