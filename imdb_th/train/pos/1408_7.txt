The Pentagon science team seems to have a complete serum that makes it invisible. But when the coffin was taken by himself, he would not be able to return the process. With frustration and drunkenness with power, he transformed into a psychopath in the classic HG Wells tradition. <br /> <br /> This is a terrifying invisible human story that comes with Verhoeven and Bacon, with taste and style. Enchanting, crazy loonytoon as well as Verhoeven's work. Most of it has a wonderful feeling in the comic book adventure of the boy. (The secret underground laboratory that scientists work very well) combined with the most scary and vile images (Women in lingerie By a creature that could not see the deadly beast, a gallon of blood, and wholesale killings on the last two wheels), while the story did not resound in the old ideas. Special CG effects by Scott E Anderson is great because we see blood vessels and arteries, cardiovascular systems, muscles, bone tissue and meat. Nowhere Especially the scene in which the team brought the gorilla back from an unseen state and the scene in which the drowned bacon dewane in the swimming pool is intrigued by the details and the invention of the dramatic effects. The film also has an excellent soundtrack from Jerry Goldsmith and a classic horror film shot by Jost Vacano. The young actor is overshadowed by the technical bloodline of the movie, but both Shue and Dickens are different from the depths. their This is a fun, nasty movie.
