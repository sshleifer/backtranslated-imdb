The Last of the Blond Bombshells is a little fun. Judy Dench plays Elizabeth, a new widow at the loose end. She spent most of her life as a faithful wife and mother. <br /> <br /> Not long after the funeral of her husband, Elizabeth was eating lunch as usual with the mud. Children when she saw the street performers. This memory caused a spark when she was a member of every girl in London during World War II. We soon learned that the band was not all women, like drummers, dressed as women. Ala. Some people like it hot. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth pulls out her saxophone. Come (Which she secretly practiced throughout her marriage) and joined forces with street musicians playing guitar. Elizabeth was more talented than a guitarist and the money began to flow in. She didn't use money because she was rich. And don't need it Her play is intended to complement the art. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth saw Patrick (Ian Holm) one day as the drummer of the band. It seems that Patrick will be - and still - quite a man, a woman, and Elizabeth - only fifteen at the time - the only member who didn't experience Patrick's "talent" in addition to drumming. > <br /> Elizabeth was inspired by her niece to reunite together to play in the niece's dance school. Therefore, it is a pleasant journey to start with memories that blend with the aspects of the movie, funny road trips - all filled with really good swing and blues. <br /> <br /> I think i'm as old as i really like Older actresses do things and this movie is a treasure trove not only But was a celebrity Judy Dench But she also received support from Olympia Dukakis, Leslie Karon and an experienced British actress. All of this is the extraordinary sound of Cleo Laine. <br /> <br /> Yeah, it's flaky. But full of joy and full fun
