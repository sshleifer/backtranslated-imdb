This is a complex documentary that shows many things about early gay life. When talking about the word gay, the term used in the sexual revolution, Homo is not just gay as an explorer. Or is it still using this method today? I believe that the majority of the film came from around 1968 to 1989. It was released in 1993. So it's a story. <br /> <br /> I touched on a documentary that caught a man's love More than 20 years, the love that is expressed in the form that only true love can be There are many scenes of caring and incredible pain along with scenes of happiness and happiness. There are scenes of gay life, sex and gay life. This movie is a work of love, and I believe it will be a diamond. <br /> <br /> At least one of them will come out of this movie to understand the serious consequences of AIDS. As I write this, I think this movie will affect me how fast. The advances in medicine, politics and social science and culture that have occurred since this film have been screened (about 15 years ago) are amazing. However, in the case of AIDS itself, we have not done so. Heck, I guess we don't do everything. <br /> <br /> However, it's a good documentary. I would like to advise everyone who feels that they do not understand gay life, gay issues or the destruction of AIDS in watching this movie.
