"The first war that has to be outsourced 100%" Dan Ackroyd's line can speak at all. This movie is hard to explain. Comedy It reminds Dr. Strangelove one or two times, especially in the scenes with Ben Kingsley (which I think is an amazing job). I have no special expectations about this movie, even though I'm a big fan of John Cusack, so I let this movie clear me And as a result, I get quite a lot of entertainment The political words are precisely painful and damage to the US military complex. Sub-plans are quite predictable. But the combination of the last story makes them worth I can understand why this film is not very popular in the United States. But for the rest of the world it is a timely story
