Before I start, let me tell you that this wonderful special sound is outstanding when you play Sonic Adventure. I DX: Director cut at the same time. So while looking at this special, I would suggest - no, you want to do that. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia takes him to the top in San Francisco. There he makes everyone enjoy without apologies. <br /> <br /> I thank God here so much that Carlos didn't do what he used in jokes repeatedly. time and time again. He works great, makes everyone fun and at the same time is really about it. I know a few times that I say after Carlos jokes. "Damn, this man makes it a good point!" Then the Game Over screen came to my TV because I forgot that I played Sonic Adventure. About this special, if you have TiVo or something like that, please do what you like and record this historical hour.
