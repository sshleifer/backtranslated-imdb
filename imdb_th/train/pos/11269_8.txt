Ever wanted to know how far Hollywood can escape before the official Hayes Code? Unfortunately "City of meetings" disappeared, so just have to watch. "Tarzan and his partner" to search in 1934. There are many sexual innuendo and even texture. Just watch Jane's swim. While Tarzan is often seen as an adventure film created for young people and no one else, this picture proves that the film has a lot of adult content. More than seventy years later, it is still sexy as it was when it came out. <br /> <br /> In addition to the envelope that pushed forbidden nature, it was a wonderful and exciting adventure. I like the wild movies at Hollywood, turbulent in the 30s and 40s, but there are a few types that I call the best movies. "Tarzan and His Mate" are the best movies from the long-lost subcategory The order of the safari attacks by monkeys or indigenous people still manages to create tension today. Moreover, all animals are cool too. (Especially the monkeys throwing stones) The performances will not win big prizes soon, but enough for this type of image. The film was once again stolen by the smartest monkey cheetah in the forest. One of the most entertaining examples of pre-code Hollywood
