The best thing about this movie is that it's fun. It is full of funny characters and interesting situations, starting with the innocent pecker (played by Edward Furlong) who likes to take pictures of almost everything he sees in everyday life. Other great characters include Pecker's friend Matt ("He's a thief. But he is really good "), Chrissy, Pecker's sister (Sugar Eater), and Catholic grandmother Pecker, who discovered life in the statue of the Virgin Mary in her room. <br /> <br /> The film makes light. There are so many things about everyday life, and it succeeds in making this point without being too heavy about it. There is always a risk when sending a message about the value and dignity of "general people". "Love Is More Than You" is a reverse look - but "Pecker" avoids these traps, allowing viewers to gain points while allowing The breathing room is enough for the audience to compare this message with their own thoughts. <br /> <br /> I mostly recommend this movie because it's so fun.
