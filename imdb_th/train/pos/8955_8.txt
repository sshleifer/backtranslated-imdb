"Bell Book and Candle" recently appeared on the cable. Didn't see it for a while and then we decided to watch this comedy again From James Van Druten's Broadway hit, which was a vehicle for Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer in the early 1950s. The film was adapted for Daniel. The film, directed by Richard Quine, which transforms the play into a delightful joke. <br /> <br /> Obviously, judging from the comments sent by IMDb, the big problem seems to be a pair of stars. In collaboration with "Vertigo" launched in the same year Movie viewers didn't think about the age difference when the film was released. In fact, the oldest male star of that era is often associated with young women. <br /> <br /> This film is located in Manhattan during Christmas, a comedy that is admirable. Kim Novak is at the highest level of her beauty because it's clear that the camera is her favorite, no matter what she plays. As a witch who became a human, her gillian is charming. James Stewart, who plays Shep Henderson's publisher, sees him best. Mr. Stewart is a great comedian shown here. Why is he top? <br /> <br /> In support of the great role of Elsa Lanchester in the role of Queenie, the movie was well received. Jack Lemmon of Nicky Holroyd, Gillian's younger brother is also a good person. Ernie Kovacs is considered a writer Sidney Radlitch. <br /> <br /> This is a great way to spend the winter at home to See "Bell Book and Candle"
