I found this to be a sensation in the film about the cultural clash in 1950. John Wayne would probably be his first choice as a cultural assistant with diplomatic relations with the intention of His goodness was like a bull in Harrods. But this time he was left to play as an insulting part than normal people and he worked in style. The Duke is really good. His facial expressions and body language may be very subtle. <br /> <br /> Although he has a significant role both as an actor and in the time screen But he failed to dominate this movie Many of his good intentions were harvested. He has power over and the occasional lecture is organized by the geisha who he is a savage. <br /> <br /> The story of an American attempt to flirt with a lonely Japanese is one of political planning. over Fierce fighting or hell for movies I cannot comment on the validity of the research. But the strangeness of the eastern culture towards the senses of the Westerners is well demonstrated. There is a very meticulous choreography ceremony in which the observer looks like a set and real props. The set parts are complex and detailed. A lot of money and ideas have been applied to it. <br /> <br /> The broken love between Wayne and his geisha adds a little more element and stops the movie, becoming just a political attempt or waving flag. Good script without having to talk too much. There are many Japanese conversations. But the translation for a long time did not interfere with the lecture It is good to see genuine Oriental in the series. Whether they are Japanese or not, I can't speak. However, they watched that part. At least the leaders were not played by white people, dressed in crosses, which were different from other attempts, such as' Blood Alley '(yes, I know they are Chinese),' Inn Of The Sixth Happiness' or even 'The King And I '/> <br /> Frankly, I'm more happy than other movies. The script is better for getting started. I never liked the song in 'The King And I' and was not impressed with the heavy anti-communist messages of 'Blood Alley'. I confess that I have never seen this work before and found that it compares well with the popular ranking. The Duke's <br /> <br /> recommended
