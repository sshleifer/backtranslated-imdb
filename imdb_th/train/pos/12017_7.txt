"The Last Hard Men" is a western style for the 70s. It seems that most of them were inspired by Sam Peckinpah. This, too, but director Andrew McLaglan is John Ford Pupil and can perform clearly in many scenes. The beginning is great. In some ways, McLaglan wants to show the audience how to travel from civilization to the wilderness. In the third part, there are some irrational defects and I complain a little about Charlton Heston. He must play as an ex-husband named Sam Berged. But he has a great shape I never felt that he had a real problem to climb on a horse or on a rock. For me, he doesn't look very motivated as usual in his epic movie. Go to the beautiful Barbara Hershey, who is playing the sheriff's daughter. Maybe both have problems with the director or are not satisfied with their role. Hershey and Bern did not show the best results. But still good If the screenwriter gave John Wayne in their hearts as Sam Burgade? Michael Park, as a modern sheriff, has not played a role in his role. On the other hand, James Byrne is an outsider to Zac Provo. Bern is a really great villain in this one. He portrayed the bad guy between hatred, madness and intelligence. His role and acting are the best movies. <br /> <br /> The scenery and shootouts are great. The filming scene was bloody and the violence seemed realistic. Zach Provo and his gang had a bloody and violent scene. What I missed is a typical western action in the middle of the movie. I would appreciate bank robbery or similar things. Overall, it is a western style flick that provides entertainment. Not a great movie But above average due to Coburn's excellent, very good start and blood-filled and violent scenes
