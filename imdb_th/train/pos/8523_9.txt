I am a big fan of this book from the third grade, so of course I watch movies, read sequels and watch TV programs. It was a good performance in myself and now as an adult I still enjoy acting. My only real problem is that it's not following the book. The first time I saw it, I was very disappointed that I closed it. But that came from the girl who owned the first book But after time passed, I decided to try again and ignore this book. (Just like you did with the Harry Potter movie) I found that the great series! It's clean and something that everyone can enjoy in the right amount so that everyone continues. It's really fun! Clean and excellent!
