"Most of us live in at least two worlds, the real world that we are at the mercy of the situation and the inner world, the unconscious, the safe place where we can escape ..." With these words the world of "The Maxx "An interesting world that combines imagination and reality together. Inspiration in Sam Kieth's comic book "The Maxx" is honest to the content of what has been inspired. But only in the matter But still in the graphic style that looks like the face of the cartoon, making this list Surreal and unique characteristics But the story is interesting and fun while it may seem too strange. But when you go inside, it's hard to get out of it. The story and characters have been developed wonderfully. The music goes perfectly with the style of the show and gives the right atmosphere. Unfortunately, there are many good animations. This list is short-lived. "Maxx" is a must see. Is one of my forever favorites
