If you want irrational action, the hottest chicks and Seattle's bad perspective, this is a show for you. <br /> <br /> Dark Angel's concept is not new. James Cameron stole the idea from the book) but I spent the whole hour watching it every Tuesday from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Jessica Alba is a smoker and a friend of Max (traditional Cindy, Kendra) is just hot. <br /> <br /> The fight scene is getting better. But the dialogue between Original Cindy and Max must be a little better. (The slang rang, forced, and it seems that people living in the suburbs wrote it.) /> <br /> In my opinion, Dark Angel is very pleased with everything the fans have. Action can be requested. But if you are looking for an award-winning drama, watch "The West Wing" or something.
