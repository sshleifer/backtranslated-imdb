I was surprised at the low ratings that this movie received from the audience. I saw it one night on TV and it hit the spot - I thought it was true in 1989 when it first appeared.

Michael Pollard looks rudely appropriate for his role, in which the sum of the first contract that did not work in his career and the others played honestly. I definitely recommend renting, although some issues that may seem somewhat frustrating in 1989, but now may seem tame, which is embarrassing when considering "contemporary edginess" often used as a necessary marketing tool.
