I saw this movie for the first time when the BBC aired in 1988, when I was working on 2000AD of the United Kingdom. My friend Steve Parkhouse recorded in VHS and sent it to me. Until this point, I will only see Shaw Bros Bros movies with their intense light. (In order for the audience to see the movement clearly), so it was revealed to me something that looked like it had been struck by Ridley Scott coming out of Hong Kong This is the first time I experience Tsui Hark's movie (clearly "Choy Huk"). <br /> <br /> But for the outside smoke, the back light and the ambitious special effects. (Stop-motion? In the Hong Kong movie?) At the heart of the Chinese story, GHOST is a simple and moving love story that makes everything more real with Leslie's outstanding acting ability. Cheung (so sad and sad. And the elegance of Joey Wong, who received Joey, was beautiful, but it was her ballet hand gesture that made her character look like a sex that was not Can achieve, which is difficult to analyze And even though Joey is now more than 20 years old (gawd, who we are not), this will always be the enduring image of that actress. <br /> <br /> Some reviewers say movies This is easy. No surprises But they disappeared from the fact that this movie is based on a famous Chinese story written by Pu Songling, about 1,700! It's a small story that complains that Romeo and Juliet have a predictable ending and just copy the WEST SIDE STORY (want to get out of my chest!) <br /> <br /> For me, the story of Chinese GHOST is a quintessential romantic story. It has a high tragedy because we know that Chio Sin and Sin Seen can't live together. It's about being an adult because no one can grow until we experience a big loss. It's about sacrifice because sacrifice is an important element of true love. And Wu Ma's jokes didn't hurt a bit. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the Chinese GHOST story by trying not to look through the filters of Western culture and you can do it.
