The Movie Freddy's nightmare is finally scary and annoying, like other Nightmare on Elm Street. Yes, it has a lot of funny stuff, so there are other movies, but how can anyone say that you won't find Freddy Krueger? Scary, if you meet this man in your dreams, you won't find him that is even more terrifying because he shows that he doesn't care about killing you that he thinks it is. a lot And Freddy also plays the game in his mind with a cartoon character, which in his own way is very annoying, using his cartoon method, I think it will make the horror horror movie on Elm Street today. Very smart writer In contrast to Jason Vorhees, who does not say anything and does not have the acumen to make his victims scared, this movie is as good as Freddy's wisdom has been received and I will recommend to everyone with a sense of humor. And by the way "Don't sleep! "
