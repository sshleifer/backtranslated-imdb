Just saw ICE AGE as a movie that looks good and especially funny. The story is simple. But powerful, cute characters and good out But what is clear is the digital design. <br /> <br /> Inspired by traditional cartoon movies rather than reality. Looking at the world in using surprising colors Sometimes the touch of reality shines through. (Especially the water is impressive) but it is actually a fantasy world Combining a special panoramic view reduces the cost of rendering. <br /> <br /> Pixar movies shine with technical ability Technically babbling, this movie is suitable for families and sometimes funny.
