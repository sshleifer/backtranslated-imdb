At the beginning of our friend's introduction to the six main characters of the series: Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Chandler Bing, Ross Geller, Joey Tribbiani and finally Rachel Green <br /> <br /> We discovered that Rachel, a wealthy girl who was a friend of Monica since high school, left her fiance Barry on the altar because she knew she didn't love him. She also decided to stay with Monica and be free from her father. Get a new job as a waitress in Central Perk. <br /> <br /> Ross, on the other side, finds that his wife is a lesbian. And lost her Susan, her partner (We saw him moving to a new apartment now.) <br /> <br /> Monica is now doing (And finally sleeping) with Paul "The Wine Man", which makes her an inefficient excuse Since he was divorced from his wife But in reality he just fooled you. <br /> <br /> PS: I just released Joey and Chandler's hair in this first season! =)
