I wondered if this movie was made from a real story. At first it was said that it was based on the real story, arranged from I bet that the only truth is that there is a former bounty hunter that might be called Domino. <br /> <br /> However, it started with Domino talking to Lucy Liu. Domino is interrogating about what she knows about stealing 10 million dollars. Through the incident, we see a domino as a child, then a model and the way she is interested in becoming a bounty hunter. She told two other bounty hunters, Ed and Choco. They let her join the group. She is strong, able to use all kinds of weapons and will use her good looks if necessary. <br /> <br /> They have been involved with the deception at Clarmont, a priest already. That Ian Sarring and Brian Austin Green took part They are like hosts and desperate to appear in this story. <br /> <br /> I think this story is fun and there are some laughs. The fix didn't bother me. There is also a lot of violence, mostly using guns and blood. May be a little shorter. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: good enough to watch
