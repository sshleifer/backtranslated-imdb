This is one of my favorite movies of all time and I would like to recommend to everyone. In my favorite movie list (Mind List) The only thing that is at the same level is movies like The Lord of the Rings, Spirited Away series and Fly Away Home. <br /> <br /> I can relate to Jesse's main character At the beginning of the movie, she is a shy young girl with a little strange background, with many friends who are more boys than girls. She really sucked you into her life. Of course, I can't blame the protagonist's performance or others in the movie. <br /> <br /> Football is interesting to watch, even people like me who don't have knowledge of the rules. The movie is never boring. Love is really cute and doesn't make me too embarrassed! One thing that can be realized is the factor of India. Jesse's parents are Indians and have many vibrant Indian conferences throughout the story that provide interesting cultural insights, including everything else. Indian people are hilarious too! Essentially, this is the age movie that comes about choosing the path you want and fighting for it. <br /> <br /> Feeling that a good comedy has become my favorite movie. Thanks to this film. They are funny, they are refreshing and make you feel good! ^ _ ~
