A very smart sense of humor. Great performances. I can't believe how much people think they deserve. 1/10! I hope this movie will be shown everywhere so everyone can enjoy it. If you have the opportunity to watch ... don't miss it. There is a part that the main actors are driving and singing plinplin. " It should be for children (I think ... it may be South American people. I'm not sure)) This song has two similarities ... but people generally don't realize that ... It's just thank you! I tried writing both Spanish and English because it is an Argentinian movie ... but the page doesn't allow me :( hope you enjoy it!
