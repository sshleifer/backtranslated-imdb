Things that can really be said ... "Tenants" is a first-class thriller created with paranoia and fear. It is a movie that plots a detailed story - every detail seems rational - although the story is not reasonable and most never speak in an objective manner. So we were left with Trelkovsky (Polanski), which is more uncertain - the gentle Polish man who received the apartment due to the suicide of the previous tenant - to guide us through a world full of fear and Uncertainty After the party at the apartment was hot, thrown by a group of offensive colleagues, Trelkovsky came in more and more, it seems that the investigation by his roommates in the building could not be explained. The rest of the film recorded his mental deterioration and gave us a thorough idea of ​​David Lynch's later efforts. However, "tenants" were more thoughtful and frightening, laced with comic relief. Unexpected, good performances and truly haunted scores It is a movie that has more experience than described.
