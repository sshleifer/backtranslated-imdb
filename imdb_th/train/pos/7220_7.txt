And that is what happens in DEATHTRAP based on a fun play by Ira Levin ("Rosemary's Baby") <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and in that MICHAEL CAINE and CHRISTOPHER REEVE will Show the talent that Caine and Laurence Olivier pulled out in SLEUTH - with as much talent as many puzzles that have ever been played in a special game. <br /> <br /> But because it shocked you, surprised and made you guess For results, it's hard to write a review about the story. Suppose that what we know at first is what you need to know about movies. At present, MICHAEL CAINE is a jealous playwright like crazy, whose last play failed miserably. When the young writer who wishes CHRISTOPHER REEVE sent his original drama to him, Caine realizes that sending it into his own will solve all his problems and get his reputation back. <br /> <br /> From the point The story of fun and games for the audience is the story of a relaxed Ira Levin dealing with the brave Agatha Christie for a number of twists. <br /> <br /> Caine and Reeve play each other superbly. Tension The dynamic for some Jokes, including comedy, which comes from the chapters that tie up with drama with humor. <br /> <br /> Summary: Worth seeing - but not everyone is satisfied with the ending.
