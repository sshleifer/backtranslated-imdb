I love the series! Many stereotypes show Southerrners because Hicks is very clear. But these people are too often The depiction of the government in the south is also loud. But the sympathetic character reminds one of the many good things about the South as well. Some things never change and we see "good kids" every day! There is Lucas Buck in every southern city that only has a phone to do things and the "po" white trash "story book is all familiar Apart from the supernatural elements, everything else may happen well in the modern south! I think Trinity must be in Barnwell County!
