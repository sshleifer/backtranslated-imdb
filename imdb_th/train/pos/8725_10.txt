I like Antz but like "A Bug's Life". The animations put into this pay off. I'll definitely put it on the DVD. By the way that Disney should create widescreen movies on tape (I heard the voice of all the characters in the screen in the standard video format). I saw only one of the two sets. But I can't see another set!
