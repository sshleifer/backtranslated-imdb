When looking at the negative post, you really have to wonder what some people do for fun .... <br /> <br /> I'm lucky enough to watch a movie during the drama too short. Viewers laugh at I was watching the tape of it while I was typing and it was still a joke. <br /> <br /> There is also a sweet side with turns of genuine pathos. At the end of the great dynasty, it was especially effective as a wrenchmuller, a lonely farmer, the unfortunate Ariana Richards and J.J. Anderson. And actors in the Mars series, although limited to the mime, do very well. <br /> <br /> Another thing to look for is the details behind the scenes. This film is full of homages, pastiches and references to SF and other fantasy movies. See next Mars costume. One of them wore Marty McFly. Another set was Ghostbuster. The third set was in the House Atreides and the fourth set wore the Last Starfighter flight suit.
