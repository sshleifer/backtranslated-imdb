This film is not trying to hide its true genre - it's a B movie with content. It will be flat, telling you to start the definition of campy. But both come together in this movie in a way that makes you go. "Hmmm ... it's so stupid!" Then you laugh. For example, there is one scene dating back to the "16th century Japan", which shows that two samurai are walking in front of the temple. In the background of the temple, there are many tourists looking at the distance in sandals and shorts. Um ... Hahaha! I can't stop laughing And the performance starts from satisfying, able to endure, oh my God But that's what makes it funny You will see famous actors and then find other people really scary. I have to talk a lot about it because I've seen Stephanie Sanchez many times and she is great. Her airtime in the movie is quite short. I have seen Bryan Yamazaki on many performances in the island during my visit, and he is still better than in the cinema than in this movie. However, it's an entertaining movie if you don't have anything to do on weekdays evenings.
