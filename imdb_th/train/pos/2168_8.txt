I saw this movie on TV one night many years ago. But it was a disturbing experience with me to this day. <br /> <br /> The location may look a bit strange - due to the hidden earthquake. Underground stores of poisonous neuron agents in the hills above a small town were wounded and many microscopic substances found their way into their food sources. The inhabitants of the city began to lose their ability to use restraint in every desire and basic desire that floated through our hearts every time, and normally we knew that we must not proceed. Slow movie But for me that only increased the uneasiness that was creeping in, because the behavior of the townspeople gradually began to unravel. There are many surreal and unstable scenes that are still embedded in my memories all the time. <br /> <br /> It makes interesting questions about what we can all do if we give. Our most ferocious instinct Am I enjoying it? I'm not sure that 'enjoy' is the correct word. Does it make me think? Of course. I still think. The scary thing
