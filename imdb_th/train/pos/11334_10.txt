I will say that this film provides in-depth information about the injuries that the child mind can face when the family is divided by divorce or other disasters. <br /> <br /> I find that the characters are highly attractive and sympathetic from a variety of dimensions. <br /> <br /> Scary monsters, though not scary for those who Larger Most But there is a real hint of what the exaggerated imagination of children who face an unknown fear may create. <br /> <br />
