In "Die Nibelungen: Siegfried", Siegfried is betrayed. Now Kriemhild is trying to get revenge. She is married to Hagen and through various events. Eventually, she enters the intense action scene (but right) at the end. <br /> <br /> One thing about watching this movie today. That is, we can look at Atatilah (called Etzel in the movie), showing that he was a strange person from the east, possibly an allusion to the Soviet Union It is clearly not the fault of Fritz Lang that Hitler used "The Nibelungenlied" for the pride of the German nation in the Third Reich. But how can Fuhrer like this story? However, this is a very scary movie.
