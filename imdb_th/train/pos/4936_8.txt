When pneumonic plague is different from the plague epidemic, Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark), a public health officer in the United States (Richard Widmark) immediately detained everyone he knew was close to his body. Unfortunately, the stiff people have such a method by being killed and there is a good chance that the killer will start to spread the disease which leads to the epidemic. Entering the position of Captain Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas), who is enlisted to follow the murderer as soon as possible and avoid potential catastrophes. <br /> <br /> While Panic in the Streets is Quality movies Not getting a little focus and slightly stretching (My reason for bringing the score down to eight) It went from gangster to noir to medical disasters, police procedures, thriller and even love. <br /> <br /> This is not a job. The best director of Elia Kazan, but said it's not straightforward. Kazan is the assistant responsible for masterpieces such as A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), On The Waterfront (1954) and East of Eden (1955). But Kazan said he was "bound" by the studio. Excessive use of that freedom may affect some of the spread. This film is located in New Orleans, a city in Kazan. "Accustomed to walking around ... day and night, so I know well." He wants to take advantage of the environment. "It's great and very colorful. I need a steam engine boat, warehouse, jazz-New Orleans joints." <br /> <br /> Kazan handles the types of Panic in each type of road well. But they can connect better than this movie will benefit from being with one or two emotions Sprawling in terms of settings will still work. Part of the dilemma may be due to the fact that Panic in the street is an attempt to combine two stories by writer Edna and Edward Anhalt "Quarantine" and "Some Like 'Em Cold". <br /> <br /> Content The gangster, who ended up firmly in the thriller land, with a chase scene near the end of the movie seems to be highlighted. It is not surprising that Kazan said that he believed that the villains were "more colorful - I never had a love for a good person anyway. I don't like the purist." "Terror" of the name - the discovery of epidemics and attempts to track the exposure to vaccination them and have the disease. While there are many doubts during both "emotions" But most movies are quite straightforward and have the rhythm of that type of film. <br /> <br /> The general dialogue is great. The stylistic differences of many modern movies may not be clear. It's wise to send quickly and well by each character. Conflict is not caused by "stupid" decisions but is a wise move. Character activities and actions are like chess games. When there is an unusual situation, such as Reed suspending the epidemic from the newspaper, he gives a relatively long reason for his decision, which other characters argue. <br /> <br /> In this sense, it's interesting that Kazan believes that "Accuracy, religion, ethics, and the middle class all make us kill." The idea came into the film through a normative modification or a break from it by the protagonist. For example, the gang of gangsters Black (Jack Palance in his first screenplay) offered a "free prison" card if he collaborated with the fight against epidemics. <br /> <br /> Technical aspects of This movie It doesn't matter if there's nothing special. But the real reason to watch is to show interesting situations and good conversations.
