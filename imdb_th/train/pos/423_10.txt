I just read the synopsis and it's the worst thing I've ever read. It's not fair with this amazing movie. For examples of good summaries, read the list of "Turner Classic Movies". However, this is one of the movies I like as a child My sister and I can't wait until every April when we can see it in T.V. It is one of the best horse movies of all time. It is one of those wonderful classics that everyone in the family can watch. Love is clean and beloved. The story is interesting and the music is great. They don't make movies like this again. Good performances and not over the top Pat Boone and Shirley Jones are their best ones.
