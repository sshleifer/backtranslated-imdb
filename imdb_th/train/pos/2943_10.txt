I think this is still the best routine. There are some other people, such as Rock, "Bring the pain" and "The guy is the pig" of Allen who is hilarious; "Damon Waynes last stand" is still a joke in the tears - but this routine has no mistakes. All jokes are funny and the 70 minute limit is perfect. Long enough to go through 20 years. I like that he gives the audience a sense of self and unlimited. I am a big fan of classics and for men who see Jim Carrey growing up Not in the categories with Ellen and Newhart, but there are some things you can see if you are bloated. Thank you, Eddie, God for protection.
