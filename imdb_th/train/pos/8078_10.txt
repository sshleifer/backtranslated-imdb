Although this was a disaster at the box office. But it is my favorite movie It gives a powerful message to the family. It is violent and has one song and bikini girl. Compared to other Bollywood movies, the action scenes in this movie are more realistic. It is an incredible mix of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see an Indian godfather, Amitabh shows that picture in this movie Do not read reviews by critics. They don't know anything. This movie has a great mix of comedy, romance, drama and especially action. So if you want to see more realistic action than Main Hoon Na (still a good movie), this is a movie.
