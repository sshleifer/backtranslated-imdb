When not watching this movie in about 20 years, I still was impressed with the strong impact and the star's performance. Of course, Mr Mickey Rooney, of course, was in his role as a leading ring killer. (Referring to other reviews here - none other than Orson Welles talks about Mickey Rooney's name as the greatest film actor.) I still remember jazzy-brassy scores and black and white photos. I like Mick's last line before he goes outside to get lead poisoning (I think Stranglers raise it as one of their songs - Get a Grip for yourself). This is a great movie. And buried the film unfairly, take it away! The latest issue of Side Review magazine has written an article about Don Segal's "Babyface Nelson" a couple of years ago "Last Mile" and starring Mickey Rooney. Another madness and Mick's sympathy may be the point Beginning of expressing gratitude for a truly wonderful movie show.
