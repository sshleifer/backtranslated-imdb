This is a magnificent piece from Sweden's King Shit. Mats-Helge Olsson Seldom has this movie created in Sweden and it truly stands out as one of the most remarkable achievements in Swedish movies to date. Who pays for these things. <br /> <br /> Russian nuclear scientist Markov wants to escape from Sweden. But his plan was destroyed by the Russian army that kidnapped him and told him that he had arrived in Sweden. This trick is the way they see Markov still working on nuclear physics that will revolutionize the supply of energy to the whole world. But the CIA allowed Markov to go west and send their ninjas to free him. <br /> <br /> The practice for Swedish actors speaks English as something that Mats-Helge has done. In his later work Cheap b-movie feelings created may not match for performance. But beyond this That action is a form Direct-to-Video standard, machine gun fires large smoke Thousands of Russians are dying. People running around in a black ninja suit trying to hide in the snow. <br /> <br /> The really remarkable thing is the incredibly bad way that the fighting scenes are designed. When they say "ninja" in the name that I expect martial arts, I expect close combat. But there may be two or three scenes of real martial arts in this movie And they are hilarious It's terrible that I lack the explanation. If the ninja moves more slowly, the heart will stop. And of course, the whole movie ends with an explosion that indicates a special budget consisting of four food stamps and McDonald's vouchers. <br /> <br /> What is the verdict? Classic instant indeed Never before in a movie that has a clear meaning to consume with a large amount of alcohol. It's a great party movie. Inserted into the video and laughed Just having to realize that this kind of movie didn't create anything anymore. This is a movie history. <br /> <br /> So the score is 8/10 for entertainment, 1/10 for quality and 10/10 for accents.
