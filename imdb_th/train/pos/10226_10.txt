I am about 7 years old when I first watched this movie. It's not that special. But a few years later I saw it again and at that time it was fun :) <br /> <br /> I think the best part of the movie is: Yeti's body language <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, don't wait for the Hollywood movie to make $ 1,000. :) <br /> <br / > I have copies of it, movies and video versions too. (But I don't think it's going to be shown in the cinema before) <br /> <br /> Look, it's fun !!! Yeti forever !!!
