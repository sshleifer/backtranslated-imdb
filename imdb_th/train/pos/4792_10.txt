The Straight Story is an exploration of the beauty and beauty of America on many levels. At a certain level, walking slowly through the center of the city, it is a kind and amber seed, another level about aging and remembering important things. (And forgetting things that are not enthusiastic) David Lynch gives us time in this movie and helps me remember how many people speak quietly. An amazing movie that will slowly rest with me for a while.
