Story: Kurt Harris (Jeff Wincott), a former police officer who died in "Peacemaker" after his friend was killed by their leader At that time he found that the woman wanted to run for the mayor and would do everything to achieve this goal, even the murder of a talented actor (Jeff Wincott is a great martial artist and a good actor) ... Brigitte Nielsen plays the role of a sexy, ruthless rival, playing Matthias Hughes. He is also a martial arts artist. Good direction. (Still fighting scenes) The rest is okay with Tony Burton, Kurt's fellow player who was killed by Nielsen and Cindy. From other action / martial arts producers ( Bounty Tracker with Lorenzo Lamas), great action movies, best movies of martial law series
