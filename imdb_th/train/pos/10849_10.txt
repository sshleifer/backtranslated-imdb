This may be the best stone work - England - better. This is the spinal cord. The character is credible. The plot is excellent and you can sympathize with certain events, such as Ray's problems that fit the band. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is excellent. Real time, even if it is in the same key, you must hum some days. My favorite thing is almost all actors from England with popular household names. Ray's wife has no value ... <br /> <br /> This film never dances at all. It moves fast and there are some really funny parts there. The origin of a really good poem! <br /> <br /> It's a hidden diamond.
