I used to watch this movie when it was released and when I was 12 years old :) and I still remember the wonderful scene of the hero / heroine fleeing every time when facing danger :) and the best features of the movie Is Describing the villain! I think the action movie called "The Escape Scene" is a lot from this movie !! And not only did it not impress me when I saw this copy, it always added appreciation for this masterpiece :) The leading actors have performed superbly The slow and realistic chemical development b / w that the hero and heroines are very natural and show miraculously while our children feel that the developed love is natural :) The way they face And overcome all trials and tribulations together to be able to make children realize the value of true love I advise everyone to watch this movie when there is a chance !! --Vijay
