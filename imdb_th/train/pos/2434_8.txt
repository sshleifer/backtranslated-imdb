I always wondered how CASPER had meant to children ... with all the problems that revolved around his identity. (In this movie, we believe that he is the soul of a dead child because his house is a burial mausoleum) as well as a disturbing message directed by this particular film. Perhaps Casper is more meaningful than playing with a virtue or a famous studio, feeling like being groundbreaking in the 'truth' cartoons. <br /> <br /> There is a good BOOS TONIGHT tonight. Good movement, no doubt. But the development of the plot involving foxes (Which became a friend of Casper But meeting the tragic end) is a worrying story. <br /> <br /> Let the famous studio credit - they deal with death with respect ... the image of Casper's mourning That is quite scary and annoying for children (even if the storyline is happy And the violence is quite steep, even in the standard 1940s. <br /> <br /> This may be a good cartoon for parents to help explain death to children, but I will Does not appear in the VCR for destroying nasty cartoons
