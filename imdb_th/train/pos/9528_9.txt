Frankly, this movie has gone through the head of the majority governor. <br /> <br /> Opposite of the disaster. (Being lost) is salvation (being saved) and this film is one of the few people who deal with those things. Two concepts The film also explores the love and disappointment that joins the father-son relationship. It should be recorded from the beginning that there is no such thing in today's popular form. <br /> <br / > The evidence is that the father of the move, Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) and John Rooney, his bandit leader Paul Newman) love their son and will do everything to protect them. But Rooney's son, Connor, is worse than others. He killed one of Rooney's loyal soldiers to cover the theft of his father. When Connor knew that Sullivan's son Michael had seen him kill Sullivan's other son. (And Sullivan's wife) in an attempt to silence the witnesses. <br /> <br /> Sullivan decided he wanted revenge for any price. The price of destruction Rooney, in one scene, curses the birthday. Connor refuses to let his son Connor and Sullivan and hire a contract killer named Maguire (Jude Law) to kill Sullivan and his son. So Rooney joined his son Connor on the road to wickedness. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the film, along with Michael, his youngest surviving son, Sara Lillivan Seeks Connor Rooney When Sullivan faced Rooney in the basement of the church and demanded that he quit Connor because Connor killed his family, Rooney said - "Michael had only one murderer in this room .. and there Only one guarantee. Heaven. "When the movie ended up predictably, one character would be recorded and one character repented. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan. Tom hangs big. But he stepped out of the character to play the popular Sullivan Man confidently. Providing subtle and compact performance Newman did well as an old Irish connoisseur. Rooney showed a stubborn face in his face and gestures. His eyes were haunted by Connor's wrong behavior. Jude Law plays Maguire horribly. Tyler Hoechlin plays the role of Young Michael naturally and without impact. <br /> <br /> The film is continuously shining from the dark, reflecting the image. The kind of salvation and destruction Camera pulled from green and gray palettes Gray is the ancestor and urban landscape of the Illinois economic downturn. Green is the youngest son and rural area of ​​that state. The melodious and haunting music of Thomas Newman is striking in Ireland and played in Copland's arrangement. Those scenes are the real city center in the west - the factory, the church, the house shining with sparkling woodwork. < br /> <br /> The film's excellence lies in creating a unique feeling with a profound theme, outstanding performances and surrounding music and movies. The only downside is the anti-gun message that flows into the screenplay y, which is a nod to the right political one. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a10 from 10; At the time it will be recognized as a great movie
