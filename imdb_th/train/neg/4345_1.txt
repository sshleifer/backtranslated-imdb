Deceptive advertising ... I saw an ad for Carlitos Way: Rise to Power that said "from the producers of Scarface and Carlito's Way" to get it straight ... Michael Bergman didn't produce Scarface. Should not abandon Bergman's ability ... but in my opinion, he should have a little more class. I think I can speak for the masses when I say ... We hate the lies clearly. As far as this movie goes best I think Puff Daddy works well even though Luis Guzman should be ashamed to work in this movie. Overall, this film does not work well in the space for Carlito's approach. Obviously, this project is an attempt to create a quick buck instead of a good movie.
