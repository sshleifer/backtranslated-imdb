I think this piece of waste is the best evidence that a good idea can be destroyed. Why do all American animators think that children in this era want good stories from the stupid GI JOE? Looney Tunes is the most popular character in history. But they were not created as Xtreme. I mean, coming !!! Tiny Toons is a great example of how to update old ideas without losing the traditional charm. But this piece of waste is just an example of a stupid organization's decision to create a cheap silly performance! Kids love heroes, right? All performances are just a waste of time when we see the new Looney Tunes version. But this time in the form of a superhero, this doesn't sound terrible. But the problem is that this performance is trying hard to copy the series like Batman. Cartoon movie or the new Justice League. The result ??? Bad copy of flash (Road Runner) or Superman (anyone else ??? bugs bunny) The problem is that Looney Tunes doesn't intend to be a drama. But it should be funny !!!! As I said before this series, and many people wonder why the anime has taken over the world ??? This performance is trying to give all the drama and action. But that's what little series and anime can do if you want to see the old upgrades of old items. See Tiny Toons. That is a possible example of bringing life back to the old characters, but with stories Good and respect the traditional roots Too bad to show that you are dead. The wise decision again of the company.
