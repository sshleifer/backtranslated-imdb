I rarely comment on movies. But I have read other comments and I can't believe that there are people praising this celluloid waste. I know there are some people who have their own agenda. Not performing well, shooting badly, and the story feels like the director made while he walked. I will not focus on the sex of the movie about the little boy because the filmmakers know clearly what they want and what their audience wants. All I can say is that it is a horrible movie, bad content and disgust. Production is a matter of skill and I'm glad that they can't make movies like this.
