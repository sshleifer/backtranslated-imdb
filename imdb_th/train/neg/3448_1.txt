I watched this movie when it still has 6 points and it says 7.2 likes or anything but seriously. This is a scary movie. To break it down The first thing you notice about this film is that it was filmed on a digital camera that was hand-held by a freshman at a community college. The next thing you will notice is that the actor is a friend of the new brother who speaks. (He may find them at the pub the night before on the third show. You will notice that the music editing is scary and they try to cram. The song in this movie at the time of 30 seconds ... and still have all digital editing on the PC at the home of the new brother ... maybe using windows movie maker. Well, undeniably Following suit, I would not recommend this movie to anyone I know. But I imprisoned writers and directors to watch this movie in Hell for eternity
