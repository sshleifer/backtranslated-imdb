Good enough with stylish images, but little things are a budget hindrance. <br /> <br /> I also get the impression that they try to scare you with some strange graphics. <Br /> <br /> If you like anime, especially in cyber cities and police advertisements, this may be your road. <br /> <br /> But in general, it has a low budget. But not having their own style. <br /> <br /> Great soundtrack from the grunge / punk band / post grunge that has never been heard before. Worth checking out for the soundtrack only.
