The little boy saw the mother killed and the father hung himself. 20 years later, he had many friends gather to expel his soul so he wouldn't become like his father. All stock characters are in place: good pair; Men "funny"; Strong hood (But sensitive); Clever girl (she wears glasses - that's the way we know); Fools and blondes don't have two personalities. Everything relates to the stupid wooden statues that come to life (don't ask) and kill people. I know I have a problem when after the grand opening scene, we jumped 20 years later - a horror movie <br /> <br /> The conversation is bad. The performance is not good. (Except Betsy Palmer - Why must Betsy?) And killing is stupid and / or unimaginable My favorite scene is that when two people have sex and the statue is knocked out of bed to show that he is fully dressed! Horror movies that are bad and foolish Avoid all costs.
