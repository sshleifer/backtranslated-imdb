I agree with other reviewers who are satisfied with "For The Birds", which won the Oscar in 2002 for "Best Animated Short", not this sick content that claims to be the best and attractive for everyone without Believe in heaven or hell. <br /> <br /> Good animation, but with lots of shorts. And by the way I love dark humor But this is not interesting from the beginning. <br /> <br /> For the story here: The guy walking around and surrounded by nothing but gray (the symbol here) told by the TV set (which appears everywhere A few hundred yards) that he was in heaven, hell or hell Every time he put a gun on his head and shot himself after hearing the news I guess that would be a joke in a few cases.
