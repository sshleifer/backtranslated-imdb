Due to budget cuts, Ethel Janowski (played by Priscilla Alden) again was released from the mental institution. (Although she killed six people) and sent to Hope Hope Bartholomew half way She will immediately return to her cruel life and kill everyone between her and the food. <br /> <br /> Holy MOLY! This movie doesn't suck! You know that you are having problems when the opening credits start and are only credits from the first film that appears to be taken from the TV screen. ) Decided to return to the world of Crazy Fat Ethel ten years later and with a budget that could cover the cost of blank tapes and video camera rentals during the weekend Assume that Millard's unique style is poorly translated with videos. Seriously, I have created a movie at home that has more production value. And Millard tried to pull SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT 2 with half the screenings from the first movie. (Which looks like it was removed from the VHS that is worn) I mean at least the first movie that tried. Here we don't have weak music effects. (If at all possible) The camera is shaky, scary sounds and fixes that look like it's done with two VCRs. Avoid this at all costs!
