But it's not funny Most of them are pubertal presentations and excuses for girls showing women who are scantily clad. In fact, it's almost impressive that there are many things that you can put in because it is everywhere. Unfortunately it is one of the signs of a movie that cannot support itself. It is not good enough. <br /> <br /> There are three points in exchange, or actually three actors that are more valuable than this chapter. It's a leading actor, Josh Cooke, who actually managed to create an impression of some common sense. I know that Sara Foster has more ability to do this kind of movie, and Emanuelle Vaugier seems to have more talent than this film > <br /> The indispensable thing is a good joke. In fact, bad jokes are quite rare as well. It's not funny. <br /> <br /> 3/10
