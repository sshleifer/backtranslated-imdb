Oh, brother, the only reason that this film is extremely annoying is to avoid getting all the "bombs" from me, because at least it is notable in the past that it was the first movie of the Three Stooges (when they were not yet. And still regretted Ted Healy in pain). But even though he was a long-time Stooges fan, I must say that Moe was a little old. Larry and Alon were badly used as henchmen. Gangster comedy trio janitor at the higher of Mr. Healy. They didn't continuously focus on this film and stupidly limiting their play, making them portrayed as funny cartoon characters beyond reason that tried hard to make humor. <br /> <br /> Most toothache related to jack Pearl looked for ridiculous things to laugh from the audience as a person who disguised himself as Baron Munchausa. (This is a good example of the level of humor: "I oppose!" "In which area?" "Coffee grounds!") His best friend is none other than Jimmy Durante who is young. But even Chanes is boring.
