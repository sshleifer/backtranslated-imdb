I can assume that other reviewers of this "movie" are shareholders in the production company because it's the worst movie I've seen in the past five years. From the rabbi's opening act, laughing uncontrollably for no apparent reason, it is clear that the actors in this film will kill "B-Level", both my wife and me. Create this movie and we look forward to making funny popcorn movies. We know that we don't rent Citizen Kane and we don't expect to see amazing movies. Best course ever. However, after 40 minutes of the most painful junk I've seen, we closed it instead of spending a minute in our lives. <br /> <br /> If it's "funny" that doesn't have laughter. Scary performances, skinny plot and annoying characters are what you want, then this movie is for you. Actually, Troll 2 is better - at least I laugh at the popcorn sex scene. > <br /> I can't adjust the writing of this photo review anymore because I spend almost an hour in a funny story.
