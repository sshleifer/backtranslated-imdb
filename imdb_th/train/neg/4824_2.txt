I want to like this movie But there are many elements that destroy it for me The use of fisheye lenses and irreversible changes made me feel that I was in the world of potions. But it made me think that I was watching MTV for a short time. I love movies that give us a glimpse of the cruel hell. But this movie can't decide whether it's a bad horror movie or a worse review about the horror of addiction.
