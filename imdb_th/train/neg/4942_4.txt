Every new dropped performance should be given at least a policy of "3 Your Protests and You Don't Live". I give 3 comedians the opportunity to make me laugh. That is the end. Episode 3 After episode 1, I speak to the TV that "Canceling tomorrow." It's so bad. I have now watched 4 of the first episodes of "Cavemen" and have not even managed to smile. Not a climber, a surfer, a true story, no face movements at all. I will continue to punish myself by watching every episode in the future, because I believe that I lack something on this program. I just don't "get" but I believe that the comedy in the major television networks during The important time is just funny. But there is no laughter from me. There is no way that ABC will perform the funniest comedy at 8:00 am. I know it must be an inside joke that is not joking with my brain. I have read each of the previous comments and I "received" the social aspects of it. But what is a joke ???? I will have to suffer continuously for at least 30 minutes a week until I have a light bulb and slap myself in the head, shouting "Eureka"
