Raymond Berry is a lawyer in his close friend's murder (Dick Forrest) because of his love for his friend's wife. (Angela Lansbury) This is a full year before he starts to do Perry Mason, so this movie may be of special interest to the fans if it is inspiring in the selection process. His show <br /> <br /> Interesting that Lansbury is always good, but her character here has one dimension and the motivation for her offense in the mystery is very clear. There is an interesting performance by Lamont Johnson as a painter who loves "femme fatale", but the character Burr is quite straightforward. It was strange to see actors like Burr make a romantic scene with Lansbury and his break didn't match his character here as in most movies that I had seen. He had no mystery and All doubts should be around the title of the movie and how Burr's character sets Lansbury's character to engage with himself. (The two dangers prevented her from trying again for the original murder case.) He did that with a very large tape recorder that she didn't notice when she entered the room. I guess <br /> <br /> some time Time that is unintentionally fun and in general the rest may be done. Television.
