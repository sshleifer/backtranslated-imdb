This movie is terrible - conversations, stories, actors and actors - everything! - It is hard to imagine that we will be watching movies that are worse this year or in the years to come. "Love's Brother" (located in Australia, among Italian immigrants) has nothing but a shallow idea about culture Italy to offer Movie message - The ugly person must marry an ugly person, a beautiful person, must marry a beautiful person - feel truly unwell. Giovanni Ricci is quite good in movies such as 'Suburbia' or 'Lost in Translation' but his pseudo-Italian accent is hard to bear. Watch this movie at your own risk. Trash like garbage!
