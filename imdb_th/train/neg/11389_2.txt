If you like movies that have a small set of scenes with strange sex stories, this movie is for you. In addition, the leading actor / actress (Newcomer sex) has an interesting screen display. But not enough to add more than a mildly interesting movie - if so Essentially, this film is about 3 social outcasts (transgender prostitutes, businessmen, men, and gay Russian immigrants) who have developed ties. Why isn't it clear? We expect to accept these mistakes, it is important that basic honest people have the ability to love while they hustle their bodies on the right road !! And Anna Nicole Smith loves her sugar daddy up to ninety! The filmmaker shows the dirty and unpleasant side of life while wanting us to believe under these things. Those who are seriously damaged are actually quite normal. Imagine. Unfortunately, this is a picture of real life in the wild. Overall, there is no plot, no truth and no real reason to spend so much time here. Unless you like to be very happy in kink !!!
