This is a good effort in something. But it is too hypocritical and boring to get to the top. Using virtual sets is almost usable. But at some point it failed miserably They take advantage of the small budget that I can guess. I just want the story and most of the performances to be better. There are many parts that you see what they are targeting and it's great if they hit those marks. But they don't Confusing and unbelievable stories. DVD transfer is too bad. I didn't take a long time to watch movies in one place. Here I have to shut down It's too boring. I make a movie slowly but just make them interesting in some way. Visually, clever stories, performances, etc. This thing is lacking in every department, so never increasing the fascinating experience. Maybe the next time the filmmakers' efforts will improve.
