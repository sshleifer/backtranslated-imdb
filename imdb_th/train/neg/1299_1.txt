This production has no story. The show was embarrassing. The Dutch television star Sophie Hilbrand should not add this film to her resume. Her performance is far from flawless, and personally I think she has crossed the boundaries of suitability with a career. Related to the way she revealed herself in this film This film has too many unnecessary nudity, vulgar sex scenes and vulgar language. It also shows the wrong image of the Netherlands. (As most movies do) Don't go to watch this movie: waste time, waste money and shameful notes for Hill Brandland, who proved better when she was on the screen.
