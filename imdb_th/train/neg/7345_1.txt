I hate this program, what kind of people are watching this garbage ?? OK, my father and mother loved it. Haha. But I'm sure I left the room before it happened. It's depressing and sad. But the worst thing about it is acting. I can't stand all this detective program because the detective is made of wood and without heart. What happened to the list of detectives with true mysteries ??? I mean, people who want to know what happens to the characters that we don't know about that thing that died 20 years ago ??? I hope that the BBC will add comedy to the BBC 1 because now, the agent of Deny has already had space for this shit.
