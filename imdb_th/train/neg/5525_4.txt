The problem with family drama is that in addition to television movies on channels like Lifetime, most people do not want to watch them. And what has been watched is often sensitive and about current issues or specific topics in the news (Or the latest news) movies that describe or explore the human condition is unpopular Especially with the young crowd who will be the fan base of Miss Lohan or the younger crowd who tend to make movies that are not only famous but successful for the studio. > <br /> The only problem I have with this movie is Some characteristics It is quite a blame for Lohan's character acting. (Destroying cars, using drugs, etc.) about what her stepfather did to her While it is unlikely that it is possible to expect the audience to swallow In addition, in other aspects, such as she gave Moerman the boy, oral sex, or she would be a good assistant to the vet, which happened to her mother. Really help this movie It is placed in the composition of the comedy situation in which one tries. Then, they created a well-documented and well-documented documentary. <br /> <br /> When you watch the DVD and listen Comments, especially for ending different options, you can see that all of this is a sharp focus.
