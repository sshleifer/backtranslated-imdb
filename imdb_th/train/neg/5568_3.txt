Dolph Lundgren is a former Boston police / boxer who searches for the strange scene to find out who killed his brother, who is a very thoughtful person in the community. However, along the way he learns that his brother enjoys Dolph Lundgren is really good in this movie. Actually, based on his performance here, who will forget that Lundgren will be famous for the relevant action roles? In fact, Lundgren was left to dry in a thrilling thriller that was both predictable and difficult to understand. Co-Star Danielle Brett was also good. This is best when it focuses on the chemistry of Lundgren and Brett. Of course, this film takes time to explore their relationship. However, the film still lacks clarity, the action does not exist, the plot is not adequately explored (very boring, BS around the investigation, Lundgren's brother, his brother) and this film is not worth watching and Nonsense again. Lundgren is really good (as well as newcomer Danielle Brett), but this movie is in order from one sequence to another, which makes this movie interesting. Hope is If there is anything that shows how Lundgren evaluated as an actor, <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of 4 (bad)
