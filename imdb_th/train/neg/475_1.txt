One of the most disgusting movies I've ever seen. I want to vomit after watching it. I saw this film in my class, American history, and the purpose was to see the agitation of the farmers in the West in the late 1800s. Oh, and finally have a calf birth and let me tell you that birth is not bad. But a lot of liquid that came out made most people in my class go to the bathroom. Your own story is ok. The evidence of this was the widow and her daughter, and they moved to the west to take care of this cowboy's house. They lived a difficult life and an interesting view of life in the West in the late 1800s. But if you have a choice, don't watch this movie.
