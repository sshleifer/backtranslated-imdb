Don't make bones about this. There are many unusual things in this movie. It groaned all the way, not funny, predictable and irrational. Let's start at the beginning: the letters are boring and fortunate men - give Stiller another one in his boring and lucky man's belt - the alleged forest. But in reality, it's normal. Interesting love - those Aniston plays well. A cheerful friend and then an assortment of clich√©s: annoying Australian people, confident Spanish people, etc. Story: The beginning is a little unusual. But after that will go into all movie formats according to standards Your average knockout joke The biggest problem is that the "development" of Stiller's character seems to come from anything - like playing on your average school. The author knows where he started and where he ended. But didn't have enough stock. In the end, the 'joke' that was alleged was nothing. But with humor that is not standard There are separate control scenes, fat men, sweaty, etc. <br /> <br /> In summary, the simple truth about this movie is that learning the meaning of the word 'charts' is only good. Hamburg is really a dog dinner here and the sugar coating of Stiller and Aniston may lure the audience. But the remaining flavor at the end is also disgusting. <br /> <br /> Final comment: This movie may have Terrifying But Aniston also chose the film series Friends-seasons Better than Kudrow's 'Marci X'
