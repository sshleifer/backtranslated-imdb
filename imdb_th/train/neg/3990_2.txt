Jungle Fever has a style that is too cool, structured and not straightforward. Wesley Snipe is wrong with the leader and no chemistry between him and Annabella. Although there are many talents in this film But most will be wasted because the parts will be reduced to less than the decorative pendant In addition, instead of just being racist for something ugly and stupid, it's Spike Lee choosing to wave it around like a whining flag I do it through most movies. But I did not succeed and that for me rarely happens
