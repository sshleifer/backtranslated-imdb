Ok, like most of Steven Seagal's fans, I know I don't expect to get a masterpiece every time he creates a movie. But I expect that this movie will have at least a sorter budget. The main problem of copying that I watch is worse than copying. I know that in some movies I have to do and I agree that But when they were over-determined with completely different actors and doing this throughout the story The magic of overdubbing away. These scenes seem to be created without interest, as in one scene above the sliding glass in the top-secret laboratory. There are large cracks that pass through it. I was truly disappointed with this movie and hope that Stevens' next project will be more complete before sending the movie out to buy / rent. The story of this movie makes me wonder if I'm watching sci-fi movies. Whether or not some parts seem alien But they never fully explained what happened. I found it very confusing.
