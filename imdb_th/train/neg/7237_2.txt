Life is too short for this movie. I know that it wouldn't be good when I knew I was wondering - David Schwimmer would play the same type of person he played in 'Friends'. <br /> <br /> Let's face each other. Men can't play anything except being stupid or they never offer anything else. I feel it is a mixture of both. <br /> <br /> And I must say that it is very difficult to like a movie that has a lot of damage to Gwyneth Paltrow, Barbara Hershey, Toni Collette And Carol Kane !!!
