There are beautiful landscapes. Writers wear repetitive words in the mouth of actors. This performance is ridiculous if there are fewer actors. 'Art must elevate humanity or be a Bachelor of Science'. Otherwise, because everyone's art is said to stimulate humanity and show the dark side. The lead character also said that people who do not drink, hide the shadow side. Wrong There is no life in his work or expression of pain. All artists have limited themselves to dozens of landscapes. The discussion between the characters is an elementary school. The repetitive things often give one character the upper hand that the writer wants. I try to like after reading the first wow reviews all here. I have to dig deep to see what I agree. I think good comments come from people who connect with movies. I was moved only once to the end. That child is too cold. The scenery is good and the music is ridiculous. Just my opinion But nowhere shows me
