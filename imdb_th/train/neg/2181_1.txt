I saw this movie thinking that it would be one of the old B movies that was fun to watch me. Wrong! This movie is boring and clearly aimed at men who like to see obese women. The story is ridiculous and unbelievable that it made me lose all my attention. Seems to be in the same category as Edwood's movie - the bottom of the tank
