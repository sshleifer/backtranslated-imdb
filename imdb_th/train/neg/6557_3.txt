Actually, they spell the brain on credit, not BRIAN. <br /> <br /> Ok, they don't have a budget for spell checkers. The money produced for the excellent old car here has at least two packs of packard. One is Darin Convergence, a yellow convertible packard. <br /> <br /> The scene of the movie studio shows that there is money for costumes and decorations. Old camera outside of Ciro, road signs and anything needed to get beautiful pictures. Well written and directed <br /> <br /> My DVD says that it takes about 104 minutes. It's about 85 minutes. It ends without conclusions. There are clashes but no conclusions. This film was destroyed with 99 cents for this. I paid 99 cents for this. I can buy 3 cans of cat food and watch my cat's face while he is excited There will be surprises to make the movie interesting. Then it sat there. <br /> <br /> A Latin actor played by Steven Bauer. (Tony Montoya) may be more involved in everything that happens here. This actor may make a good movie. <br /> <br /> I think if they cut Brian's part and use Steven Bauer instead of him and change the script and keep the packards and cause the band to lose and add Johnny Otis as well They have something. <br /> <br /> Here Kitty Kitty ... <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
