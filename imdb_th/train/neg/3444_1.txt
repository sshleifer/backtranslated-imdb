This is the worst movie I've ever seen. From the plot, though the picture "Special Techniques" Performances and I'm talking about the story? Everything in it sucks the ass! <br /> <br /> This is a good example of the meaning of "Doing too much" and I'll try to explain: <br /> <br /> I understand what the creator Of this film trying to do; This is probably one of the movies that you can't tell what hell is going on until the end. You sit idly, not knowing who is dead, who is still alive and who killed anyone and why. And when you think you have the right time, you will find that you are wrong and the movie ends. Minutes! Something like "Unbreakable" or "The Job" if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> But Olga Levens, the writer of this garbage, yes Olga ?? Writers, directors, producers, screenwriters, Caster, production designer, art director, costume designer and also twice as much for one character as some scenes ... in general And it's a female movie "Levens Productions" You're not wrong :-) <br /> <br /> This may be a shocking thing, but "This time" Olga made this big jump from one scene The scene from the dream into reality ... but wait! All this is a dream after all ... or is it ??? The picture faded away and I realized that this thing didn't happen. The only girl on the boat ... actually no boat ... Don't wait! There are more ships and guys! They are still alive! thanks to God! No, they called her to join the cruise ... but then the ship disappeared, so maybe they are dead ??? Or maybe they have never had a life to start with. <br /> <br /> If you understand what I just said you might like this movie - otherwise it's a boring and one reason. Which I set in all shit Is to find out how hell will be able to finish this movie ... <br /> <br /> Do not watch this story if you focus on 90 minutes, will lose in this case ...
