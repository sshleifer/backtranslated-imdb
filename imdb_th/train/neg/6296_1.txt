This movie looks interesting; I read the book many years ago and it informs me that the property is quite tight. <br /> <br /> Start watching it and almost from the beginning. In fact, I'm not worried about watching all ... Bad performances, bad performances and immediate nasty characters - that's the point of the movie. I guess <br /> <br /> look. This movie Leave a bad taste in the mouth and irritate me for the rest of the weekend. <br /> <br /> Don't bother with this feature.
