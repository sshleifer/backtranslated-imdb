I really want to like this movie. But it is impossible The show has a special hammam. The plot is annoying and the rhythm is slow. All the time in the theater, I want the movie to finish twenty minuets in a movie and I pray for the end. Sure, some pictures are good, but c'mon, I really mean! And for movies about men tuning musical instruments, there is no music to talk about The songs are annoying and boring. Sometimes the loud shrill sounds are annoying as well. Most of this movie will make me bored and crawl out at the same time. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I got to watch "Tideland" and wash the bad taste from my mouth.
