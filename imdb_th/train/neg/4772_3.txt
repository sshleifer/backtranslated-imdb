Before watching this movie, I can tell that it is the complete copy of Saw (along with the place like the hut they are in and the black man wants someone to separate their hands from the sleeve). MJH in the movie will make me distant. (Uh, can we say GROSS?) But I still want to try it out. <br /> <br /> Start now. I'm a little interested. The show was extremely scary and I found myself laughing almost every reaction from the characters. (Especially men who play "Sulley") MJH is the worst But I still look. <br /> <br /> However, the ending is the biggest joke of all of them! I sat with a shock, seriously thinking that "Is that the end ?! Is this a joke? "<br /> <br /> I think this garbage collection is more fun than a trick. "Horror movies" and that really says something!
