I have been a big fan of Woody Allen all the time and are always in the past. But only blind lovers can ignore that this film is boring, meaningless, insolent and scary. Blank mental obsession based on inconsistent space And what a terrible idea to create "Allen-clone actor" is a new fake that is going into the mouth of Wilfred and the manner in which Allen will do where he is 30 years old. Obviously And not talking about dialogue ... something that is intended to reflect the philosophy, becoming a voluntary intellectual mockery without knowing of the very sad cartoon effects ...
