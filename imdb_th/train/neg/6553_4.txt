Many years after the collapse of the world's largest giant company, the world has fallen into a new dark era with the Cyborg harvest on its part. Cash, a robot, a woman traveling to see a wasted doctor to receive news that she is pregnant. When runners flee from Recyclers (bounty hunters who hunt cyborgs), cash tries to find a way to Cytown, a legendary cyborgs refuge. <br /> <br /> "Cyborg 3: The Recycler" is the third time. In the end, CYBORG, the first movie, was planned to be a sequel to MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE, but was quickly rewritten in the post-war martial arts festival that became a classic because of the action scene. Magic CYBORG 2: GLAD SHADOW is The further development of its predecessor. But not widely accepted (And was expelled from someone who saw it as a cheap animal food) <br /> <br /> This movie tried to do one thing To unite the first two movies (The first episode is a magical action movie, while the second is Cyberpunk Smart.) Unfortunately, when the two count Clearly, the budget is lower than CYBORG 2 because this film is located in a deserted desert area. (Like the post-apocalyptic action movie in the 90s) was shot around the old industrial building to save cost. <br /> <br /> The story of this film is on the plot device of the story. The pregnant robot is interesting as if it's ridiculous. (This movie is not the first movie to try that idea. OVA ARMITAGE III anime series uses it more), but the film falls into the same way that the action-sci-fi-i-2 movie that has Many low budgets fall victim to the fact that things are clear. (Synthetic organisms) are nothing more than robots. Visual effects do not have anything more than artificial arms and makeup effects. <br /> <br /> The performance is the standard for this type of film by leading actor (Khrystyne Haje). Is the worst actor alone Instead of being happy from the news that she was pregnant, she did everything with trance and sullen. Malcolm McDowell is a normal gangster star who starred in the scenes in which he appeared in the movie & Richard Lynch. Enjoyed as the villain leader. What is particularly notable is that Andrew Byniarski plays Lynch's right hand which will appear in THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE remake & prequel.
