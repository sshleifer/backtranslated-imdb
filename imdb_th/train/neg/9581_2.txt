That's the only thing I can say about this movie. Cleveland is a star. I've been there and have never seen the city look good like this before. Beautiful rivers and city views. <br /> <br /> This film moves forward as they hope you won't notice the lack of relevance in the real world. People ran and shot the gun without any effect. For example, there was a shot in the character in Rob Lowe's house - two cars were stolen, but police didn't appear there until later in the movie The killing of the contractor never seems unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Anyone who writes this movie should receive countless movies. Many actors in this movie are much better. I checked the date of the movie to make sure it wasn't written during the writer's protest. But this is not the case Now, this movie rotates according to Universal's HD channel - unless you want to let Lowe lower. There's no reason to watch.
