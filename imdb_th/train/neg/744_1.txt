The holy God, the great traitor This movie is terrible. I think I'm addicted. In the wrong way ... The character acting is the worst thing I have ever seen. This movie is more like Lord of the G-Strings than IMHO (it's a real movie). Most movies seem to be made on a scary green screen. My favorite part is when they are in a carriage and you can tell that there are no horses. They are fleeing from extraterrestrial monsters and running at a speed as fast as a jog. From there, it turns into a distant shot with horses. CG is ridiculous and CG generally seems to be inferior. 'Beyond the Mind's Eye in 1992, I mean So it really feels like the horrible episode of Hercules without Kevin Sorbo being there to save the worst life.
