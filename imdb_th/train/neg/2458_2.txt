I can't explain how bad this movie is. I am the only one here who finds disgusting animations? The Men of Rohan looks like 100% fake, with badly colored hair that doesn't come close to what the actors look at. The ghost looks scary. Why is gandalf walking with a bad limp? Why can't they pronounce correctly? Saruman is not Aruman. There is another thing that sounds like the scary pronunciation * sp * of all Tolkiens characters, and I'm glad that the studio doing this pulls the plug out of the sequence. It's just a terrible adjustment. Go to see the Hobbit cartoon to see Tolkiens cartoons that are better. Hell, even the cartoon version of ROTK has improved. 2/10
