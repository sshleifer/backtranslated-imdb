This film is disgusting. It should be a warning that some nasty writers who are lustful of lust, trying to make a name for themselves before being held hostage for an hour and a half, to see what garbage is. That is wrong, misuse of energy and the loss of every type of education system that teaches you to read and write Talia. Your psychiatrist must determine the strongest medication for your problem. <br /> <br /> The performances and plot makes me no choice but to move fast through the middle of the garbage. I ended up with a scene that was not retaliated. If you want to learn how to scare the audience of Larry Clark, I lose respect for all the actors of this film. "Isn't it supported by me anymore? How do the actors or actors come to sit in the scene while the human behavior shows clearly from the insane mind? I feel sorry for all the actors participating in that scene. I think the devil will know who wrote this movie. Congratulations on receiving your attention.
