I chose this movie from the cover, which was terrible. It's not funny, and the main character is disgusting. The girl is beautiful But the story and the performance are terrible. It has nothing to do with surfing. Great movie with a "theme" of surfing that doesn't involve surfing and no real surfers. Catherine Zeta Jones is beautiful and the movie may be seen as a resurrection just because she is in the limelight. But if you don't see it, don't waste time. Bad movies with wonderful surfing, true surfers and amazing, beautiful movies in the hands of God.
