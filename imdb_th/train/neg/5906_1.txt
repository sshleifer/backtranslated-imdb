This movie is terrible. The plot is sucked. The show is not good. The editing is not appropriate and this movie makes me want to poke my eyes out. I hope I will have the time I spent watching this movie back. The balloon scene is stupid. Mormons. Really funny jokes. Sucking soundtrack. I don't see the chemistry between the two actors. It's full of traditional images. .. "Computer idiot The worst thing is that these actors have to play themselves in spirit. This film helps create a lackluster effort for important LDS beliefs in Hollywood, IE RM, church children, etc. etc. I will forget to watch this movie and instead head to the brick wall Before You will be more entertained than watching bad excuses for acting.
