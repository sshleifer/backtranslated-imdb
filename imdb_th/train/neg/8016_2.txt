First of all, this movie is GLACIALLY that is slow-moving and I can see most audiences lose patience for the first thirty minutes. <br /> <br /> The content of this movie is something I think will be the basis of Great movie The most missing thing here is the plot to develop the basic theme. <br /> <br /> It's unfortunate because in the hands of writers like (say) Lanford Wilson, I think the symbol is like a mountain lion. Invading The school campus can accept good and sad moments without being good. <br /> <br /> I think with a good chapter that supports this film, the same filmmakers with the same tastes and even actors. The same person (who doesn't have the opportunity to impress me) may present a meaningful picture and feel the pain and struggles that boys face when they develop. Put on a powerful "interest" for older children that he admires. <br /> <br /> However, I'm sorry to say that there is no foundation and is armed with a vague, boring and uninteresting script. Without any sort of sight and lack of any reasonable structure (For example, after watching, I believe you will find that you can't point to the climbing scene and instead Will find themselves enumerated "Well, maybe that scene or that scene is the pinnacle ...") - The result is 95 minutes boring. <br /> <br /> Without a good plan, we are not particularly interested in any characters. ; Their trials and tribulations are boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Without a good plan, amazing equipment and freedom, directing in a surreal direction will be more confusing and confusing than improving the story. For example, I never believed that creating "Leah" and I think most viewers would be baffled by the traditional way that her phone was filmed. <br /> <br /> When this movie stands I'm afraid it's not recommended at all. What I can't understand is why this movie was not re-created by an enterprising filmmaker ... instead of an ordinary movie that was created in the first place! What it wants is a good screenplay written by a good writer and I think this movie will become an easily recognizable classic about the aspect of a young man who barely gets a check. Practice in drama All the elements are very boring and seem to be true in the movie. (Text written on the stomach of a child, the scene "Leah" imagining a television screen) may become rich if supported with good STORYLINE. <br /> <br >> I see in some comments that people are Talking about this film about "gay" and I think it's wrong Obviously, the "attention" that appears is of a new hairy boy in an older teenage boy. But Logan's character is too young to judge in any gender choice and of course in his imagination. All types of sexual and non-sexual stimuli as we expected in young children like him. I believe that "defeat" such as Logan is common among young men who have grown up to choose female couples.
