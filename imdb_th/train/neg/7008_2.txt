Annie Pott is just a highlight in a truly boring movie. Mark Hamill plays a really upset teenager that Corvette has stolen. He and his classmates become a hotrod (probably an ugly car. And head to Las Vegas, along with Annie, to follow the evil genius who stole his pride and happiness. <br /> <br /> I would probably have withdrawn my eyes after watching this. If it's not for the fun of watching Annie Pott in the first chapter, and it's also not good for Hamill, which he didn't learn from a few performances from her, Danny Bonaduce made a stupid pendant.
