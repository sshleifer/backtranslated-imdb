"The Bank" (1915, Chaplin) "The Bank" was one of Charlie's Essanay movies in 1915, while these films were able to watch more than movies in 1914, but the film seemed to be slightly below average. Gag with a double locked room that has been unlocked twice, and unfortunately Charlie woke up from a dream where he was stroking Lady Lady's hair only to rub the mob he used to be like. The pillow is a time when both classic Chaplin. They have both the beginning and the end. Ironically In the middle of the battle was a fight with a janitor, a competitor's colleague and a bank robber to defeat a young woman. The liner may be the greatest physical thrust of the film, and Charlie uses it to create humor, whether it is the intention of his character or not. It seems that Sub will be Charlie's ego in doing what he wishes he can do. But will not do with both his own hands interesting thing But still better
