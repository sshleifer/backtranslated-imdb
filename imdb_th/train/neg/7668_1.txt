The minute ahead starts, I know we're having problems! The evidence is the most laughable thing. The story is even worse if possible. <br /> <br /> The performance is stiff and the actors give a feeling of inexperience. You expect more from the likes of Slater, Reid and Dorff. The lines are sent as if coming from a robot. And i'm sorry i like red But she is not very convincing as an archaeologist. Slater and Dorff chose a punchy film to try and come back to show <br /> <br /> Continuity fell out throughout the story. Life is not bad. But they weren't good as well. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, I want ninety minutes in my life. They can collect money But give me time! Lose nothing
