I don't know what this movie was about before I saw it, because Tashan only had a teaser preview while being promoted. So I asked my friends what they knew about this and they said "It was the debut of Vijay Krishna Acharya, who wrote the screenplay for Dhoom 1 & 2 and the son of Saif Ali Khan, making Ibrahim. Children in his past story. "<br /> <br /> After watching, I understand why they are not a suitable example because there is nothing in the movie to show. The story is a great story, and even a 10 year old boy can create a better story. There are almost no actions that happen and the camera vibrates at every possible angle and it is difficult. Will understand who killed anyone Actions are crazy & unrealistic, like 1 man has a handgun that can kill about 100 people with a machine gun. <br /> <br /> While I watched Tashan, it reminds me of three movies: <br / > <br /> Sin City: During the opening credits. <br /> <br /> Koyla: Anil Kapoor's terrible English language, like Amrish Puri in Koyla. <br /> <br /> Jhoom Barabar Jhoom: No fun jokes. The matter is not funny even <br /> <br >> I still hear that the budget is 40 crores which is equal to the amount of Dhoom 2 and I don't know how all the money goes. Users now However, if you don't like Dhoom 2, there is no chance that you will like Tashan. The competition is so hot and a million times better. <br /> <br /> Only 2 good songs are Dil Haara & Challiya and both songs. This song was filmed in Greece in a good location. But using it in junk movies? Even the English language of Anil Kapoor was unable to record this dissatisfaction.
