Yes, this movie made me feel really horrified when I knew I paid it and spent more than 1 hour of my life trying to watch it. The bald man just gave me the impression of being a psychotic actor - a junkie and a young woman is the worst actor I've ever seen. Believe me, if you appreciate the time when avoiding this movie, I understand that movies require money to build and some movies don't have that money. But that's not the reason for stupid plans. I always support independent movies when they deserve support. But this movie makes a bad name for this type of movie I'm still traumatized I will not believe in good coverage anymore.
