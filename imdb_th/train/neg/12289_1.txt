I'm bored with movies that sound fun in one-line conclusions and end up with equal things you will find in the center of the bottom of the compost heap. <br /> <br /> Who knows: "Witch" "May Sounds interesting in the studio, even though there are "big name actors. "(Such as Blair and Hussel Hoff - winking, winking, nudge-in-law) and hissing like Hildegard Knef card (I pushed some girls ...) <br /> <br /> But on the film, it dissolves faster than the paper sculpture in a rain storm. It seems that these unfortunate people were trapped in the East Island mansion and one of them. (The woman I guess) is being targeted by Satanism to bear the children of hell, while others are ways. <br /> <br /> Okay, you have a cross section of "The Exorcist", "The Omen", "Ten Little Indians" and less movies than the other. The Amok line does not have much to entertain and most of you will travel from one scene to another until it ends. <br /> <br /> Not even Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff are important, they are in there to receive <br /> <br /> From his face, Hasselhoff may hope that he will come back with Pam Anderson (and who can blame him?) And Linda. .. Well, who knows the benefits of PETA or professional golf tours or whatever she is today? <br /> <br /> And the torture scene! Ecchhhh You will see people closing their mouths, sewing them, hanging in the fireplace, roaring, tangled in trees during violent storms, boats that burst from the neck, etc. etc. Shesh and I think "Mark of the Devil" is The most sadistic movie I've ever seen .... <br /> <br /> Don't worry, it's not worth your time. I can't believe I will tell you as much as I think. If you watch it, just see if you can count on ancient ideas. And yes, Blair will be possessed as if you didn't see that coming down to the main road followed by the band. <br /> <br /> There is no "Witchery" star - these witches will make you wander.
