First of all, I would like to add that I am a historian, so what I look for in a movie based on historical events is that it is based on historical facts. But this is not the case here. Of course, this movie is entertaining and all. But the fact that it does not depend on all true facts is more than annoying Hitler was not anti-Semitic in his youth. He also worked for Jews before the First World War. However, during the First World War and afterwards he had a view about the Jews. His parenting in this film was also incorrect. Hitler, because the child was not an annoying little boy. He has more or less normal parenting. There is no mention of the lost brothers and other important parts added to the puzzle that Hitler <br /> <br /> Robert Carlyle is a great actor. Hitler was not impossible and unstable as he was vertical here. Under his younger age, he was a charming person who "managed" people through his charm. His unstable behavior and anger started in the turning point of the war. <br /> <br /> I want to see a movie about Hitler's life based on historical facts and not charge I hate when people point to blame, such as Hitler and others and tell the wrong story just to draw their image as a demon. It is much better to tell the story correctly as before so that everyone can learn what it is! The people behind this film should have research before doing this. Because it seems that they don't even know what happened Hitler was not even shot in the March Revolution in Munch. His shoulders ripped off the socket. <br /> <br /> It helps you to see a documentary that is better than seeing this.
