The type that is attracted by the erotic scene only recognizes that this is one of the most unbelievable and unbelievable movies I've ever seen. Sort of like a high school film project. What is Rosanna Arquette thinking? And what is it that has all the stock characters in the strange Midwest city? It's quite difficult to be involved with this. There are no lessons to learn from it, no great insights, just pride and vain. (But there is a lot of skin if you are interested in) ridiculous nonsense videos .... What are bisexual relationships. And what about that ridiculous dance with everyone playing their fixed roles? Let this pass be like one million miles of bad movies, waste money spent on starving children or AIDS in Africa .....
