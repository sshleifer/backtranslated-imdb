I went to watch this movie, expecting it to be really scary. And it is I feel really sorry for the actor with the actor - Kathy Bates is a great actor ... before she made this movie - Vince Vaughan and Paul Gmati were disappointed as usual. But Miranda Richardson couldn't perform well. And love you for Fred's father, played by Trevor Peacock (from Vicar of Dibley favorite, others), about one line Humor is lacking ... (However, there is a part of the movie that Santa comes into the house of a Jewish family ... that makes me laugh because their expression is classic.) Don't watch this movie unless you There will be other alternatives against the train. Significant real - maybe a train could be better ...).
