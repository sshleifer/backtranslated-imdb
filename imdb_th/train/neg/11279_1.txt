Words cannot explain how bad this movie is. I think Sandali isn't good. But at least there was a good shock and a good chin from time to time stroking here This is ridiculous! The script is bad. Bad direction. The acting is bad and you know what? I can't think of the only thing that would suggest about anything other than the fact that it wasn't too long. If you want 100 minutes worth of entertainment, book yourself at the dentist and work in the root canal - more fun and worth the money. Incidentally, I need to type 10 lines of text to complete this review - please do not buy this movie. It is awesome!
