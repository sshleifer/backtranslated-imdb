I can't believe it when I put this movie into a DVD player. I think I laughed well since I played D&D for half the life. I had to close myself when I had a colleague and they wondered what the shit I was watching. <br /> <br /> Done in Later and I should leave it in the beginning of a soft gay porn movie. No, they use a funny fart tone, jokes, incest, racism, KKK ... this movie is smooth. out I mean anyone who has ever played D & D <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, it seems that Real D & D did not allow them to use their games. Who needs their names attached to this thing?
