I have a special "privilege" to participate in the screening of 'The Absence of Light' in a special horror meeting in Ohio. <br /> <br /> First of all, you know that you have a problem when the director introduces the movie. Say: "Don't forget that we don't have much money ..." It's not that movies that don't have a bad budget. But when filmmakers use this as an excuse, the results are always bad. And there are no better examples. <br /> <br /> Actually, 'Absence of Light' is considered the first time in the world of underground cinema: it was the only time I saw a talented actor. In the veterinary industry Enchanting actors such as David Hess, Tony Todd and Reggie Banister randomly enter and leave the movie and prove that it is not as interesting as it doesn't have a name. Who are their characters? What are they talking about? Who cares? It's so boring that you will stop paying attention or anyone else. <br /> <br /> After passing the thirty minute endurance test, I quit and walked out of the theater. It is not surprising that most of the actors join. <br /> <br /> Fans who are curious to want to stay away from this. With a little luck, this film will not see the "light" of the day.
