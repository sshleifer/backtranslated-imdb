Scary Movie 3 is a game that is hard to say. It makes movies like the most wanted garlands like Oscar material, just saying that <br /> <br /> The original horror movie is so much fun. Movies that spoof the better 90s come from the great team with Dont Be Aace to South Central while drinking your juice in Hood But what happened! After the tragedy that is Scary Movie 2, I think changing actors and teams will help with things, but it's even worse. <br /> <br /> Within 20 minutes, I smiled twice. No one laughs. The jokes that are recycled and the originality are not factors. The fact that at this point in writing, most people on this site have voted it. 10/10 makes me feel sick. When there are great flicks like the School of Rock, which has a joke that is * gasped *, funny. Anyone who loses money with rags like this has to be examined. <br /> <br /> No Stars / ****
