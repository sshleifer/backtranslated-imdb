SAPS AT SEA <br /> <br /> Ratio: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio format: Mono <br /> <br /> (Black and white) <br /> <br /> Suffering Suffering from 'hornophobia', Ollie embarks on a boat trip 'resting', but he and Stan have mixed up with escaped prisoners (Rychard Cramer). Chaos happens. <br /> <br /> This long comedy is OK. Compatible But things that are not imitated like Laurel's imitation work and Hardy's best work are just the final cooperation between L&H and the producer Hal Roach. Remember after The Boys were taken hostage by the Cramer villain (who shot the seagull to prove how strong he was!). But lack of inspiration, perhaps because of recruiting director Gordon Douglas, who had been an actor before, responsible for Ollie's first solo career in the sound age (ZENOBIA produced in 1939), but the work here is absent. Pzazz's measures are fair, but nothing special. L&H regularly, Charlie Hall and James Finlayson appear before the guests.
