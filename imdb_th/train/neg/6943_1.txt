This movie is a very stupid story. Men want revenge for crime - but when he legislates revenge - there's a video camera pointing at him all the time. Any man who has a brain cell in his head will sit there and do this in front of the camera for a long time. <br /> <br /> Just the fact that this script can't happen. Destroy it for me - but it's foolishly !!! <br /> <br /> I think the script writer has a serious habit of cooking brain cells and causing them to miss the plot that you can. Drive the armored tank battalion through <br /> <br /> Point: A man tried to avenge the death of a loved one. But in the middle of the plot there is something completely wrong and then the unexpected ones will be revealed. <br /> <br /> If only these people who write this story are not An idiot to write all unrealistic plans that could not have happened this way. For the author, I ask for help from your serious mental problems.
