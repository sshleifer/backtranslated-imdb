I have to sit down on my computer and write a review immediately after watching the clone. Why? Because I have to let everyone know how bad this movie is. It's incredibly bad. Just to let you know how bad it is, I'll give you a little detail about this movie. During the scene of chaos which usually consists of people shooting or kicking zombies, they enter scenes from video games. Yes you heard me right This movie is really bad. In fact, it made me think about the fact that it cost ten dollars today to enter the cinema today. And to see the crap that is full of corn like this? There is no story to talk about, and in general, this film has nothing to do with the shock and cheap killings. I was very disappointed with this because I knew that I watched it. Ok i'm a fool It's terrible that I can't find a word. Rating: Zero from *****
