This is probably the worst movie I've ever had. The connection will be a compliment. Even the ending is unreasonable. But it was a great relief that eventually ended I watched it with great passion for death to see if it was getting worse. At the end of this mess, I apologize to one of the characters who survived and I don't feel like being a charity. Even the round-trip train platform is still confused. Obviously, I have not vented enough to fill my ten defined lines, so with the risk of redundancy I will say again This movie is zero and it will be less if I have a word for a lower ranking. How to remove with zero?
