Cruel Intentions is my first ever favorite movie. It's a complete masterpiece. And how will they create a bad sequel? Sarah Michelle Gellar is perfect in the first movie In this one, Amy Adams sucks. She was scary. And they can't really find the chicks that look like Sarah Michel Gaillard? At least the same hair color !!! I mean, Robin Dunn is not as bad as Adams, but he's terrible when compared to Ryan Phillipe Sebastian in the first film that is more cheating and deceitful than Sebastian during the prequel. And what happened to the story In general, it will be like this ... <br /> <br /> 1- Sebastian has a bad representative in his first school, so the movie says that although it doesn't talk about him and life out. Dating to the girls 2-Sebastian moved to New York and immediately decided that he would turn back. He "fell in love" with Daniel (I would like to remind you that in the original version, Sarah Michelle giller said " Break up with the first person you love because I say - He will love the prequel ???). He is a good and charming person and everyone is a "good man". While he changes sex from his chicks, his father is doing. <br /> <br /> 3- He Complete 180 people and ended up in the end of the movie and then attracted Cherry. <br /> <br /> I mean, it's terrible and I love the very first one. I haven't seen the third person yet. I hope God is better than this prequel
