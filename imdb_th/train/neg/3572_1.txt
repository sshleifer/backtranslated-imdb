The excellent "Z" channel in Los Angeles shows this movie Pia Zadora for about six months or after "Butterfly". I have such high hopes for the actress and then she falls to Not clearly good in this movie. <br /> <br /> Again, it's 80s and I have to tell you that Harold Robbin's work has been obscured. Jacqueline Susan tore him. (She hates women's writing methods) Erwin Shaw's work is trapped by many women, and of course, Sydney Sheldon has his kingdom in the late 1970s, early 70s, and men in every way in the book. yours This is why this work has smelt the work of Harold Robbin in the 80s that did not attract viewers. Pirosadora acted as one of Robbins' work, like throwing kerosene into the fire. The supporting actors didn't help anything. <br /> <br /> Oooooh ... It's terrible to watch that time and 20 years later, it looks worse. I have hope for Pia as an actor, and everything was shot when he was done. It would be difficult for Pia to redeem himself as an actor (although John Waters, who cast her in "Hairspray", was sparkling), even though she had a good cry. <br /> <br /> Hey Pia, no matter where you are. Where .. Hairpray may go on a tour! Join the show You may be the biggest comeback. <br /> <br /> I'm just hoping that they will burn this movie for you if you do.
