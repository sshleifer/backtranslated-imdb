Close, stupid, redundant and incredibly shameful towards "Nightmare on Elm Street" - set! Episode 6 is incompetent until it seems that director Rachel Thaleay intends to change Wesker's first location to be a bad joke. This is not just the worst fairytale program "Elm Street" It is one of the most embarrassing horror movies ever created, and it is offensive to fans of the genre! The story is dumb, the drawings, the ridiculous characters, the dark structure and ?? Most of all Special effects and images that resemble Tom & Jerry cartoons. The sequence in which Freddy Krueger kills his victims is endless and not interesting. Should we become frightened when Freddy babbling, turning Breckin Meyer into a video game character and pogo sticking him around the house wall? The story takes us back to Springwood and it seems that Freddy suddenly has a middle-aged daughter. Do you think he will talk about that in one of his previous adventures but not? There was only one teenage survivor in Springwood and Krueger used him to contact his long-lost daughter. Another reason why this final installment is so terrifying is the completely irrational structure. John Doe-boy was introduced to the lead character. But suddenly he died and the storyline still swirled for two adults! How about this: Freddy Krueger, who spent five films, nothing but killing. In the end, two adults eventually wore three-dimensional glasses that were attacked! The sort of ruins that are the essence? As far as I'm concerned, "Nightmare on Elm Street" is a very scary series. But until now, even the weakest items have at least a redemption element. However, "Freddy's Dead" is not durable and no one should waste his / her precious time watching it.
