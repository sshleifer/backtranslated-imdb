No one noticed whenever they were in the car each time the camera used a new perspective on which they switched the road. Like in the same scene, it is a one-lane residence with a sidewalk next to them on a multi-lane highway with a divider next to the two-lane country road with double yellow lanes. I can understand the low budget. But it was just a sloppy movie. <br /> <br /> I also read other reviews and didn't agree that it was a bad movie. I think if you are a fan of Paul Reiser and his comedy, you might enjoy this movie. However, if you find his work / not funny, then I would suggest staying away from here.
