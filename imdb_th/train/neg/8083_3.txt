This disaster caused damage to the Japanese theater before coming to America and going to the video immediately, which was not seen again until Turner wanted something other than infomercials to fill the 3 and 6 tapes at the bottom of the trash should use the name Smithee when the movie hacking studio is so bad that the director doesn't want his name attached to it anymore. But I'm afraid that Sarafian can't blame all the studios in this one. Most actors are past graduates of "Overacting 101", sending one corn ball from another. The plot is complex. Special effects are not impressive. The laughing part is plain boring. Scripts or books must be good - why would there be a Palance, Matheson, Boyle or Heston agreed to appear in this game? But there is something very wrong from the screen to the screen. Conclusion: Avoid not bad enough to be bad - good - good.
