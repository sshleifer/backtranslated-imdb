Have you ever seen a movie created from a long shot? none? I'm not the same. I finally saw one of my "Spring in Hometown" and I must confess. Now I know why people do not do this. The technique is "arty" to make sure. But certainly not to be ripe for public consumption This technique has a lot of drawbacks, just because the audience doesn't have a sense of attachment to the character and may be the director's intent. I don't know. I can't read my mind. And of course I don't know about the director who will judge. <br /> <br /> But one thing about this movie that is obviously pain is ridiculous. Feelings against America As an American, I am well aware of my participation in my country in the Korean War and I know that we are not always angels. But I will curse if I will take this version of the person that happens as blind people, not only Americans But as the beginning of the war, we are the cause of the war and we almost destroyed the country alone. Whatever the director, Mr. And I think you still make this movie in Communist KOREA if we don't intervene, right? Talk about forgetting your history. This is similar to making the Nazis a "good man" while changing alliances to "bad people". This movie has a historical, innocent and inaccurate story that almost seems embarrassing. For people from countries that owe America's intervention, he is sure to come out highly, courageous and judged.
