I must say that this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen this year! The joke is very rough. (Not expecting to be a PG movie) (ranked PG in Canada) and they aren't funny! At least I expected to have a good performance. But I didn't get it I am a big fan of Rainn Wilson and this is the first time I am very disappointed with his performance. Regardless of the character of Luke Vilnius or Umar, it will be the least favorite and I don't care what happens to both of them. I did not expect this, as in the past that I liked the director's other movies (for example, Six Days, Seven Nights). Will be like I begged the film to end
