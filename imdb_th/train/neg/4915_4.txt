One of the previous examiners wrote that there seems to be no opinion of Love Story; One loves or hates it But it seems that there will be an amazing distribution of opinions from levels 1 to 10. For me, this movie gives 4 points, with some beautiful scenes and places and Ray Millland turns out to be a great job as a father Oliver But this film does not have a special interest in telling the story, and the story does not have a unique character to guarantee viewing many times, at least not for me. I may be an insulting person. But I always avoid movies with Ryan O'Neal - I haven't seen Barry Lyndon - because most But not all were destroyed for me by his presence The only exception is What's Up, Doc? Which his direct acting is the perfect underline for the goofball protagonist of Barbra Streisand - and not accidentally shooting a photo at Love Story for a good temple! McGraw and O'Neal tend to show their roles rather than show them. <br /> <br /> This movie is outstanding in the early stages of a good career: it's Tommy Lee's first movie. Jones
