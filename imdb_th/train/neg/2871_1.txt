I rented this horrible movie Think the worst I have ever seen I believe that grade 1 can do better. The movie is worse than I have ever seen and I have seen bad people. There is nothing scary except I pay 1.50 for rent and that is too much. 1.49 The performance is terrible. The characters are getting worse and this movie is just a piece of garbage. The scene in the house that is slippery is a very low budget that makes B look like an Oscar candidate. All I can say is that if you don't want to lose a good time and little money to rent this horrible flick I would rather watch the killer clown from outside the world while sitting in a razor bucket rather than sitting through this failure again.
