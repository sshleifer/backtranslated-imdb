Hollywood can do it again A lot of money is not creative. I'm sure the writer is in something other than oxygen when they write this. From the preview, I think this will be a funny movie. But if you're not in the latest pop culture, then you'll miss the most stupid humor in this movie. Why waste time You can sit on the record without doing anything and enjoy more than this movie will give <br /> <br />
