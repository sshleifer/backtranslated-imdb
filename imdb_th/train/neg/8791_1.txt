Be warned! <br /> <br /> This is the shit that shit, others won't even be with because it's underneath! Okay, let me say something more important. <br /> <br /> I've seen Ashes of Time a long time ago by thinking that it's a new content based on the highly respected wuxia of the novel because The new reputation of director Wong Kar Wai, although all of the WKW's have not succeeded in adjusting the novel on the screen, according to many fans of wuxia, mostly just pictures of drops of water droplets. Making eye horse, etc. I can not sit and watch most movies <br /> <br /> Fast forward many years later when I need you. The movie of the band was shot again after hearing many admirers, especially from Cannes. I was fascinated by his latest thing in 2046.

But no, he just shows what it is Fay Wong's performance is a good example of Hong Kong style: sandy reading, deer in expressions with wide eyes of the headlights, trying to be cute and be a girl. The rest of the actors didn't get the same attention. <br /> <br /> I think the word Auteur is a beautiful word for the director who tries to do something new and different that must be clap Also mastering the art of film narrative, which is what Wong has been in the last 17 years!
