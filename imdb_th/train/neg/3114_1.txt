Any attempt to compare or show "swill" is anything. "Hitchcockian" is a freaky attempt to convince Hitchcock fans to pay $ 7 in this movie ... weak performances, weak chapters. <br /> <br /> No suspense, no excitement. You wait for the movie's weaknesses to get a great return or even any reward ... You are thinking of what everything is about <br /> <br /> and please enough to move. Make HIP "lifestyle choices" and politically correct !! ... I can't recommend this to anyone ... How am I talking about acting weak? Williams worked better when Peter Pan and "Mork", but that was a more naive moment ...........
