This may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Everything about it is weak and incoherent. The performance is ridiculous, even the costume is crummier and the story doesn't really exist. Sword and adventure film This 'row of poverty' means getting some success at "Beastmaster" and "Conan" are happy, but there is no reason to do it. The lead characters are tedious and boring. He can't even fight with swords and swords from the 16th century. All action scenes are slow and unrealistic, not when talking about castles and scary music. Whatever they rode Don't even be with this shit.
