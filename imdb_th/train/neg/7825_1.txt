I guess this movie is a tribute to Superman's first movie because it looks cruel and painful like the original. <br /> <br /> After the opening scene that consists of a dark space image For the original Superman movie that is looking for their time. <br /> <br /> Then there is something darker than Ma Kent. Seeing some dark clutter on the farm and spending some time in life. My slowly walked up to the ruins in the fields. Then Superman sneaks into her and faints. <br /> <br /> Next, we will contact Lex Luthor in a scene about the gloomy close-up of an old woman in While she died We didn't see Luther's face until the end of the first scene of this film that would not leave a large stone. Lex Luthor is a man who doesn't like Superman because he's not human. In addition, he may not like humans, as sometimes the film has a plot about Lex Luthor who plans to kill most of the world's population. <br /> <br /> After that, no For a long time, Clark Kent appeared again, an old job (I forgot to talk about him going out for five years that nothing had happened). Then he found Lois Lane having an illegitimate child and dating. With Cyclop It made him so frustrated that he lost control of his strong power until the frame was broken unintentionally. <br /> <br /> At this point, we saw that Miss Lane was stuck with some jet. Type of space shuttle It is some important event in its account, namely on television. Then we learned that there were people in the control room following this event. There are also people watching television and having pilots in the cockpit as well. The film reminds us that these people are involved by cutting between them for the summer. <br /> <br /> When events that lead to the inevitable catastrophe begin to build, I ask myself for soda. I accidentally walked back into the wrong theater and watched a movie about Al Gore showing all the slides. I tried to find a way back to Superman Returns, but I walked to Prairie Home Companion, which I watched twice in a row. Then it's time to stop playing. <br /> <br /> I walked back into the first theater, found my seat and looked up to see how the Lois Lane space shuttle disaster was coming. We almost Even so, it seems to take forever, so I walked around the theater, found a married woman and raised a son and sent him to college. While attending my son's medical school, I remembered that I should check in with Superman Returns, so I asked myself and returned to the theater to learn that there was no need to hurry. It still takes about half an hour before things go wrong for the space shuttle. When they do that, Superman saves everyone's life, which is cool. <br /> <br /> Then there is a sub-plan that Superman turns disgusting and begins to trace Lois Lane and her family. Visibility of X-rays and excellent hearing Then he tried to take her to cheat with Cyclops, which seems to be a good person. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Lex Luthor participates in a contest to show ordinary villain behavior. All types before the end of the movie. I forgot to bring the score card home too. (Give them at the door of the house) but I think they scored close to a hundred percent I hope that he will win millions of dollars. <br /> <br /> At this point, everything starts for the last dark scene. I think maybe the projector might crash because the movie seems to be circling for a while here. I remember seeing the bad things that were sprouting out of the water. Superman was sick. Superman became better. Go back to the darkness. He was sick again. No need to wait. He was ok. <br /> < br /> Then Lex Luthor relieved the last bad guy to move: yelling at his girlfriend a little <br /> <br /> Then Superman died and came back to life. I think this movie is over, so I go out. <br /> <br /> Ninety years later, the elderly home I live in is cold. I know I left the sweater in the theater and I went to find it. When I did, I was a little surprised to find that Superman Returns did not end. I tried to ask the audience what I missed. But most of it is just a skeleton with a long gray beard. <br /> <br /> Now I sit down in my old seat and see that Lois Lane putts around her house. For a while, for a while. Then Superman appeared and started the reference to the beginning of the movie and since I saw that part, I thought it was okay to leave <br /> <br / > So that is my opinion of Superman returns. <br /> Oh, if you like jokes about people who eat dogs or jokes about a dog that eats other dogs, you'll love. This movie In the account of there are two such jokes in it.
