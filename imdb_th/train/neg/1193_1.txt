Do you know that sometimes you can watch crappy movies with friends and laugh with all the shortcomings of the movie? This is more than that. I bought a DVD at Tower Records because it was like $ 3.00 and I heard that this is a movie you laugh. There is nothing really pathetic. In the movie for about 30 minutes, my friend started asking me to turn it off. They asked me about 45 minutes. After one hour, we compromised to forward to the end quickly so we could see how the conflict was resolved. (And because we watch all the time for Matt Walsh) seriously. Don't watch this movie It's so painful.
