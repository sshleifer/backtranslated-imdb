I saw my fair share in the unthinkable ending and the last distraction to the movie. But I do not remember any movies that immediately committed suicide as I did before. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers hoped clearly. The great distortion will surprise us all .... and it is like that. But may not be in the manner that the director expects I was surprised that Connery, Harris, Fishburn and Capshaw were involved with this turkey individually or as a group. <br /> <br /> The film is up. Until the last thirty minutes The story is unfolding and the nature of the film as a whole. But when the revelation of the plot of the plot and the inconsistency is revealed, the basic motivation for revenge is not realized, and the various ways Bobby Earl makes it ridiculous The worse thing is that when the twist is revealed, the rest of the film becomes fantastically predictable. <br /> <br /> Harris gives a great performance and Connery. Like Morgan Freeman in a story that he never performed This movie is not a great story! So overall it started well and unfolded, causing the audience to last 30 minutes, one of the most memorable nose dives in the history of the movie.
