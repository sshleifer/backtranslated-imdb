"This movie" is like a music video. Kusturica said in an interview since 2004 that when he made a movie he felt like doing music and when he made music he felt like making a movie. The best thing in "Promise me this" is the song written by Stribor Kusturica. <br /> <br /> Kusturica said in the same interview. "This promise to me" very little "sound. <br /> <br /> I like" Life is a miracle. "It's like music videos in the first 30 minutes and at some point later. But it has a beautiful plot "This promise to me" does not have a plot. I wait for this movie with great expectations because I have read the chapter written by Ranko Bozic - one of my favorite screenwriters who participated in "Life is a miracle "Ranko Bozic wrote a wonderful conversation, but for Kusturica, they were" noise "and with my regret, I saw only two conversations, which I can identify as written by Ranko Bozic. The script is used by the director to make a music video for his song Chaos /> <br /> The Stribor son Gordon Smith <br Hitcher (who wrote the screenplay for. "Black cat, white cat") said in an interview that Kusturica never followed the script. "Black cat, white cat" is the only script that Kusturica said he would not touch it as Gordan Mihic said after Kusturica came back to the script and if he didn't do it, he didn't create a good movie. And I think this is a case of "Promise me this". He should follow the Ranko Bozic script. <br /> <br /> "This contract with me" is called "funny" but there is very little time that makes me. Laugh Funny moments are in the same style as "Black cat, white cat" but it's not funny. I think the difference comes from the fact that "Black cat, white cat" was written by Gordan Mihic. <br /> <br /> However, I know that there are some people who like it. "Promise me this". They find it a very positive movie.
