This movie trailer attracted me enough to guarantee DVD rental. However, the movie came out really scary! It is acknowledged that this is not the worst movie ever created or is the worst movie this year. But it is approaching. <br /> <br /> The main problem is movies that do not know what they want: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen-porn? The story is interesting because it involves the mistakes of the mail order bride. But this movie is not a mess What started out as a "comedy" that was mildly interesting (The words that I use in loose terms) then go back completely in return Nicole Kidman should know better and Ben Chaplin wasted! Like Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, which I can assume that doing this for money. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie in every aspect. It's not a joke. It's sex. Until you can forgive Benny Hill for everything he does and the amazing elements are really nasty. Movies that should be avoided unless you have to see Kidman or Chaplin in all of their films!
