I want to say that I am a Christian. (And I work in the film and television industry) so I understand how working with this long film is about to make a scene with the filmmaker in that story I all have a positive message and elevate the mind if they are true to the nature of life. (This is a world that has fallen into sins and things are not always effective ... even those who follow Christ) I am glad that others have an overwhelmingly positive reaction to the Christian message that is revealed. For me, it's just the execution, which is where the film falls on its face. The movie is alive and dead in its story, and here you have a one-dimensional pattern and many changes that occur in the behavior of the mysterious characters as you say the least. I believe that movies don't have to go to your club over the head with a message to get issues. I'm sure Kendrick bros will improve over time and their storytelling methods will improve as well. Sometimes they may direct other people's movies as their next project. <br /> <br /> * Sports movies are not my first love. But a good movie If you're interested in movies inspired by PG, see Steven Soderbergh's 'King of the Hill'. The whole truth is the truth of God ...
