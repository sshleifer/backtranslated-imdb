This film loses the ability of all actors in what may be called the best "potboiler". <br /> <br /> Despite the launch of the "Top Gun" full of action Length Keep track of each other until you try to choke yourself in your popcorn. <br /> <br /> There are many death stories in this movie. I guess at one point, it was caused by a collision in the TV series Quit <br /> Quinn's Mexican drug role is ridiculous and his colleagues withdraw from the Quinn-Martin police program in the 1970s. Costner's character is a stick and makes us There is no reason to believe that actually He loves his wife Mendez. We do not believe clearly that believing that the wife is painful for being a friend and will jump the first hot body that comes together. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's the best movie 'B' and wasting so much time For everyone involved
