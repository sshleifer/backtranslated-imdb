I should believe my intuition better: without expectations - without disappointment. However, I expect to experience similar masterpieces like Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and feel mercilessly disappointed. Powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion, nothing. But the effort was money in the success of the ancestors' creeds and - art - it failed miserably It seems that some manufacturers have collected the remaining material from Koyaanisqatsi Hurriedly threw it together, putting everything in slow motion and having a pop singer under the pseudonym of Philip Lass, who constantly threw background music on Koyaanisqatsi Entertain the audience with fast, intelligent changes. Powaqqatsi is a continuous world image that has a long, slow motion. (If you watch them on your VCR in quick preview mode, you'll see what I mean.) The most disappointing thing is the soundtrack of Philip Glass. I can't - and still can't believe it. That these things create a buzzing sound in a new era that should be easily composed one afternoon by a 14 year old boy in the Casio calculator from the same songwriter. Compose music, mood and perfectly synchronize for Koyaanisqatsi Summary, waste a lot of time! My advice: Forget trading! See Koyaanisqatsi again instead!
