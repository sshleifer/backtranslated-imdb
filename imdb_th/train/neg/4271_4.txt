The general thriller has been done many times. Simple layout. Police Liotta is obsessed with Russell's wife and he tries to beat Okkurt for him. This is more than unpredictable, even making you guess that the plot is a plot and there is no thinking outside the box here. I guess the only reason to watch it is to see how it develops. But nothing to do with the original or interesting There's nothing to say about this movie. It's not bad. But there are no good issues as well Russell plays as Russell and you know what you can get when he sees him in the movie Ditto Liotta Stowe. The annoying Cher-esque sounds. I watched it and it spread out before my eyes as I imagined. I do not feel mood swings throughout I have no feelings for this movie, as if I had never watched it. When considering this, it's a pointless movie, right? Still I will give 3/10 for some reason.
