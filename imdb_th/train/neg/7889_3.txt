I just finished watching this movie. It's not bad. But I was very disappointed with it I'm not really sure why some people do movies like this. It provides a little entertainment. But I feel like people make it a lot of conflict with what they do. Monday, responsible writer Tuesday Director; People who received coffee on Wednesday Etc. It seems that they want to create a few different movies. But there is time and money to make movies. <br /> <br /> There are others who comment that the show is really good. To disagree Then again, if the actors were able to keep their faces straight during the filming, maybe they would be better actors than I gave them credit. <br /> <br /> The back of the DVD gave the impression that the movie Will be a mystery ... something according to the laws, history and regulations or national treasure It started like that. But after that, it changed to the bad episode of the Twilight Zone or ... things that are not as good as other ... bad episodes of outer boundaries. <br /> <br /> Complaints My main thing about this movie is that it just played out. There are evil men with pointed white hair. There was an interesting love when she first appeared. The wind blew through her hair. Seriously. When you know that it's a Christian movie, the end is easy to see. <br /> <br /> The movie is not good, especially in the opening scene - a way to keep your feet moving forward. It's not bad for most movies. But with the occasional bad shot of the old woman, praying, arms up in a dark room while losing weight is outstanding - the type of thing that just makes you a little embarrassed to watch a movie
