Do not listen to names that are deceiving "Werewolf Woman". Europeans are well known for their emphasis on sex and nudity rather than the actual horror stories in their horror movies. But this movie is quite too much. "Werewolf Woman" seems to have a sex scene that is flowing out with the name of a crazy character and killing her mercilessly. Enjoy the first few times. But this hundred minutes became a tedious matter quickly. She is not a werewolf. But is a chelated chicks that his ancestors were hanged for the year This film cannot judge its tone in the first ten minutes (in the past). It is a supernatural horror story that is legal. (I think I'm in the classic trash after these things) to study the character that is quite poor. To thrill revenge At the end, the director confirms that this story is based on the true story. Right. <br /> <br /> To be fair The woman named Wolf is a looker and has beautiful effects and nude scenes. However, these things become monotonous quickly. In addition, the dubbed dialogue is quite hilarious in fashion camps, especially the most sweeping doctors in the world. (He drank at the event) Unfortunately, the film became a quick annoyance. No real plot or anything else. It's a shame because reading the description, I feel that this movie has real potential. "Werewolf Woman" is too long, slow-moving, and even less pointless by the standard of exploitation (4/10)
