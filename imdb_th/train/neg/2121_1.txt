It's quite straightforward, it seems like a seven-hour boredom as well. What will Smith do that I can no longer tolerate? I think he looks scary and serious about getting an Oscar. I understand what this bias is. But if he doesn't get a new acting lesson, I can't see him win. He is a great name and is often confused with being a talented and versatile actor. He just doesn't. I give him credit for trying hard and being able to cry when wearing a hat. That is about it. <br /> <br /> Seven pounds is an attractive thing for me from the beginning of the 911 that killed myself. Not interested in me in any way. I don't want to know why he called. Self-suicide There is absolutely no surprise. The best thing I can say is Will Smith and Rosario Dawson have chemistry on the screen. In addition, I do not know her name. But the Spanish woman worked very well with her role as a scared and defeated wife. Woody Harrelson had a very limited screen time, but I would say he stole the item whenever he was. <br /> <br / > All of this is just an extraordinary work of the mill. I can't help but asking myself all the way why I care about these people. Never felt sorry for 'Tim / Ben'. Did he kill himself with jellyfish? The only survivor in 8 accidents? Geewiz..did doesn't see that coming ... <br /> <br /> 5/10 is quite generous.
