Miss Powell at the end is a great commentator in every word. She is paired with Red Skelton, who is still very young. They both performed in "I Dood It." Moroni Olsen, who 3 years later, was excellent as a police officer investigated in "Mildred Pierce" reappears. The problem list is that Olsen and his gangsters are really Japanese spies. <br /> <br /> Bert Lahr is a great identity of He normally follows here and he is very supportive of Virginia O'Brien.
