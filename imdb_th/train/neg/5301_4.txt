I bought this movie because this is Shah rukh khans Debut and I like to see what he will do. I have to say that he's great in his role. Divya Bharathi is excellent in this film. Well, the role is not good in his role. Amish and Mohnish also do their job well. Dalip also serves his small role well. The movie director Mediocre is fairly good direction, bad editing, boring story. It tells us about the famous pop singer Ravi. He has a lot of female fans. One of them is Kaajal.Ravi and Kaajal fell in love and married. Ravi was killed by his cousin Kaajal, a widow .. to escape from Ravis cousin. They went to Bombay. She found the king. She fell in love with him and married. Returning to Ravi. The predictable story. The key point is to guess the first half of the dragon. It is still very dragging. Half of the actors and music entertainment, music, catchy songs with some great film shoot looks outdated. He first half But it seems unbelievable, boring music images, except for the song "Sochenge Tumhe Pyar" and the rain song, one set of outdated costumes, how to see only actors and music Rating-4/10
