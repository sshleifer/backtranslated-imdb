This movie is truly fantastic. It passed abound for the crap at such speed. You didn't see the good feelings and the common sense for humanity in the past. But it doesn't stop there! This movie hit the bottom of the tank so hard that it bounced back to the point of humorous jokes: according to Kor the Beergutted Conan Wannabe, along with the neck of my hair that was so much more than necessary Throw it. I'm really surprised there. * It's tomorrow for him, or at least because of his gut.) Don't miss this movie. It's a fantastic story when talking about true stupidity and bloodthirsty! And when you have finished watching this video, wipe the tears of joy (Or tears of frustration from trying to tell an inappropriate story) from your eyes because some fool f00l give these people another 5 dollars to continue!
