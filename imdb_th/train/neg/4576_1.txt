At first glance, this documentary / fiction / comic is quite entertaining and thought provoking. Of course, when there is something thought provoking, it can be checked. The truth is that this film combines metaphysics with satire and unfounded conclusions. The link that "What is treble ..." will make you see between science and spirit, that is, in fact, not conceived. Root in science The transcendental meditation study mentioned in the film claims that meditation by groups can reduce crime in designated areas, Washington DC in this case. In fact, the crime rate of HRA (murder, rape and assault) increased by about 30% in 1993 than the average crime rate between 1988 and 1992. There is no definite reduction in murder rates during the study. In fact, each claim is linked to metaphysics and science, and can be cleared. <br /> <br /> My conclusion from this information is that this film is a bad attempt to cultivate people. I suggest that you do not waste time. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a long film about thought-provoking science, you might consider Mindwalk (1990).
