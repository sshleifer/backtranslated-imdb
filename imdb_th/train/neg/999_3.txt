Last night I saw 'Descent' at Stockholm Film Festival and it was a big disappointment. Disappointment because the story is very powerful, the opportunity to see Rosario Dawson in a small movie is exciting and a fan. (Sounds bad, I can't!) From the 'rape / revenge' flick of the 70s. I don't need to talk much, curious to check out this movie. My conclusion: Let's be classic! Yes, the story has potential. But the conversation was smooth, the actors were not reliable Even Dawson is still empty. Some people say that it is the right image about the world of college in America that the character's emptyness has all the purpose and jazz. But it makes the whole movie look ridiculous Like the scene in which Dawson is raped: It's not serious! I didn't expect a 'irreversible' style, but still we shouldn't feel pity for her or me, not just one minute. She's very lame all the way ;-) and I read that photography is impressive. There is nothing to destroy I have to admit that the screenings at the festival are not good. Maybe I miss something here. But at the end of the movie I can't think of 'I felt like watching the' Inferno 'of Argento again. Haha. More seriously, the first scene in the club was filmed beautifully and all. But I have a bit of a bit of boredom from a long and boring scene in a dirty bar near the American-Canadian border in 'Twin Peaks - Lynch's Fire Walk. General, reckless / degraded ... No, I'm just going into this movie is not very bad.
