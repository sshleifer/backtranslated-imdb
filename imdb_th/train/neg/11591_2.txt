This movie is so bad that it almost feels uncomfortable to watch. At this point, other regions have at least one good thing about this. Episode 1 is suspicious and bloody. Episode 2 is rhythm and entertainment. Episode 3 is interesting, with great effects Visit Episode 4, with great music, great special effects and Freddy Krueger that provides new entertainment. Episode 5 is more boring than everything I've seen before. Alice, a more beautiful blonde from Episode 4, returns with her boyfriend Dan. In part, this will make Elm Street become a daytime soap. The new character looks harsh and even though Alice is sweet, there is a chip on her shoulder. Freddie seems to be completely out of this. He looks tired and doesn't seem scary. One of his mariner looks different and different. In episode 4, they may be funny. Leslie Bohem's story never stops and Stephen Hopkins's direction is so bad that my grandmother looks good! The whole story of this movie is ridiculous and unrealistic. It's also confusing and silly. Avoid part 5 at all costs!
