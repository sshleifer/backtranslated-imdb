The story of an incredible massacre like "The Psychic" over and over again The characters and the plot are completely uninteresting. (Like the work of Fulshi's crazy camera, which is usually a factor in redeeming awards in his film) and without any doubt, it is full of unbearable levels - at the end you Not buzzing with excitement But full of boredom (And, like me, may be an uncontrollable craving to sleep) <br /> <br /> 3/10
