Is a really scary movie Although it is as expected Obviously, the low budget: There is nothing to create an actor. (If you can call what you do, "acting") that usually has a role with nudity in the shower scene, men in the reptile set are almost replicas, hunt wild, etc., but there are some points exchanged. Although the story is not new, most have some parts that do not regurgitate. For one, black people do not die when he is attacked (first) and he is not one of the first couple to die. But that is a little matter More importantly, it is very interesting about Kat and Wes & Steve's experiments that I don't see coming. When Steve told Kat, he knew what she was doing, I believed what he said and what Kat responded. But when the creature reveals who he is, I am amazed at the novelty of revelation. Maybe because of my lack of experience with the genre or that it is truly smart. <br /> <br /> In any way, this movie is quite bad and doesn't look if there's anything better ... outside Lose that you are in the mood for a cheap scifi flick
