See a team of Iraqi bombing experts count down the time before they return home. <br /> <br /> It sounds boring. Every time a small subtitle comes up to tell us how long they have gone, it makes the movie no plot to drag. Hurry to find the time to complete, so we can go home. <br /> <br /> I have to think about something. I am a big fan of war movies if they do well. This is a "Jahead" movie that is sometimes shot beautifully. But the movie didn't stop it from being dull and totally pointless. <br /> <br /> and getting a slow bullet "The bullet came out of the gun." Shot. They can save money and just get a stock photo from another movie that has a gun. <br /> <br /> I don't have any important sympathy for that. I have always hoped that his carelessness will cause him to die. In fact, this film will work much better if he has. <br /> <br /> I read the criticism and seemed to feel that the person who was. In the army did not like I just love it all I have never been in the forces and I am with them. It floated to pretend 3 stars for shooting movies.
