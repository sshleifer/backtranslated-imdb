I rented this movie yesterday, mainly due to the art that looks good and the conclusion on the back of the jacket. After popping into my DVD player, I checked the jacket cover again and though I took The cover is out of plastic view. I still can't read any production details about this film. This movie is called Evil on the Jacket and must find it by going to the Faith Films website to find any links here in IMDb. <br /> <br /> The filming and special effects made in the movie Looks quite good ... Then the actors reading the script Oh, dear ... The reading of this actor sounds like a high school jock that faces a pimple with just a volume change and never tried it. In addition to reading the script from Concept At first I thought I had received a bad disc from the audio sync and had to think that it was a foreign movie because I couldn't read the jacket ... English conversation dubbed. If they want to select the right person for the dialogue, this movie may be appropriate. I gave the opportunity for about 20 minutes before rebounding when I discovered a bad line reader would not be killed. But as a fixed core device Yes, it's terrible! The jacket and art cover made in this movie is great, so give one star, but there are 1,999,999 stars for rotten conversations. I do not recommend this one!
