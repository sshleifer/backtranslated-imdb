Before the release of Night of the Living Dead, determine the genre of George Romero. Zombies are creatures that behave well. Of course, they have better manners on the table in the past. But social etiquette, apart from the exciting first-generation zombies offered to the public who are screening movies? Judging by this film, there is no matter what. <br /> <br /> A story about traveling to Cambodia, which aims to find and destroy the secrets of being a zombie. One of the parties discovered his secret and began to create his army of zombies. <br /> <br /> This movie is a love triangle with zombies. But when I saw that this was a 30-year-old movie, the zombie said was like a mummy, rather than a variety of meat eating as we think today. It seems that they are more responsive to mind control than an insatiable desire. And quite frankly, 'protests' are quite overwhelming as well The whole thing is really boring. In addition to the lack of fear, there is still no theory of true melodies that will make us enjoy. It seems unlikely that this thing can be very entertaining even 70 years ago. See if you have to see everything with 'zombie' in the name, but otherwise I would suggest skipping this thing.
