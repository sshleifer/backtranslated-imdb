This is a high quality cheese fare of Kung Fu movie flicks. Bruce "wannabe" Lee played by Bruce Li ... I think of course we will show Bruce's clip quickly and make his eyes close up. And if you speak, do the right angle at a certain time of the day during the winter solstice You will laugh with fear that the film is not very good. But some deleted scenes from Enter the Dragon were thrown into the mix Bruce Lee was darted at the target while being hung by a helicopter. Of course, they think this is an excuse that Bruce Lee is trying to be Bruce, although his character should be Bruce's younger brother. Watch Bruce go one by one with a cowardly lion. The props department stopped by Kay-Bee. Did you see? Bruce also found that there was nothing wrong with the brutal man's bashing. At the end, the director decided that "Release the flashback" for the scene that just appeared 3 minutes ago !! They have to think that there is only one living thing that has the disorder of interest that can fully understand this movie. <br /> <br />
