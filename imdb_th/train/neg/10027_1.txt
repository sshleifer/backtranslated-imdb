The action in this movie makes Sunny bhai in Gadar Akshay Kumar possess the power of Leonidus in 300, Neo in Matrix along with Spiderman and Superman. It is hilarious except for comedy Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor. In general, I can't see anything positive in This movie The story seems like the author told the 10-year-old son how to write this film. It is not true that Anil Kapoors took a remote shot with a shotgun, considered the least mistake. Except for the director Tashan to do this movie. There is no other Tashan. I'm sorry to lose money with this movie and I won't recommend anyone to know 1/10. It is the least that I can give to IMDb or I will be zero.
