This film is about a very sexy Olympic athlete star who has been hired to coach a high school basketball team, similar to Goldie Hawn's WILDCATS. It is a celebrity Cathy Lee Crosby in the title role and she does the same thing as Permission script. I think Racquel Welch is probably a better option. But when considering the film's clear budget for movies, they may not be able to pay for her. Cathy Lee looks very good in every shot. But we never saw her naked The story is a predictable thing that will say little by no surprise. Michael Biehn, a minor and lucky, has a role as a male leader. He is a star in the team and is loved by Cathy Lee. Keenan Wynn has a few amusing scenes, while the rich old man who performs sports and doesn't think women should be sports coaches. This issue has been brought up throughout the film and it is not necessary to say that it is a strange day that Cathy Lee did not give her team through her unorthodox training. She did nothing. The male coach refused to do it. There is a funny subplot that deals with high and bright players who are hypnotized in order to pass their classes and play like a professional basketball player. Sydney Wicks seems everyone has a good time to create. This movie But the only real reason to see it is for Cathy Lee Crosby. She's not a great actor. But she has an impressive smile, beautiful hair and a tan body
