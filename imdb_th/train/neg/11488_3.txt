It's hard to imagine that anyone can find a short answer they like if they see most shorts. But I know that humor is very personal. I have seen the shorts, all of them (By their best IMO) and I found one of their weak attempts <br /> <br /> This year was created (1930) Stan and Babe made 15 shorts and one In features They are very popular and their boss Hal Roach takes advantage of continuous work. In addition, this is the time of experimentation for writers and Stan. I would say that this is a really ineffective experiment, as others say it doesn't play for their strengths. Too many conversations and plot <br /> <br /> The best part for me is the order that has not been resolved, mostly with Stan as Agnes, the maid and Telma Todd. The great thing about "girl" things The short time I thought of them Can be forgiven for changing short shorts They do something like 108 movies at the same time, very few (except those who do at FOX) have immediate failures. But there is something County Hospital, Me and My Friends, Live Ghost, Service Provider, Top of the Mind, Become Weak But otherwise I found some wonderful things in almost all of their shorts Quite a record in my book. <br /> <br /> If you have seen and enjoyed their other shorts, all by looking here. But I am happy to bet that this is less memorable than Stan and innocent.
