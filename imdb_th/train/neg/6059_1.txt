I must say that it is a fan of the person who created the Halloween / The Fog / The Thing - probably his best movie. <br /> <br /> Then you got this POS. As a result, he has used any effort in this regard, just as he did with the cigarette. At least his son made a good soundtrack. <br /> <br /> You have to watch this from a different perspective. It looks as if someone else directed it for one thing. I do not believe that Carpenter will use any effort. <br /> <br /> I'm just listening to the old school H2 / H3 / The Fog soundtrack and it's great.> <br /> He uses a style that no one has and works well with his movies.
