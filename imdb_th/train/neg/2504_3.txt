Is there a law during the weekend? Then this is a movie that will accelerate their journey without being able to induce a state that cannot be moved to welcome the constant nagging. <br /> <br /> This film is set up. On a luxury cruise ship Car ferry superannuated; The story has more holes than the average colander and the pieces that are dug from the depths of the list of celebrities. Interesting entertainment added is "Spot the Villain" while passengers join the boat. You won't be wrong !!!! With a script that sank faster than a brick, causing clichÃ©d to double the pieces and raspberry jam when the blood of this film tries to encircle the genre of thriller, action movie and gore-phase > <br /> Must watch movies if only But laughing how bad it is
