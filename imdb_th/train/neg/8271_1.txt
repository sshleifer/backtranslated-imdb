"Handsome guy with short haircut !!" "Beautiful girl without any trace !!" "Stupid gangsters who can't shoot straight !!" from the Dragon Dynasty comes to the Hong Kong Gangster drama "Dragon Heat" for reasons that may be obscured. Forever forever production and casting for the film 'On-line criminals' made both Maggie Q and Michael Biehn signed as villains. But they didn't do much in this horrible festival. <br /> <br /> They are two of the best contemporary actors, each with a personal history and success program, and Biehn in Only have the courage to take a role that is quite challenging and not a hero. <br /> <br /> Maggie Q is the worst "Chiang Mai" in "Live Free Or Die Hard", so 'nuff said. Of course, Biehn is famous. As a future soldier who created "T he Terminator "in 1984 which is a credible fantasy science fiction / fantasy by clashing with Big Arnold, who is now California Governor !! <br /> <br /> Michael Biehn almost wasted The destruction of the police drama train There is no reason for that because the plot is incredibly complex - mostly in Chinese, because it is the story of Hong Kong - should have better details for non-Chinese audiences with foreign speakers. br /> <br In other words, if Biehn is used as an observer or coordinator of international police or agents under deep cover, who wants to be comforted by him Every five or ten minutes is great. But he did not become part of a group of bad people, a special force that seemed to liberate his own corruption agreement among others who dealt with the corrupt terms of the local king. <br /> < br /> Yeah, I said it all, confused? I also. "Welcome to a friend's party." <br /> <br /> In Hong Kong's truly great crime drama known as English, "Breaking News" also has a number of interesting characters. A lot at work, but there is only a story in the story. <br /> <br /> The bad guys and the police are good. In this violent and brutal raid in the world of gangs Hongad Triad or the gang, it seems that the police force of the Hot Shot is more than a parade of ducks in the gallery, photographing how criminals cut them off. > <br /> So it's not surprising that there are scenes that cannot be understood otherwise. (Many real scenes) where children try to shoot a duck in an arcade game to receive an animal doll award. Therefore, the famous police officer who intervenes to intervene to allow the arcade owner to surrender the doll. Kewpie <br /> <br /> There is also a half-hearted effort to create "love" interest "between one. in 'Police visited' and the police visited only one woman. <br /> <br /> The visiting police should be an important witness to the three gangsters who had been taken on the way. Appearance in court But not by his team But by mercenaries (Biehn, Maggie Q, and others). What do these killers want? But we didn't learn what it was until the end of the movie !! That is a stupid mistake in the story as a whole. <br /> <br /> You can't create suspicion in a crime drama without receiving anything or getting or escaping from being introduced at the beginning of the story. > <br /> Add some "cut-out scenes" that are made for pure art effects, showing that the bad and the past of normal bad guys and all films can be easily understood why.
