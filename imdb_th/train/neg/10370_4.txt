I regret every second that I lost while watching this movie. Unfortunately, I often find it difficult to close movies when I start watching. Especially when it's classic or what people use to call classic I think this is one of the movies that every movie lover should watch at least once. That's why I watch it. Don't understand me wrong. I like Humphrey Bogart and his wife, Lauren Bacal, both as actors. But this movie is a big scam in my opinion. There is no really good plot, either flick, espionage or romantic love stories. Not even the convincing ingredients of both types. The only thing that causes tension is that it is not certain that 'Bogey' and Bacall will be together at the end or in part. Which has improved greatly in the 1940s
