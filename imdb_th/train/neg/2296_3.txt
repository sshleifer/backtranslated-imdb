"Back of Beyond" takes place at the Australian desert restaurant / gas station run by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio), a shy man who finds himself in a difficult situation when some visitors are unexpected. At first we understand that things that seem confusing backwards to him and his sister (Although their relationship with others will be understood later in the film) is accelerating through the desert on his motorcycle. After that, he appeared as a sober person and sometimes as a character with a mood swings in front of visitors. <br /> <br /> We know that there is one thing that is certain and that is the spiritual feeling of Mar McGregor, for example - his little clairvoyance associated with a large number of stories involving three diamond bandits that the car crashed and those who rely on Tom to help them out of the spot without Must go in their way Of course, Tom fell in love with a robber, a young woman named Charlie, and suddenly all three believed that they were allies. But not in a manner that results in mystery or action In fact, the whole movie seems to want to create something that is important. But failed to do so Even the ending that plays out like the story of the camp fire (And the story that reveals many flaws) is almost ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It may be worth trying if you don't. The heart walked slowly, terribly slow. But in the mood, at least for something slightly different than usual
