I sat down to watch a documentary about Puerto Rico and ended up watching a documentary about Nu Yurcan. When I go to Puerto Rico, I do not see 50% living in poverty. When I saw people struggling, they were often Haitian, Dominican or Cuban who had just arrived in the island recently. There is nothing to say in words ... whether you speak Spanish or you. Do not ... Pedro Albizo Campos is not MLK. For me, MLK is a good person. Campos is a wonderful person for those who want independence which equals 1%. The rest he is loco is Osama Bin Laden Puertoricans who want. Ego The pool is a fool. If you want to prove the dream of Puerto Rico that is free, everyone sees Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Bahamas, South America and Central America and Mexico. It works wonders for them. This documentary is not about Puerto Rico. This documentary about Nui Yorikan and their struggles Puerto Rico ... not Africa. Denzel will make you soon. <br /> <br /> In summary ... for white people who do not know that we want green cards to come to the United States and want to learn. Method The Prime Minister made things This is not a good documentary about the Puertorican culture. Tell your children to be interested in geography and history. <br /> <br /> *** Update *** <br /> <br /> Bocabonita .. "doc" is the story of the Nuyoricans. She moves it as if all of us feel Probably named ... "yo soy nuyorican ... lunche ... can't speak Spanish" Please stop using Puerto Rico, Ricardo Borica or anything else related to public relations with the New York History lesson. This rickshaw God forbid them to play on this island.
