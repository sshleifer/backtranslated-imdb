When THE MAGIC OF LASSIE opened at Radio City Music Hall, I was stupid enough to believe that it would be as warm as in the first Lassie movie. <br /> <br /> The story is horrible. Sherman's brother's songs are lower. Their normal level, the characters didn't get the attention, and JAMES STEWART and MICKEY ROONEY all saw a better day. <br /> <br >> Then I was interested in seeing how the participation of ALICE FAYE was. Because she didn't stay on the screen for many years and played the role With her at Fox always come first. Alice, too, was degraded by stupid scripts and uninterrupted photography. Another disappointment. <br /> <br /> There's nothing traditional here. There's nothing interesting for adults to enjoy at a distance - and clearly, there's no magic for everyone. You can skip this thing without missing anything.
