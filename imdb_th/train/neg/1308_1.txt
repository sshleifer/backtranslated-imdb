What makes me about this movie (That is something about this movie that makes me physically sick) is actually paid to do. There is no definite purpose for the existence of this film. It's not scary. It doesn't think it's provocative. It's not fun. It's not good. It's a sleeping pill made from cyanide. DVD cases compare with Blair Witch, Evil Dead and a few good movies, making the filmmakers hopelessly obvious. It's not like any other movie ever created. It's far worse Claim "The shocking ending that you will never forget" is equivalent to one ton of horse droppings. Please do not waste time watching this trash because it may make you sterile. The person who wrote this movie should be removed from the Writer's Guild's list of members and never be allowed to shoot anything again. Because if he thinks this is a movie that is worth doing, he may not have much to offer in the future. The star center may be Grod. There is compassion for the souls of all those unlucky enough to see this I'm going to vomit.
