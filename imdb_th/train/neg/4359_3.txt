Wow after trashing the disk of the Timo Roses "Rout City" after about 15 minutes (South Park is more than a meaningless curse ... I guess some people don't get) I'm interested in this movie. I read positive things and the packaging and appearance of the movie seemed far from all the garbage I expected after "Rout city" <br /> <br /> Surprise: The movie is not all garbage. But it seems that the problem will occur That way, Timo Rose tried to follow in the footsteps of the German Horror / Splatter Cinema, Olaf Ittenbach, and like that means "barricades" in the blood-filled and detailed parts. Gore FX is unbelievable. But ok, the show is ok But in some cases, very bad The first chicks in the first order were ridiculous and not getting better until she was fired. <br /> <br /> So what is the problem ... This movie is full of blood with a typical German flavor, booby in the blood), OK FX and modern feeling with it like the promised package! <br /> <br /> 1. The script is all BS. You get a typical country house / lost in the woods with people + camps and meet a disadvantaged country house. Everything is just leading to the torture / torture scene and seems incredibly random and pointless. This is the first thing that makes "Barricade" Hart heart. <br /> <br /> 2 The randomness is also a perfect explanation for many camera functions. (I like cutting repeatedly with tweezers in a protracted torture scene ... both they don't have the material or the editors working in the hardware store) are worse than editing ... Of course, it's more modern and better than other movies. More in this category But it is random You are affected by too much general exposure everywhere and without meaning ... It is there ... All the time, then there are noisy grain films that have just been brought here and there. I don't understand the meaning. <br /> <br /> 3 Like the effects mentioned, there are many repetitions here. For example, most killings are solved with multiple repetitions of stabbing and punching. Once agreed But here it is annoying and fake, especially at the end Also annoying "music" attributes that are permanently used without any changes in the background. It won't take long until this movie gets difficult. <br /> <br /> 4 From all this is the biggest problem. Of this movie (and many more in my opinion). If you create a film that splashes with worthless feelings, it is an amazing story to scrub it with a special FX and fix it. New study It seems that they are too serious. It's not fun, because FX is good enough to lose in this context. And where the FX FX Classic agrees. FX computers in the scene, such as stabbing in the mouth or the gun in the ending, look rather stupid (and most 3D water splash sucks me even in movies with budget and great 3D artists). <br /> I always wondered when the serious water splash movie ended and "Barricade" was another example that might be the time to put it in the grave. It's not fun, there are no characters and too worthless for its face. The script is to try using "Wrong Turn" and "TCM" at an affordable price. You can get that ... The ending is there and randomly as much as you can ("I love you" in the flick of a flick ... Come !!) "Barricade" tries to combine things. Together and fail ... You can go through quickly through this film for extensive disassembly, melting of acid faces, squeezing nipples and classics on Friday. 13 cheers boobies!) But it It is difficult to pass this matter.Including failure, especially because you can see it may be something
