I found this movie in the 'Horror' section of my video store. It seems reasonable, because most zombies have places in it. From Romero's Trilogy to '28 days later ', you can see what this movie really is. <br /> <br /> Actually it's a music video that gets faster and gets better. More and more blood, no horror people here. There are half-way action scenes that are appropriate and boring because in the end ... and finally ... and finally ... and finally ... and soon you will get the feeling. Maybe you are a DVD player. By no means accidentally skipping 3 minutes, but not this is the way they really create movies It's a shame. I think anyone can take advantage of the movie industry better than 7 million dollars than making this raw money. Although some 360 ​​effects are cool But it has been used repeatedly and boring because it is the same stunt over and over again, each time just having a different character. <br /> <br /> ROYALLY annoying is the boundary On images from arcade games I played the game and it was terrible. Why did they put it here? Oh yes, this is not a movie. But a music video and a terrible story 3/10 <br /> <br /> get score R: have violence / gore and very insulting
