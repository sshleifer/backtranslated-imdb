This movie is not scary. But it is not very good I am a big fan of Toni Collette. I think she is a very beautiful and talented actor. This film started with writer Robin Williams and received a book from a 14-year-old boy. This book is excellent and he doesn't believe there is a child writing. Tony Collet plays the child guardian, who you don't know if this child really is, or she's doing it all. I will not destroy the movie. But I will say that this movie is not terrible. <br /> <br /> The performance is quite good and Toni Collette's performance is great, just like Robin Williams. <br /> <br /> This movie is a story. Very disappointing in my opinion, I'll wait for it to come to the DVD.
