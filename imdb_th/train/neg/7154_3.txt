This film has all the earmarks of the chef too, causing the stew to lose. From the autobiography of Shielah Graham, it seems that the power that cannot be separated from one person is good enough. They cannot decide whether or not it is the story of Graham or Fitzgerald, and they should trample anyone's story. Therefore, movies that may be about two interesting personalities (Fitzgerald) and famous (Miss Graham) became a boring and boring television drama about telling us about both There is no time to feel in addition to 1959. The clumsy scene follows the clumsy scene and we have no idea where we are in the story or how long the time has passed. To me - Kerr never looked so cute and Peck was a very handsome person. They create truly beautiful and mature couples, and I just want them to have better content to work with. There is one scene that can be used - Scott chases Chiela while in a drunken state, and when seeing the two stars that are distorted together around, it's very annoying. In addition, this movie is a wasted opportunity and succeeds anywhere near the classic heights of other Wald models produced in 1950 (PEYTON PLACE, most of all).
