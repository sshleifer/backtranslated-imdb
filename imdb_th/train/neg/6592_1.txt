Brief summary: This movie makes everyone touch. That means you <br /> <br /> First of all let me say I'm not a mess, and this may be a joke for a few minutes. Imitation is not bad But overall, it was boring and almost bleak. A few jokes are repeated over and over again. <br /> <br /> It's clear that this movie exists only to squeeze the last few dollars out of Laurel and Hardy, which is now trademarked. Producers cannot consider their place in film history or their talents. This is what makes me the most offended. <br /> <br /> Of course, my daughter likes it so I fail as a parent;)
