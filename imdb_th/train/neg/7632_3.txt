Many people see this as a classic. But of course I had to miss something. Life in Anarene, Texas in the early 50s was very boring - which means that movies about life in Anarene, Texas in the early 50s would be boring too! What do many people see here? When the final image of the show in Anarene is closed, nothing will happen again in the city. Duane (Jeff Bridges) makes that point at the end of the movie. But before it closes, there is not much to do, so basically everything revolves around sex. High school students plan for how to lose virginity - sometimes together, and sometimes with equally boring adults in the city. Do you see that there is something for them to do, except that they have sex? (Sometimes together and sometimes with teenagers who are bored) or complaining about the local high school football team There were three things that I thought would add a spark of drama to the movie. Sam (Ben Johnson) died suddenly. But nothing happened because of that. Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Jacy (Cybill Shepherd) elope but nothing happened because of that. Joe Bob (Barc Doyle) kidnaps a little girl. But nothing Actually happened because of that The only thing that adds a lot of value to the movie ends with Billy's death. (Sambotsom), which points out the emptiness of life in this pathetic small town. <br /> <br /> Peter Bogdanovich filmed in black and white, which I intend to point out that this city is gray. But the only thing I was interested in was the first thing I was interested in was Bottoms, Shepherd, Bridges and Randy Quaid. Classic Lampoon Vacation Movie) Classic? I do not think so! 3/10
