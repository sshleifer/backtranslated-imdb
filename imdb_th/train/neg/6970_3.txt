Now, it's a clich√© if I start with a little title, so I'll wait for that. First of all, this movie makes me wonder why children do stupid things like walking around in the lab and breaking bottles. Then I realized that this is a movie with a message that defeats the children and things like this will not happen. Things like asking things such as giant monsters, insects growing up and causing physical harm before dying in "Kill an indirect monster" as typical The image on the cover has a giant bug / crab / idiot / something in front, chasing some nurses screaming. That is what happened But I want a monkey! Most happy, just a few nights before (Screwed half on the trash in your mind and Creame's brandy tank) I was in the mood of monkeys for more than 80 styles. If you like snow monkeys or blue movies, this movie isn't right for you. If you like bugs and good reasons to hit children, rent this thing.
