I tried to watch this program many times. But for the item called "That shows that the 70s" I didn't find anything different from the short hairstyle and had occasional references to the disco that I grew up from when I saw the plot and most of the jokes. Can be set at any time Get rid of the novelty of being set in the 70s and the list is not interesting and funny. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a successful program rather than showing the experience of youth in America in the 70s. Seeing my humble opinion, you can't do better than "The Wonder Years"
