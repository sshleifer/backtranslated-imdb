warning! This review will reveal the ending of the movie "Scoop". If you don't want to know how the movie ends, don't read this review. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" Very bad. You think "Annie Hall" is. The coincidence <br /> <br /> Get a star because you will see Hugh Jackman's bare breasts. That's the only thing that "Scoop" happens. <br /> <br /> Hate the woody woman. Allen and his fascination with women who are young enough at this point In order to become his niece, he makes a disability in making a movie that he might have. At what point, <br /> <br /> The storyline seems to have hope: Ian McShane, the superintendent of the Scarlett Johansson. To check whether Hugh Jackman is the Lord of England or not Killer of prostitutes Wood Allen, the magician, helps the girl <br /> <br /> promised the story. However, this movie lacks charm or humor or the atmosphere is perfect. It's an indefatigable and useless effort for those who have created one movie before. Perhaps Allen may have a stroke that has not been reported in the media. <br /> <br /> Most of them are made from the fact that unlike in his previous films, Woody Allen is now. As a previous therapist, accepting young women <br /> <br /> Otherwise, in reality, the plot was created in a way that young women would not get <br /> <br /> The first scene where Johansson without reason is the center of the movie drunk And being seduced by the powerful and aged director "Seduced" is the euphemism for what happened. It was "Slam Bam. I have to go" for a moment. It has no relation to any plot. And makes Johansson cheaper in the eyes of the audience Why did Allen add unnecessary scenes to the movie? Because it shows the powerful director-like Allen - having sex with the female lead Allen received his cake and ate it too. <br /> <br /> Johansson is not an actor. She doesn't know how to order the screen, except wearing a low-level shirt. She imitated Allen in two scenes and it looked strange and sad. <br /> <br /> It didn't help her character being scripted as a doll that couldn't work without ghosts or seniors. And less than the inspiring magician telling her what to do in every turn. <br /> <br /> Jackman is about half the age and she finds an unsightly screen.> <br /> The audience members who are not obsessed with the breasts should be better than the heroine, and Jackman deserves better things as well - the script that gives the heroine's intelligence and ingenuity. Show that can be taken <br /> <br> Hugh Jackman also cheated on the script. Clearly, Allen couldn't stand that Jackman was good and still young, and he didn't tell or do anything with Jackman, just like Johansson. He used it for beauty only. This is a shame because, as Jackman has performed in a number of productions since "Oklahoma" to "X Men", he can show. <br /> <br /> This is a great plan - Jackman, suave, charming British lord is a real killer So even though the movie says that it is about giving people other than Allen to get women. But she didn't get anyone Jackman, the man she loves, is a man who kills a prostitute. Nice Woody is a great way to punish your heroine beyond your abilities. <br /> <br /> Allen must lose the heroine. In his own appearance as well, killing his character, magician Being alone at the end of the movie <br /> <br /> Final observation: In my show, not the only audience member who laughed at every point in the movie. The signal is not always good when advertising a movie as a joke.
