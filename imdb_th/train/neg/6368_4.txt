This was the last time I rented a video without checking in at the IMDB review. The Limey was directed by Steven Soderbergh, the author of a terrifying Nightwatch with Ewan Macgregor and directing trash like Out of Sight with talented Jennifer Lopez Terence Stamp. Is a good actor and it's a shame that he relates himself to a bad movie There are frequent confusing amendments which seem to be a last minute decision to compensate for the lack or storytelling, filming and common sense alone. This movie did everything wrong. What are they thinking
