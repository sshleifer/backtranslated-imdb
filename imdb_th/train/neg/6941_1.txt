This film is not only But only boring But it's not doing well as well The graphics are terrible. They don't have a second rate - scary. The characters don't show any facial expressions. The sound is empty and there is no spirit and the plot is broken ... well ... everything, everything is 5 years old. I like it - but I think it's a bit boring. I agree with him
