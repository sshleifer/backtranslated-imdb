While it was funny, strange, humorous, often dry with the members of the panel, often pulling the face or turning to rough language and waiting for the crowd to clap, funny enough. I don't think this is the best thing that has ever been done. It is dry and really satirical. Sarcasm is the lowest form of intelligence. There are very few smart jokes that will make you laugh out loud. will be Was persuaded by comedians, better known names by judging the quality of jokes that are not good Overall, it is quite mediocre with good laughter to have. But often it may be quite mediocre. It's not as good as Jasper Carrot or Dave Allens. I find Benny Hill more fun.
