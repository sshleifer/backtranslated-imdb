I'm a big fan of Artty. But I have to regret that the film must be overwhelmed. Very slow in developing a plot that is not based on an experienced contract. We will say try. Even after a bad movie, I felt that I had learned something or was happy. But nothing to admire The location is not amazing. But the movie starts and ends there The performance is ok, even though the characters are the most boring. In order for the protagonist to focus on such a brave goal, she is extremely empty. Pity I often enjoy movies that are not formatted. But the lack of formulas should not be confused with zero content
