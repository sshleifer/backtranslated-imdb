Actually, the setting in Paris is great. Good performer The story is playing Dharma Twist. Should say that if you want someone who is not good enough, it is okay to hurt others all the way? In true love, you need less ancient ideas than men who are tired of their wives and are willing to leave their families and women who agree to encourage him to do this And if they look good and if Karen Allen shows her out? The characters still absorb themselves and become vile. Perhaps the moral of the story is "You get what you deserve" I give 4 for a quick scan with potential through a bit.
