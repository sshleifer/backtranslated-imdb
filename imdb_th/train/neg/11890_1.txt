Since the first time I saw the cover of the movie box and the shooting of the stretch, I think this guy, the friend of 'Scwarz', must have 6 feet or 6 feet 2 inches. <br /> <br /> No 5 feet high, not like that. It's his fault. <br /> <br /> Whatever the level, I opened the movie one night in Tucson, cool on the second deck with a good cigar and let it roll. At that time, my wife had relationships and things were going down to him for me, so I wanted a good diversion, but the bad thing was this movie ... I totally enjoyed it with a Merlot bottle. br /> <br /> I've watched this movie many times. It always makes me feel good !! Not that it's 'trying too hard' to be cool or 'it's very close' that will mark the action movie .... It's exciting, truly clueless. It's the best thing in a low-speed chase scene. Wow !! I never felt safe in my life. Warm and happy too I am thankful that they conserve gasoline during the chase because there is less production in the summer ... anywho <br /> <br /> The direction is 'not getting attention', actions and fighting scenes that need to be Or posture design Redesigned and tightened, the sound that is exported does not affect you. But it still continues, the 'villagers' of that village where they live in the city are quite 'closed to the queue'. They don't seem to follow what is happening, they look and even look at it. Into the camera lens Just like a deer in a fire, things are just some people with a smile, a smile. <br /> <br /> I feel bad because of 'Columbu'. I bet that there is a good heart and mind that cares for people in America. <br /> <br /> However, "Baretta Island" is dull and unbelievable. Even though I like it a lot, my x wife now hates it. But I love it! <br /> <br /> The funny thing is, I'm quite discriminating when it comes to movies I like or even 'love'. In conclusion, I like Franco. Therefore, <br /> <br /> as a movie added to the annex, if you like killing a couple of hours with real fun to watch straight to a video B movie or a bad movie for the collection Steep your small library. If you can find, try watching 'The Big Sweat' (1991) and Robert Z 'Dar .. You know the big boys from' TANGO & CASH '' The Big Sweat '. The plot of the real story and the show is bad. It may be 'top Word 'and at the end of' The Big Sweat 'I think they have no money. Because they have an actor's image and just put it in the fire and let it burn in the credit - good fun. <br /> <br /> But not all is as good as Baretta Island 'I rated' 1 'and the overall score of the movie' scary 'for the movie B is great. I'm waiting for the sequel, maybe like 'Revenge of the Baretta against Montazuma' (France takes the Mexican vacation and is sick on the water, then declares war on water companies) or 'Baretta's Star Wars' in which he will bet. Is a big drug maker in his country and a gene that is chemically intertwined and creates a super hybrid bug (insect) that will breed and dump into the cocaine field and eat coke, and when passing it will cause a chemical reaction Changing Coke and pure powdered sugar After that, the next part, he would have to help young people get help from excessive sugar addiction, etc. He was able to provide a large toothpaste production company to support and provide some funding to the project by carefully placing the product. In the right feature? (*)
