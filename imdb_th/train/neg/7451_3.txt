Sorry. <br /> <br /> It's interesting. But it disappeared in a few minutes in the movie. <br /> <br /> It didn't help a lot (Quaid, Glover, Ermey, Leto, etc.) for a very good performance. <br /> <br /> May Because of the fact that I saw the dub version (German), but the character of Dennis Quaid is particularly annoying and woody, and Danny Glover doesn't do it for a really reliable villain. Moreover, Jared Leto's character does not have any help in the story (except for saving one main character). But the scene is as necessary as the wipers in the submarine at first ;-) <br /> </ br /> Speaking of unnecessary scenes - the main complaint is a messy and messy story: Detective (of course! ) Must handle personal matters with the villain and (of course!) Being suspended from his official duties His personal turmoil, the killer (of course!) * Want * to be tracked and played with his opponent's cat and mouse game for many years ... I don't know how many movies are created in the same plan - part However, <br /> <br /> The plot has a lot of holes and many unbelievable and unnecessary scenes that do not help or work well with the story. (Such as a truck stop scene or a car at the edge of a cliff, etc.).) <br /> <br /> To close the top, ending trying to be original and exciting. But failed completely in regards to We saw a much better ending with the fight on the train in the winter for the winter landscape ... finally there was a gathering of parents and children ... hokey at least
