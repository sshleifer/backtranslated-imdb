In general, this is overlong, unfunny, action / comedy. First of all, I want to say that I enjoy the horror movies of Wayans brother (1) and the sequel. Unfortunately, the white chicks didn't help to laugh halfway. <br /> <br /> The humor is rude. If you like burp, burp, fart, silly poem, you may have to look at this. When it was not rough, it was a silly story. The first 10 minutes of this film gave me everything. <br /> <br /> But I watched everything from my friends. (Otherwise I will not pay attention.) Some stories are undeniable. It's in horror. But at least the laughter is fast and steady I think this may be one of the main problems of this movie. Some jokes were dragged out for too long when they were more disgusting than funny at first. If you like comedy with a few brain cells, you should avoid this. If you want a stupid comedy movie that has more laughs, look at the horror movie Hotspots 1 + 2. <br /> <br /> Complete 1/10 unfunny. Some stories that seem to follow the concept That is what if we dress up as a white chicks for movies?) But there is not enough material.
