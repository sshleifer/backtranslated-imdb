I watched SCARECROWS because of the buzz around. I couldn't imagine who would like this movie because it was terrible, bad and bad. <br /> <br /> It's clear that anyone who created this movie didn't know the horror. The whole story is a successful marriage of two types: action movies. (Guns and criminals) and horror (scarecrow live) When criminals are killed by scarecrows one by one, both types will automatically cancel each other because they are first criminals and those who care about criminals and the order Two because of the stupid criminals that will boot! Having zombies, scarecrows follow, they just don't work here. Where is the horror I want criminals to die horribly and painfully. <br /> <br /> But this story is so bad that the marriage of this type may be original if handled well. We left just a dense criminal group and a scarecrow, which is "life" for whatever reason the filmmakers think. Making things even worse is the fact that the movie is terrible (TV like) and the worse offense is that all the conversations are told to CBs and we hear unused conversations. Types of radio programs This part is not really good. The director should be shot at this point because of stupid thoughts! I can't tell you how annoying it is. <br /> <br /> As I said, the criminals in SCARECROWS are amazingly stupid. For example, when someone suddenly appeared, very upset and filled with money and straw (straw wounds) in his large open wounds, others asked, "What medicine is he?" After they fired a lot of bullets In him he cannot kill him (he is a "zombie" by the scarecrow. Do not ask ...) Receive immoral clues. I have never seen a fool in a movie before. And there was that woman I wanted a scarecrow to kill her quickly because she hurt her butt. When she finds out that her father is caught at the scarecrow "cross", she blames the criminals in the infamous scene. (Bad performances) Although criminals cannot do it She's really crazy! But the Scarecrow is the biggest weakness in this very weak flick. They are not scary Nothing can explain much about them. They are just a plot device in this movie filled with equipment. <br /> <br /> Wesley filmed the scarecrow for 30 seconds without a break. And that scene with the head talking in the refrigerator Thank you for the laughter. <br /> <br /> All of this is the worst movie I have seen recently. (And I have watched many movies today!) Between equally frightening silos. KILLER or SCARECROWS I want to see SILO KILLER again. Yes, SCARECROWS is terrible.
