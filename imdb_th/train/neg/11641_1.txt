Although in general I will be the actor of a well-built movie. But I did not limit myself to movies that escaped those boundaries, and often I didn't enjoy and admired the successful films of "breaking the rules" and it was quite true that the director Pasolini broke the rules of the cinema. Established But it was my opinion that he had not succeeded or reached the real point. <br /> <br /> Pasolini's work trembled with sight. But this is a matter of what is on the screen less than it actually is. His filming was less interesting than the artistic choice, rather than the result of the amateur filming. This is the truth of DECAMERON. Pasolini often uses actors who are not actors and while many directors do that with amazing results under the direction of Pasolini, who is not an actor of He tends to remain not an actor. This is true of DECAMERON Pasolini. Often there are images designed to scare, offend or confuse the audience. Such elements can be combined with shocking effects. But in the hands of Pasolini, this element hardly helped anything in the movie. This is also true of DECAMERON. <br /> <br /> I have been understood that there are many people who like to even appreciate Pasolini's movies. However, I never met them and I couldn't read anything. With Pasolini or his work that makes me like or admire like that Considering only his work, I saw that he was a non-"rogue" rookie director due to his lack of skills - and those who applauded his early intellectuals. "Existential courage" simply confirms that he has a bad habit as a filmmaker. I found that his work was boring, not impressive and pretentious. And this is also true of DECAMERON. It is a sad story that is the true story of all films of Pasolini. It is the misfortune that I have to endure.
