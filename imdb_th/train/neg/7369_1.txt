I felt after "Submerged under water" This would not be better ... I was right. He had to look for champagne money and not care about the final product ... His voice was dubbed by strangers. Repeatedly, which sounds like what the correction is - good - just above the skill level It's nothing more than a B or C movie that has enough money to hire a talented photographer and a sound designer "OK". <br /> <br /> Like the previous poster that says the problem looks like Will appear in post-production (... dubbing, etc.) too bad, causing the plot of the deal for SG flicks. <br /> <br /> I will not rent the flick SG again until He will email me to ask forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Terrible - I miss K. elly LeBrock ... <br /> <br /> - Jimbo
