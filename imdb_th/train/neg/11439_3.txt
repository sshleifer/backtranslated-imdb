Obviously, this film was designed to attract the Chick Flick audience, which I have sat to watch and are most happy. However, this is a very frustrating attempt that Heather Graham will become the next Meg Ryan. Her performance is too much and she seems to have anxiety when compared to her colleagues who feel relaxed in their role. This movie may be more due to the appropriate budget for setting up the actors and the appropriate story. My wife and I both agreed that this was the 'mud' at the end when the movie ended with embarrassing pain! Good luck next time. Hope that Miss Graham will stick to the type of movie she is like from Hell.
