It seems that everyone is raving about and doesn't notice how this movie was created. Deaf, dumb people are good people, losers, underdogs - good for cricket is great. But the average movie overall I think it should be better than I thought. <br /> <br /> The story is predictable for movies that are not based on real life events. I'm sure this movie is more interesting. The song has just been stuffed into it and I have to forward the scene to show the same thing from different angles. <br /> <br /> Good performance, though watchable.
