One of the worst movies I've ever seen! Actions, conversations, manuscripts, sounds, lighting, plot lines. Actually, I can't say anything positive about this, even though I enjoy Swedish movies. The fight scene is so ridiculous that it is impossible to be serious. And when the characters take off with his shirt while dodging bullets in the bar, I'm not sure if it should be a joke or if someone thinks these are really good movie ingredients! A half-descent performer But she disappeared in unbelievable pronunciation and unbelievable reactions It shocked you with people spending time and money on this kind of thing ...
