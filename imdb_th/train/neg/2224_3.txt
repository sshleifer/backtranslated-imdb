I saw this first thing at the age of about 7 years. I remember what I believed to be a vague outline of what had happened. It turns out that now, 15 years later, I can remember everything very precisely because it seems that the author has never created any stories. There is no plot for this movie / cartoon. There is no character development. The character's curves are nothing. Good men do things because they are good while bad people do things just because they are not good. The unintended part is hilarious, when the person you think is important is dead and no one cares the least. They just shrugged and went forward. No talk at all. If you cut off the fight scenes and the running scenes, you'll lose 70% of the movie. <br /> <br /> Watch this because you want to see good animation and no other reason Or if you like to watch hot cartoon chicks, scantily clad
