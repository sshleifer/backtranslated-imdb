Now please don't start calling my name. "unpatriotic", "weirdo" and others <br /> <br /> The length of the film (4 hours .. !!!) is the biggest mistake. There is no fix at all - it seems JP Dutta loves his project too much. Even Lagaan is 4 hours long - but it's fun and gets the message as well. <br /> <br /> It depends on the real event and who Real people Its glory But is the war scene repeatedly necessary?

Various related Have bad conversations At first it helped relieve the violence. But became monotonous later on who would be able to predict the nature of the right talk. <br /> Why did the soldiers walk as if they were fully lions in the forest? Do not know that the enemy is lying close and when they are shot, it shows compassion. But it seems that they are not confident in their safety at first. <br /> <br /> Melodious songs and lyrics are full of emotions. Better to listen to them on the soundtrack than in movies. <br /> <br /> The performance is a graceful grace: from experienced veterans like Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan to related newbies such as Abhishek Bachchan and Akshaye Khanna. Like a professional. Manoj Bajpai and Ashutosh Rana deserve special mention for making a happy mood whenever necessary. <br /> <br /> The conversation is in a wonderful period ("from Madhuri .. Love !! ") To the absurdity / boring musalman Hindusthan mein hain") and the fun that is composed of MCs, BCs, Cs and F-words. All is not really necessary. <br /> <br /> LOC Kargil tries to send Appropriate tribute to brave Indian soldiers But tried hard and eventually failed Indian soldiers deserve better tribute
