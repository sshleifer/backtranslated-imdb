I don't know anything about this movie and I went out in half an hour knowing everything about this movie. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm a good person, but if someone tells me that they like this movie, I probably won't talk to them again. Anyone who likes it regularly tends to have the most hermit-like personality. I will also include that they think they are smart as well as the fart bag in the middle that makes sound for the movie. I know that everyone has different types of humor. Some people may not like me. But it's okay I don't think it covers all types of humor. This movie is flat and boring as Wes Anderson's heart goes inside and is prepared to walk away. The best way is to get a refund as well.
