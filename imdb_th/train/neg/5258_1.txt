I rented this movie and found it to be true again. It is about a family that has a stepmother and a crafty family. Then the cool son comes with his stupid camera and he likes to take pictures of the damaged buildings and strange things and strange movies. He travels side by side and agrees, etc. etc. etc ... They go to a city where no one knows it exists (blah blah blah) and the most annoying thing is that this movie ends. No experience Understand what the movie is !!!! I saw many mysterious movies. But that is the worst thing. Actually, it doesn't have an explanation at all and I hope I don't see it.
