This is the type of thing that is now just exciting for the movie eggheads. In the end, Feierstein's Flex Crush will let you know that Real Men don't see anything from Truffaut. <br /> <br /> It might be interesting if Truff. Foo has something to tell here. Images from the camera - voyeur are nothing new. Do we all forget De Sica's "Bicycle Thief"? Or whatever by Hitchcock <br /> <br /> So what we get is a metaphor that extends to children and youth as Truffaut, who takes all his free time. Of plagiarism (a little steal) and eventually flee from limited society to make 'his own movie'. Sorry ... stay there, do this too often for this.
