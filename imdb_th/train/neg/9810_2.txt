It is difficult to criticize this film because I don't like the story of myself and there is no good acting to help. Think "Raising Arizona" with a bad time That show can pass But Jennifer Tilly is above (But still not enough to create a good movie movie) normally comes somewhere between "Misery" and the ridiculous DMV staff. The stress of their part or the stress of all useless exercises. The movie is actually degraded for a couple of hours. Darryl Hannah spends most of his time crying so hard to understand. I hope I can tell you that it is over. But I walked out to apologize
