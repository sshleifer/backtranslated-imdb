This film is almost laughing with Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters as the mother of the murderer who was found guilty. With a terrifying scandal after the trial, two women gathered and departed from New York to California to open and music and dance studios for girls that look like Shirley Cathedral. <br /> < br /> Reynolds made a mistake in bringing Winters with her in California. Winter plays as a religious woman who seems to stop rocking the plane more and more. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, women who are together receive unsafe calls. Reynolds, who wears colored wigs Blonde has been praised by the wealthy father of one of her students, Dennis Weaver, played by Agnes Moorehead, one of her last films, Sister Alma, who Winters is a faithful listener. <br /> <br /> Movie This is the title of her heavy Shelley Winters here and heaviness seemed to make her performance better. Winter has always played a good role in testing her nerves. <br /> <br /> The ending is disgusting and anyone will forget the Winter that plays the piano that is slapped with insanity. ?
