I'm a big fan of Martin Amis, this book is a film based. Unfortunately, the director couldn't translate the book into the screen. This novel has been posted in a modern and highly inventive manner in the characters that look elegant and the breakdown of traditional plot and character development. Is a test of human greed, greed and emptiness of one of the most moral English writers The director of this film was not interested in the novel. In his hand, the film shouted at the speed of the brakes, indulging in every trick, shooting and knowing the 'strange' camera angle. Up to one hundred Not even a glimpse (short) of Christian Solimeno's beautiful penis is enough to help me with this film!
