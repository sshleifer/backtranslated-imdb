This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I gave up to watch it after one hour and regretted that hour. The performance was terrible and there was almost no plan at all. I guess people come with strange shapes of animals and start creating stories around them. Borrowing some ideas from movies like Resident Evil and Aliens doesn't result in movies like them. If this is a top Korean movie, I don't want to see even Korean movie trailers ... <br /> <br /> However, this movie is a good reason to believe. High scores mean that the movie tends to be good. I think all Koreans who have internet for playing online games rate this movie in the last 8 even though there is no clue about this.
