This movie is a complete nonsense! Avoid losing this celluloid at all costs. It travels and is not continuous. I am proud of plumbing the cinema in the 70s with depth from everything from Salo to Salon Kitty. I like to be shocked. But I want a consistent story However, if watching a pair of horses will make you interested, this movie is for you. The worst part is the idiot werewolf with the Wang function set. I mean, it's hard to sit around without talking about the performance that is terrible and the voice is not good. Please, I know that the cover is interesting. (The gorilla hand that stretched out for the naked woman) But don't waste time or money because you won't return.
