Two early selectors: I think Joe Don Baker can do well or even bigger with the right content and the right director ("Eater" Cape Fear "remake a small role in" Goldeneye "," Walking Tall "). And I like Baker in "Mitchell" because he plays as an anti-hero who is supported like no other Yes, the coverage of MST3K is fun, but they shoot a lot of cheap photos at Baker, which he doesn't deserve to make things lively and fun - he suits the level and tone of the movie and he is the best part. <br /> <br /> "Final Justice" seems to be the same. But even though there are exotic places and themes "Cowboy frontier Justice", it is somewhat weaker than "Mitchell." And the main reason is that the character of Baker, as written, is an idiot. This film has the idea that since Baker combined the old-fashioned mechanical genre, he challenged his opponent in a fast-paced, mano-a-mano match, and because he was a tough man and a man, so he Always winning, even when he was injured, the injury is greater, etc. <br /> <br /> That's a lot of potential thoughts (applicable to Gary Cooper), even though it is condemned. Users Baker felt awkward and foolish enough to challenge his minions of evil men in three launches in the public market by civilians anywhere. He can shone them to the head of the villain's headquarters. (Which is why he followed them first) and they will not notice Or he may have been reduced by them and forced them to surrender and get one of the subordinates to take him to the headquarters at the gun point But not he must be a hot dog bush league and a manly boy block, so he gets the kid who was held hostage in the next shot! <br /> <br /> Is this someone we should appreciate? <br /> <br /> All movies are like this. Most supporting actors are between OK (henchmen) to be quite good. (The bad guy and his father, who are two well-known European actors - they've just passed the movement But they are professionals But through everything, Baker's character showed a stupid and ineffective attitude that caused at least two innocent people to die, including two bad people who may have survived without using it. <br /> <br /> In a positive light, because 90% of this film is located in Malta or in the Mediterranean Sea, you will see many beautiful scenery and special things that look good and strange. lots And in fact, Baker himself may be a person who is very heavy and slightly sick But he wasn't that bad ... Of course, not a fool at this film critic. (Including Mike and bots in hilarious stories). <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is good for video wallpapers. But viewers should not pay any attention
