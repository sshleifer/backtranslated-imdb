I voted 3 for this movie because it looks very good, like all Greenaways. However, it's a combination of "art", sex and his intimate shit. But I got bored of it It is not for everyone. Of course, the prevalent McGregor is clearly involved for the sake of credibility that I guess. But he really should not waste his time I hate to give everyone a fake corner, but please ..... !!! On the positive side, it is very visually appealing and I enjoy music. But can't see it until the end and I can't say that for many movies I always watch everything But can't bear !!
