Recognized by many critics as one of the greatest frauds of all time (Of course, the greatest fraud of Brian De Palma's career) <br /> <br /> Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) when he and his wife Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith) participates in the hit and run, Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis). His story is recorded by other people who like it. <br /> <br / > Well, as I said in my summary ... <br /> <br /> What movie should this be? What will be It seems to combine comedy and satire. But of course it didn't increase much It was destroyed by an incredibly nasty character that you never wanted to meet in real life. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of the novel. (I started reading once But it was not clear because it was not my preference) but it was obvious to me that those who didn't like the novel thought that this movie was a complete imitation. Many talents try hard to give the movies of substandard quality with some characteristics and failures. <br /> <br /> The problem started with casting Tom Hank and the good guy in the role that should be clearly not sympathetic. And Peter Fallow's role in the novel is the story of Bruce Willis' terrible story in this role. <br /> <br /> Alas, not even Morgan Freeman who was able to escape from this film with his dignity still alive, which had to send a heavy lecture. <br /> <br /> This movie ended up being ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I like gathering talent. Because I will give four in ten But I'm sure some people will say that the better movies are likely to be made from sources.
