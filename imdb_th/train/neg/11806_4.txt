It's hard to watch this movie and is fair and totally objective since I was a big fan of the original movie. Fri, 1944 for me and others is one of the most famous movies I've ever done. Realizing that this is just a short film made for TV and most people leave it. I didn't expect much. But you can't help comparing this to the movie '44. Behind the scenes, I found myself comparing what I watched and remembered playing with Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson and others now. I saw these famous actors play a famous actor who was replaced by Richard Crenna, Samantha Eggar and Lee J. Cobb. <br /> <br /> When it ended, I found that it wasn't bad. As I expected But it does not match the original 1944. The two main areas in which this movie was created for TV are not as good as it should be. (1) The electricity between the two actors is gone and (2) takes only 90 minutes. With almost no development time Characters and chemistry between those who hoped. Crenna and Eggar were flat and did not match MacMurray and Stanwyck as "Walter Neff" and "Phyllis Dietrichson," respectively. As in other characters, such as "Barton Keyes" and "Edward Norton" Cobb are great, like Keyes and Robert Webber. As Norton, the head of the insurance company, it is quite interesting to see the time frame change. Time is All that was in the early 70s, instead of the mid-40s, or the story was very similar. Just rush. <br /> <br /> However, watching once is enough and I will return to the original version. Happy for watching this movie and classic movie
