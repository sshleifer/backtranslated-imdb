If this is the first time you experience the wonders of the cinema, if you have never seen it "Animation" comes first. You think that this movie is a child of the gods. But if you've watched movies, TV shows, even Barney the Dinosaur, you won't be impressed with this movie. Heck Barney, the dinosaurs, is more realistic than dinos in this movie. Just watch "The Giant Gila Monster" before I can watch this story and I like that movie more. It works as a movie B, it has a lamer dialogue, a hokier performance, a cheesier effect and a real faithful to Gila Monster! Carno 3 didn't have much of B's ​​finisher. It had some blood, and the man Polchek came close to a few jokes. But this movie is quite overwhelming .... almost weak It's a small engine that can't be used with dinosaur movies. I'm not saying that you shouldn't watch movies. <br /> <br /> Some people can watch the gum dry on the sidewalk and enjoy. If you are one of those people, try shooting this movie.
