These two scores are a sensible contribution from Akshay Kumar. I know that Bollywood movies are not determined to be true, but please produce Walt Disney more realistic than this plot. Dad is dying and doing what the good parents do ... kicking his son out with his wife and pregnant wife. Something that is too difficult to swallow - 1. The cool indoor pool in Priyanka's bedroom and from that point to hunger in the garden where her law shed tears. 2. Akshay The work is a dwarf, biting a dog that has been mad and walked away. This film is our ingenuity. I can't believe that I am financially involved with the 'people' who created this movie by taking my family to watch it. We left the theater with a frown. Use my advice and don't waste your 'waqt'.
