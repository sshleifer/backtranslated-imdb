Un-Pop - Believe! Meg Ryan didn't look at her personally, as usual in this story, which allowed me to forgive her by acting superficial, hard to believe that she was the producer of this dog. What kind of style did he ever do? Ho ... Banzai !!! Finally, this is directed by the person who made Big Chill? Must be Jonestown's replay - Wooofff Hollywood style!
