You get 5 writers to come together to write different stories with different categories and then you try to create a movie. It is an action adventure. It is a fire. It's a western style. It's a mess. Sorry, this movie has a foul odor. 4.5 gives an extra high rating. That said, it was this kind of movie that made me think that I could write a movie and I could barely write.
