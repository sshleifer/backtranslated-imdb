The original movie (dated 19 ??) doesn't show any "monster". It's just a terrible thing. "Things", <br /> <br /> This version shows all aspects of the technique. Special. <br /> <br /> The "mystery" presented in the original movie is the most scary part: no one knows what causes the strange things to happen. By showing the face of the "old man", this mister disappeared completely. Even worse: special effects (The face with the crying child) is ridiculous. This is creating an idiot that is too exciting to be scary as close to the original.
