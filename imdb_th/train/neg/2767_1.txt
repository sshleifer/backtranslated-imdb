This movie is probably the worst movie I have ever seen in my life - above the movie "Spawn of Slithis" that I had seen before about 10 <br /> <br /> Poor, arrogant dialogue and Nonsense, the plot is difficult to understand, the scenes that are cut, even the songs are annoying. I didn't leave anything at all or Special effects are not bad - but CGI does not make good movies. <br /> <br /> I can't believe that I really use money to watch this movie. If anyone has contact information of Hyung-rae Shim (Director), please forward it to my username "at gmail" and I will contact him to request a personal refund.
