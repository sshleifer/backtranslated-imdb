I watched this movie, claiming that Stone, Amber, Benson and Nick Stahl were pretty cool - I think any movie that has two actors that I like and respect is not bad. And in that sense, I was right - considering the conversation that made them both well enough Not enough to stop the suction of movies. You understand. But enough to make it through a strange 75-minute movie (And that is the main sign of a great movie: 40 minutes after the time you wish to pray) <br /> <br /> How hard is it to know how to start with the problem in "Taboo"? Was shocking Wood and completely unnatural January's performance was incredibly bad, and since she was the character that we spent most of the time around the house, this was a flaw that could not be forgiven. This plot is complex enough to make it unreasonable at the same time, thinking that it is completely predictable at the same time. (Indeed, not one of the major 'twists' in this movie will surprise everyone. The director tried too hard with too little success, tracking the awkward shock, and the camera that was disturbing - distracting from the things in the story. <br /> <br /> Three stars in the movie Was rewarded by the fact that it had Amber Benson and was finally thrown into the area where there was a joke that made me a little angry I will not recommend this movie to anyone, in any case, avoid all costs.
