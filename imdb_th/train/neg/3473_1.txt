This may be the worst Christmas movie ever. The plot is almost nonexistent. The show (especially Affleck) is the worst. Ben Affleck's fans may protect this film. But they have to accept As far as I can compile the plot, including a wealthy salesman Ben Affleck was told by a contraction to the place that reminded him of his childhood. When doing this, he paid for the family that lives in the house to be his family on Christmas ... and that is the film continues and he finally stays with the daughter of the family ... . blah blah blah
