Polyester is John Waters' first film I see and I have to say it's a movie that "The worst" I've seen until now. <br /> <br /> Water's "talent" group, including many people, I'm sure who is the cook and is happy to say that the river is written. Everything about this movie is terrible. Actions, cameras, editing and stories about women playing by 300 toots. Divine idols are really ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Saying that I have to recommend this movie because It is Very funny and you won't believe the shit that happens to Francine is not good. Her son leaped the solvent and stomped the woman's feet at the grocery store. Her daughter is the most foolish in the city. Her husband is an A-hole of obscene actors who have done everything in his power to make the poor and make the poor Francine poor. <br /> <br /> Francine's only friend is played by Edith Massey Edith watched and listened. It seemed that she was reading the script from the cue card and had never seen the script before filming. <br /> <br /> Despite all Francine's traffic, Waters Then make a wonderful Hollywood meal and everyone) lives happily throughout Cams
