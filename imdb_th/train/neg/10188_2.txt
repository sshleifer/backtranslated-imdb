Flick, this juvenile tenderness is strictly for teens in the old men 'body, desperate to relive their teenage hormones years, how to challenge them by burning gas to a fast and pointless car. (Or plane) that is free. <br /> <br /> Plot borrowed heavily from Mr. Rogers' neighbors. (If it was my oil company group) and Logan ran, it was quite calm and lacking clear style) <br /> <br /> Starring Lee Majors and Burgess Meredith, this movie is set in the world after the gas crisis. The powerful government doesn't want you to (* ahem *) drive and burn gas. Sort of the opposite of the current Enron and Bush, the government that pushed the oil to drive the SUV. <br /> <br /> The juxtaposition makes this movie laughing. But wait ... there are many more, even if this movie will be in the future. But we do not show any future technology in addition to returning to use bikes, golf carts and horses. You will believe that the future looks ... like today, the same clothes, the same suburban homes, green lawns like today, and when movies are created. There is no solar panel, no wind turbines, no concessions to renewable energy. <br /> <br /> The show is flat and tasteless. Even the scenes that may be witty or moving, flick, honor, romance, horror ... All things have to fall over the paper dolls under the briefcase. <br /> <br /> Continuity is lacking. Burgess Meredith's character changes color and configuration periodically, as the filmmakers insult our ingenuity with unparalleled stock images over and over again. The plot is complex. <br /> <br /> Even though the film is dead car and SF fans should avoid this movie like a one-month roadkill, except that you will enjoy Exxon executives trying to make movies. Empty gas tank like a hero.
