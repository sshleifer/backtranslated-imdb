The widow named Audrey Kaisel still refused to sell the rights to the movie. But by using ordinary CGI effects to become a reality, Gessel changed her mind. Universal gave her a good offer. She also accepted the casting of Jim Carrey as the main character. Suppose she is satisfied with the final result. Okay, Kaisel, who made us one of them. <br /> <br /> The film received a budget of $ 123 million (which is more than the cost of Heaven's Gate, including the inflation rate adjustment) which is obvious. that Neat makeup, scene design and special effects (Destroyed) <br /> <br /> Some of the movies are rather gloomy) Unfortunately, it seems that there is no money that has been set up to get a better script than what Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (the author of Who's Rabbit Rabbit Rabbit), which can do better than <br /> high budget).

That may not look bad if Grinch is more ... Grinchy, the character that Dr. Seuss wrote and Chuck Jones later became a cunning fox who tried to compete for the holiday season, destroyed by his sudden changes. (And the multiplying growth) of the heart. Carinch's Grinch is a celebrity who acts more than a cover and sometimes a gangster when doing a holiday. 'Cheermeister' will erase the whoville square in anger. <br /> <br /> (Hopefully the scenery is as delicious as it looks). This destroys the script's efforts to make Grinch more sympathetic by Whos. All in Whoville, insulting (at least in this interpretation) <br /> <br /> Whoville of Dr. Seuss's vision is a small town, a faithful villager who knows in the heart of the true meaning of Christmas. Whoville of this movie is Kurdistan is noisy and crowded, with a spoiled, selfish, selfish and material; A clear attempt to comment on American consumer protection <br /> <br /> Since the film industry has benefited greatly from American consumers, and because this film has helped to advertise large products, <br /> <br / > <br /> The movie continues to expand and define the new characters of Cindy Lou Who, a small character.

The people at Universal should kneel down and thank God that this great blast worth $ 123 million has earned $ 260 million in the country or they haven't come here today. Moreover, it makes Mike Myers' The Cat in the Hat possible!
