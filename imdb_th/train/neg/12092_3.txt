I do not fail to memorize movie-building skills that are higher than the average of Haneke. For example, I appreciate the unusual setting - daylight - bright, a powerful way to force realistic feelings. However, regarding the content of this film, I am very sorry to see that in the 21st century there is still a need to cause a relationship or feeling overwhelming to surrender or dominance. The problem that the main character has with her mother is incredible, as Walter feels alienated and doesn't understand. (I do not mean the frustration of lovers who do not love in the same way, which can be understood. I mean He looked at her as if she were crazy or as if he were a monk!) I mean, D / s is not a new thing in the world and I think it's rather stupid to deal with the story that it's "strange" or pathology; It is not generally a movie that is really related to this story. <br /> <br /> So, for me, I feel that the film ends with a program-oriented movie, quite anxious with a very outdated spiritual theory (not ) It's almost embarrassing, right?) And that doesn't involve real life and the experiences of those who are involved in the relationship of D / s (personal experience, forums Irc chat rooms, although recent academic study to show this).
