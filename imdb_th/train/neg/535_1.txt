The comments of some of these audiences are ridiculous. Not painful to watch with your important people? I apologize to all my fans. <br /> <br /> It's slow and weird. <br /> <br /> Both Redgraves, Vanessa and Natasha are not suitable for this story, especially with Vanessa, which focuses on the absurd American accent. <br /> <br /> Claire Dennes is an awkward girl the same way she is in my So-Called life. She has not pushed herself in any way. Girls find new ways in Pretending to cry! <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep is one of the parts of this movie exchange. She is on the screen for five minutes and I swear to God. She reaches out from the movie screen and slaps me up. Come <br /> <br /> Oh! And Hugh Daisy better every time I see him. <br /> <br /> Glenn Cole and Eileen Atkins are great in the two and a half scenes. <br /> <br /> I mean, this is a movie that can be taken quite well. It is very beautiful. The setting is attractively decorated to alleviate the boredom that I feel. <br /> <br /> I don't know if it's pathetic. When the movie starring the actors "The greatest actress of our generation" sucked a lot. Of course, there were a few obvious mistakes in corrections, and the main character (Ann) was a jerk. I'm glad she died. But that is because I feel bad with Ann's friend Lila, mostly because these two women are better actors and make me feel a little sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Ah, a bad job. Movie evening You don't have fun and you don't even think of it. I'm sure hope that this book will be better, so don't waste more time. 3/10
