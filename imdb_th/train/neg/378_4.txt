... but the keywords here are "normal". I have been known to like movies, everyone thinks that is dumb. But in this world of movies that have a B rate, Z is absolutely ridiculous. What I respect about their favorite movie, type B, is that they don't care too much about themselves. The filmmakers like that sort of keeping the movie soft, even though it's a heavy topic. However, I have been impressed that the producers of this film are serious, as they gather into a 10-star class with bad efforts in painful lines. However, despite all this, I still give 4 stars out of 10 stars because I have prejudices towards movies like this. However, if you are a fan of B, I'll try to find it too hard.
