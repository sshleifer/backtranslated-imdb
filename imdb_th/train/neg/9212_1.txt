The only value in this movie is basically to laugh at how bad it is. With a story that makes your average middle-aged writer look good and the performance is almost good, it gives me the lowest score Tom, one of the first films that he clearly was not happy to be picky. The best special effects of movies include men dressed in fabulous, fake rubber, consumable.
