I watched this movie a couple of times and all I can say is that this is a low-cost garbage and nothing related to true historical facts. Actors' performances are terrible. But as a result of the limited possibilities of acting I can say that there is a much better movie about Hitler and Germany over the years and the increase in evil is much lower than average. I can recommend the German movie Downfall, where you can see the great performances of Swiss actor Bruno Ganz on the roll of Adolf Hitler.
