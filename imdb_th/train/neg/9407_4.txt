"Houseboat Horror" is often regarded as the worst Australian film ever created and is described as a general slasher movie that carries out promotions. 'Watching a movie that can't get an Oscar' underground disco band members began to die. Death from the fires that were burned as they were trying to shoot music videos on a remote lake in the outback of Australia, flicking and writing with a suspicion and annoying characters. Send blood: The head is split in half, the neck is cut and the woman is killed by a horseshoe. If you like to watch a movie, you can try it. But you get a warning at least better than "The Bleeder" of Sweden. 4 out of 10
