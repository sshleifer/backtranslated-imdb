This movie is boring! <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some funny and funny moments. But you can't make the whole movie! <br /> <br /> The character is too stereotyped. There is no real story - but a short episode with a freakish character that is not enough to make the plot genuine Because most actors are accepted in Hungary, mysteriously why they played. <br /> <br /> This is not * not * a new hope for Hungarian movies. It's boring, even if it's genuine or unique. They may try more and more ... 2 out of 10
