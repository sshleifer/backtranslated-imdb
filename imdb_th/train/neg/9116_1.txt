There is no suitable scene. <br /> <br /> Amy Adams gives the worst performance ever. Prove that you can start anywhere. The guy playing Sebastian, too, doesn't look like Ryan Phillips. Like Joshua Jackson The other two women are terrible too. <br /> <br /> Then the conversation is boring. <br /> <br /> Sebastian (going to have three people): If you can't beat them ... <br /> <br /> Innocent girl: Who says you can't beat them? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The ending conflict with the whole plot. Of the original In the first film, it is clear that Kathryn and Sebastian never had sex. One of the reasons Sebastian wants Kathryn is terrible, apart from the fact that she is played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, ie she is "The only woman he doesn't have and kill him." She is a tease who likes to play with him. The fact that she never gave to him increased his needs then in P.O.S. this meant that he could have her with the girl on the side. What? And we do not see sex as well It's implied not only But stupid, absurd and contradictory <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Kathryn denied Sebastian because he fell in love, making him a loser. Even if he wins the bet But causing the opportunity to collapse Then in this stool he loosened and fell in love. So she doesn't screw the "loser", the perfect loser. Another thing: It stated that Sebastian never had love. So what you call something with Virgin Girl? <br /> <br /> Then, at the end, the innocent girl suddenly suddenly revealed that Is an evil lesbian couple (dun dun dun) and as I say, they go into a silly, stupid threesome. <br /> <br /> There is a plot conflict Did the writer see the first movie? A 5 year old boy could point out his stuff. <br /> <br /> After three years, Sebastian had sex with a blonde girl who undermined her mind. At her back, at the back of the Sudden Plot Twist limo, sit in front of the audience and smile endlessly on the camera. <br /> <br /> The end ... <br /> <br /> Saw Sebastian become his asshole at the beginning. Foreign Interest I guess it will make the evil Sebastian into three-thirds with two hot girls.
