I haven't finished the movie yet. You might say that in this case, I don't have the right to review, especially negative. But I do it just because I stopped it because I couldn't see it anymore ... I passed halfway and I got there by promising myself that there was something good near the movie. This is so boring that I despise. I haven't read many other reviews, so I'm not sure if there are other homosexual teens who have suffered from this. But I am a homosexual and I am through revelation. "Similar" dreams, days, problems, etc. etc. There may be two moments that I feel that this film can go somewhere that I feel it may have some meaning of meaning or relationship. But these hopes are dashed while the clich√© subtitles ride on the next set of horses I mean, just look at the quotes on the IMDb page. Unfortunately, you can't hear the scrappy play or the resonance will fade away if you just read the words because they are too painful / ridiculous / ridiculous / not to be missed. I gave the film three stars and all three of those stars to the actors of the film that did a great job trying to change the "Archer" concept of the weariness of Cherry is remarkable. In my heart, I prayed that he was not the one who decided to include long TV close-ups ... Another unnecessary ancient idea in movies such as Curin's Korum ... I think it's perfect for the movie. This premiere at Sundance (because Archer has a relationship at the festival through the volunteer work he has done by the way ...) because Sundance seems to be one of the festivals with ancient ideas. Like this Recognized as "art" is not art, it's not home I'm afraid it's just plain do not see the house.
