This may be one of the funniest movies ever if you are not serious about it. It's a bit old and weak effects But it's very fun There are giant crabs that attack women. Oh and Japanese crab singing It is surprisingly bad. And the ending of the telegram throughout the story was great, predictable, but seeing the final battle would roll you in your seat Don't even give this movie a chance and you will love it. Susan George enjoys watching and yes, she looks naked. Her daughter is not worth fighting. But she was attacked by a giant crab They are the size of a big cat. This is 2, but I love it as my God movie. But for entertainment, I gave 7, did I mention the giant crab?
