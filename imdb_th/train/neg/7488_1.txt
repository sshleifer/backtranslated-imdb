Everyone who saw the original 1970s movie knew that the best actors and directors were able to compile masterpieces of comedy movies. In the same way, it's easy to see how the opposite can be boring to Hollywood! This movie is pathetic! If not for John Cleese (comic genius), I would walk out about 15 minutes to lose this terrible celluloid. <br /> <br /> Neil Simon didn't write another screenplay for this story. And I was surprised that after the failure of the film, he would not sue for libel! Humor! How do the original producers think when they choose this actor? How can directors and editors look at these scenes and think how funny they are? I don't know, but one thing I know - it's no surprise that foreign films and independent films are becoming more and more popular. .......
