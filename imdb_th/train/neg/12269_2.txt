Japanese feelings about pacing, editing and music scores must be different from American tastes. But of course, this movie should have a lot more to do with post work. <br /> <br /> Hollywood people do this movie and I think it's a big deal. Interesting and creepy story There is something about the edge of the city, brave police, earthquakes, health facilities and the mysterious saltwater killings that are enough to make you fascinated. However, this story requires a little sense and may be shorter than about 40 minutes. <br /> <br /> I must say that the effect "Sixth sense" is completely in effect in this movie. And that is clearly seen from the beginning. <br /> <br /> As mentioned above, only those who love Japanese movies are hard to die.
