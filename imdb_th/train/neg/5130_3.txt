Janeane Garofalo is widely known for her dissatisfaction with the film, calling it anti-feminist. She also said on her radio show that she hated to do it. "Romantic comedies" because she doesn't believe in them. I wholeheartedly agree with Janeane here. This movie is the best small story. She did her best But overall, it is another tedious and unbelievable story. "Romantic comedy" that has no basis in the real world While there are some who will say "Suspend your unbelief". One person is tired of having to suspend it almost every time you get a romantic movie from Hollywood. Janeane's character for some reason is usually filmed in the shadows. And darkness which makes her look unattractive while Uma's characters are filmed in dimly colored tones (Which may be offensive to Janeane and may be one of the reasons That is what hurt the movie if we buy evidence that Janeane should look better than both of them. As many people have said here and in other comments, Janeane is not ugly. But in fact quite beautiful I haven't read the criticism that someone said that Uma looks better. Having said that, even though I believe Ben Chaplin's character should be with Uma rather than Jane, not Many men don't like women who are really smart. (And many women don't like men who are really smart) and sadly Ben remains with Uma And even though the director tried to make Jane a pretty person But it didn't work Her natural beauty has arrived. <br /> <br /> I think many of Janeane's male fans who are obsessed with her like this movie because they like to think of themselves as Bepp's characters. Chaplin Janeane is more complicated than the characters she plays here. (In real life, it is often more complicated than Hollywood can imagine), so try gentlemen to take a cold shower. This is the role Janeane is well known and is a shame because this is not a good movie.
