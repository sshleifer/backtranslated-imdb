This film has been covered with scandals for a long time until it became something that sought ... evil, mystery, etc. It has everything to be a great masterpiece. But in the end it failed in every way. It was a terrible comedy movie, a horrible horror movie, a weak erotic movie. <br /> <br /> 2 DVDs consisting of beautiful little books with interviews, interviews. Essays about wildlife and other director rather than pretentious For those who have heard about it But never saw it. The package will look fantastic until someone sees the real movie. Disc 1 contains movies that have been edited and translated into English. But with the quality of the picture that is good. Sheet 2 has the cut of the director in a terrifying transfer into French. <br /> <br /> What do I say about the real beast? Mitch's hand puppet should be more effective and shocking.
