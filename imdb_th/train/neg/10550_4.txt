After being a big fan of the scene for the episode of T.V on Stella Street, ten minutes, I waited to watch this movie with excitement and expectation. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with the way that almost all the porch and one torpedo boat were lifted directly from the TV and sent less enthusiasm and cartoon rhythm. If the actors spoke them once and were unable to speak again I bought my copy on the DVD and felt that I was cheating with the hard earned cash to see the joke again. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * The film's story begins at Stella Street ( General english Surrey Road) gradually has a population 'Some of the most famous from the stage and screen of the past forty years', including Michael Caine, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and The Rolling Stones. All famous celebrities in the streets are staked by local con artists and Forced to live like a homeless and general working class Have some good times But overall, the writer tried to think of interesting things and make it boring. * The end of the spoiler * <br /> <br /> On the TV episode, all the characters will be performed by John Sessions and Phil Cornwell (including Female) but in the movie Ronni Ancona will be added to the character. I think this is an error. Her imitation is not a joke and feels that her character is included in the story for her to do. <br /> <br /> If you're not a big fan of Stella Street, you may find that this movie gives Entertainment But if you are a fan, I think you might walk away, feeling a bit cheated. 4/10
