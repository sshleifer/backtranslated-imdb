Bo is Jane Parker, the father of anthropologists who died a long time. (Richard Harris in the worst role of a very inconsistent career) is in Africa, studying something or something else. She follows him (how?) And he tells the story of the native people of the animal. A giant freak that heard the nightly shrill in the forest became Ape Man himself (Miles O'Keeffe, who had the best dialogue of this film), which saved her life from bad guys and fell in love with her. Provided enough time to suffer for two hours. Monkeys look and cheer Usually I am very generous with different opinions about any movie, but this is the only exception. This is the worst movie ever created. If you don't agree, you haven't seen it. (Note: Newsday calls it "unendurable", which is the best single conclusion I can think of. Maltin Movie Guide commented that they almost had to think about low ratings. Than BOMB)
