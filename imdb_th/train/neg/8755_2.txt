This movie is very bad to say the least. I hope it will be much better after seeing "High School Musical". All movies are the perfect movie "The Simple Life". But it wasn't a real show Amanda's interest in love is playing as a French man. But with a horrible accent One good thing about this movie is the completely cute Michael Trevino, played by Alyson. Things to remember if this movie aired before "High School Musical". But there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> Overall I give 2
