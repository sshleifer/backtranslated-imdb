Basically, bring the concept of every Asian horror movie together into one, and you'll get this movie. The story is like this: A group of children received a letter of voice from their own phone which told in advance of death. There is something that happens to the ghosts, which if you have seen the movie Ghost Asian, this story is not scary at all. This movie is quite uncomfortable because it's quite old-fashioned. It's a different movie of the same. <br /> <br /> The performance is quite good. Unfortunately, the actors are in a difficult situation, so there is nothing we have never seen in the past. The two actors performed well. <br /> <br /> As far as possible We got a great sequence which included twisting the arms out. (I don't know how to explain it) but it's cut out so you won't see anything except the end result. You see blood, sometimes including arms that were executed and zombies. (That looks really cool, I might add) But this movie doesn't get too much blood. <br /> <br /> Fear in the movie is minimal and spread out. And it's not that scary You will get some creepy pictures. But it is not enough that I consider it scary It is no different from Ringu, Ju-On or Dark Water and no one makes me scared. That is the downfall of this story. (And most Asian horror movies) is that if it does not send fear, then it is not good. <br /> <br /> As far as the director Takashi Mije is still able to do quite well. Slightly tame in this film compared to his past movies. Many images are like Miike (including scenes with dead fetuses) and in the last 15 - 20 minutes, it seems that Miike will be far more in other movies. Still, the movie isn't perfect without it. Origins <br /> <br /> I would like to introduce people who are big in horror in Asia. (Even if you are able to recommend it better) or a big Miike fan, reminding people who want to enter Miike is not his best job. <br /> <br /> I give 4 because it's just average. Maybe if this was released 4 or 5 years ago, it might be worth the higher rating. <br /> <br /> Besides, I want to b **** about Asian horror movies. Really fast. Why is it a horror movie in Asia? It's probably better than this automatically. (US) These movies have a lot of equivalent in Japan with what Scream, Urban Legends and I know what you do when Last summer Here at 90, if you've seen one you've seen them all. And many of these movies rely too much on horrific and imaginative ways that if they don't send the fear they have set to do, they are not that good and there is nothing to change at all. The more horror movies in Asia need to be the subject of the Audition and A Tale of Two Sisters. Two films that, if they are not scared or scare you, at least they have great stories, acting in the direction of movies and others Many more. Two films that are not only But a terrifying horror movie But excellent general movies The more horror movies in Asia need to be like this instead of the old idea. "Ghosts want to meet, so they go to kill people via phone / video tape / home / electric appliances / water pipes / Google search engine / vibrator / grocery store / etc."
