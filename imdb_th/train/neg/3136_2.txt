There are many ads that are clearly related to this movie. Although we face each other for the main reason why everyone looks at it, it is Leo and Cate, which doesn't have to be the best actor in this movie. I'm not saying that they are not good actors. I'm saying they are shocking in this movie. Special techniques are appropriate (And I would say that filmmakers do well in satisfying the ship.) But the IT department has many important flaws. For example, before the ship goes down, you will see an unfinished blue screen behind your main character. <br /> <br /> Don't understand me wrong. I like the true Titanic story, but I searched for a movie. This story insulted the story. The correction is bad - there is no reason for the film to take more than 2 and a half hours (except for MAYBE movies, biographies) and the writing and screenplay are viciously stupid. That the song may be better than I expected (And not just the song "My Heart Will Go On" as well) There is a scene that stands out for me when the boat is sinking and pounding the bass music That may be the highlight of the movie. For the whole mood, it was very boring. I felt more relieved than sad when Jack died, which I knew would not be what the director intended. <br /> <br /> In the shell of the bean, I found it very scary that they changed the beautiful story. Of the Titanic, become a hyped chick flick
