I think Croc Hunter is a cool guy! I know I don't have the nerve to get away from the crocodile about 5 feet. <br /> <br /> But everything in this movie is not good. Funny stories that pop out, people start eating and the president's panic makes this movie the worst ever. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible movie that you have to stay away from. The story is a child and youth that you will find yourself laughing because they are very stupid. The plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is 4 years old. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that Croc Hunter didn't ask the crocodile to eat him after he saw this.
