I agree with most Columbo fans that this film is an unnecessary change in style. Columbo is a unique policeman with a method of unorthodox police. This movie looks like a regular detective drama, other things in the past and that is a disturbing point because Columbo is not a regular detective. <br /> <br /> There are two parts in this movie that make me obsessed. First of all, I can't find the name of this movie. It's misleading Perhaps the better name would be "The Vanishing Bride" or something like that. Second, Columbo hides a piece of evidence without proposing a reason. (At least to the audience) why he did it <br /> <br /> I don't feel betrayed. I'm happy that Peter Falk returned to Columbo normally. <br /> <br />
