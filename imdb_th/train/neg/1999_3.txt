At the end of this chapter, Holmes asks Watson not to save the case for his children for good reason! The top detective left his small gray cell (sorry Agatha) at home for this. There is no reason for inference, there is no signal analysis at the scene of an acute incident. Holmes tumbled to fifty yards behind the most funky CAM plot, managed by a weak man in a manner that would make Charles Bronson's heart bulging with six proud bullets in the breadbasket to pursue. The follower holds one of Watson's shoes. Decided to freeze the story of Cinderella in order to extend the length of the movie. Killer Holmes and Watson escape from independence. Oh, it's a bit of a change of pace in the late Victorian era. London A bit of sixgun law :-)
