Because the 1988 Writers Guild of America hit them, so they had to shoot now in 3 days. It was quite shit, consisting of repetitive clips + paste from Season 2 and was described by writer Maurice Hurley as " "Terrible, terrible." <br /> <br /> Why did the producer not be able to shoot the right things that anyone knows? I guess because the production protests have been exhausted and can only be released later, or maybe Roddenberry is too sick at that time to be able to stop this half-kill. It is now the last appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) in the series.
