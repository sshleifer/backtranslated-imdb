I'm not a horror movie But my niece and nephew of my wife is So I saw the first movie. It's scary and stressful. But not my taste is still good for similar reasons. At this time, I am receiving a sequel. <br /> <br /> The evidence of myself is ridiculous. I can buy that disaster occurs in the desert. I can buy the available species. I can also buy that the event may be strange and strange until the army may decide to join. It's not possible. Yes. But I am willing to suspend my faith. <br /> <br /> However, in any situation, I am happy to believe that the military units assigned to survey the area will not be able to prevent it. Mutation As a member of the United States Army, I can assure you that while new recruits may lack knowledge and experience in fighting with the military, the military will integrate with a talented team. <br /> < br /> group of weapons The soldiers were not taken away by a few knives. That's just how it works. The movement of the team, the power of the fire is very superior, and of course the radio support will help ensure that nothing can be won. I'm not saying that you won't get hurt. But as soon as the area is confirmed as an enemy, military training will be more important than this, no one will go on their own, even using the bathroom. <br /> <br /> And if it is discovered that the area is full With enemies that cannot cope with danger And believe me, their radio will not stick if there is a chance that the normal radio will not do the team will have a military satellite phone Chances are that if they can't check in every hour, they will call the search. <br /> <br /> In order to accept this movie, you have to admit that our soldiers are stupid, incompetent, with a leader who is not Ability and Incompetent command line While it may be true that the most dangerous thing in the world is a lieutenant with a map and compass, our military forces are full of well-trained intelligent soldiers. Mutation with a knife is lower than our ability to deal with <br />. With the whole operation of the movie depends on the impossible to imagine. But we expect to believe that our soldiers, crew and pilots cannot handle the most serious threats. <br /> <br /> As a combat veteran
