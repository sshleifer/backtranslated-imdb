Christmas Girl (2004) Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Catherine O 'Hara, Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, Jennifer Morrison, Udo Kier, D: Mike Mitchell. His girlfriend has been abandoned. He didn't want to be left alone on Christmas, so he decided to return to his childhood home by defining an incomplete family that now lives and bribes them. A terrifying and one-dimensional performance by Affleck, who mainly acts with a flashy smile, makes his character fall out of the unbalanced mind's progression. Gandolfini and O 'Hara breathe of life Even a joke, its stupidity is somewhat subdued, there is no reason from one scene to another, and the sentimental message is fake, like the smiles of Affleck 91 minutes, rated PG-13 * Â½
