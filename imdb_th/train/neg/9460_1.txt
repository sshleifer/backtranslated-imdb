This movie makes me upset! When I miss the cat in the hat I am thinking of cats in the hat book. Do you know that a few years before parents read to their children? I think this movie will be like that! But what was very surprised for me was nothing like the book! Installed, it's like a funny movie for adults. In one part, the cat is talking to a gardening tool (hoe). The cat talks about it like it is a hoe. His car name, I am all, although not very good for children's movies. Under the rating, you will find: gentle humor and two participants I think this is humor for adults. I hope I can return this movie! Wal-Mart said that they will not do it because this film has been opened. If you are thinking of buying this thing, I suggest renting it before you buy.
