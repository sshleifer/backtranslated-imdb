This story is related to genealogy researchers (Mel Harris) who were hired by her aunt, Estee Lauder's cosmetic aunt. Her aunt (by marriage we were left to believe) was trying to find a lost family. Her in europe All they have to do is a picture of a girl standing next to a luxurious music box. The researchers headed to Europe and searched in places such as Milan, Budapest and Vienna. The scenery is real and shot at the actual location. (Unlike the murder, she wrote that Jessica should visit a remote location However, she found a young man who was searching to solve the mystery of his own family and they gathered to follow the clues and threaten the bad guys. Conversations, especially romantic conversations, are terrible. I watched this because of the scenery. But the script was so bad that I continued to see whether it was getting worse or not. It was done. The show was closed. I can see why Mel Harris's career had never been expelled after thirty years. But she is enough But the supporting players are directly out of the community theater I lost count of the number of times they said "Budapest". Bood-a-phesht We know, right? I know halfway that this movie must be one of those Harlequin movies and that's enough. Guess it all
