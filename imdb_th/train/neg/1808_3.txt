In the movie "Blow Up" in 1966, Antonioni asked the truth about his hero and the background of British youth protesters. By asking such questions with the structure of the hippie youth movement, Antonioni asked about the effectiveness of these organizations intentionally or not. How will you fight for what you think is true? On the other side, the film says that we must fight and challenge what we see precisely because others may deceive us with false images and false truths. Although the hippies are the most tacky part of the "bomb", they create a good texture and give more meaning to movies than they may have. It is a small movie that needs to be careful and mature. <br /> <br /> With "Zabriskie Point" Antonioni throws the ambiguity and subtleties of "Blow Up" and the hippies that are blown out. The result is a submerged movie with bad metaphors, stupid thoughts and heavy storytelling. Someone who, throughout his career, expressed such restraint and cleverness, made a foolish thing. <br /> <br /> The film debuted with a great set-up as we watched the group. Radicals that speak of the meaning of revolution Suddenly a man (Mark) got up and left. He hated his strength and ordered a revolution. He realized that even though the revolutionaries would fight for freedom But binding yourself to the cause of war is to give your freedom effectively. And just like Jack Nicholson in "The Passenger", Mark just wants to be free. <br /> <br /> Like that, Mark bought a gun and released solo. He received orders from nobody. When the police attacked Mark University, he shot a man and ran away. He then fled to a nearby airport, stole a small private plane and flew out into the desert. Antonioni treated the desert as a peaceful and utopian utopia with a brutal capitalist city with modern advertising signs and appliances. He saw that the desert was a garden of Eden. <br /> <br /> In the desert, Mark met Daria and fell in love quickly. Antonini therefore gives us a ridiculous sex scene in which hundreds of hippies have sex in the sand, free from the limitations of modern life. The earthy trees and the radicals of students can celebrate their individuality by <br /> <br /> The movie ends with Mark and Daria's death. House of wealthy capitalists who killed him It was Antonioni's challenge to his audience. Picked up a wooden gun and explosives Tear off the wall before they lock you up! <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie doesn't affect the audience. They remember that "Zabriskie Point" is just a self-centered commercial effort. Types of radical radicals identified <br /> <br /> In this movie, rather stupid, Antonioni says that if you are not happy with the modern world and the fat cat that exploits you, you should escape to the desert (Mark ) Or fight with the system (Daria). That's all good and good. But even if the artist reminds us of the dystopian nightmares all the time, but most of them can't show us how to deal with change effectively. As well as the ending of "Fight Club". Destruction and violence do not work at all. In the real world, social change tends to be motivated by humble inventors. I mean, women who have more freedom than contraception. <br /> <br /> 3/10 - Terrible movie. The problem is that Antonioni doesn't believe in rebellion. He was quiet and thoughtful. An introvert who seems to be making films outside of the story only to gain more popularity from the culture that turned his attention to the previous film "Bomb". Therefore, "Zabrinskie Point" is released as a movie that pretends to be pretentious and Foolishly, a 50-year-old man said, "Look at me. I'm a brave rebel!" <br /> <br /> There are many movies that viewers are encouraged to fight with "systems", but they all fall. Is one of the four categories In the first category, you have movies like "Network", "Cool Hand Luke", "Cuckoo's Nest" and "Spartacus". These things show that the life of an independent fighter ends in failure. But in each case "The spirit of revolution" is still alive. The message is that you can't make changes. But by death or failure, the optimistic thinking of the changes that survived suffering Essentially, we must continue to fail instead of giving up. <br /> <br /> Then you have movies like "Fight Club", "Zabriskie Point" and "Falling Down" which encourage you to explode. Tear it all down Blow it all up Everything is a lie, so you may go out to shoot a gun. These movies are caused by anger, feeling more retaliatory than any common sense. <br /> <br /> Then you have a category. "Flight instead of fighting" Terrence Malick and Antonioni are experts of this type. Movies like "The Passenger", "Red Desert" and "Badlands" show that humans run away from the world that they don't like and create a peaceful island or paradise for themselves. Both directors are pessimistic people that Malik destroys his island and Antonio Nini has an island that offers an unhappy feeling or exit. <br /> <br /> Then you have a category. The fourth movie of Donnersmarck's "The Lives of Others", Ashby's "Bound For Glory" and Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" preserves the artist as the power of change and revolt in these dystopian worlds, where everyone is satisfied. Satisfied to be a slave to the state, it is thought Creative and freedom of artists / criminals that control the system Just create a herd outside, you will create waves. Your important comments, actions and visions challenge the status quo. Donner Mark's movie has novelists and artists undermine Nazi Germany, while Kubrick has Alex as an artist / criminals fighting against the Nazis. Droogs painted the city with blood and sperm.
