Who in the right heart is doing stupid things like this movie. <br /> <br /> Unintentionally killing a security guard ... A two-dimensional character until two years old can draw it ... and Better ... <br /> <br /> Tool box of death? Please .... <br /> <br /> The weak gangsters who are hypnotized ... <br /> <br /> Acting from hell ... <br /> <br /> The rhetoric of this movie changed. Going between comedy movies, teen thriller, voyeur and ... female ... (Er) Rambo <br /> <br /> Unbelievable and insulting people who think. Don't watch, walk away. It's more terrifying than you imagine ... <br /> <br /> And above all, it is trying to be up-to-date by using excessive graphics in violence. .. <br /> <br> Mrs Montford: Shoot 'Em Up. Fun and funny. This is pathetic and terrible. Good luck next time :-(
