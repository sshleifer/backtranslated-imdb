After previewing, I felt that this movie would develop better than the fast and violent series. So I expected it to have a lack of story. But at least this time it will not be filled with powerless citizens and fart cans Unfortunately I was wrong If you can imagine that the movie Fast & Furious, which has a worse story, everything means that this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I've ever seen. No, I would not bring a baseball bat to the bean as others say. Not just a non-existent story. But the action is too crap as well. I guess the director thinks they can throw women and strange cars and call it movies. For example, there is one point in the movie that the man presses his nos and Lamborghini buttons and then flies into the air and flies through SLR McLaren to win and after Eddie Griffin fights with one of the "girls" His (Thomas comments will work in this case) The woman asked to pull out of the plane and of course they were doing in the middle of the desert. So I will see half of this evil This is the first movie I ever walked out. After that I had to stop to let the drink kill all my damaged brain cells. <br /> <br /> I give 1 because 0 is not an option. You should go to the local car show and stop at the boundary on the way home. I will let all the audience be in my prayers.
