I agree that my review is from the perspective of 2006, almost 30 years after the creation of this film and at the time of thinking that it might be a great horror / thriller. <br /> <br /> Beginning in the Halloween night of 1968, Michael, six years old, committed a brutal murder of his 18-year-old sister.

Cheers!
