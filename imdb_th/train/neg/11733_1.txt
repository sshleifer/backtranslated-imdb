I'm shocked that there are people who like this movie .. I saw it at the Tribeca and most viewers laughed in scenes that didn't mean funny. I feel bad because the actors are in the audience. But in essence, the story in this movie must be modified MAJOR .. but it does not make sense even the second time the character asks what it is The scene where they hopelessly stuck and find a way to make it ?? The ending just took the cake .. I will not break the beautiful conclusion .. but it is quite mixed together with the rest of the horrible plot / script ... Watch this movie to see Funny movies if you have to ..
