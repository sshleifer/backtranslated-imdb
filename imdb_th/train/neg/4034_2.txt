Oh, who loves good actors, but writing and using it directly is the art and intellectual writing and direct use of wisdom is a relatively minor task Even good comedy shows you have to make the right time and time. I didn't put it all down. There were some parts that I laughed loudly. But that is very little My main focus is a fast-paced dialogue that makes some people in the movie annoying. It may sound good while reading the script in your head. But going out and with the camera is a different task. And the operation of the mobile camera gives energy to some parts of the movie The overall direction is good. But the script is not my thing But I'm sure you are reading the script in your head. It sounds good. Sorry.
