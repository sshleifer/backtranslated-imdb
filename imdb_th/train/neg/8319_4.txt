Quite not impressive. 'Twisting' is all predictable if you've watched any movie in the last ten years and some interesting parts. (Which some people take advantage of the context in the decision-making context) with little and no punch 'Received the show before explaining these clues. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler, sorta) <br /> <br /> The performance is good. The story is not very interesting, all the evidence of 'still awakening' becomes null and void by something similar to star projection. (Not kidding) <br /> <br /> The surgery scene is quite tense at first. But it doesn't work. <br /> <br /> Not scary but not memorable. Terrence Howard's most interesting role to this day, as far as I have ever seen <br /> <br /> Overall boring
