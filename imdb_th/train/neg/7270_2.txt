I gave this loooooooooooong film to "2" because of the attractive actors and semi-sexy love scenes. Otherwise, if you can't read it like a speed reader, you won't have to go through subtitles that try to catch up with Spanish speaking! And what happens in the plot if you can't read the subtitles Gaze, unseen and stupid eyes and constant rejection Just boring after an hour or so Some good movies But there are some things that make you think your screen is gloomy. How do I not understand this? It's hard to talk about "acting" because the leading actors seem to be staring and watching each other with love when they don't push each other out. The character Geraldo was so attractive that it was hard to believe who would push him out. And what is his mother I didn't spend most of the time except that there were three men who seemed to have a history of each other .... but never thought who was "EX"
