I do not know this is a silent movie with subtitles. I'm not interested in silent movies - humor that is monotonous and the movies are flickering, etc. I'm sure the low scoring feature I set It's about Chapter 8 before I find interest in this subject and if I have popcorn, I might throw it on the screen. Maybe this will attract the sci-fi crowd? The only thing missing is the zombie scene and brain transplantation. I went with two other people on Friday night and had a total of 6 people in the entire theater. Isabella Rosselinni described this film - one fun aspect of the movie. No one commented how much they enjoyed this story and didn't like the unusual way of telling this story. I can't recommend this movie.
