Rachel, Hannah, Tina, Bradley and John are all top. They deserve an Oscar nomination for their performance. I'm a big fan of TV programs as well. Their music shook and all of them were very talented! I am also a good representative of SARCASM !!!!!! <br /> <br /> If you are a fan, don't read this !!!!! <br /> <br /> The performance is extremely weak. Terrible and the pulpit is not properly executed. (I feel sorry for the director) The jokes are incredibly terrible at the S Club fans. 8 small people who don't laugh. They think they can do better. And they do They conquer the world. They became S Club Juniors Paul "The ugly fat man who started the band mosh" thanks to his lucky star he left when he did. One of the worst movies ever created Watch out for this movie! Don't go and watch it! You don't laugh! You will CRY! 0/10 RJT
