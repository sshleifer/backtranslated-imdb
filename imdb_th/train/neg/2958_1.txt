This movie is surprising. It's more than bad I often gather with a group of friends and go to a movie shop to find scary movies to watch comedy. My friend suggested this. But when we watched, people started to leave I want to finish it so that I can say that I have But I can't do it. It's terrible. The main character is klutz, an annoying dinosaur and Whoopi Goldberg. I want to see the postman of Costener twelve times in a row rather than watching the film's fractions again I think they try to deal with some dinosaur discrimination issues. But part of the movie that really stands out is that the dinosaurs banged things all the time with his tail. It hurts. See if you are a self-punished person.
