Can I give this negative rating? No? Let me say that this is the most brutal movie I've ever tried. It was so painful. The Boringus Maximus plot (?) Was well hidden in many sub-levels of the nebulosity. I rented this movie with a friend and after about thirty minutes, hoping it would be better, we decided "Fast forward" to see if things will improve or not. It has never been better. This movie is about some friends who were kidnapped by these two women. Sounds interesting. But in reality it is boring Nothing interesting from the distance that had happened. If you ever have the opportunity to see this thing, do something you like yourself, try "Planning wine making from outside areas" instead
