This may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I do not see that this can be described as a horror movie or even a thriller? It's like a rotting drama. The scary music is great. But because there is no horrible situation, the director thinks it is a good idea to use it for everyday activities such as dropping or walking down the stairs This film has a lot of potential. They have beautiful movies (sp?) And interesting characters. But it seems that the writer assumed that you already knew them. They will receive strange activities without explanation or even clues to what they mean. This is just one movie that says about one thing and something completely different.
