Although I saw "Gymkata" in the cinema back in the year '85, I couldn't remember anything except the vague images of Kurt Thomas that ran and fought against the backdrop of the rock wall and disappointment about the ending. <br /> After reading other reviews, I took a copy of the newly released DVD to enter the world of Gymkata again. <br /> <br /> It seems like this is one of the movies created during the 80s. To go straight At the video today The famous acrobat star Kurt Thomas as Jonathan Cabot recruited from the blue to infiltrate the country "Parmistan" to come in and hope to win "The Game", a suicide who supports Khan's people by shouting that "Chamaree Power" The goal of the mission involves the Star Wars defense system. Jonathan is trained in martial arts by Princess Rubali who never spoke or left home. When trained, try to blend with the villagers by wearing a bright red sweater and blue and white dotted lines. Needless to say that Cabot found himself running and fighting for life on the rocky streets of Parma, while he was dating fate and games. <br /> <br /> Kurt stars Thomas, served by director Robert Clouse, seems to have never been in the series. The script is called just this side, incompetent. See other reviews for many shrillers. The city of madness has just a good time. But eventually being destroyed by bad editing. The ending ... There is still a good adventure action pathogen here. The Hong Kong version with more visceral movements and faster speeds may be quite good.
