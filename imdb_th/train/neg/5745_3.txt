This film is an award-winning film of the best short film of the year 1990. Over the past few weeks I have seen dozens of nominees and award recipients in the last 30 years. And I think this movie might be the worst of them all - but it's not just the nominees who have won !! I think 1989 would be a terrible year for this kind. <br /> <br /> This film shows a group of characters that look like Uncle Uncle. The most emaciated seems to be a simple, moving figure. Use animation to stop moving. All the same - with the same face, body and clothing. The only difference is that each person has a different number drawn on their backs. They are all standing on a large platform that is suspended as if in space. Each has a pole and they are also a box on the platform. The platform began to tilt slightly and respond to the movement of men in an attempt to balance the platform. This continues for the longest time. The only relief from this boredom was that when one of them behaved quite disgusting to the end But it is not enough to make the fun of watching as little as possible In addition to this short animation that stops moving, there is nothing interesting for me .... nothing <br /> <br /> Anyway, the shortest KNACK KNICK came out. In 1989 and I don't know why Not in the nomination It's very short and better than any nominee that year or the year before. Perhaps the success of Pixar in previous years resulted in their bias, but KNICK KNACK is very clever and funny. It seems that criminals almost ignore it. Did Pixar enter? Seems unlikely
