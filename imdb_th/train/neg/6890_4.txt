... except Jon Hader This guy keeps the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The story sounds fun. The 29-year-old lazy son (Heder) still lives with the widow (Keaton) who happens to meet a new love (Daniel). The lazy son is jealous and anxious to lose his comfortable life. He and tried to sabotage the relationship. He also met a young woman (Faris). <br /> <br /> I like Daniels' performances and especially Faris. But anyone who shows Hader is better than selling hot dogs at the beach. The performance of the header is annoying, which should be a good thing since he plays an annoying person. The problem is that he will be bad. The actor who will perform this role makes this man cute at the end. At the end, you also hope that you will be able to punch your face and feel uneasy about the end. In the future, every movie with this man will not be my story!
