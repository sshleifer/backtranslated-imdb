This will make me one of the worst things that vampires have ever had with men. How can we change the fascinating story into an interesting story? Obviously it is not a difficult task ... First of all, conditio sine qua, which is not vampirefilm, is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a good sexy touch. In the name of Christ / Judasan is about anything. <br /> <br /> Every time Dracula comes about, he is swallowed by light. (In the chapter that will make him weak There is only one scene that makes it worth looking at near the end of the movie. (Beautiful dance with Dracula and his new victory) I'm really happy with the first person. The twist of Judas is original. But this person is not good, not in any way Hopefully the third person will not like the vampires that I like in other classics such as Herzog's Nosferatu, Coppola's Dracula, or even interviews with vampires.
