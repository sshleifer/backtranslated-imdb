This movie has ordinary people, being lazy and without thinking, writing all over. If you are going to make thousands of vampire movies already, you should do a good job. I will be the first to say that this movie is not cut. Some horror / horror films fail to break the pattern of "Do something forbidden and abandoned for fun because the whole story is just a lie." This clichÃ© is sad, no difference, and like every horror movie when you turn to the road, there is no way back br /> <br /> and the ending? The hero performs the same function over and over again throughout the movie. But then they were mysteriously enveloped at that time and could not work in the end? The ending is an episode that is anti-climatic and spelling. Episode 3, which I will never see a terrible movie.
