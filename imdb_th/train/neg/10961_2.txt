Although this movie may be "real" with Lewis's book (In that chapter, it is generally a word-to-word), but cannot capture any greatness that may relate to this epic story. Legendary creatures (unicorns, centaurs, griffins, ghouls, ghosts) are * drawn * in and in previous checks, the green screen flight sequence is hard to swallow. I almost laughed and died when I saw a human beaver with a giant hard dress and flirting teeth. I almost cried when I heard wolves. "Howling -" The gray man in general is generally screaming and loud as he can. <br /> <br /> All the performances are especially forced. Very little of Lucy Penvensie ... I can only be offended, hopeless and canine teeth in fourteen hours of watching a movie. The actress who played the white witch in her history seems to be living more on the stage with a loud voice, arms and courageous efforts in some things Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> That scene makes you feel uncomfortable, whether the scene happens in the shade or outdoors. In the shade, as if the BBC was able to spend $ 100 on creating the set only, so it was very small and all the characters would be constantly combined. The White Witch Castle was an English castle in a dilapidated and full country. With a statue of foam and bad light when the child Penvensie is walking through the forest - really * any scene * in the forest - feels like they are circling in a circle <br /> <br /> The only thing that looks good In the picture This story is Aslan, but you can bet that the BBC may use the entire budget of the film to create a mechanical cat. It looks very good when standing still and before it starts talking. But when it starts to move, you will not be able to pity the poor who is the latter in the lion costume. <br /> <br /> Yes, if you are a Narnia hardcore fan, you may want to see this version just because of it. Preserving every word that Lewis had written - but Lewis was not a screenwriter and much more The conversation feels fat and uncomfortable when on the screen. While the children were at the beavers and prepared to escape from the wolves, the beavers never stopped. "Oh, another thing that I love, then we are ready to go". Space by the children singing together, sighing and wailing of "No, Mrs. Beaver, please!" - The scene of cartoon relief that is not compatible. (They should be cute from the imminent danger without wondering whether to sew a sewing machine). Cut out the drama that may have other scenes. In fact, this movie is full of faux directors like this. <br /> <br /> I recommend watching the new Narnia (Disney 2005), a new movie with new improved effects, anime computers. Great length, wonderful timing and gorgeous scenes and stealing the White Witch (who plays her role with the subtle evil of experienced politicians Of the greatness and beauty of the world of Narnia without distracting from the original vision of Lewis (I think) Lucy is more lovable. (No fangs, yes!) Like beavers. (And the actual size) and the BBC Edmonds who are very talented, nothing more than hopeless God - hungry for acceptance -an-Inferiority-Complex Edmund, which is a new version of Disney. <br /> <br /> If you're not the type of person who enjoys spending time creating fun movies, I won't recommend this movie to anyone.
