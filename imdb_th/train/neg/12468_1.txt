Easy to say: boring movies Ancient ideas are confirmed and the story never comes together. It seems that the director is not sure whether to create a movie or documentary. The main story is very thin (the CIA agent ordered to kill the oil prince, was arrested and warned the prince (why?)), So some elements were added to make the movie interesting. Therefore, the child dies, which results in the "natural" response of the father: advises the person responsible indirectly for the death of his son. The lawyer has drunk "friends" and takes him around. Some children became suicides and exploded. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've seen for a while. I am not entertained or intellectually challenged. I didn't laugh or cry. I didn't get understanding or I was forced to learn more or find the cause. It has no meaning for me, which in my eyes is the worst thing to say about movies.
