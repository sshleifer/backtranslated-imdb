I just watched F * @ # What is this? Steven STOP !! please! This movie is terrible and ridiculous. In the strange journey of action and adventure, now Seagal is fighting a creature that has a strong human level. OK? Oh, and their eyes blink in a brutal way? Wow! Although still in this film to suppress the Seagals, there must be a finisher and no one can kick the ego $ ego. He is stronger than them. However, all average humans are being crushed around him. Come on, I can understand the bully, the big mouth neighbor or the drug dealer. But these are strong men Oh and understand this. Seagal has to face short-term problems because he and his friends in the movie think that he is Wolverine! Oh, I go ... and worse than all! Yes, there is worse than that. He had even changed his voice in the middle sentence while we were looking at his face. Obviously there is nothing like him and I believe it may be one of the other actors in the movie. It is pure madness. Although I want to close it, I always watch movies for him to finish. This is a very low time, even for Stevens, directly to your great video! Great! Great! Two thumbs down! The quality of the Redemeption? I guess I will be fair in that area. At least some special effects are ok and I like the wardrobe options for actors and actors. Every woman is quite attractive. Still, and I said that STILL didn't compensate for the famous X-Men Underworld. (Insert your favorite zombie zombie movie here)! All directors, writers, and producers should be banned and deported from the movie business. I think I feel the way most people feel about Blood Rayne (and all other Uwe Boll pictures) about this movie. That's all my $ 1.00 in this movie. See how brave you are.
