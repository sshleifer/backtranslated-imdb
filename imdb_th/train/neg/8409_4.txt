Eddie Murphy for the best supporting actor ??? It's an insult to Alan Arkin and Djimon Hounsou. <br /> <br /> Jamie Fox (who can be shown) walks through this movie like zombies <br /> <br /> Beyonce ??? That is the show. <br /> <br /> This film is different compared to CHICAGO or about other musicals. <br /> <br /> If not for singing and acting at The best of Jennifer Hudson. I'll give ZERO this. <br /> <br /> And no, I never saw the stage. Broadway in general with rap Hollywood
