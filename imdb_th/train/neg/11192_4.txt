I'm not totally impressed with this movie. At first it was named Sin Eater and should be like that when considering what was said in the second half of the movie. I'm not even sure how the first 20 minutes of the movie relate to the rest of the story. It's very slow and what happens to the selection of Robocop (Peter Weller) is one of the main actors. That's a sad issue. <br /> <br /> All I want to say is to see if you are involved in Catholic religion. It will certainly fail after a few days and the words come out.
