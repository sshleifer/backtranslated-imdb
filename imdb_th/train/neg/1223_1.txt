It's a weekend. Two days ago I watched the first half of "War Games 2: Dead Code" now "when you go out" I am trying to decide one of the worst in terms of the pain in my heart while Look, I guess "while you go out" is worse. <br /> <br /> It's been said before in other comments: Unrealistic, irrational, etc. - The only thing I have to add is really. At some point Began to feel that he was more evil than women because I wanted to introduce her to Darwin awards if she really died (see only the first half I didn't know). Soon I was at Darwin's second prize. (If possible) for her great stupidity <br /> <br /> And Hey: Produced by Kim Basinger? So she not only But only knowing the script But still responsible for bringing this money to the people? I think human beings who waste a lot of money are evil because money may be used to give food and wear a few clothes instead of hurting 80 percent of people seen in the cinema and giving 20 percent of which is stupid. The opportunity to show that they are an idiot
