Let's come to pick up the real thing. The Knights of Christ, Ordo Templi or the Knights Templar, commonly referred to as nonexistent until the beginning of the 12th century. In addition, if you want to have a Templar in real life, why not try using the Knights of Christ still in Portugal. At least they should consider the history. The only quality of redemption I found in this film is that the artifacts look good enough to pass through the Middle Ages or the Gothic era. Bad performances, scary stories, horrible actions and props are ok.
