If you haven't seen the gong drama TV series, you won't like this movie too much, not knowing that the series makes this movie a great story. <br /> <br /> I give 5 out of 10 because Some things make it fun to help compensate for obvious problems. <br /> <br /> 1) It's a funny overview of the era. It was created in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 2) You get a cameo. Many jokes from people you have seen in the program. 3) It's interesting. A lot to see Chuck (the host) when he doesn't show TV personality. 4) You will see many strange people doing strange things like you see on TV. <br /> <br /> I will not list all the bad things because there are many of them, but this is the most outstanding example. <br /> <br /> 1) Gong Show movies have many TV clips that are bored with movie lengths 2) The story of the movie outside the segment The statistics are very weak and basically consists of a single plot 3) Chuck is a great actor halfway. But the rest of most actors follow the simple style of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie to watch when you don't. Half an hour, you want to see all at once, watch 20 minutes at a time, and it's not that bad. But even then it is not good as well;)
