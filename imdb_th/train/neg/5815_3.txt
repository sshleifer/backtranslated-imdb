I waited for this movie as an example and click on it. But after watching, I was very disappointed. Slum is an improbable movie that mixes with the reality of the Todd Solond family that disturbs the humor The story dragged and each scene was worse than the last. Maybe I miss this point. But if this movie is an example of the experience of every woman's growth, I'm glad to be a man.
