I like Geisha's record, so I read the book twice. It's one of the best books I read last year. I waited for this film and feared that reading this book would destroy the viewing pleasure of the movie. I didn't expect this movie to be so bad. The best part of this book is omitted from the movie and the weak character by Hatsumomo (Li Gong) is the worst. If I haven't read the book, this movie is confusing and inexplicable. The film's plot plot states that "Nitta Sayuri reveals how aggressive she is for her fishing ..." Does anyone see Sayuri becoming Nitta Sayuri? Forget movies and read books
