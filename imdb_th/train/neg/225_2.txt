Spoiler: Young couple Jed was kicked out by Kie (Andie McDowell) because she was wrong. Believing that Jed is having a relationship with one of her two girlfriends. Kate thought she could catch them. Kate threw Jed's shoes off the door. Jed reluctantly reluctantly sits in the middle of the road to wear shoes. Then he ran to the truck ("crushed" one of the names) and died. <br /> <br /> "Then he was scuttled by a truck." With this plot element? Until now, it was a funny movie that was intended to be a bubble. But there is no real bubble. Everyone, but Jade is annoying Then they killed Jed and everyone was sad to the end that they learned to love each other and give support instead of destroying me.
