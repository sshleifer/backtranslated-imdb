An incredibly scary story that I can hardly say. The best part of this film is when one of the murder victims appears at the end, alive and only good to be killed again. There is a chance that I will miss some important elements because I may be in a slight coma at the time this child is. The box in which the movie came to show scenes that were never even in the movie. I was tempted with the brutal image of torture, slavery and the promise of "Euro Trash, Sexy Horror Flick" I feel that this is an economical version and about a quarter of this movie goes out. Everything is too good to be possible. I have been filling PG-13, which makes sense of the end of the new movie 'Planet of the Apes'. See this with friends and bottles of difficult things. You will need it
