I can't imagine anyone wanting to try this movie for a million years. Not because it is one of the worst things ever done (not), but mostly because it's about 20 years old and not important. I tried to find out where I saw the actors before and this appeared. So yes, the kids stopped playing little leagues because he didn't like this nukes. Noting the important media attention and quick solutions in the Cold War ending. It's a fantasy to be sure. But one thing that is crushed will make John Lennon shy Since terrorism has replaced communism as a cult that makes hell afraid of us, this movie is not relevant at all, except when looking back at that time. Writing, acting and film work are not developed as well. The reason I gave the highest score I ever was was because I watched this movie about 50 times while I was 5-6 years old. There is also a small place in my heart for it. But now I know that it doesn't drop mustard. So if a lot of laws are true and eventually people decide to watch this movie, please realize that there is a much better way to spend your time. But worse than that (I will refrain from John Q. Damn now)
