Writer / Director Peter Greenaway takes his position as the head of the noble art gallery with his latest exercise in indulging himself in the formidable 8 Â½ woman. A wealthy Englishman and his son on a quest to find sexual satisfaction while they seduce and threaten women (Guess how many people) in joining the private group of concubines This evidence may be offensive and Greenaway's chances can be achieved. The female character is more than a catalog of amulets, so the two protagonists join. There is a Mio Kabuki that is obsessed with Giaconda and Beryl who are pregnant. Those who had things for the farm animals Giulietta without legs and used a wheelchair. "Half a woman", right? Greenaway is furiously angry, denying all the allegations of women. But if not, what would it be like? <br /> <br /> This film continues to inspire all things related to Japan - good cost. (But the disgusted women) Movie 1996, The Book Book, but The The Book Book is erotic and elegant. Women 8 just barely have him and take advantage. Greenaway's work is tacky and arrogant in superstition.
