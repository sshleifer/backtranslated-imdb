Full of good actors, I expect from "deceitful" more than ever The plot is highly planned and distorted. Many incidents caused confusion. The conviction flew out the window and the ending became completely unbearable and ridiculous. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes their movie plans, based on the least possible things to avoid "fraud" because you are very disappointed Maybe I don't have enough hips to get it. But my suspicion is that others are totally confused with the story and especially the ending. Blurry, the line between reality and lies is not effective because the whole movie is unreasonable - MERK
