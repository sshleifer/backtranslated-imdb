Dan Duryea, the great B-movie actor who has been a lot of noir in the 1940s, couldn't do much with this: a young man accused of killing a married singer When he was sentenced to death, his wife decided to fix the case with the help of the woman's husband. After opening the shot, flick quickly into the movie B formula. Of course, it looks good. But the manipulated twist has no color and the actors (including Peter Lorre and Broderick Crawford) are quite hard. Based on Cornell Woolrich's novel and passed a single examination. <br /> <br /> ** From ****
