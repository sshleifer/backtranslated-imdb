Director Fred Schepisi (Roxanne) directs good intentions. But the joke about Albert Einstein trying to ask his scientific granddaughter (Ryan) and ordinary man Tim Robbins to take her to rest for Ryan to like Robbins, Einstein tried to make Robbins look like a great scientist. That idea is cute But this movie does not make sense to the situation that is jolly and ridiculous. Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan and the best supporting actors trying their best to make this comedy float. But can't help this movie Unfortunately, many talents have begun to create a lackluster movie. I won't recommend anyone unless they are big fans of Meg Ryan.
