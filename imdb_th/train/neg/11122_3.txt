I will say this very much - this director is about RAW images ... what most of us are not ready to face Pictures of sex, suicide, murder and people who "Relieving yourself" has an impact on the audience continuously, which makes me wonder if the director tried to communicate the concept of relief or release Although I don't think I can watch this movie again But I will say that the director is watching There are some really good shots and "visual moments" in this movie (fans, fish wire in their hair) but the story makes me want more (Strictly since we were left to ask ourselves) Just saw? ") <br /> <br /> Note: If you tend to close your mouth or vomit easily ... don't see this movie.
