The film 'Gung Ho!': The story of the invasion of the Makin Island of Carlson, built in 1943 to see the virtues of Americans during World War II It shows in a better way that the cinema can be composed as propaganda content. The value of this movie is just a collection and without art. In the propaganda movie, it is useless to judge the direction and actors. Watch that movie if you're interested in learning how to propagate in a movie or if you enjoy Robert Mitchum, who has a small role in this movie. If you want to watch movies for World War II, they have a much better identity and purpose. I rate it 4/10.
