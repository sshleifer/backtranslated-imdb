Twin brothers separated from birth (Due to the death of the parents) gathered twenty-five years later to avenge their parents and bring the million-dollar tunnels back. Double Impact works for two hours and generally does not have any planning methods Of Corsican Brothers and Jean-Claude Van Damme, while sufficient because the evil twin brother is embarrassing as a good twin brother The action sequence is not exciting at this time, and Jean-Claude still needs to shoot more guns from his martial arts. Supporting actors are wasted and in two hours the movie is boring. <br /> <br /> * From 4 (not good)
