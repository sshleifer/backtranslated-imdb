The DVD is a joke. The sound of the first few minutes is terrible with the sound of sync and the sound of the Segals. Not even his !!!! pitiable! When the audio sync improves in about 5 minutes, the plot is not good, the line and the actors should get a new job because the movie business is not where it should be. <br /> <br /> While C Gal has good movies. The first day is funny and shameful for him and the company that created it. <br /> <br /> If Seagal is the one who handles this matter Because he doesn't have this ability all the time. <br /> <br /> This film is an embarrassing story for everyone involved in production and disgrace for everyone to see. I closed it for about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> I'll ask for a refund at Block Buster! Marked from Ontario, Canada
