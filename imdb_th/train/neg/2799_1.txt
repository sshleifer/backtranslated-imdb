Anyone who wrote the script for this film is not worthy of working in Hollywood. (Even though there) and those actors need to find a new job. The most horrible hour and some minutes of my life ... and I watched to see that it would be better, which is a shame for me. <br /> <br /> <br /> Even at the end, the credit is still Yes, I am concerned. I guess there are not many people behind this film, so they have to roll the credit slowly ... very slowly. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely a great guide. "Don't have to make a movie". Unfortunately, I can't give 0
