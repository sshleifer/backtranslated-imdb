It seems that Salvatores can't decide what to do with this movie: some stories are very weak thriller. (And I said very weak) some people try to explore the relationship between the main characters Both things have been tried with thriller psychology. But in this case, the movie can't keep things together because of bad scripts, superficiality, poor performances and movies that are too boring, too dark I can say that Salvatores gives the best results in other categories and in other places where he is free to watch the characters without thinking about the plot. In the movie overview, B is hardly worth your money ... Votes: 4/10
