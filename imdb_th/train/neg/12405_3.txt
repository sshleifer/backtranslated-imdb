Its a shame! I was there, sitting comfortably on a chair with a beer and a popcorn bag full of hope for another night of Muppet entertainment. I was disappointed! How can the Muppets go from the noble Christmas Carol? The humor is scary. The song is worse than Country and Western (and that's something to say) and the story is confusing and terrible. Like Blind Pew, I think the main problem is that they try to close Treasure Island too. Roll is perfect because you can weave the Muppet to jerk high around it ... here you have to drag the plot to stop the fun. Where will the fool go? Muppets Wizard of Oz?
