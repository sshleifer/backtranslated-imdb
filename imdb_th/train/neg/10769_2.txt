I found this thing on the shelf, while the house and how bored people will give this article 10 Not that it should be a redemption movie that feels good (I think) because it doesn't work at that level as well. Weak plan, bad conversation, horrible performance Nothing there. Harvey Keitel is great. But not working at all and Bridget Fonda and especially Johnathon Schaech are terrible. The progress of the plot (Especially the relationship between Byron and Ashley) is not reasonable It seems that the author wants to plot to go either way and make it without having to write in the necessary bits to keep it flowing. Only one and a half hours But that is 90 minutes in your life that you will never return.
