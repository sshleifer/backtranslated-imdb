"Tapeheads" The periodically funny scraps of the music video business may be the perfect short joke and actor John Cusack and Tim Robbins. They played two semi-understandable security cards in Los Angeles, which started the video company Ace, making hilarious videos for party groups and one star who died. It is terrible that filmmakers must devise a dim plan to support their work. (Shenanigan, who is associated with a corrupt politician and his party, who did not do much other than the main strength of the film, delivered the music culture of the late 80s). This: stupid but loose, clever roads without hipsters or posers. They are in the same wavelength range and they never make each other. They are real in the friend's comedies * 1/2 from ****
