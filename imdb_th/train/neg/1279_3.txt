There are three storytelling stories in this movie that seem to be shot without knowing that it is a short film. The manufacturer has a relationship with three short articles, which let them connect with Martin Kove, who is shrinking, even if you have never seen a leader with Kove. Who feared everything under the sun (she made Adrian the brave god) with paranoia in the evening at home alone You will literally shout at Vivian because doing something ridiculous. She spent most of the night showing her amazing qualities. But her movie is the worst, if not the most boring thing. <br /> <br /> The second short article is Bill Paxton, as he plays a roommate from hell. His mischievous roommate helps him to take full advantage of him and Bill does so whenever he can. <br /> <br /> The last article is funny because men fear that death will take He goes every time like a friend. That suffocates death with olives. <br /> <br /> Not very interesting because the overall movie seems to be shuffled with a little thought. A must have for fans of Bill Paxton
