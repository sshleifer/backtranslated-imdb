Today, Bea Arthur died, so I sailed around the IMDb website and caused a program called "Gloria". "All In The Family" was a great performance in the first four or five years and I thought That I watch every episode more than once However, I swear that I do not know that there is already a list of "Gloria" may be good. It may mean that I have a more mature life than watching television. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is pathetic that the "All In The Family" franchise has deteriorated so much. Show I have never heard - and one that has received very low scores by previous investigators. <br /> <br /> I rate item 1 for two reasons - the system doesn't allow me to register, not vote. And Writers and TV executives should be condemned when starting a program that doesn't have a broadcast business and makes the memory of one of the greatest programs in TV history. <br /> <br /> Chalom, ZWrite
