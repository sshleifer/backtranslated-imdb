"Friends" obviously have no taste or class. Suggest me to see Ron Atkins' work. If this is representative of his work, I don't want to see anything from him. It is an amateur, self-indulgent, low self, and criminals indulge themselves. "The mangler prostitute" of the title is an angry low-budget filmmaker that the murder of a bunch of hookers has a little nudity and some erection But there is no element that can save this from the executioner's snare. Scary light, nonsense dialog box and shouting mostly and innocent direction I saw documents about American filmmakers seeking benefits during the Fangoria meeting. Recently, Atkins was one of the highlights. He spoke like something important about his work. But after watching this, I didn't see any imports at all. There was no one style and awesome video effects. (Such as solarization) enhances expertise only Not bad. It's fun. Avoid.
