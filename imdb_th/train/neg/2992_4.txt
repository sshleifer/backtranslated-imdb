Next to the 1970s and 80s slasher movies, the movie about the walking dead seems to be the second most popular horror movie. While the slasher movie has 'Black Christmas' and 'Halloween' for the whole story to continue, the zombie film has the 'Dead' movie of George Romero and is not surprising after the success of his first two in Serie A. Other directors wanted cash. Many Italian directors paid special attention, such as Lucio Fulci who brought us 'Zombies' for one year. Known as 'Zombi' in Italy and other countries and is known as Fulci's movie, known as 'Zombi 2'. In addition to walking dead, it has no relation to Romero's movies. But it's a good movie in itself It was a great success in Europe, and 9 years later it happened. <br /> <br /> Pros: beautiful and lush scenery. Excellent score The performance is not good. But the actors are games and seems to enjoy the experience After starting slowly, the rhythm of the movement will move accordingly. There are lots of cheese and hilarious for bad movie lovers. Works well with makeup effects. A lot of blood and good blood. <br /> <br /> Cons: The plot is less true. There is nothing you have never seen before. Blatantly something came out of the first couple of 'Return of the Living Dead' characters. Age is not too good due to bad rock music. (Not that I'm saying that all rock music of that era is bad.) The clothes and the overall feeling of the movie. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: First of all, this is not a true sequel to classicism. Of Fulse In fact, I don't know what it means to get at this film. For those who do not know that Fulse was sick during production and ended with resignation and being replaced by Bruno Matte, Mattei's movie was quite ridiculous. But this movie has many fun things And that's all, this movie is just something to watch for fun. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5 (bad score, terrible) 2/5 (serious score)
