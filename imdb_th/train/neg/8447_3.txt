I don't know what I missed But I can't believe in these positive opinions of many people in this movie. I think it's ridiculous and unbeatable. I like the performances of Greg Henry and Michael Ruger, but others are boring ... <br /> <br /> Now I like the movie B, I really do. I see who? Some people compare humor and horror in this story to "Army Of Darkness" and "Shaun of the Dead" as well as "vs. The Re-Animator". You must be kidding. I did not find this movie funny. It tried. It was tried. (May be too much effort) but it fails By the time I was hit the third time or the fourth time, I rolled my eyes and checked my watch. <br /> <br /> There is definitely a respect for many other movies that are always cool. It's a joke for us at horror fans, but here it may lack the original idea. Acknowledged that there are some special special effects But cannot carry the whole movie The change became like Jabba the Hut and in the early stages of mutations - Chet from "Weird Science" (after he became a monster) and one of the alien creatures / children from "The Explorers". Work. I think it looks like something that some children from Art Class 5 can design. Then there was a female Brenda that was moisturized and chained in the barn. When the help finally arrived, she looked like a giant tick that appeared. The design is again totally meaningless. Round-shaped colored balloons that have a face in the middle * Yawn * <br /> <br /> Now about zombies - the more movies I see with zombies in them today, the more I want George A. Romero has a lot of patents and is the only author / director who has been licensed. Movies about them He was the only one who did it right, except Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg. (But that's a joke) Oh and Danny Boyle But they are different zombies style Perhaps Romero might have destroyed me with the zombie film due to his clever ability to make his actors moan and tremble as if their joints were dry and lacking even rheumatism. Caused by a violent death that began before they came back to life again. The people of "Wheelsy" did not have the proper motivation ... they were horrible zombies <br /> <br /> So finally, I gave "Slither" 3 for a few laughs and a few scenes that were good.
