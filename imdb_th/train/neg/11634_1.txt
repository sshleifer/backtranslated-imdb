I saw this movie at the Edmonton International Film Festival, with the great Dr. Uwe Boll joining. <br /> <br /> The film is easy to put on, very bad and doesn't live in Uwe Boll as usual. It's very fun. "But it's not good at all. Plot about a man that leads to a horrible life. (Because of the past criminal history, it seems that) could not find a job, and by cheating on a 900-pound terrifying wife Al Qaeda also has a design about stealing toys and the following things under sexual intercourse and violence that can not be understood in just two hours. <br /> <br /> The performance is bad. Much (Except for Dave Foley, who is truly trying). The joke never happened over a child who was shot in the chest slowly and the people went together. It should be words. But I'm not sure what <br /> <br /> think "Airplane!" But made by South Park creators and no jokes
