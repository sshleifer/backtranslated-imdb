Meet Peter Houseman, a rock star genetics professor at Virgina University. When he is not ballin 'in court, he blows his mind and puts his pants in his classroom. New cells can continuously make humans become immortal. I want to be immortal, too. If I look like Christian Bale and get the love of women that VU can only give. Classification of old and ugly university professors is not interested in popular houseman and funding for his project due to lack of results. This made Peter use himself as a guinea pig for his serum. Made me very surprised with the side effects and he received this change! Is embedded in our genetic DNA that has been suspended for millions of years He also added Dr. Mike's obsession with Sally after knowing her all day. She has a son His name is Tommy. He is an angry little child. <br /> <br /> The change is not a bad movie. Throughout the time I watched this, I couldn't get past the fact that it was filmed in 1989. The look and feel of this movie was in the late seventies. It didn't help it be packed with movies in the 1970s due to the Metamorphosis. Is part of the classic 50 songs of Milk Creek Entertainment In general, there is no difference in the quality of the movie. In the last five minutes, the movie is truly bad cheese. For me, at least it helped this movie from a lower rank. Pay attention to computer terms such as "cromosonic anomaly". It is not surprising that Peter's experiments failed. Your computer can't spell! This is something worth watching, followed by a trip to your local tavern.
