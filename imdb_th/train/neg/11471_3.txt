Is it a coincidence that the Orca was created after two years Jaws? Orca is not "Jaws rip off" but it is clearly trying to profit from the success of the Jaws. Orca, in my opinion, is a bad movie, not bad. But not the best average. <br /> <br /> The story is a male killer whale (orca) after seeing his partner and an unborn calf. Fishermen are killed by trying to get revenge. I can't wait to watch this movie again. The direction of this movie is terrible, and compared to Jaws, it seems that the director, the producer and the writer are almost incapacitated. <br /> <br /> For acting, it's normal and reliable. Not least satisfying That effect is okay right now, and the image of the killer whale looks quite good. <br /> <br /> Violence causes blood confusion and is not recommended for people who are more sensitive. The music is too loud and loud, causing the sound effects to be irritable and sometimes irritable. I hate the way they speak beyond the intelligence of killer whales. (Killer whales do not breed with only one friend that appears in Orca.) <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is bad / bad in my opinion because The reasons mentioned above Some people may appreciate this film more because of the concept of revenge among animals and humans, so I will not beat this movie and I can understand why some people like <br /> <br /> My score: 3.5 / 10 (but for the concept may be 5/10)
