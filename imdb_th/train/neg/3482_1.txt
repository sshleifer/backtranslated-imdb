So I know I voted 1 out of 10, but actually should not be more than half of the stars. I hate it. It's stupid and unrealistic. I can't believe that any star that signed in to create a ridiculous project This James G. and Cathrine O'Hara are great in their characters, and Ben Affleck and Christina Applegate are also good. But the story sucked and I advise everyone who sees this in a video store, not having to pick up and read the back cover, but to walk ... I don't even want to. To go into what the movie is about because it's too stupid to pontiff about <br /> <br /> don't rent this! It is scary! Horrifying!
