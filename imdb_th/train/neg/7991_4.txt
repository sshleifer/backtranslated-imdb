Coloring according to numbers and mediocre performances recorded by true colors - and a moment that is really wonderful and deeply felt. It captures the delicate changes of girls into adulthood and handles cultural conflicts that are the main family experiences <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film is locked in a pointless and great way. Complex plans that manage to include religious conflicts, conflicts with road construction projects, sexual life of secondary characters, and even tertiary, mysterious men living in forests, elite gangsters, at least three complex carnivals. Of local church politics and in and in and in And all this does not include the true center plot, which is only hope, dreams and disappointments of two girls (And the whole family) at the turning point of life, I was really shocked when I knew that all things should happen in the summer. (And a movie that is very successful in 1.5 hours!) <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie is about love, every plot The point is to anticipate important events in life that have changed and will be forgotten about 10 minutes later ... and some of those events are extremely disgusting. The most shocking truth is that one character deals with horrific crimes (in all "predictable" twists) and then is completely forgiven and all events are forgotten. Similarly, the second character was recommended to die only a few minutes later and gave another "twist". It was entirely entirely mechanically until the end that was completely linked to the end. (Not all, just what the movie thinks you're interested in)
