I know it will be But I give rent for some people laughing and maybe some fun, not interested Everyone who reads my comments, some people will see that I am an easy person to please. I do not think I will feel this negative Responsibility can? Is one with ?? Good dragon ?? Or something ?? I don't know. It's so stupid. I'm not interested in keeping it. <br /> <br /> It's a stupid story that is filled with ridiculous moments and ridiculous ideas. There are many random and sudden events. <br /> <br /> I think there is noise from the studio or something because the biggest problem I have with this movie is the fact that the story seems to be. So Great and great But everything happened quickly and quickly passed I felt like I had just been attacked with a plot and millions of action sequences. This movie is like a punch in the face. It doesn't take much time to create a character or drama. Imagine the ending "Lord of the Rings" in 90 minutes ?? You can have the most important battle sequence. But there will be no accumulation and you do not care about those battles That is the case of Dragon Wars. My 90 minutes didn't give nonsense. Wait for it to end. <br /> <br /> A wonderful CGI has some directors. But the acting is horrible. I might love it at the age of 6.
