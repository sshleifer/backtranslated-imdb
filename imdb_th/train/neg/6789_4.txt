The story of this movie hangs on one important point: this murderer is a responsible and loving father and caring person. Not that being a father and murderer is impossible. But this man showed that the killing of teenage girls without provocation or reason and without emotion This girl is someone's daughter. I do not think that the father who cares about his daughter very much, may be cold-blooded with other people's daughters. Or otherwise may be very cold and still worry and take care of his own daughter And the idea that the murderer will ask his parents to take care of his daughter beyond belief. <br /> <br /> That said I think that changing the color of Scott Bakula's eyes makes him look cold and more dangerous than he used to be. You can't look into his eyes.
