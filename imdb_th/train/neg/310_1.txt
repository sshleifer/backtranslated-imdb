I never heard this story from the movie Adam Sandler until I saw it on the wall at Blockbuster as a fan of Adam Sandler. Honestly, I can only see about 30 minutes of it. It's a terrible thing. Do whatever it takes to prevent this from falling into the hands of the public. I sincerely hope that this movie will go soon and I hope it will be like that!
