This mini-series, according to Alex Haley's book, as well as 'Queen', tries to use a similar formula: creating a long history based on the life of the family over the years. While the result of 'Queen' is good in Mama Flora, lacking inspiration May be the first time in their own books and most definitely in the production of this television program Too much was put into too much haste over the past several years, such as the unfolding fairy tale is shallow, shallow, almost unreal, like in the 'Queen' full score for the scenery in the previous part of the film which has been taken care Nicely But when the movie continues, it seems that it has deteriorated into the unpalatable ingredients of Dallas. I hope more; But clearly Haley was inspired by this story less than his near - 'Queen' biography and Peter Werner, the third was a competition for John Irman. Recommended only for those who have an appetite for these long-growing tales.
