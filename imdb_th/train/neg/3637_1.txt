I was amazed at the positive reviews for movies that no one cares about. <br /> <br /> Often with foreign movies, I skip reviews that complain about the slow pace and it seems. "Lack of action" due to many best international movies Live the life of Western Hollywood in film storytelling. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the expertise and lack of ancient ideas in the international film arena. I enjoy a lot of foreign movies that are not tied to a satisfying little bow. <br /> <br /> That said the film, especially without redemption, for the time that I wasted time watching. There is no meaningful character development, no curves, engaging stories, no way to relate to any character on the screen. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: People with emotional biases that Underage prejudice against their slaves and a little girl was hurt by her only friend when "Boy House" finally gets bored. <br /> <br /> While the above paragraphs are intense and amazing, this movie will make you bored while playing the scene. I am not independent, so it takes three times to finish and I will not even do it for a positive rating. <br /> <br /> If you do not have academic interest during At that time, I would strongly recommend this issue.
