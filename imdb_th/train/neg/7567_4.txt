Subject: Young-goon is a woman whose family has a history of mental illness She became a mental institution after she began to believe that in reality she was a robot. In an educational institution, she met Park Il-sun, a young man who developed a bond with her. <br /> <br /> If you are reading this, you probably already know what Chan-wook Park's abilities are. But ' I am Cyborg ... 'is a big, familiar story and strong territory (sad). I'm a big fan of any movie or story that tries to do different things. God knows that we all get enough shit at our local cinema. The main point about the movie that I have to say is that it can't say anything about mental illness or create a character that you're interested in. <br /> <br /> This story must be one of the most bizarre things that I am. I've seen it for many years, but weird, not enough. There is no heart for the movie ... just statics and confusion. The confusion seems to be the main theme of the movie. All characters try to understand their own problems. But it is Chanwook Park that proves that they are the most confused
