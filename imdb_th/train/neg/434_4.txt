His first claim, the desire to be an invention at all times, totally wrong. <br /> <br /> When Jehovah's Witnesses do not accept their own documentary in the movie? Or whatever, for that matter - it's time for everyone to get that Although far more intelligent than saying Paris Hilton (I know it's not too hard) Zizek's mouth throws as many baloney as her. He combines the worst things from the whole world. His work: psychoanalysis and philosophy. Both fields are famous for their comfort to the experts b * lls *** Many experts in creating the theory that can not prove the rant without the beginning or the end and to link random ideas in The process of making the English language wrong Confused only mother can love. Example: There are three main Marx brothers, so the "wonderful" idea of ​​connecting them to the human consciousness of three levels, id, ego and super-ego. I was very surprised. That he did not play clips from "Snowhite" and made comparisons between the seven dwarfs and the seven-level Gahannah (Hell Muslim). It's like Schumacher's location. "The Number 23": Play with numbers that are long enough and you can create <br /> <br /> There are many elements of the crocami theory that you want, even connecting the ancient Greeks with the death of the princess. <br /> <br /> However, there are entertainment elements for TPGTC: look sweaty, crazy, like a wild boar. While speaking of deceptive cheats because intellectual analysis is quite fun, why watch "Cuckoo's Nest" or other drama series when you have Zizek for more than 2 hours? It's like watching the carcass. Fun Admittedly, he was funny almost once or twice. <br /> <br /> I was surprised by those who tried hard to raise the level of filmmaking to be a noble intellectual science. Giving a stupid movie like "Birds" is something to think like this, so many credits may make the fat creator laugh in his grave. The raw truth is that most movies have zero intellectual value, and some wise things do not need to have a scholar who doesn't turn to use the map to understand them? If no one is a complete idiot, Zizek sees the layers and layers of meaning in the most repetitive movies. The hallucinogen must be popular and cheap in Slovenia today. <br /> <br /> When Zizek shows a shower hole in the shower scene, "Psycho", I think he will say something about Galaxy black hole The way in which they drain life from the stars, as well as the bath holes that suck Janet Leigh's blood Or maybe he could say that this hole is a representation of Leigh's vagina with blood flowing instead of a vagina (Eg in menstruation) This shows "Zizekian" irony. "Speaking like that, the real irony is if Hitchcock thinks much in every scene. (And the screenplay) His films are not irrational. The purpose of comparing these bathtub holes is to show how easy it is to talk about. "Deep hidden meaning" and when you add Zizek's fanciful vocabulary from philosophy and psychology, placing these terms on similarities, such as decorating a wedding cake, you will get chaos that can impress. To those who do not learn - such as easy and gullible impressions. <br /> <Zizek discusses funny things (Inadvertently) a number of here, one of the most ridiculous thoughts when he connects Anthony Perkins to clean the merciless bathroom too. "Job satisfaction. Don't laugh ... Both Hitchcock and the author of" Psycho "may never be entertained. Even this idea that Perkins might enjoy doing a good job - cleaning the toilet. Blood - While they are pregnant / directing the scene. Talk about putting words into the mouth (the dead) but in the context of what the director must interpret. "Say" <br /> <br /> I Liked the initial idea of ​​Zizek in the Solaris issue of Tar kovsky wonderful, but then he has To destroy the good impression by dragging in "anti-feminism" and other nonsense in his theory. <br /> <br /> Zizek's attitude towards logic is that the dog has its plastic bones. "I just want to play with it all day!" Logic has rules and should not be raped at least, not publicly disclosed by his likes. It seems that he considers logic, proof of common sense, and reasons for being an enemy. The idea to avoid twisting to fit the end goal or destroy Zizek is a hippie that LSD-tripped and all his favorite movies are his own personal movie "2001" <br /> <br /> The truth that That Zizek focuses on two very valuable directors Wisdom lacks, if any - such as Hitchcock and Lynch, just reducing his credibility I was surprised De Palma was not more prominent; That is another weak director who wrote an inappropriate script. Zizek has a day. Lynch's "Lost Highway" field cannot be understood. There are many interpretations of this movie, just as people are watching. Zizek's comments that the audience is ready to get von Trier is laughing. "Destruction" physical settings in "Dogville" I laugh. <Br / > <br /> But Zizek not only did things as he went, he was also very indulgent in "bleedin 'clearly" as well as "social scientist" (oxymoron). He wrapped the "observations" that were boring. As his (If filled with spitting) and blankets, sometimes complex language Ultimately, sociology works in the same way: allowing us to believe that we hear new things. In fact, it's something we all know. But told in a beautiful way - which the fool listens to those who do not care anymore. <br /> <br /> I expect half for a man in a white suit to appear immediately and expect him In the Loonie suit ... <br /> <br /> Slavoj Zizek: Soon the bugs in the children's park near you. <br /> <br /> http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Fedor8/150_worst_cases_of_nepotism/
