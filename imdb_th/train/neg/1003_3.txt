OK, I'm not Japanese. I know a little about Japanese culture and know less Japanese pop culture. Besides that, I am a Spanish person. I eat paella and I like black humor. <br /> <br /> Good with a set of points that I can comment on movies: I have no idea about how to enjoy Mamoru Oshii. Japan is a very good director, even though it is a post-modern style that is cocky in the form of Talking Head, and even though it is strange and interesting, and I was surprised that he caused this. It may be one of the cases that have been lost in translation. I am afraid that it is. But as a European audience watching movies with subtitles with too much English subtitles, I just thought it was scary. The jokes look bad. The script is overcooked - I mean, causing the audience to stop and close. The narrator you condemned a little - to the point that my head exploded over a fast and ridiculous speech. Br /> <br / > However, I think the animation is really great. The idea was great and it was well utilized in those animation scenes. However, the eye candy ended as soon as the character was left inside to begin with the words that were not funny. It makes you want to move forward quickly to the scene of the cut-out character. <br /> <br /> I read Mamoru Oshi that really planned the sequel. Of this That idea is good But was horribly exploited Perhaps the second part will bring the first part of this good movie to be an interesting movie, or maybe a more narrative scene, but if you think Headinghead has an amazing life density Fast food givers will definitely make you a stroke. <br /> <br /> Of course, all of these reviews are based on the experience of people in Europe. Probably because Japanese people are not useful at all, maybe it is a comedy that is missing in the culture and translation.
