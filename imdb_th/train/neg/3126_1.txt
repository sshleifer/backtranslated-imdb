Mr. VanHook takes good ideas and kicks like football. Unfortunately it didn't make the goal. The history of giants is good. But poured into the boiled milk, and then you see the giant wheel cheese I said to take this wheel and roll out of the cliff. I can't even watch all the movies. It speaks a lot because I don't go out of any movies. I always give them a chance to redeem at the last minute. It is impossible to exchange this bad thing. At least the performance is good .... No! <br /> <br /> The only thing that "falls" in this movie is the ranking 1/10 and sink in a negative number!
