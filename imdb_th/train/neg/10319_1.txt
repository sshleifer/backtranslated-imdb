Unlike many, I didn't find the evidence or theme of this item that was the least offensive. However, the operation of it is completely different. Like many B-minus movies, all good jokes seem to be connected to the example. For almost 22 minutes we sat waiting for expectations, any jokes, or at least something that would prevent confusion with the remote or counting of carpet fibers. With a few exceptions, the show was terrible. Some of the actors and comedies may be suitable for those who come late at night. But not the early sitcoms (even a Canadian), despite having a traditional cultural perspective, I can't help but think that this is CBC's wrong shot to repeat the success of Corner Gas. Too bad they have a tone and the script is completely wrong with the grassland. The last insult is that they do not seem to be able to work in a place that is actually happening in a small town (why - are they rare in Saskatchewan?). They think the audience will be fooled. As a proud Canadian, I hope that this will soon disappear and other parts of the world that are sponsored by CBC publishers will forget the enormous embarrassment of Comcom.
