Although many people here appreciate this movie, I have to warn you. There is no reason at all. I think Basinger works well in acting. But you can't be thrilled if there is a lack of realism Sat down and stared at the pictures she found from her bag This image came from her daughter and read that "We love mom" Who does that? What works? And believe me when I say that it is not as stupid as any other movie scenes. "Hidden gems" I have to disagree strongly. The film is still hiding for a reason. And it's not a gem Oh and please, I don't even want to comment on the red tool box. It hurts my brain: D Usually, lack of logic doesn't bother me if it's a small amount. But basically this movie can only be made because of lack of logic. But I still give 4 because although it is a shameful flaw in logic But there are some emotions that make me look to the end. <br /> <br /> So if you choose to watch this, you know that you have Be warned
