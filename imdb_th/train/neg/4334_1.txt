This film has the potential and I'm happy to try it. But there are many problems that are obvious - difficult to swallow, treated like an idiot. <br /> <br /> Rise to Power is located in the sixties. The end of Carlito's Way is located in the middle to late. Seventy decades For this film to be true, it must be held at the age of fifty, if not the forties. <br /> <br /> The rise of power without the sign of Pennelope Ann Miller has no symbol of Kleinfeld There is no sign of Rolando that Carlito predicted to run into his "hey-day". There is no main character in the original movie in this movie. We should believe that Carlito met all of these people in the last few years. <br /> <br /> The rise to power ended with Carlito walking down to the beach to talk about. Retirement in heaven, which is what he wants to do In the original film, in addition to the pre-quel created character Rocco and Earl - what should happen to them because they are not clear in the way of Carlito? It is also difficult to understand how Carlito can relate to the Italian people he has in the original movie. See the events of Rise to Power Taglialucci, where in this movie? There may be seven years between two movies and he takes five people in prison. It's like trying to plug a square into a round hole. <br /> <br /> Obviously, no one is interested in telling a good story and they are interested in making more money by creating an average gangster movie. And throw the character Carlito Brigante into the story This movie has a good time. But I think they should be better off leaving this movie to stand alone instead of trying to make it before Carlito's way. <br /> <br /> If you feel committed to watching This movie The only advice I can give is not to think that the movie is a linear prequel. Think of it like a spaghetti with the name of Clint Eastwood, which has no name. In other words, two movies that have the same characters. But not necessarily related
