I am a big fan of Miyazaki's work. I say "part" because most of his films are divided into two categories: excellent and boring. Sadly, this film falls into the category. <br /> <br /> The film has the same basic problems as Miyazaki's latest movie, "Howl's Moving Castle", but is reduced to a scene. A little behind for an inconspicuous event that will confuse the plot rather than explaining. <br /> <br /> The first third movie reveals the post-world of the fabulous story. are It actually seems very interesting story was about to launch. Then down the hill The middle part of the film mainly consists of eco-propaganda that is covered with thin fabric and the ending is heavily destroyed by believing in an irresistible spirit that destroys many Japanese anime movies. <br /> <br /> The overall picture of the movie feels as if someone has torn other pages from the script before forwarding it to the animator. What is left is an amazing sight. (Although the version I saw was tragic, a copy of the Nth version with bad colors - which caused the common myth that Nausicaa shows her naked butt while flying), but it is reasonable and Eventually causing me to be confused
