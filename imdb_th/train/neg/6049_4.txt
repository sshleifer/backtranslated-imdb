It is a sequel to a great movie that often makes it difficult to watch and b.) Directed by John Frankenhimer, one of the best American directors of all time, likes it. William Friendkin is the perfect person to direct the film about drug traffic in the rotten city of New York because his documentary is similar to the action and the story Frankenhimer. With one of the most stylish styles, such as "The Manchurian Candidate" and "Second" and with his "French Connection 2". It feels like someone is trying to have courage and no real understanding to pull it. come out The fact that Frankenhimer was chosen to direct the sequel by Gene Hackman himself, actually telling a lot about Hackman's understanding of original movies as well. It is well known that Hackman hates Friedkin in the scene and vows not to work with him again. It is well known that he imagines the character to be more dimensional, lose weight and try to play him like himself. Straight drama It shows you that Hackman, even a great actor But didn't know who would make the movie and it was a great story The plot of Doyle who became addicted is interesting. But it does not guarantee that other movies are the lowest point, unfortunately in Frankenhimer's film work
