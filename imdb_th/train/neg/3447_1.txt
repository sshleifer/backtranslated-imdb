This is one of the 5 worst movies I've ever seen. It is not scary or other things recommended in the plot plot. This movie is very slow and I am bored for almost 98 minutes while the performance is the best. But the biggest problem is that the script is poorly written, slow and full of true direction Sometimes creepy emotions are set to be destroyed by wires or useless events. I was not surprised that all the actors were sick and hurled during the match. As a big fan of good horror movies, I'm often frustrated that this bad thing happened. Help yourself. 98 minutes, you won't come back
