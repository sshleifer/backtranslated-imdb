Like wearing a hair shirt Absolutely positive, without a doubt, one of the worst movies ever. Truly tortured Zero from ten stars One of the long, boring scenes, tiring work and self-interest, theatrical and artistic style scenes Intend to be like a dream and impressionism <br /> <br /> Half naked, father and son, find each other like a lover. "Homo erotic" is a loud and clear point. OK. <br /> <br /> Repeat. Where the son is raised from "The life of the saint" "Father's love crucified, the son who loves himself to be crucified." Christ is parallel to God and his son is left-handed, irrelevant and joyful like everything here. <br /> <br / > Some people refer to the topic of gratitude of Russia: "Mother and Son" (1997); "Return" (Andrei Zvyagvatsev, 2003); "Little Odessa" (James Gray, 1994); Turgenev "Father and son"; And of course Dostoyevsky "Brothers Karamazov" <br /> <br /> Credits in English indicate the intended international distribution, which means that excuses cannot be used that you must be Russian to understand. <br /> <br /> <br /> The last thing that Sokurov is "Russian Ark" (2003) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Just like in Mother and Son "which is an equally powerful soptic Some scenes were filmed from distorted mirrors, though not very interesting. This film is almost independent, shooting from the beginning to the end through a beige filter, making it visible as if it were very numbing. The smoother, smoother focus will only increase the intoxicating feeling. <br /> <br /> The annoying murmur on never being closed like a loop. Old radio plays continuously as a background. Russia's romantic melancholy increases endlessly as "Tchaikovsky based theme". The presence of "Sound designer" (Sergei Moshkov) means, of course, that everyone is annoying, the little sound is constant, the radio sounds constant, the sound is distorted, and this is the "design" <br /> <br /> It's hard to Believe that someone (Sergei Potepolov) really wrote this It seems as if the traffic is arbitrary, as if done by a boring actor, freed from emptiness into nothingness. <br /> <br /> Modern art has finally succeeded in conveying meaning by That is not your own The idea of ​​an empty mind is a shell. But not the shell, just the idea of ​​the shell Who would ask for a better definition of degeneration?
