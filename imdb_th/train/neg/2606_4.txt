Drew Barrymore plays the Holly Goodman, who moves in with writer Patrick Hacksmith's Highsmith (George New Bern) and stops his life, claiming that "doppelganger" or evil twins <br /> stupid horror movies. This story is difficult to be serious, even if the creator and actor are dead. "Doppelganger" is confused with unsatisfactory conversations. <br /> <br /> Some viewers will know that the name of the character Drew is from the role of Audrey Hepburn in the episode "Breakfast at Tiffany "and the name of the character of Newbern, the name of the author Patricia Highsmith (actually he tried to write a new" breakfast "as a horror movie. Believe it or not!) <br /> <br /> I think it Deserve a lot of credit for not being Your general horror movie - I mean the writer / director Avi Nesher looks like he really cared for his character and made his film more plot than the standard standard fare. <br /> <br /> After The villain, the villain, explains everything to - the confrontation of the audience. This film has sent an awesome climax to the outside to believe. Of course, this movie will not fall on the wound. <br /> <br /> But hey! Pulling her mother to kill this time No, I am not kidding. Jaid Barrymore appeared near the beginning only to be slain violently. <br /> <br /> Drew is very watched and very sexy in this game. New Bern came out as a "good" good guy, but the top spot of the film would have been Sally Kellerman, a veteran veteran with a professional role in one scene as a former nun. Sex phone business (!!!!!!) <br /> <br /> This movie is rubbish. But quite amusing at a small level that is dirty and bad. <br /> <br /> 4/10
