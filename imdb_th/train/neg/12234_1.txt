I think it's useless to produce the second movie, "My Girl". "My Girl" is a very good movie. But it was ridiculous to create the second part of the movie, one of the main characters (Macaulay Culkin as Thomas J.). I wonder why some people are trying to find ways to make the story continue. That is unconscious!
