I don't like this movie a lot. If you read Puzo's books or at least watch the first two films closely (Especially the first movie) You will agree with me. <br /> <br /> Compare with Corleone's fairy tale presented by Puzo's novel. The script of this film is sometimes ridiculous. Characters and relationships among them are distorted. The story ends anywhere, even if it goes in the direction of the movie. <br /> <br /> It is understandable to expect different times for Corleone's fairy tale in the 90s and us. Will not Find out what they used to be before. But on the other hand, I don't know why they have to copy the dialogue from other movies in the context when they are not appropriate. Why is it like this It seems to be a badly created sequel that tries to imitate the original features of the movie. <br /> <br /> The thing that will never be understood is the fact that Mario Puzo, Coppola and Al Pacino work together to do this. The man who directed the piece like Apocalypse Now and Godfather must have forgiven almost everything he did in the theater until he died. Like Al Pacino, who is an actor he is, but Mario Puzo shouldn't write this. Why did he destroy all his previous work? It's a shame for my friends. The Puzo's novel The Last Don is a story of the 90's about a mob and it's a great story. We can't tell the same story with Godfather III.
