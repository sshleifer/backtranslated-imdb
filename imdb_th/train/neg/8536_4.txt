This is a typical production of Steele's novels in two people who have experienced some tragedies in order to be together even with the opportunity. I will not call it a spoiler because anyone who has read the novel Steele knows how they all ended.

Gilbert needs to stop making a movie that she needs to have an accent because she will, otherwise, be a good actress, can't pull out any accent. Brad Johnson, the great actor, is Matt, who Recovering from a nasty divorce He is gentle, polite and interesting in this role. <br /> <br /> The two meet at the beach through her daughter's phi and in the beginning, Ophelia accused Matt of being a child of abuse because he spoke art With the children. All of them became friends after this event and both fell in love. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the two is not good, although the ability of these two people is not in the idea of I question. They Making the best possible use of the plot is predictable and the script associated with stereotypical. Two people find the tragedy, the great tragedy, reveal the secret, the tragedy again. Then they come together. I hope it has more. But in a short period <br /> <br /> I want entertainment that is not interested and I get this In terms of the type of romantic movies, this story is not memorable. "A Secret Affair" and Janine Turner are superior. (Not Steele books) as with previous books of Steele that became movies
