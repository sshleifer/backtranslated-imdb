As a silent movie fan, I hope to see this picture for the first time. I'm quite disappointed. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, it looks like this movie will have a long length and is an advertisement for Maxwell cars. <br /> <br /> Maybe if the chase scene is About half the length, I might enjoy this movie more. But it's old, very fast And while I realized that the truth had been prolonged many times in the film without reducing the enjoyment of the audience with the Mexican bandits I mean, they're chasing a car through a mountain car that most of the time moves at a speed of about one mile per hour. But they can't run after it?
