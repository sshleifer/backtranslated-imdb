At first, most mice were big rats. But there are also connectors and giant chickens too However, this youngster is just a giant rat, a big rat and a little boy. This is a story about this growing child and a scientist trying to help him, so he accidentally created a big killer mouse ... You know how it is. This film has a killing and its moments. But I think it's close to the original. I just like the variety in my giant animal movie. That's not true ... I like "Empire of the Ants. All in the film is quite boring, although it has a rather strange event in the sequence of a truly strange dream. I can't recommend this one.
