I guess you have to give a rating for the courage to write a play about history lessons. <br /> <br /> Howard Desilva's cartoon show means stimulating the interest of a child. Any other disgust? <br /> <br /> Does William Daniels's contemporary style show (at that time) mean attracting visitors to the 1960s / 70s? <br /> <br /> Do we need "in-jokes" all about NY & NJ? (I can hear the Broadway audience with blonde hair on guffawing on the queue.) <br /> <br /> Sorry, I found all the parts that were boring.
