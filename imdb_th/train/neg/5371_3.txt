This film is quite disappointing. After a very slow start, violence (And full of blood) started the movie, began to lose The plot is too much, allowing too little time to explain and come out of the theater. I wonder what it is about. The characters are still superficial. The story is unbelievable. Most of them are Dejava's, without mimicking parody and there are some wonderful parts ... such as the young police have to dig up the bodies Of course it was the night and the rain and he had to do it alone ... yawn! Or the manifestation of evil as "Nazi" plus "genetic distortions" ... wow, it's real There are some good parts, such as smash scenes, mountain scenery and jokes (running) but (although Reno and Vincent Castle do what they can do), which is definitely not worth it (3 out of 10).
