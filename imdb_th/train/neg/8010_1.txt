I was very surprised with the positive comments because there were four of us who saw this in one show and we all walked out. We felt it was difficult to watch and couldn't watch the whole movie. And we try to stick to it Especially those in the group who want to like because of their personal experiences with sexual alienation in the school year that appears to dislike or specify too: (<br /> <br /> at Mentioned, it is a very good thing to see that this movie has a lot of people on the board and the commentator is the beauty of the personal art form of the movie :)
