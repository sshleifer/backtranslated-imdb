One miracle that makes this image happen: this plot is unbelievable if it's not a nonsense character. (Freaky police with experience with passionate younger people) are quite predictable. The ending is quite dark and impossible. But you have to have a terrible tendency for that. The idea that you have to read a book to fully understand what it is) and that performance is not good. The basic idea of ​​showing that French filmmakers can do the same as Americans in the genre with "Seven" and "Silence of the lambs"? If so, it is all failure. It's quite successful. (And has a cult status as the first French serial killer film) and seems to be a good product for strange exports.
