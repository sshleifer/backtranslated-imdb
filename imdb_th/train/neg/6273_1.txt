This is a lovely movie until the end. The ending is just another nasty attempt to make men power and make women more costly. The girl refuses to listen to reason and reason and uses her aggressive / aggressive nature to control and determine her needs with the person who ultimately gives her power and control over her relationship. It was not the chance that she would sit behind the driver's steering wheel in the car as they drove out at the end after he had asked and asked her to bring him back. This movie is a victory for all women who think they should take care of all men and control their relationship with them. It's a nasty movie for that reason.
