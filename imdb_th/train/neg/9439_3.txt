The twist ending may look cool in the movie. It is especially interesting when twisting in front of our eyes. But we just don't care Those twisting ends are what make people think. So then we have a thread like this movie. Twist on whether you are interested or not, you don't know what will happen. When they reveal this random twist instead of shocking, it is a surprising reaction. This movie started out as though it was an interesting horror movie. But after about 20 minutes, it was nothing but boring conversations and twists. <br /> <br /> Three young women are going to a concert. Lost his way in the forest and hit a tree trunk They ended up at the house of an ugly old woman who hated men and they were greeted by her warm daughter Marion. (Laurel Manson) Strange behavior occurs when these girls are at this house for many days instead of trying to leave the house or go home and the vigilance creeps in silently. /> This film has dialogue too. And it will always be between a few characters We have three main women, an eerie young woman and an old woman, and important conversations do not go beyond these five. To make matters worse, they never say anything interesting. In fact, it's quite annoying to talk. We want to know what has happened and they just talk and talk. (Not related to anything) <br /> <br /> The plot of the plot is abundant here. These women are in the car accident when they are clearly three miles away from anywhere ... Wow, three miles! Walk two hours or less to kill them. Why don't they go to sit with workers in this house that drive into the city? Does he have one seat? Why are these girls not out of the question and just being willing to barely check? Why does this have to have many dumb twists? Perhaps the answer may be in a boring script. <br /> <br /> Having a slasher film with five characters is a really bad idea. It's not exciting, it's not scary and the ending is definitely coming out. But it's stupid, undoubtedly. <br /> <br /> My score: * 1/2 from **** 79 minutes. R for nudity and violence.
