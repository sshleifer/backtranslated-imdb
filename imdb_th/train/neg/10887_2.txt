...... This movie is quite scary. The only thing that made me stop No. 1 was the fact that I was unlucky to see worse. <br /> <br /> Scary wild demon music style. UV glows blood / teeth / eyes. Look at "scary" and scary scripts ..... This movie is like a test to see how long you can stay before giving up. It is also predictable. But not a good way There is nothing that this movie does in a good way. I watched it 10 minutes ago and thought I would be a little rant. (Oh and the performance didn't allow the film to get worse too)
