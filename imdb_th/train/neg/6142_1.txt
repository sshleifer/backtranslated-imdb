Gymkata is one of the worst movies ever created. But not a bad movie This is really scary. It's fun to watch and laugh. Kurt Thomas clearly doesn't have a rich career in acting He should go back to gymnastics. But who will forget the memorable scenes, such as the tall bar with chalk, horse rock, Pomeranian I don't think it will be so bad. But who can tell It's not art But if you want something soft and soft to make a good conversation Make the evening of fun
