I don't know where to start. This film feels like being one of the cheap kids on Saturday morning, showing that they were created in the late eighties, sort of like a power captain or Power Rangers. It's full. Bad digital overlays and sounds "Secret agency" and villains. <br /> <br /> The performance is so bad that it's not funny. The direction is terrible and now there is very little continuity. It seems like someone has thrown the scene together and forget that there should be a plan. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this movie before. Explosive device in the car agent For some reason even though the device is clearly identified as "Igniting from a distance" but the villain decides to chase her on a motorcycle while she drives away. This chase continues. While there are bad people, make the bike laugh and pointless completely. Standing up on a motorcycle, doing wheelies and so on. At one point, an error occurred and one of the attackers was thrown out of his bike. We saw the bike (clear, cgi) thrown at the agent car. But the driver has disappeared Then, a few seconds later, the driver and the bike returned ... without injury from the crash. At this point, even though the car has a bomb device But the attacker chose to shoot the agent while driving past and explode her car. Which can be done clearly with cgi. Doesn't it seem confusing? It is like that and the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I may point out that when I say cgi, we are not talking about the Lord of the Rings cgi type. Here we are talking about Power. Rangers, cheap cees type. Actually, I think it's better to do in Power Rangers. <br /> <br /> Why Savini and Todd made this movie, I never knew. For money for the benefit of someone or because they were blackmailed ... may be the last
