This application Buck Me! No humor and too serious to be called "fun"! It's a study that is too far for my liking! The characters are stereotyped and not very interesting. Redundant plot and morality repeated over and over again Where is the fun in it? In addition, I feel that this thing is on the BBC for too long and is too broadcast. Is it necessary to have a channel for T.V every 2 or 3 months when the newest item is out? I think it's time for the BBC to begin bringing back their old performances, such as Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, The Smurfs, Snorks, Moomins, Raccoons and Count Duckula. BBC that brought Danger Mouse back and what happened to that! 3/10
