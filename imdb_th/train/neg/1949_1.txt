The animation seems to be finished in 30 seconds and looks like a cartoon rather than a character. I am a big fan of Scooby Doo. Since the premiere of the series in 1969, I have not missed much of the Scooby Doo animation film (I'm talking about the TV series, not the full movie) but some of them are quite cool. And I like most people who find that Scrappy Doo is irritating But this series is pure garbage As soon as I saw the animation and heard the characters In addition, Mystery Inc. is a team, and if there is no team at all, watching each other, it seems to open a box of chocolates to find someone who has eaten the best. And the only thing left is something that no one wants. There is nothing new. Scooby Doo is better if you are going to have the Scooby Doo TV series and the elements that make the series lasting. All actors of characters and quality animations They need to bring this one back under the rock from where it came.
