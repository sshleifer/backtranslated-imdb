I used to watch "eyes" before I watched this. I like "The eye". It was really one of the best horror movies in Asia recently. So I chose "Bangkok haunted" because it was a director. The same person and it is popular in this round But human things are disappointing ... "Haunted in Bangkok" is about three stories about love, revenge, ghosts, etc. that are not terrifying, not even disturbing. I can't fill the 10 lines needed for comments ... <br /> <br /> 100% boring <br /> <br /> * My rate: 2/10
