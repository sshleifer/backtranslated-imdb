Aaron Spelling created this to create a movie that is about seventy-three minutes long. It plays like an improbable series of pilots. <br /> <br /> The handsome Clint Walk is the US Marshal Dave Harmon, who walks in Yuma, Arizona. To kill a brother The route for driving <br /> <br /> Walker takes another brother to prison. Walker also met a "cute" homeless Mexican boy who slept in prison. One night, Andres is taking a nap when the villain and another man wears a dark blue dress, takes the remaining brother to the street and kills him. Not good for your first twenty-four hour job. Walker visited the army fortress and ranked the chain of commanders. The big parrot heard the death of his brother and rode back to the city in time to keep his chain in good position. Local indigenous population in which the army changed from beef in a short time and was ranked in the chain area With all these networks being rated, Walker still has time to seek local hotel owners. The men in the army involved in the murder have ended. Local bull buyers are involved. Indians say hesitantly and the number of people causing the tournament is unlikely to happen because Walker must prove to the city. That a bad cow buyer has a boss Some people that we suspect are too useful. <br /> <br /> There are sub-plans related to the death of Walker's family in the hands of the invading army and I think this will be powerful. Behind The series was picked up. But the film ended abruptly and I watched the scene from the exciting episode next week. Due to the absence of a commercial break, the spacing ends where this story and its story are fit together. <br /> <br /> Walker is a handsome, strong and The sound is deeper than the pond. The remaining actors are full of television actors that you may have seen in other TV movies. Most actions are rather lame and violent. The first brother who was killed received a shotgun blasting midtorso and fell without scratching him. I didn't expect "Reservoir Dogs" but this is the wrong movie to teach children about the evil of guns! Speaking of Mexican children from here, "cute" to "anxious way" quickly. <br /> <br /> If you don't like western people, you won't like "Yuma" if You like western people, you still don't like "Yuma". I can't recommend. <br /> <br /> This is not rated. But with physical violence and gun violence. <br /> <br />
