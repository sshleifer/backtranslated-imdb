Many lead characters in Hideo Kosha's movie in 1969, "Hitokiri" (manslayer; aka "Tenchu" - the punishment of heaven) is a real historical figure (in the form of the Western name Okada, ____ Anenokoji, the name "Hitokiri", is a historical term referring to the group of four swords that assassinated many important people in the trial of Tokugawa governor in the mid 1800s under the command of Takechi, the leader of Phakdi "(ie ultra-nationalist, pro-Empe ror) What is the battle of the Tosa tribe? Sad to say, you won't find it in this movie, "Brilliant History Lesson" of course! <br /> <br /> No, Gosha is interested in showing you normal slicing and bleeding. (In a ridiculous term) the inner torture of the killer Izo Okada than in revealing the true history For example, Sakamoto is a historically important person, considered the father of the nearest Imperial Japanese Navy Gosha, to make a history lesson, the scene in which Sakamoto, Takechi, considered as a traitor to the loyalist, was brought to Takechi's mansion. To try to convince him in ideology He started by talking about the international political situation with foreign warships in Japanese and Japanese ports that were too weak to protect them. Want to know more? Sorry, Gosha cut this interesting lecture into the very central sentence (!) For informing his audience about the turning point in Japanese history. <br /> <br /> Movie This made me very confused about the goals of both sides in this fight. For two and a half centuries, the Shogunate held central authority in Japan, an institution dedicated to preventing social change in order to maintain the feudal relationship of society. It is a fear of external contamination in both ideology and technology. In order to maintain this spirit, it has illegal firearms that are the tools of "Leveling" in Europe and America where farmers can stand up to the samurai Throughout this period, the emperor was nothing more than a body of soul. <br /> <br /> But in a city that stands in a neutral zone between feudal feudalism, elite merchants, landlords and new craftsmen are developing - - Classes that are known in Europe by the French name that the middle class Inevitably, since this new class has gained strength, it has been opposed to many feudal societies. Like in Europe, the king (emperor) became an important person in the struggle for the power of the elite in the feudal system. But political leaders do not always understand the interests of the class that is serving When the outside world came to bang in 1853 in the form of the "black ship" of Admiral Perry of the United States, the Japanese ruling class was thrown into crisis. Their soldiers do not match for these foreigners. They have heard about the catastrophe that British and French imperialism are lamenting in China. What should Japan do to protect themselves from the fate of weak neighbors? Surprisingly, some elements of Shogun Nate tend to be inclined to open trade with foreigners to receive their advanced technology. This is the view (almost) shown in the movie by Sakamoto. On the other hand, the emperor, a loyal dictator who represents Takechi, believes that they can protect foreigners by force if only But they can protect other parties from "selling the country" (sounds familiar?). Therefore, Shogun Nate's important assassination is in order - and we go together. <br /> <br /> Takeshi's inspiration is the biggest puzzle of this movie. For me, Gosha shows that he is fighting for his personal progress primarily instead of being loyal. Can we do this to be a representative of all supporters? (Are you interested?) <br /> <br /> Many critics compared this movie to "Goyokin", which Gosha did in the same year, but "Ko Yokin" is a crack, suspense, yarn adventure with Valuable heroes of sympathy "Hitokiri" are stubborn, no nearby places of interest and lack of heroes like this. Sakamoto may be the hero of this movie. But we are not allowed to know him - or what he means - good enough for him to achieve that status. <br /> <br /> In view of his excellent score for the previous five movies of Kurosawa Masaru Sato's score here is very disappointing. Looks like something was rejected from the episode "Bonanza" <br /> <br /> Barry Freed
