Swayze didn't make Alan Quatermain very reliable. Compare with Stewart Granger; Which grew into my best hero in movies such as 1952 "Scaramouche", 1952 "Prisoner of Zenda" and 1950 "King Solomon's Mines"; Patrick Swayze failed to complete even the image of Alan Quatermain, which is older than Sean Connery in the "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen", very good in a big failure. Alison sucks and lacks the grace of Deborah Kerr in the role of a female lead, and the last one is Siriaque. The impressive role of Umbopa makes it difficult for everyone to wear shoes. For someone who was disappointed with the version of Richard Chamberlain in 1985, now I highly recommend it if you can't get a better version.
