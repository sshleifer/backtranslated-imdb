Egyptian movies have many movies with high-level plays or romance or comedy or even sports action ... "Ziab la Ta'Kohl AL lam" was banned in Egypt because of the nudity content. (Nude pictures, full forehead) and this kind of nudity was banned in Egyptian movies .. when I watched this movie I felt bad ... stupid .. nude actress .. bad action .. some colors Horror and scary .. Dear friends .. If you want to see Egyptian movies ... just: stay away from the form "Ziab la Ta'Kohl AL lam" .. We have great movies in Egypt ... we have great actors who have won world-class awards such as: Omar El Sheriff or Gameel Rateb .. We have great directors like "Yousef Shahin". So believe me .. You don't need to watch this movie ..
