I work as a hotel receptionist in Washington DC and listen to my words. Nothing is right about the characters played by Michael J. Fox - # 1. We don't walk around with our purse full. With theater tickets and $ 100 tickets! # 2 If I let anyone use the room for a period of time 'Afternoon happiness' I will be fired immediately! The organization that I own (Les Clefs d'Or) has an ethical and practical standard that we take seriously He and forwarded to other employees - we received those keys and it was a symbol of honor and knowledge that would have allowed them to wear. And process participants to join our organization <br /> <br /> This film does nothing to eliminate the perception that unfortunately the concierge because nothing but mercenaries mercenaries. In the short term, it is damaging to our organization. I welcome any comments.
