I disagree with any Dharma in the Left Behind series. However, I found that the book is interesting and I read 8 out of 12 of them. Undeniably good writing and interesting stories. However, I didn't expect much for this movie. Hollywood doesn't have a way to bring Christian series to produce movies with high budgets. So it was done independently ... and it felt like I was watching a very long TV program. It didn't feel like a movie at all. It didn't have "experience" that movie. If anyone knew what I was talking about. Therefore, the movie has to suffer. For this reason, the inexpensive effects are another annoyance for me. <br /> <br /> More than that, I feel Gordon Kerry. Is a monster Reading my impressions about North Carolina is that he should be a charming, attractive, attractive and handsome person who speaks English, almost without a trace of accent. So I imagined that there was someone like Pierce Brosnan in the role, but they found the Aiken clay pencil neck that looked like a month's employee from Best Buy and gave a terrible fake accent. That made me lose a few stars there. The movie is unbelievable when the big villain doesn't look or listen as it should be. <br /> <br /> The performance is ok. But nothing to write to the house, some scenes - such as one scene (Can't remember which scene) - is a real partition for me. And some Christian rock songs or anything that really happened outside of the scene. In some scenes, just as Kirk Cameron prayed in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> In short, it's not. Bad movie But it didn't do for me Next to the book of people, it is much better
