Style but without substance, not as funny as it should be Not as deep as it wants. <br /> <br /> This is another type of movie about the difficulty of making movies. A young filmmaker was hired to make a 60th sci-fi movie called Codename: Dragonfly. Think Barbarella or Danger Diabolique. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Davies is a filmmaker who gets pain. He doesn't hack him as an artist. The movie he wants to make is a diary of life. <br /> <br /> All the characters outside of the filmmaker Jeremy Davies are as thin as rice paper. Interesting characters such as his father, goalkeeper or Jason Schwarzmann, as the hacking director, were presented and shown the door without adding anything. <br /> This movie is full. With eye candy, but when compared to other movies about filmmakers such as Stardust Memories or 8 1/2, it looks pale compared to These movies are funny and inspiring with well-developed characters. Those movies have lessons that are used outside. <br /> <br /> Movies like to be cartoons and camps. But it is something that has been adapted and there is no funny scene The filmmakers explained that it was an attachment. But what is their goal? The actor said that it was a show of respect. But I think I want to be a full-length version of the Codename: Dragonfly. <br /> <br /> Coppola has a lot of fun from the scenes that appeared in the sci-fi movie. Inside the movie But he failed to share why we had to be amused. <br /> <br /> Outside the sci-fi movie, it's a mess. There was a continuous error, the filmmakers chose sci-fi weapons after being chosen. <br /> <br /> Just because he had a scene, the filmmakers faced a critic who complained about the lack of stories. At one point, the scene in which he accepts empty intelligence does not mean that he speaks. Those criticisms <br /> <br /> I guess your Roman Coppola, you can escape with making a movie about an ideal filmmaker who doesn't like anyone, doesn't know what he wants to say and ends. By saying something In that sense, it may be considered as an autobiography. <br /> <br /> I will look at Circuit City on a wall full of TV. If I have the option to watch Codename 15 minutes: The Dragonfly movie included on the DVD is Special, then returned
