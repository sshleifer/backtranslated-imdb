Lady in Cement - PI spoof with ole Blue EyesFrank Sinatra is a shamus on the houseboat in Miami in this "funny", less-humorous joke, distracted by the annoying and annoying Hugo Montenegro score. A little too unusual to be on a TV created for the TV movie status. Dan Blocker is performing in the big galoot role of Mike Mazurski / Ted De Corsia and Raquel Welch should thank her personal trainer, the only thing that makes DVD worth Treatment or viewing is Collection of magical trailers for Welch flicks such as Bandolero, Fantastic Voyage, Mother, Jugs & Speed ​​and Myra Breckinridge. Even if you get DVD-skip the projected movie and go to the sample library in a special feature. There is also a mysoginistic Sinatra lisps @ homosexual owner of the local Go-Go bar. The memorial must be put back in the D time capsule.
