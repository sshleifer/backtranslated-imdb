This is a new low level entertainment. Although there are a lot of worse movies, <br /> <br /> In the Gangster / Drug scene, it's hard to have a credible story. (This film doesn't. I mean, Sebastian's inspiration isn't over. Far from boredom and lamentation), then you must have a set of relationships of believable characters (This movie can't be) <br /> <br /> Sure, Tristan is pulled out of his family. What was the agreement with his father again that he had to ask for permission to leave according to his age? Interesting images, even if asked about the lack and need of rebellious behavior of children in the aristocratic family But this movie doesn't go in this direction. Even if there is a possible judgment from the Backflashes randomly, he doesn't get down and then go out. Why did he do it again? <br /> <br /> So there are interesting questions going on here for the critics of social drama. (But again, this movie is not only focused on "cool" production techniques and special techniques that are not provided. The character is a moment to ponder and most important, forcing the story to follow the path that they need and not paying attention to letting the story breathe out and develop naturally. <br /> <br /> It wants to be a drama. Not glorifying substance use and violence (It is not politically correct today, right?) But on the other hand, it is nothing more than a cheap action movie. (Like a lot of people) On average, the actors and Vinnie Jones managed to not destroy the rest of his reputation by doing what he always does. <br /> <br /> So, in all I .. just Just ... can't recommend. <Br /> <br /> 1 for Vinnie and 2 for editing
