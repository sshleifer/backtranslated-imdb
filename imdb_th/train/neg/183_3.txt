This is the action of the West, James Steart, starring every actor in the beautiful northwest, which was filmed in great beauty. Great scenery and costumes With action and adventure Stewart plays as a wealthy cowboy working in a government winding in the old Nothwest. <br /> <br /> The main drawback is the cynicism that Hollywood has always been a hero. Even when the film was created, Konik was a hero, a stereotypical and a steward, with very cute poems. He is kind to his partner and that makes him a more reliable and pleasing dimension. <br /> <br /> However, he is very strange for others. It's hard to really care about him or accept. He is like a spaghetti, a one-dimensional character in the west. (Not that bad) <br /> <br /> Still, the secondary characters are still fun. Walter Brennan, Royal Giordano, Harry Morgan and others make it look attractive.
