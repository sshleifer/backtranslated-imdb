I am a good person and I like to think of myself as a kind person. And I guess by that I mean, I try to consider movies in the context of the genre, if nothing else helps me from feeling like I should say something really nasty about people or movies that I don't Like to do <br /> <br /> The plot in this way is clearly clear that the production cost is very low and is set to be simple. "Good for playing high school" from time to time. My feeling is filming in one day - please tell me it. <br /> <br /> The worst of all sex, while fairly modest, is fairly obstructed by at least in my copy. "Overload" that is inconsistent with action (Moans and climates moan while lying on the bed to release the bra). Of course, there is no "edge" at all. - There is nothing outstanding or interesting and surprisingly fast cutting. My vote is "1" and then with the following summary statement: It gets better if the body material pulls the dancers at the club, extends and the rest of the movie is shortened.
