No one should try to adjust the Tom Robbins book into the screen while the film is good and the performance is good. The dialogue that works well is read out in shit when speaking. Or to say in other words, no one should suggest that hearing the names of others like seeing it written in radium on pearls. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film feels like a cliff that is badly adapted. Note for books - most parts are hacked into one fifth of the book size in terms of past and present stories and the ending is very different from the book. Most plans from the book disappear, including things that make everything reasonable at the end and have more than one reference that is reasonable in the book that makes the viewer say "Um?" Is not a worthy attempt. The script should read and compare with the book that was burned and all the actors sent to do something better. I admire Gus Van Sant very much, but there are not even people who are capable. He can make a movie that's as sophisticated as this book without staging.
