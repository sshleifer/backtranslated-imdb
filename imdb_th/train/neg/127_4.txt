I rented me purely - yellow from my video store due to all the disputes surrounding it when it was first launched in 1967. I heard that at first it was confiscated by US customs if it tried to enter this country. One of the fans of the movie considered "controversial". I had to see it myself. <br /> <br /> The story is centered on the Swedish drama student, Lena, who wants to learn everything she can about. Life In particular, she wants to focus her attention on making some documentaries about what the average Swede thinks about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and competition issues in the United States. While asking politicians and those living in Stockholm about their opinions about politics, she had sex with the drama teacher, classmates and married men. <br /> <br /> What I killed me About Me The past is considered pornographic. Actually, the sex scenes and nudity are not too many and far apart, so it was not shot like the porn that was made. While my fellow countrymen felt that it was shocking But in reality, sex and nudity are important in Swedish movies. Even Ingmar Bergman, which is their answer to John Ford, an old man who has sex scenes in his movies. <br /> <br /> I would like to compliment the filmmakers who showed. Saw that there was no sexual intercourse, not just to shock people and make money to show in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW It's a good movie for anyone who wants to learn about meat and potatoes. But actually this movie has a lot of stories
