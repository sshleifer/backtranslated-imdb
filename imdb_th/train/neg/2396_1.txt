Just saw this movie on TV and I have to admit I was a little surprised that it still exists. There are a lot of stupid people, busy and badly edited that the old episodes of Sesame Street should be better. The performance is ok. But please, you can feel the feeling "Go straight to the video". The actor / team created this movie to be a bad drama. Yes, there is a message in the movie. But wait until ten minutes before the last episode is heard Believe me, you won't tell the difference.
