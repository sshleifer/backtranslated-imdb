The warning spoiler <br /> <br /> When the main character's sister is pushed down the stairs, the killer will stop a glass of vodka next to her, so it looks like she is drinking. But before she was killed, told her sister's business partner (Teri Garr) on the phone that she didn't drink for 4 days, but the police never mentioned the results of toxicology reports! And the character talks about her being drunk when she falls down the stairs? A really bad mistake in this movie, which is quite bad. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly bad considering the excellent actor. Some mistakes: Writing is not very good, the music for the TV is not good and there is no tension at all because we know the answer to the puzzle in the first scene of the movie.
