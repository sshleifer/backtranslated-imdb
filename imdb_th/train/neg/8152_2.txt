"Don't drink water" is an incredibly incredible movie. It is based on the 1966 Broadway play by Woody Allen. It is the star of Jackie Gleason, the cartoon genius behind "Honeymoon". Director Howard Morris appeared in many comedies. Of Mel Brooks (Life Stinks, High Anxiety, Silent Movie) and mark in animation (The character he voiced is Gophers from "Pooh" Jughead (Archie). What's wrong? <br /> <br /> I think the problem is that the place is too difficult to work effectively Allen's original play is the use of the tongue in the cheek, which is the reason why it works for Broadway and in 1994, Allen's remake. The screenplay by R.S. Allen and Harvey Bullock wins the evidence until death and makes too many changes from the original play. Giving Glyeson's wife the air of this generation when she is a traditional, unstoppable woman is just one example of the cause that doesn't work. <br /> <br /> The performance isn't much better. Gleason does good things. The most he can do with the content But he cannot record this Gleeson is a comedian. But still a good actor as he performed in "The Hustler" and "Soldier in the Rain". His polished personality may work here. But the flea script doesn't give him a very bad chance. Estelle Parsons' cock wife will drive you after 20 minutes. See if you have to strangle her soon. That is a shame because she is also a great actor by changing. Show two specials in "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Rachel Rachel" do not have other actors as well. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen hates this movie so much that he remade this movie. Again in 1994 for himself and Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson), the leaders they dealt with all the correct notes and the movie itself is a comic masterpiece. Eventually it was in the video after a long battle for rights. Go out to find that version The original 1969 all is good for eliminating unwanted guests that are beyond the time of <br /> <br /> 1/2 * from 4 stars.
