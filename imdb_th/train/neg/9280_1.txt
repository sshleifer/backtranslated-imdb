Honestly, I don't know what fun, horrific remake, or comments on this board. The masterpiece review has my tears. It's very funny. However, this movie is one of the worst movies ever. The name "Omen" on the title made me stop and watch this morning on HBO. There are many classic bad times. But my favorite is the fire guy from the magician !! good time ! This film has an Omen series, "Scary Movie". What is the whole movie? Avoid if you are looking for a good laugh.
