Other scientists were shocked because it was clear that they were behind Was arrested and pants The rest of the story is like THE THING or ten Little Indians, where the team is hunted and killed as they try to determine how to escape and / or defeat the "dragon" creature. CGI Dragon is a dark gray color that looks like Is a popular color for most cheap CGI effects It doesn't look much better than cartoons and dark gray tones, making it difficult to see interesting details in the dragon's body.
