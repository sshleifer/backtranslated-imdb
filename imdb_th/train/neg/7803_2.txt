"Secretary" is one of those wonderful magicians. "Excited" that one must be watched on Sunday afternoon when nothing is left. While plotting (A woman with dementia becomes a person who is jealous of everyone who succeeds in the office and decides to do everything she can to stop them). The same reason. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, I didn't get angry about the characters. Mel Harris is one of the actresses that appeared in many television movies, including "mother" or "victim", a type of improper play or insulting. In this regard, she received the pleasure of playing mother and victim of secretary Sheila Kelly, who was not a good choice as a villain. While Sheila Kelly has a good career (Singles break and I guess the laws and regulations) She is also surrounded by the role of a pathetic television movie and this is added for others. <br /> <br /> This will play in the network for life. (I think that's what I see), but don't not have to watch it until you get tired of words too. Not that it will make you excited anymore ...
