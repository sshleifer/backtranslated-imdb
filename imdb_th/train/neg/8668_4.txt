I never read Bradbury's novel that this movie is based on what I gathered. It will be interesting. (When I finally read it and I will) my opinion will depend on the whole movie. As soon as I saw the trailer, I knew I had to see it and was very excited. But when I was finally disappointed, it hurt a lot. Because this movie feels that he is not an expert The actors were not well selected (although Robards and Pryce are both good actors - not here). It seems that the child actors are asked to appear to receive the characters' clothes, say along the lines and make faces The scenes and props are cheap and unrealistic. That direction is surprisingly bad. I am very surprised at the horrors of it that I have to go online and check who is directing just to see the type of work he does. The corrections are cut and pasted and the plot (movie script) is like that too. (Although the author is involved in his own irony?) The tension, fear and suspicion were not as severe as the ultimate climax. <br /> <br /> I read some comments about it. With this film. The most painful thing is that the content is interesting and fun and interesting. It has a lot of potential. Unfortunately, this film has terrible techniques that require the intelligence of the story.
