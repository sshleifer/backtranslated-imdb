I've seen all kinds of "Hamlet" <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh is the most ambitious person. Mel Melson is fast and to the point. Laurence Olivier is the best. But now we come to the song Maximilian Schell on Bard. <br /> <br /> For this one is a version that has been dubbed by the famous German television program of William Shakespeare's chestnut. More and more ideas are drowsy and there are worse scenes somewhere that must be implemented at the primary level. <br /> <br /> When seeing MST3K, help with the mic and robot used. jabs are good The story of the old boy penetrating the depths of Shakespeare's black and white TV and the wisdom (?) Of German, playing English and making it seem like Ingmar Bergman refused. Is MST the best riff line? "I will release Great Dane", "I don't think so," The Living "", "Meet the Beatles", "Hey, your father will help me with my science project" and my personal favorite in Party - "Keillor Battalion is going to Germany (YAAAY !!)" <br /> <br /> But then there is Schell, playing Shakespeare's greatest character like a model puppet in a department store. product No doubt he is a great actor. But here he came back with Paul Newman in "The Silver Chalice". Have you ever seen GOTTA see these two things on the bill twice? <br /> In the end, here is an example. That you should read this book better At least this book was not dubbed by Ricardo Montalban. <br /> <br /> This one star for "Hamlet" only; Ten natural stars for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> The Prince of Goodnight, the sweetest prince.
