Interesting to read the opinions of the audience about the Omega code ... Many overwhelming positive comments were raised almost by the words from the broadcast TBN ... The movie looks like it was created to go. Still direct videos to keep apart from the three-set rapture made by other religious groups in the 70s .. Can't remember? You won't remember this in a year or two. This is the first movie I have seen before, which implies that it is your religious duty to go and buy as many tickets as possible to save lives ... very shameful .. . This just shows that if you are The son of a television program, you can play a high level Hollywood producer with women money ...
