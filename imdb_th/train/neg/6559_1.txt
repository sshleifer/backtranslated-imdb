My girlfriend chose this one. As South Africans born and raised in African Americans, I found the story of this film and evidence without credibility. Believing that class and racial prejudices will be easily and comfortably suspended from someone who is not completely familiar with Antibelum in the south Totally ridiculous !!! I wonder if they have good actors such as Harvey Keitel and good actors like Andie McDowell (those in the south know better) join in this shit.
