I thank you for one thing and only one thing - that this woman will be thousands of miles away on a completely different continent !!! Yeah !!! This list can be perfectly concluded that Victoria Beckham is passionate about being herself and her family to promote themselves and 'Brand f * cking Beckham'. <br /> <br /> A few years Past me I used to like 'Posh and Becks'. I really admired David's ability. But I didn't respect him anymore You will respect the person who has his wife's hand pushing his back to work like a man. <br /> <br /> It's clear that Victoria's hand is more than Beckham's early departure from Manchester. United and now too Happened at Real Madrid I hope Beckham can live with the fact that even though he earns a pound - he sells spirits to American Buck and will end the day he plays for a team that will fight for promotion from One division in England - but where baseball and basketball you rule - football, you can't! <br /> <br /> Next - I'm talking about. For many years I have seen an entirely exaggerated and wonderful performance from 'Posh' - this is a show on the red carpet during her performance of the precious red carpet after the fall of Rebecca Loos. Throwing all the pitch * p at David he deserves, trying to stick to his arm like trying to save her partner with a million pounds. <br /> <br /> This PR performance is pathetic. Why didn't she go there quietly supporting her husband through the biggest mistake in his career and causing her to despise? How much she started to have her own feelings that she felt that moving to America should be wrapped up with this big fan value? <br /> <br /> Incidentally, I saw David Beckham's documentary last night. At least he still has grace and humility. Two things that his wife can do by learning <br /> <br /> Another thing in Victoria - you complain about being paps forever. A little hint - stop tipping about the address. You who are stupid women <br /> <br /> Good luck in America !!
