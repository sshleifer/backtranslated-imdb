I'm sure that deep in Jack Black's channel, the mind of Nacho Libre's character is absolutely hilarious. But no, it's not. You can tell the ol jacks that there are whales once, play as a fluid Mexican priest and have a dream of becoming a wrestler. But this movie is a misunderstanding in every department. Just sitting there through the movie, most thought "This should be funny" and "Is this the guy from Tenacious D?" The truth is that this movie has nothing to offer at all! It's a scary script with crappy characters and acting and guiding. You will see endless events that you think some funny things are going to happen. But it didn't get me bored for about 10 minutes, but it couldn't be better. 90 minutes later, I could hardly stop aneurism. It was so painful. <br /> <br /> Remember many years. First, when you see something with your favorite actor there Breakfast since before they are famous and you have to be really embarrassed to say that the actors have many problems. Yes, it is like that. <br /> <br /> I've had fun with Jack Black's previous movies, such as Shallow Hall, and I'm looking forward to seeing Pick of Destiny really. If you do this again with us. Once Jack, I have to go there and smash your knee bones or something. At least let the conversation seriously with you. <br /> <br /> I know it's an ancient idea. But this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and for many reasons ....
