You should be better if you plan to sit through a gentle and pokey amateurs about a middle-aged widow who has a relationship with a young adult or teenage daughter younger than she wants. Located in Tunis, mothers waddle around the flat, accepting anger and deciding despite hesitation. (She can't help herself) to wear a dress and dance in a local cabaret. While her daughter is studying dance The common denominator is the Tunisian drummer. This movie is full of fillers. I watched DVDs at x2 and read the subtitles, fast forwarded through ordinary dance and loooong photography (they walk everywhere) and walked more. Flicking this low and boring budget, which makes viewers get good reviews. Think (C-)
