The closing song of Johnny Rivers is the only thing that is great about this movie. Unfortunately, it's a good thing that I can talk about this farang movie. I have to write another 8 lines to make my comments posted but there are more than 8 scary lines in this west. I'm not sure if this movie is a tribute to Hopa Along or just pretend. The hero and villain in this movie is too plastic. Not true at all Many supporting actors in this film look realistic. But the scene of the filming was funny The previous reviewer thought that this movie was excellent and in the comments was shot at President Bush. This is not democracy or western republic. It's just a bad western movie that is sold commercially. I wonder if it can make money Sometimes I think I'm watching a movie created by a college movie student. If so, it was a great movie.
