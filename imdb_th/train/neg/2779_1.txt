Obviously when you offer enough money for what they will do I'm not sure how much John Rys-Daves has received. But most of the money he made should go to his fans to apologize, even involving ROTTEN movies. The special technique is worse. The effects of the 1950s B movie and the rest of the actors are worse Go down again For children, acting is not as good as I thought. The English language is very focused and I think that no one can really speak English. They just remember that the words should be sounded instead of memorizing the script and trying to make their characters both.
