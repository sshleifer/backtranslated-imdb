Like most comments, I saw this movie under the name of The Witching, a new title. Obviously, the original Necromancy is better. But I doubt it. <br /> <br /> Most of the witches' scenes still include most necromancy scenes, and these things are still not good in many ways. I think adding a nude image of a witch at least increases. Entertainment value! But don't be fooled - there are only 3 scenes with nudity and belonging to the people standing around. <br /> <br /> This movie is really bad. It's hard to know what to criticize first. The conversation was scary and straight out of the Troma locker. At least Troma used the tongue as a cheek. This is the boredom that must be faced. The performance is a variant with Pamela Franklin (Flora, the boy who is obsessed with The Innocents. You will believe!) The worst thing with her high pitched scream. It seems that Wales is waiting for his pay check. Other female actors have creepy faces, so I don't know why Pamela thinks she will trust her in this movie! And the doctor is quite bad too In addition, he still seems unbelievably Gene Wilder. <br /> <br /> It was filmed improperly for scenes that changed without reason. This is because the witch is copying and pasting, not a delicate task. Only the light is ok. The sound is scary and difficult to hear with a shocking new soundtrack that has never been shut down. The mother of the 'ghost' is equally rubbish, but the actress is not as good as the fun that serves at least it. <br /> <br /> Actually, this movie has a lot of fans who are unconscious because it can't be caught and I find it really boring! <br /> <br /> The best bit is when accumulating credit - enough to say better than bad excuses for LIKE THE PLAGUE!
