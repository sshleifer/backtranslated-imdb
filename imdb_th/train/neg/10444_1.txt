The only thing that is great about the movie is its name. In this case, "Snake On a Plane" is an example of not judging a book from a book cover, not about a movie When I go to the theater, I do not expect Citizen Kane. I expect Independence Day, a fun popcorn movie. But it turns out that I received the horrible Roy Liotta movie called "Turbulence" Yes, this is a bad thing. The only thing that makes SOAP better is its name. And it is not an interesting name for movies But it is not a "snake" or "plane", just 40 minutes in the movie! It's a false advertisement! If it is not in the name SOAP, it will be another Grade B cheap summer movie that is memorable. And scoring R? It must be the most unrelated rating movie of all time! The filmmakers add just a few words to make this an arc. All violence is preserved at the pg-13 level. Do you know what the R score is? The superstars who have scored R! Meet him at Summerslam instead of losing money with a snake!
