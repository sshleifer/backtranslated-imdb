The attractions that come to "The Order" make it seem to be a good mystery / thriller thriller. But what we get is a plot that has the potential to be a great thing. Before closing the movie, all of it consists of scary conversations and the great special effects of God. The show wasn't so proud, but Keath Ledger (I thought I was spelled correctly) recorded a movie in this category. <br /> <br /> For heaven's sake: Don't see this movie!
