This is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen ... Unfortunately I am a horror movie and will rent any horror movies unless it is done for When looking at the box, it says it has been rated R for some gore and language ... Where is it? Is a good death scene, one scene where you see the blood? I might overlook that if there are short nudity or good conversations There isn't even a single line that has wit or humor from this movie. Sometimes horror movies are scary because they are very stupid. But it was sad
