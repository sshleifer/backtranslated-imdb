There are rumors that when NASA's technical adviser in this film was asked to maintain the image he believed, they laughed for hours. Ultimately, if you are a politician or a working / shuttle bus crew, you won't get in the shuttle. In addition, the space camp (Cadet) in Alabama is not Florida. <br /> <br /> The truth is that everyone on the planet will receive a multi-billion dollar prize before the events that appear in the movie. This will happen. This film is meant for children and must be written by one because they are not aware of the many restrictions and requirements regarding access to KSC / CCAFS. <br /> <br /> This is the most useless movie of all. Time and it is a failure that deserves good
