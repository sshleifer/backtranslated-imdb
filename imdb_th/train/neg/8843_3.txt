This movie is absolutely creepy. Unfortunately, not because of the reason the filmmakers hope to have <br /> <br /> have the same killer who is also good. He is just your standard comic villain. The combination between Hannibal Lecter and Freddie Kruger, although nothing new will be added. In addition, for those who commit the most crimes and crimes, can they be confined to the stress position by walking armrests, stretching their arms out 24 hours a week in a week? I think that in the world where Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay are all possible, <br /> <br /> No, the creepy thing about this movie is the main character, Danny. This attractive young man has been helped and supported by the fact that strict safety arrangements and doctors do not care about the ethical thoughts or the confidentiality of all patients walking into the hospital room. That was taken by what can be described as Women and on the basis of anything (Her chronic sleep makes it impossible to give anything, such as informed consent). Imagine yourself having a special relationship with you. <br /> <br /> Looks like in a few days. Claiming himself to kidnap her by believing that (Pretending that we discovered) that he can take care of her better than others and within a few minutes after taking her back to his apartment Again, due to her sleepiness) can not consent to or resist. <br /> <br /> Our suspicions of why he felt that this connection was confirmed soon. Of course, he was unable to create an adult friendship, either as a sexual relationship, so instead of returning to a woman who looked like a child, because of her permanent sleep, the mental age was consistent. With a few years of life experience. The scene in which she discovered the ice cream was doing a special act and the educator knew that she gave him when he looked greedily. He will have to clean her again, causing terrible fear. But again, I'm afraid it's not a horror story that filmmakers hope for. But it is a very offensive matter for hate We can all clearly see what's on our fork here - it's the perfect dream of innocence, innocence, sexual intercourse and supreme dependence. Scary, scary, scary. <br /> <br /> What else do we have to solve this mistake? Distorted dreams are not as good as Del Toro. "You have to go to the police." The argument that the leading characters often have is the reason not to do so, even if it is the right approach. The automaton sequence is very admirable in the comments here, although it is completely pointless and perfect. ("It doesn't do any duty!" Due to Sigourney Weaver, a memorable protest in the Galaxy Quest) and looking at me like Phibes, a disgusting derivative. <br /> <br /> Jeffrey Combs is doing well. The most, even if it is that star and a few things, because you have to lower the rating of movies that are worse than this, and in general it's good - shoot and act efficiently
