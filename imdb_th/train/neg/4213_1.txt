Wow, I'm a Henry VIII fan / Tudor. And this is .... interesting. The only thing I watched is the Catherine of Aragon one and wow ... just wow I've seen. Bad performances before But now reaches a new peak When the actress who played the role of Catherine cried ..? She cried and screamed, and I had to admit that I had re-secreted many times ... many times .... The only funny joke that had little talent was the actor playing Anne Boleyn. (I may have prejudices But I have a little passion with Anne Boleyn. She's a really interesting woman. Also, I've read a lot about Tudor times, and I think the characters that aren't acting acurately are all. Very professional Watch this movie only when you are ready to see the very important moments and important lives of those involved becoming laughter.
