This movie has the potential to be more than it used to be, but not only failing to release. It also shows the preaching of self-disgust at the same time. <br /> <br /> John Cusack still flatter over at midnight of the Garden of Good and Evil. The difference is that now he should have a southern accent, which he has clearly lost many times in each scene. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino does his shtick but seems to walk through this film and keep wage He is a normal person. <br /> <br /> Supporting actors - throwing interest in romantic women that add a little story Talking about complicated stories "Who cares" The real story that Cusack is a righteous mayor who has to search "The right thing" to do <br /> <br /> People do nothing this way. Cusack's characters lose all credibility at the end, which without revealing it is preaching and nausea. The final scene makes the final folly seem profound. It's completely wrong. But I will not break the law. <br /> <br /> This is very bad. It seems to be interesting in the first 40 minutes, and then is a movie that preaches the faith and righteousness in the last hour Better with unreasonable shit than this garbage dump.
