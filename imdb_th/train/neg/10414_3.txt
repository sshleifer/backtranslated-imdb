This movie is stupid and rarely seen in slavery in the West Indies and is a star that shows Puddy from "Seinfeld" Obviously here, Oliver Reed gets the highest bill. Warburton plays as a white slave and is a joke that sees all the young and horny wives of wealthy old men offering him a price because they want to have sex with him. Eartha Kitt plays the role of Bardello, and they are very naked in this movie. If it wasn't drunk, Bordello showed that his young wife was turning towards him. Then, of course, at the end, the slaves were rebellious and there was a bloody conflict. There is no real political message, such as the movie "Bern", but it is just another invention planning device that will move the story. They created a sequel and Warburton and all the remaining actors came back! I hope they get a lot of money because this first movie is quite bad. Nudity makes it look and the lack of Warburton's accent makes it sometimes laugh. The movie is terrible, but I have to admit that I want to see the sequel.
