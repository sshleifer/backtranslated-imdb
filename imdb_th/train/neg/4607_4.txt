You can't imagine how I looked forward to King of the Ants as Gordon's big fan. I waited for the premiere in Europe with evil expectations, especially when I loved Dagon-Gordon's latest success - The King of Ants has premiered here in my country, and it is Gordon himself. Unfortunately, I can't go and congratulate him. After that, King of the Ants is the movie that no one is interested in and is most boring today. Actually, the quality level has never exceeded the standard TV thriller. The storyline is a very scary routine and except for a few poor scenes, the typical Gordon-touch scene has never been accepted. Moreover, the weak script has more holes than Swiss cheese! It involves a young man hired to do murder. So he and of course they did not pay him, and of course he fell in love with the victim's wife. And of course, he avenged himself .. only the sequence that a man fell in love with. Talking about and they are the only ones that remind you of the fact that you still watch the movie of Stuart Gordon, performing below average with McCenna as George's brave man `Norm Peterson 'Wendette is a half-fat and Kari Wuhrer is a very good sex bomb. The unreasonable things happen and the dullness of the story is quickly irritated while the makeup effects are not enough to make the amateur fans horror. I read other comments about King of the Ants, claiming that Gordon is the best, because in the end it is a thought-provoking and mature movie. If this is the case, I should be in a very young age. I think all the good directors are inspired and in the end it is also very bad. It also beat Stuart Gordon.
