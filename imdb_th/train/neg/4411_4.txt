Michael Rooker is a good actor. But he has no business to be a leader, except in movies with low budget He has a lot of charm. Ryo Ishibashi has more screens and sadly he's not the main character. Most screens go to Rooker in front of the brick. <br /> <br /> Daniel Harris (From the movie Halloween 4 and 5) playing his daughter and she is cute and fun Smart and one of her stupid mistakes made one main character killed. Comedian Fred Willard, Bobcat Goldthwait and Stephen Furst are here in an interesting role. Just see what happens to these characters. <br /> <br /> Vincent Schiavelli plays as a Consigliare for Mafia Godfather in the local area and it is hard to tell if he is working on a movie as a joke No, Tim Thomerson is also in this movie. It seems that he is in action movies directly to every video that has a very low budget. Thomerson is still in a low budget comedy. Seeing many comedians and cartoon actors in this movie make you feel like being deceived. Is it a parody of the Yakuza movie? It is difficult to tell at some point. There is very little action at Yakuza. <br /> <br /> The actors supporting Thugs and Goons are scary and handsome. Some of these movies have gangsters that seem to be working at a local comic book store or as a stock child. Piggly-Wiggly Overall, this movie is very uneven. At some point, it seems funny or parody. Then, in other areas, it works as a good action movie. Then will flow out to the end Without the involvement of Daniel Harris and Ryo Ishibashi, this movie will give Zero a rating in my humble opinion.
