I look forward to receiving this program for two reasons. I like Jan Michael Vincent. Actually I am a flying bean and have a love affair with a helicopter. I do not like this program because I use the imagination at an unbelievable level. The world speed statistics for helicopters were set at 249 miles per hour by Sharp Westland many years ago. The only thing that was faster than before was the Lockheed AH56A experiment in 1960. It collided with 300 and was a combined helicopter, which meant that it had a propeller to push at the end of the body to drive. No helicopters can fly as many as 275 because of the principle of rotating flight wings and bell 222 "actors" that show the image of Airwolf is not so fast, even by helicopter standards. And it is not in production for a long time. <br /> <br /> There is a movie that came out during this time called "Blue Thunder" that is more realistic.
