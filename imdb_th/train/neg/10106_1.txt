Yes, I am sure it will be a true country .. If all four people stand at the four corners of the world and the other two gather together for billions of times. I'm really glad that I watched this movie on FEAR.net instead of renting. I'm a big fan of the movie George Romero and I'm pretty sure that if he sees this movie, he might throw up while laughing too hard. What do I mean to the raccoon women who act as zombies and walk around like Charlie's Devils? It helps as well. The songwriter chooses a crappy fashion show when the zombies walk to find the murderer, especially the part they entered In any warehouse that is placed as a furniture / police station / apartment / flat / room With a gong in the background and a living woman arguing about a closed furniture store I can't say which killer of nationality and the fact that his accent indicates that many countries do not help as well. Oh well, what I expected from the movie, they cast random battle scenes without good reason in the warehouse, apparently they shipped the air box around the world. So for everyone who worshiped the Mystery Science Theater 3000 or if you like to be screened in a bad C movie (C for Craptastic), this is the movie for you .. or not.
