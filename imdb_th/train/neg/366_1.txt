Bad actors, poor filming, missing conversations, superficial characters, but after that again, it was a bad evidence at first. Basically, an 11-year-old child who was bullied because he had very little money would receive a blank check by a criminal who was morally Of course, 11-year-olds have technology and intelligence enough to buy a house, a $ 1,000,000 check, and even an insane rebellion three times, reminiscent of the three followers. <br /> <br /> Preston Blake is an annoying child. Disgusted by the decision that when writing a blank check by a stranger, he would take advantage of the best situation possible. In other words, he walked into the bank. <br /> <br /> Send a check to him in his printer and walk out astonishingly with millions of dollars of cash. Clearly, Preston also has the ability to reach an incredible speed on his bike due to the fact that a man drove a Jaguar after Preston and his 10-level speed couldn't catch him even in While Preston jumps in a row, <br /> <br /> Of course, in every hokey adventure movie, there must be a hot heroine. In this case, our hot heroine is a child who pretends to be an FBI, dating to Preston, eleven years old and contracting again when he is 17 years old. <br /> <br /> However, the worst thing of This movie is not a casting. And sloppy conversations such as "The only way I think that is interesting is that the cat is attached to the bottom of the tube and picks up the hair." It's all true that no one in this movie seems to realize that the FBI does not condemn random people. What I can't explain is that Preston uses the alias "Macintosh" to disguise himself as a strange entrepreneur. Of course, the FBI finds something interesting and sends our young heroine after Preston, who uses 11-year-old wisdom. His first scream when the lobster fell on his face, then treated her for a hamburger while running in the cement area. Ground water Our heroine failed to realize during all the adventures that the FBI criminals were doing, slipping and sliding to the back as they traveled to Preston's limousine with a 1-dimensional driver. That never fails Laughing that every family can breathe. <br /> <br /> Overall: 1/10 is incredibly elegant for this movie. I don't see that it's only 4.4 / 10.
