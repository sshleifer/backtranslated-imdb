*** Possible spoiler *** <br /> <br /> I love Dennis Hopper. I asked why he accepted the police detective role in 2000 of The Spreading Ground. This movie is smooth and I'm going to tell you why. <br /> <br /> This is a story about a small town that is about. Will be contracted with the stadium. One hitch: There are loose and bad killers for the business. The mayor made an agreement with the Irish mob to search for a murderer and made sure he had never been to the detention court. Ed Delongpre had other plans. He wanted this man to catch as well. But he is at the level and believes in the system He wants to see that the system works well. <br /> <br /> That would be good. It may be sensational. It's scary First, they labeled the serial. This killer is not wrong. There are specific criteria and do not match here. Bad people kill 5 children on the first day and I think it's 2 days. The second movie has a 48-hour period. ... almost no serial killer action I don't care what they give to him. At the end, the serial killer has done their job for a long time. They not only killed 7 children immediately in two days That is fun. <br /> <br /> Okay to make frustration. The only name here is Hopper, and he is the only one who comes close to pulling out his part. Unfortunately, he is the type of actor that I am and I think he has done a lot of psychosis. This is not a good vehicle for Hopper. It doesn't allow him to do what he does best, which is an eerie act. It's not that he doesn't do well. It's what I saw him do better. <br /> <br /> Irish man mob Johnny Johnny (Tom McCamus - travel all night. Lasting) responsible Their investigation is just stiff. Conflict? Not really. He tried to play as a cold and kind person, and he did so until the point that the character was just wood. So boring He didn't scare me. He didn't create any inspiration except boredom. I can't tell you how many times I checked to see how long this movie ended. <br /> <br /> Another thing about this is that it feels like a TV movie. You know What do I mean? Low production cost, low budget, use of the scene to save money, just Ee Yanno? But I feel that the comparison with these things is an insult to them. <br /> <br /> Derek Vanlint is both a director and a director in this project. He bites more than chewing. I couldn't help but feel that Hopper had to take this role as a gift to a friend. That's the only reason I can happen. This is Vanlint's first job as a third director as a director. Hopefully this will be a learning experience for him. <br /> <br /> I will not destroy the ending in case you decide to torture yourself with this story .. even Hopper in a scene that should be a secret. The emotion for the detective is just .. good .. blah I don't see any concern about coming with the overall gear change. Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> 100 minutes are tired and get R points for violence and language. Children under the age of 13 do not have any interest in watching this thing, so don't worry. It doesn't suit anyone. Heh. <br /> <br /> Skip this. You will thank me later.
