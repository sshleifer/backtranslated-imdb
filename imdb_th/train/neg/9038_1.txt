This is Bartleby's brilliant production, although not while other critics put it because it is "Cannot understand" but because this model does not preserve the spirit of the book It tells a painful story. Watching it, I can flip the pages of my book and follow, which is not fun when dealing with adjustment. Rather see the version of Bartleby in 2001 with Crispin Glover that edition while humor brings new details to the movie while still maintaining the spirit of the novel. The important thing is that the spirit is not a subset of things such as setting names, characters and costumes. The difference between these movie versions is like day and night, boring and hilarious. This model is a lesson about things that can be wrong if adaptation is handled badly, painfully and mentally.
