Ok, I like movies. B ... I know what movie B should represent. But this is terrible I was surprised to get a good overall score. The only redemption feature of this flick is the splashing effect (mostly). Do not understand me. Wrong. Blood in this flick - but there are some effects that come out at me (eg "Anal ... That's great!) <br /> <br /> I believe this movie. Filmed on a video camera. C'mon - At least Betacam for rent. I've seen pornography with better production costs. (And better performances as well) <br /> <br /> Acting-sucking! But not in the form of Troma or the full moon. <br /> <br /> Story - Being planned! But that's what you get from movies like this. Very loose! <br /> <br /> Dresses and props - suck! My 16-year-old brother created a more complex scene for our house on Halloween. <br /> <br /> Dubbed and conversation - sucked! (I shouldn't even call it acting) and other words are "S ** t" or "F ** k". <br /> <br /> There are many good classics / flickers out there. And they are not difficult to follow Do yourself a favor without wasting time with this shit!
