This game was created by Sega. Made by Sega. I didn't expect much. But I didn't expect the garbage as well For starting the camera, work with you in this game. Motorcycles are your travel tools. The motorcycle is the worst part in the game. Whenever you encounter something that you just caught there and you won't move You never fall from a bicycle or a wreck. The main character is barely speaking, even though he has a sound that suits him. Awesome graphics You ride a tree on your bike. The camera makes fighting with enemies impossible. This game is not worth the rental.
