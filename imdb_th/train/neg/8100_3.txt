Bonfires of the Vanities is a movie that is soaked with sweat. I do not remember which movie that tried so hard to show serious aggression and unimportant. It's like a stand-up cartoon that doesn't laugh. But cannot exit the stage The harder the movie tries, the more laughter each time will make a loud noise. The despair of this film shows that it is almost pathetic for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> This film has been successful in a laughing state, just two times out loud. Once in the eyes of Geraldo Rivera, who played a tabloid and ungodly tabloid newspaper, which was a joke just because he was clearly not aware that he played himself. Another scene that is worthy of laughing is the movie "The Last Second" by the judge, played by Morgan Freeman, gives a lecture on sacred morality. ("It's what your mother taught you!" pomposity of the moment of being insulted to the point of absurdity. <br /> <br /> But having to admit that it is a noble effort It has a good performance if actors, actors who are trying to create characters from some caricatures. This movie is professionally created and a little movie has flourished which director Brian DePalma just loves seeing Obviously, if not particularly effective But this film, which wants to express opinions about morality and modern ethics, never happened above the level of cartoons. Satire needs style Jokes need energy. Even sitcoms still take time. But the best fire that can be collected is despair In the end, you don't want to laugh, you just want to escape.
