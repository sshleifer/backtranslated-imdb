I have seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiest / worst attempts at once. Most scenes work in a style plug-and-play That is inserted strictly to comply with the romantic comedy Usually this is okay because we are dealing with types. But the general challenge lies in making it original and creative. This film failed to do that. <br /> <br /> There is no sense that the character is anyone except the character Sylvie Moreau (the true star of the film is not Isabelle Blais). Ancient thinking in one dimension and they are nothing more than ordinary puppets that are used for telling light stories Store full of With unnecessary closeup I should say that the extreme decors that make certain scenes do not occur naturally or make the effort to look natural are too clear. Of course, you have the right song, which is a shame that doesn't seem to match. <br /> <br /> I can't believe that a movie that makes Woody Allen allusion is a hoax. If you expect to There is a gentle romantic comedy, not like that. Or more, this is a bad attempt at it You will leave the theater wondering why this film has been so praised when the cinema is over 100 years old and has a better Quebec filmmaker. <br /> <br / > Les Aimants is a good movie for what it is. But it's not good if you think movies are art and the director is the director.
