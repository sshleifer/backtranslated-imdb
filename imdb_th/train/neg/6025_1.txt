Leaving behind a type of "We know what we know makes us know that" Christian movies (And most innocent people, others) want to help them feel like what they "think" and "believe" (not "know") is right. But at the same time I feel bad about A small man because this is not a movie that is made out well. It doesn't help any messages. I work at a video store and I know just the reason people go to watch this movie because they respect religion and they think it is. Anyone in this world who thinks they know what will happen in the future is wrong, unless they think they know that they don't know. I have enough (but after I have too much) of these people walking. Go around with their nose in the air. Think of the movie starring in a semi-talented TV actor, meaning something above me. <br /> <br /> Please, if you love yourself, you'll stay away from me. Refused Into detail about this film (because the AI ​​does not see it (as I do), B- It's shocking than those who do not believe in God, I can handle myself. (Because it's not) or CI, nothing to say badly about this (because I do) reason (which is a word that no one helps this movie understand) is that I want this movie out of my head Make it from My head, I want me to see everything by opening my heart from me. I want the message that Kirk is proud and as a coach. At the end of the movie, leaving my head, I want everything. In my head, before watching this movie, there is nothing directly related to this movie floating in my head! My calm anger is about to end. I'm sorry to have people in this world go to the cinema to see this movie, what happens in the future (but not) when they give Seven Dollars Plus to human charity. Any number of animals or rain forest But if they do So that they cannot "believe" in the fact that it is real, they may need to know what is Left to zero (from ****)
