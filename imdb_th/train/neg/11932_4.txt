I do not know Oliver Gruner. My friend showed me this movie because he saw Gruner in what he called the film. The sci-fi action was very good. So when we look at this, we find ourselves moving forward. Quickly through the BS drama, just to go to an unbelievable action scene. Gruner likes to kick and kick and kick and kick! haha <br /> <br /> The character Gruner is a graduate student who is forced to live in a slum near where he grew up. He finds himself looking after a boy who lives with him because he wants to enter. Really join In a Mexican gang that tortured his family Instead of joining Gruner, tell the boys to fight back. (Compared to gangs of madness too) Gruner plays a typical Van Damme character that kills everyone. (Or disabled, they are not good) and work to get rid of these gangsters' blocks. <br /> <br /> The plot is wonderful and easy to think of. Gruner may not be well known because of choosing His script, if this film is anything that compares possible options This slum is a pure hell and I am happy to see the team of the characters in this drama pass as if they had a chance to Gruner's character. This song is a typical action song. (Outstanding piano and short drum, guitar swell) which is actually not as bad as I do. The director wants the action to continue instead of resting every 5 minutes for a stressful family moment. <br /> <br /> Finally, I gave 4/10 because it was trying to be an average action movie. For Oliver Gruner to join But the overall feeling of this film makes you want to end up with what you just saw.
