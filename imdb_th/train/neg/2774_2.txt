This is just a bad movie. With what seems to be a good budget, it has the potential to be much better. It's almost With a beautiful heroine almost like Salma Hayek, the hero's battle is almost like Jackie Chan, fighting and dueling similar to that in Crouching Tiger ... The music is almost like talking Conan ... but eventually it is boring And it is difficult to find interesting things Perhaps apart from John Rhys-Davies who flew with a duel like a warrior in the Hero or Crouching Tiger earlier ... I am ashamed of poor John. He is a good actor and deserves much better. So according to you - so if you still have the opportunity, just look at something else.
