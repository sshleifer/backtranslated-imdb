I hire a hybrid on weekends. Really disappointing! Stupid effort at the movie The guy for them is the leader that is completely weak and when running {he did a lot} he seems to be eating those mints ... with his back! The contact with the wolf he wears is excellent. But I feel that the actors rely too much on them because there is nothing dangerous about their performance. Native American Indian chicks must be one of the toughest witches ever encountered. Talk about the sour cow! She smiled throughout the story and I thought that was because she had sex. The sex scene is also lame. They may show the curtain blowing if you can dig. <br /> <br /> Last and this is my most ugly pet on the cover and DVD menu. Sharp teeth cool down on men They have no place to see in the movie :(
