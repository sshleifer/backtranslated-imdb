This film is made in a really bad taste. The script is very bad. I was really sad for Gregory Peck, who acted as the title of one of the greatest generals' B movie adaptations in history. This film is not politically correct and does not feel serious to others who fought in Japan in World War 2. There is one scene that I almost vomit. It shows that Mac Arthur in the bunker in the island of Cor. Ri talked to the military like a politician. Philippine soldiers wounded one leg The soldiers were bleeding and dying, stood up when they saw the generals and said: "No father, no mother, no uncle, Sam" and Arthur gave his little words to the Americans that "Will never abandon the Philippines." The scene ends with the military being fueled by the words of MacArthur and giving him praise. I mean, if there is a scene that is more conducive to drawing in the United States as the great white savior of the world, please tell me, because this takes a cake. It shows that Filipinos are young women who are suffering, unable to honor and rely on the great Americans just to redeem. It was blatantly and deliberately obscured the involvement of the members of the USAFFE (the US forces of the Far East). These were Filipino volunteers who were joined by the US Army during World War II, which died alongside Americans fighting. with The Japanese who walked alongside the Americans in March to the death of Bataan and protect the island of Corregidor with an offensive guerrilla attack after Macarthur left Australia with his famous saying, 'I will come back.' I am a Filipino World War II veteran and the USAFFE soldier is one of many people who fought with Japan with honor and love for a crazy country. Born I think this movie does not honor them and thousands of others that MacArthur trust in preparing the intelligence for his famous return to landing Leyte Bay.
