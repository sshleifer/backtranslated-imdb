I cannot believe that such tilted genius materials are being passed on to Americans in the form of art house materials. Early from the line telling like "We want to make sure that they are playing for the right team" and the lighting and manipulation framework A Love Divided shows that it is a true face. The ruthless nature of which the Irish Catholics showed to be a hegemonic. The peaceful and poor Protestants represent poor history, representing the early history of the West, demonstrating the struggle between the Western Cowboy and American Indians The truth of the matter is distorted by the stereotypical and immediate form of Irish Catholics in the matter; The damage that filmmakers accept! It is sad that people today still think that they can receive moral awards by making movies that are easily accepted because it is a clear intention until trying to do art. This film does not have any business in theaters or legal libraries.
