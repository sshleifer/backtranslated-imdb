Since I started visiting this website and voted for the movie, I have never voted for any movie. Even the annoying "Dance! Workout with Barbie" has 2 issues. That's the reason for this. <br /> <br > Whenever I find myself watching a bad movie, I have to stop and ask myself the following question: "Is this movie very bad, like the evil beast that is the 'Theodore Rex'? ? "And I can't answer" Yes ". <br /> <br /> What will I give to the reason to know that the crackling says" Hey! Build 'Blade Runner' with Barney in Harrison Ford! And decided that it was a good idea to spend real time and money in filming In addition, I want to know what kind of market they are going to sell if it is not a video channel. This is a rare monster: movies that are more violent than children think are too stupid for adults. I ask, "What are they thinking?" But in this case it might be redundant. <br /> <br / > However, what you need to know is that you should reveal yourself to this surprise if you are one of the five or six crazy fans of "Howard the Duck" or if you want to know the most insane Evil Insane movie. Time A. You want to punish yourself literally.
