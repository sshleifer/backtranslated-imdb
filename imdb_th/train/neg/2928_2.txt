I really wanted to watch this movie and waited several months to get it through our Blockbuster Total Access account. When it appeared in my inbox, I threw it into a DVD player. <br /> <br /> I'm very disappointed. Sad. Which makes me crazy I will give a chance to the movie, even if I want to walk out of the theater / press 'stop'. But not anything except frustration. <br /> <br /> The performance is very good. But about it No explanation While we understand that Mathieu has become depressed and into the spiritual realm in some categories, we never give in-depth information about While we understand that he and Cedric broke up again, we didn't see it happening or why it happened. During an interview with Mathieu's doctor, Cedric revealed that he had once cheated on him. But it's not a big deal. I expect to see this in an incident but not - nothing. We also get a hint that Cedric is the one who brought Mat to the hospital - but again we didn't see it. <br /> <br /> Know that some movies are about 'Take it as a basis' but this movie makes me really tick When Cedric's ex-boyfriend Pierre appeared in the club and started having problems, we wouldn't see him or his hair until near the end. His personality at the club and when Mat found him completely different I might be wrong to say that it's a confusing story. <br /> <br /> This movie expects you to know everything and walk with discontinuity and confusion. I can follow movies like 'Pi', 'Citizen Kane' and other movies that have flash back / forward, left and right, but CU didn't catch and hold the style at the end of 'Citizen Kane'. You will know what happened and discover the answer to the mystery of the main CU puzzle. Just let you hang. It has an atmosphere of pretending in 'We will not tell the cursed things to think out for your own presentation.' It's like reading a book that has alternating chapters and missing pages. <br /> <br /> A good performance like I said. I like characters But the whole story is too disappointing.
