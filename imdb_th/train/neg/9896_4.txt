The DVD version consists of 2 episodes, the parricide of Caesar is the connection point. In addition, the language is Spanish without subtitles. So it's hard for me to review in-depth this film because I don't understand what is being said. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra is a historical icon, a very difficult part and I found that for newcomers Leonor Varela plays well. She is a self-centered person. But with great encouragement, Thimothy Dalton as Caesar was perfect and their love was important at first. So it's not a documentary or a peplum, but a great love story. <br /> <br /> After the encirclement of a new lover (Marc-Antoine) But the taste disappeared: We always remembered before love. So I found the second episode that is boring and their tragic fate is not so powerful. <br /> <br / > However, production is luxurious: the scene is large and tastefully decorated. Exotic Moroccan places and beautiful closets The manufacturer certainly has a lot of money. But they do not spend money on special techniques. They are terrible (blue screen, boat, sphinx) that is funny. <br /> <br /> Finally I want to hear it in French or English so Clear comments about these two movies
