Dr. Mordrid is very scary. I will not advise adults or children to see this unless they are already rampaging the murderer. There are so many filths in this movie that it hurts me. Yes. The eyes of the eyes have eyes in the sky against the backdrop of the stars. Only the devil can imagine this evil thing. I rented every copy that I could find from a local video store and smashed them with a 5 pound cross. What this movie belongs to I recommend if you want to entertain the scandal and rent out All Dogs Go To Heaven or Angels In The Outfield. If you want to sin and love a horrible movie, you must meet Dr. Mordid
