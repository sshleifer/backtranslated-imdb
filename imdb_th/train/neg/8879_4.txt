I think Cliff Robertson is one of our best actors. He has half a dozen classics to his credit. He's doing well here as a heavy one. But the direction is terrible and the boring rhythm is never dropped. The story begins well, although it makes me wonder how he would trust his wife who hanged himself. He kept the glass jug well and carried things. Death was twice as much. First of all, if we have to take time to walk from one room to another room or part of the house to another room, it will consume about a third of the movie. In addition, Robertson's character sits in bed in a blurred blue light that may add another lump. I agree with saying that shorter than half an hour will make it look good, even if it is an insignificant movie. The biggest weakness is just a complicated storyline. When everything is said and done, it leaves an incredible question. I don't wear spoilers. But when it ends, don't think too much. I can think of 10 items without causing sweat. It would be better if it's still a ghost story.
