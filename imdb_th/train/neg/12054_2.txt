"What happens when you give a $ 100,000 homeless man?" As if by asking questions, they will be forgiven for what will happen in the end. <br /> <br /> They took Ted, a homeless man in Pasadena, and let him see $ 100,000 if he changed his life. Then, with the most direct navigation and consultation, they let him go cheerfully. <br /> <br /> What are they trying to say? "Can't you buy money for happiness?" "The homeless are homeless because they deserve it." Or "Raise the man - more fun to watch him fall from higher places." A man went without anything to lose, so he did something for him and watched him throw it into the drain. Is that supposed to be entertainment? They dress up with melodious music and amazing camera images. But in the end, there was a video with a car crash - but this time they designed a car engine and asked if "What happens when you stop signing?"
