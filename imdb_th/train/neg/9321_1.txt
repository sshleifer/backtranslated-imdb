I rented this movie about 4-5 years ago and was immediately disappointed. <br /> <br /> I want to see the b-slasher movie. I saw a better performance in softcore movies. <br /> <br /> The idea that the killer is crazy from nowhere. How is the horror movie? <br /> <br /> The production value of this movie is the most laughable. No fear It seems that high school students will have a new video camera for Christmas. Plots are all over the place if available. If you're tired of looking for a bad horror movie for rent, skip this story. There are many better b movies there.
