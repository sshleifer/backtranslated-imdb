After sitting in this dung, my husband and I wonder if it is a work from the experiment or not to see if the computer program can make a movie It's a ridiculous thing and it's a formula. But US propaganda thrown on your face throughout the movie proved to be frustrating. That's human work. Called me a conspiracy theorist, but claimed that "we must steal the Declaration of Independence to protect it" seems to be a way to demonstrate actions such as the invasion of Iraq etc. Will not use the Declaration of Independence as a bargain chip "With a straight face, I and my husband suspect that all actors use Valium before shooting each scene or not. The "reasoning" behind each plan and the new "clue" is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow. And there is also a bonus plot of female hatred with Dr. Whatever her name, she is being chided by everyone involved. "Never shut down." She was clearly seen in the movie for viewing. But they felt the need to hit "Dr." the name of her character so that she had gravity At one point, the character of Cage said that "Did you ever close?" And the camera turned to look at her as if she were a child. Truly weird The only benefit of this movie is that it is surprisingly terrible. You can laugh out. The really scary thing is that most people who watch movies with us seem to enjoy it creepy ....
