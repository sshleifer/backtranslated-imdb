This film is pure pain. Sitting in the theater for x minutes. I wonder when this movie will start. All settings are in place; General love story The character must overcome the short evil. The villain must appear. When these things happen, I feel bored and the device doesn't work at all. In scenes that require great tension and accumulation, it feels like cutting the necessary frames. What children do not have to be like this Children's movies can be sensational and engaging like adults. The excuse "Hey, it's for the kids" is the cow. I'll take "Sword in the Stone" everyday. today And for children 10 years that I see this too, will see ... pure trash
