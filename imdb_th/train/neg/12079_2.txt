Poir will turn to his grave if he can. This is a German-TV adaptation of his classic play. Obviously, spending a lot of money on it. The stage plays, catwalks and columns that are randomly placed through the series. This film was incorrectly dubbed in English by British voice overshadowing their calls from time to time. All production is incredibly dark and boring and where is the Fonterbras in this movie? MST3K gives an apology for the treatment that deserves. <br /> <br /> Will it be? I hope this film will never be in the first place.
