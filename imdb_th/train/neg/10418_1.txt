This is not a children's movie !!! <br /> <br /> This movie is like "Traveling in a bad acid" for children under 5 months for a 4-year-old child will ask me, "Why does that rabbit flow out of its mouth?" (And that's not the worst of it) We stopped it for about 1/2 hour, but the damage happened. Severe and severe pressure Fortunately, he finally forgot about all the tragic things. Who decided that this movie should go to the market with children ... (to blame me, I was wrong)
