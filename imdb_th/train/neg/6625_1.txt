This is the first time I write comments about movies on IMDb, but I have to write it for this 3 hours of torture that is not contaminated. From the beginning, you get the idea that this movie is not good. The show was pathetic. I'm a big fan of Ajay devgan (love him in bhagat singh) but he's the worst in this movie. It seems amitabh will work hard for this. In any way, the fear disappeared. Prashant raj is a non-actor. And the most annoying part of this movie is nisha kothari. I don't know why the director took her to watch this movie. Duplicate background score Somehow I feel that ramu tries to repeat sarkar, color themes, background scores, camera angles, but it doesn't work. Please don't look.
