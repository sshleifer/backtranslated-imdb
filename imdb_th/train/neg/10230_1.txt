Happened to this copy Not mine, and if I use my own money with this, I will have to find a responsible person and claim back! All I can say is that this movie will be a horror movie for students. Understanding in any media of the movie is lacking. The show is a great deity. The story is rejected by the original Twilight series that is not original and weak, and the change of character's reaction to the "ghost" is ridiculous. That the 'glow' review of this film comes from friends and family I am afraid that it will not be too bad. <br /> <br /> Finally amateurs! <br /> <br /> Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!
