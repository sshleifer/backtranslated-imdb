This film has a satisfying aspect. Maybe too much for my taste Feels like a writer / director is trying hard to let us feel the internal conflict of all the characters. Not a few times ... but all the time. <br /> <br /> This is the work of the television, not the movie. <br /> <br /> The location of the train station is very well chosen and I like it. Sascha Horler's performance as a pregnant friend Movies through expressions Her protagonists I can't believe that a director can make Daniela Farinacci a great example. Unbelievable examples. <br /> <br /> I can't understand the choices of pop songs that went all the way. This is a lazy device, especially where pop music comes from places that are not diagetic with movies and / or which the lyrics of the song feel serious Stimulate Australia's heat and local attitude with initiative. It creates an atmosphere of heat and sunlight. Especially with the use of the excellent animation sequence that helped this film from ordinary people full of passion and charm created by hands. <br /> <br /> I want to know why. The conversation was overworked. "Who knows where there is a god like a man sitting there in the sky telling us what to do?" Or whatever is the line. <br /> <br /> Perhaps another embarrassing moment is A friend returned home from cricket with a bouquet of flowers to announce to his wife that "I quit smoking" <br /> <br /> Anti-smoking advertising? Are TAC ads with tasteful animations? I have to leave the cinema at the 50-minute mark - it's too much.
