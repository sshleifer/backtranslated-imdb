Going to see a movie like this, I expect nothing to be fun except killing a group ..... What I have less than <br /> <br /> Christmas Eve 1947 A child witnesses to my father mom While the father is in Santa's outfit Scary. He ran up the stairs and slit himself. The story begins in 33 years later and Harry Stalling is your normal Joe in everyday life ..... because of the fact that he is obsessed with Santa. After his boss makes him fun, he gets mad, dressed like Santa and starts killing people who don't believe Santa and his boss. The stubborn neighborhood caught him and while they were about to fire, he drove his van out of the cliff ..... to the moon, not the best ending I've ever seen. /> <br /> But it is original, it is a film that <br boring and slow, with no redeeming qualities except except when Harry to sneak Church. Hardly any blood, and even the "sex" scene is reduced. <br /> <br /> Too boring ... 4 out of 10
