This movie sounds like a good proof: 9 people face the fear of receiving a million dollars. Unfortunately it didn't become a good movie. There are many scenes that are too long and pointless like a dance scene. Some scenes are an excuse to point the camera to different parts of the female body. Performing is not good, but some of the characters are amusing in horrors. The really strange thing is that at the end of this movie will become like the West in 5 minutes and at the end, the twists they have many people do not understand with the rest of the movie. It seems that the director has just added things because he thinks it looks cool while ignoring the film's story. It's not reasonable. The only creepy thing is that one old man danced down at the hall. But that was not close to compensating this mess
