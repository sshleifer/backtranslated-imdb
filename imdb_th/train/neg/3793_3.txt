The Nutcracker is a ballet that is quite a problem. It has a slight similarity to the original story of ETA Hoffman based on this story. <br /> <br /> In the ballet, most stories are stories of the second half when Clara. Sweets to see the character's dance dress. <br /> <br /> There are many endless stage performances that interpret new stories in a variety of ways. (Not always successful) to compensate for the weak ballet chapters> <br /> Balanchine's version has no sense of drama or story. (Despite the fact that there are many plays and mysteries in Tchaikovsky's first song), the result is the first half-year Christmas party that is completely forgotten, almost nothing happens, and even dancing. <br /> <br /> The dumb show, especially of Drosselmeier, may be seen on stage, just stupidly filmed on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, things weren't much better when we reached the Candy Kingdom (Act II on stage), although there were a few choreography highlights. But most choreography is polite and not interesting Of course, this is not ancient Balanchine. <br /> <br /> Balanchine is widely regarded as an abstract dancer. But I always felt that he was less successful as a ballet lecturer Watching this version of the movie about his creation of The Nutcracker has only confirmed this view again.
