In an effort to bring a teen slasher game that was tricked by gangster like Scary Movie and Shriek, if you know what I did on Friday the 13th, why do people like Halloween? Because it is a new original and superior to anything that has been done Why do they like screaming? Because at least it is reasonable Valentine is just flicking a dab that hardly stabs anything. The story is similar to Halloween and Urban Legend is not a joke. And the moment when the killer comes on the screen, you know who it is, it's just sssssssssssooooooooooooooooooooooo Teen Slasher type is DEAD. Beat it. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10
