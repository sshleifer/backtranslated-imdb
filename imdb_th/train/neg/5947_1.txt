This is one of the most nasty and cruel movies I've ever seen. Sadly, I stick to it because Donald Sutherland's presence can be misunderstood. [That was the last time that happened] <br /> <br /> Lesley Ann Warren's character is a frustrated and stupid person when they arrive. There are characters that are smarter than you who were killed in this movie. One of many things in this movie that made me ask "Where is justice?" <br /> <br /> Why is the cable late so full of sadistic garbage filled with pathological attacks? Most of these movies seem to have specific problems with women and seem to focus on them being threatened and killed. This movie may be a thriller without being sick and distorted in the process. What it does is to change the audience's stomach with sickness and insulting the intellect of the audience. <br /> <br /> A very talented actor. I guess they will be Sutherland first and use him to lure other people into this story. <br /> <br /> I'm kicking myself because of wasting time.
