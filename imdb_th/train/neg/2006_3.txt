It helps to know why this book took so long to prepare the movie as "The House Next Door" to be adapted into a movie or television. This book is copyrighted in 1978. One reason may be the problem of designing a 'home'. The house in this Lifetime movie is so ugly that I can't imagine anyone buying. In fact, it is so ugly that some people may come and destroy it as soon as they are created. <br /> <br /> I'm not crazy about horror books. Across about ten years ago The main character is not the type of person who is looking for mystery in life and this is the strength of this book. They are not the ones who can conclude that the architect is a type of demon .. (or the devil embodied) without witnessing and analyzing the events described in the book. However, it is the most depressing book, and I don't think that will attract the attention of people who use it for life. There may be someone with another book in the next few years. Better house .. Better music, better screenplay and darker light will definitely help.
