The King Maker is a movie about real events. (The necessary reference) that occurred during the Portuguese occupation of Indochina. <br /> <br /> Although the costumes and the art direction are commendable. Some actors try hard to make tears run down and the accents of both real and fake are extremely annoying. The story is too stupid and stupid to be true and seems to be a more historical lesson. This film can't even capture the king and the air that is centuries-old, and it looks like an unsuccessful attempt to create Elizabethan Asian versions. Clothing and art help the film to have fresh air. But the executions were terrible and the actors were unable to express their natural emotions. In short, the movie sounds more like a character than a script.
