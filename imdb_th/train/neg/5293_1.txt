I picked up this video after reading the text on the story box. It looks good and it has Keanu Reeves! But after watching for 5 minutes, I noticed that his acting was horrible. He walked and spoke silly all the time. It was fake and unbelievable. It doesn't end there. Almost every character behaves badly. It is ridiculous. The only acceptable performance is Alan Boyce (David), but the man killed himself early and you don't see him again. You don't know why he did it! Everything about this movie screams at low quality. I can't believe how it will come out! I was tempted many times to stop watching. In fact, I made half way. I decided to stop watching and close that thing. Come to IMDB to check what others think about it. I found zero reviews ( Not surprisingly), so I decided to force myself to deal with the pain and return to complete it. Then come here to comment. The only good thing for me (for me) is the Rock High School theme, playing guitar and singing occasionally. But it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> The acting and governance are very bad ... The movie is terrible.
