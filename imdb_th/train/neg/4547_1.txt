This movie is very scary !!! The worst movie I've ever seen in a couple of years easily. One of those movies, I can tell people in the next three years that it's the worst movie I can think of. Thank you for providing answers to burning questions. "What is the worst movie you have ever seen?" Answer: Heavenly prophecy trusts me ... I read the book, enjoyed the message and was excited to watch the movie. But then they treat the audience as we understand There are no stories and stories that are disabled by magic and coincidence too. It was too bad that they had to spell all nine prophecies and could not carry them as entertainment. They didn't spend time developing characters and it was easy to ignore which characters died. It's embarrassing to be one of the few people stuck around until the end of the movie is incredibly boring. This book is boring too. But I like the genre that can be seen in everyday life while you read the book. This film does not give the same opportunity and I suggest that you do not look at it if you want to hold the words of this book close to your heart. Don't see this movie. Believe me.
