I just watched. I spent 90 minutes in my precious life watching one of the most stupid movies I've ever seen. The concept of clowns against serial killers is actually very scary. See, there are a lot of people who are afraid of clowns .... But if it's 300 pounds, touch the funny nursery. I'm still wondering how the character Mark can't escape from the clown. He is 300 pounds. He must finally get tired. All the endings woke me up and said aloud, "What have I just watched?" Clearly Brandon is Denise's cousin .... and they approach the middle of the movie. Having sex with his cousin ..... Yes. That's what people want to see. * Shivering. And she said "What are you doing?" Bye, what do you think he just did? The last thing that is foolishly funny is one second. The main character slapped the guy and tied up and called her ac * nt. 5 minutes later he said that the violence didn't help anything. Keep late for the wrong person? There's no reason for this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a very low budget movie that I was sucked into to buy (all 3.99) and not entertained in addition to the sex scene. I was surprised that the fat clown didn't participate in the fun or it would be fit. I hope this movie will have the same entertainment value as the movie. B Other things that may have but I think wrong. See even <br /> <br /> 1 of 10
