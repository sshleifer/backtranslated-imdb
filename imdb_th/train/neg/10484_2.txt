As an Elvis fan, I don't understand how I can do this. Is the movie that deals with the worst Elvis of all time, not many stupid mistakes and mistakes about The King? Come to Elvis's grave in the park? Suspicious mentions in 1958? ... And this is just two examples. Some of the actors on the team are trying to do their best. Mike Starr is a funny person (especially as an imitator). Tom Tom Hanks is an amazing person. Minutes. But as funny as Elvis, I recommend "Bubba Ho-Tep" to you instead of this mess.
