All the movies are replayed after the first Boogeyman movie and the video from the movie Uli Lommel / Suzanna Love. It is a frame with more current images (from the early 90's). Boring images, poor photography This film is not only But can be screened almost completely So you will see the video that is reused again and again as if you didn't see it. As if the original was not bad enough I've never seen this movie before. Some people are rolling the last dollar from these movies, including ripoff and talking about internal spaces ... Why do I have to write 10 lines about this trash? If I can say that it is garbage in two lines, that should be enough.
