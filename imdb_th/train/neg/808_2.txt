A very frustrating movie from the novel James Michener. <br /> <br /> The worse thing is the performance of Marlon Brando. His observations in the south are ridiculous. I found myself laughing when he spoke as he listened like an old woman in the south. Come back to stay at Brando House, which was great in the previous movie, being demoted to laughter. "Should be nominated for the best actor instead of Brando here. <br /> <br /> This film is related to racism dealing with the efforts of the US government to avoid but Work between the US military And Japanese women <br /> <br /> Brando has to face rocks throughout the movie. The move from resisting these relationships to professionals arose when he found love with Asian women. His emotions and talk make it difficult to see how he can receive new perspectives. <br /> <br /> Only the boss knows why Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki won the prize. Scarborough for their performances There is nothing equally impressive about any performance. Umeki's appearance on the screen is short and almost shows nothing on her part. The better performances in this film were made by Miiko Taka, who received a lot of attention from Brando. She showed great emotion as an anti-American who found love with Brando characters. Her face was inscribed with the suffering she lost to her father and brother in World War 11. She knew that her dance was not the way out of her existence. <br /> <br /> Martha Scott walked from Yochobel, a Hebrew mother in "The Ten Commandments" for the stubborn mother of Brando who had an interesting love at first Her performance, together with one of Ricardo Montalban, wasted Patricia Owens as Brando's first love, showing deeply and confidently in her performance.
