I rented this movie on DVD. I know that this movie will not be with what I promise in this case. But when I saw Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) in there, I had to rent it. It started out quite well, with evidence that snuff films were airing on cable. However, the main character has nothing to do with her that will make you feel sorry for her. In any way, and the ending of the movie makes you have to hang. There are too many unanswered questions. There was a wonderful scene at the end that surprised me completely. But overall, this is not a good movie. But I think it's worth the $ 3.99 rent.
