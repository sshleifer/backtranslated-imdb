I grew up with Scooby for a lifetime. My father grew up with Scooby. We just watched the first episode of the impersonation that called himself Shaggy and Scooby received a clue to Warner Bros's planets. The characters are likely to attract better attention from my sister. The story should be better written by my 3 year old cousin (who is also a Scooby Doo fan). Scooby and Shaggy can't !!!!! If anyone but Casey Kasem makes Shaggy's voice, it won't work. Believe me, <br /> <br /> This shameful program has nothing new. Scooby Doo is much better. Why change the winning format? This trash can then return to Scooby.
