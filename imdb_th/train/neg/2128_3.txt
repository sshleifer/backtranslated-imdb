An unnecessary remake and can't get close to capturing the original charm. Extremely long causes more than a few yawning. This version is politically correct. The film lacks style and most of it lacks talent, not just acting. But the direction, scene, costume and others are all below standard There is obvious disregard for the details of the time period. Vanessa Williams is the only actor who shows any talent. Tyne Daly is not bad. They should be left alone who is good enough. The singing is in good range (Vanessa Williams) to the poor (everyone). See the original version 1963 and skip this There is not much here to suggest.
