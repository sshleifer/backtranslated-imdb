I want this movie to be zero. But that's not an option !! This movie !!! Women cannot perform their duties. I should know that it will suck when I see Bobby Brown. No one in my house believed that I didn't change the channel after the first 15 minutes. The idea of ​​a black woman as a sharpshooter in the West was ridiculous. It's not just about race. But is sex The combination of these two things is ridiculous. I'm sorry because some people in the movie aren't bad actors / actors. It is not credible as a movie. It may be 'fun' with certain groups of people. But I'm not in that group. Haha. And using great lines from great and wonderful movies ... "That's all I have to say."
