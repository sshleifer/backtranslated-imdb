Another story in the long line of flicks made by people who think that knowing how to use the camera is the same as telling a story within 15 minutes. Help eliminate all doubts A half-talented actor was killed in a 10-minute movie, so we left a stupid character that ran around to do stupid things. Movies with a low budget could not buy expensive special effects. Therefore, the CGI is not surprising. But at least it is the right attempt The creatures are terrible, as seen when they fall on the sidewalk, and the director continues to focus on the eyes, not even the red color shown in the mirror image. The conversation was clumsy and unpopular with some lines reminiscent of aliens or terminators. The final action scene takes place in the police station. There is also a copy from the Terminator. Everyone is hiding in an office with a mirror that Darkwolf does not collide. In the end, the girl called the hero "Good guardian", but he received both the original guardian partner and at least three civilians, not to mention dozens of police, including silver bullets and submachine guns. But this is a real expectation for bad writing: they can kill the beast after the credit begins when it holds a stripper while blinking red eyes. They take it to take care!
