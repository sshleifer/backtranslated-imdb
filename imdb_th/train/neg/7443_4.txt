There are some scary scenes that I like more than straight bleeding. But otherwise the movie is quite weak There are too many questions that have not been answered and when they try to explain everything in the movie, it is quite clear. After watching this movie, I still lost many ways. It reminded me of Silent Hill a few years ago. This film is not satisfied as well. But still better because it tries to work and the story is reasonable This one is not too much. <br /> <br /> Most of the performances in Abandoned are good, but the film was dragged up and never gave a satisfactory conclusion As I said above, there are some creepy scenes. But otherwise this movie is a mess Sorry, I can't recommend it.
