Something strange happens when you talk about global warming: science goes out the window and "faith" and "consensus" become the topic of conversation. <br /> <br /> It's because of the truth. That I rated Al Gore's documentary failure. <br /> <br /> Instead of encouraging intelligent discussions, he continued to debate at the level of "faith" and "consensus." When you try To sell the world for millions of dollars to "Stop Global Warming" You may have problems telling science truth: We do not know how much global warming today is caused by humans. Maybe not at all. Maybe it will be part or maybe the next ice age and we are very lucky not to cause trouble in the world. <br /> <br /> But the truth is that we still don't know. /> <br /> So we ask "believe" in "consensus". Never mind. Any scientist who has strayed from that "consensus" has been separated. Never mind that scientific questions about straying from consensus Einstein could not "believe" in concurrence, Copernicus or Galileo could not. <br /> <br /> Why did you despise the researchers who would develop the field by asking? Difficult question? If global warming cannot be ignored, there are actually some people who test that the theory cannot be threatened. <br /> <br /> What happened here? That is the movie that I hope Al Gore will do. Istead chose to support his support with the true "believers" of "consensus." <br /> <br /> Really sad.
