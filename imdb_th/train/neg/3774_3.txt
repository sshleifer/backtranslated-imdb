This movie is an old story and misses the mark. It is very far compared to 89 Batman that he tried to do. That female singer, her name cannot do, and we see why her film service provider is dead. Notice that this movie died at the box office. No one watched this movie on TV as well. My uncle and father expect Batman and the impression of the movie to be like Cop Rock. Not worth the rental. 3/10
