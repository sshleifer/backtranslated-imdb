I will start by apologizing to filmmakers everywhere using the word "Filmmakers", "movies" or "movies" related to this subject, but "criminals" and "crimes against humanity" seem slightly violent. <br /> Writing: pathetic <br /> <br /> Director: Pathetic <br /> <br /> Acting: Pathetic <br /> <br /> Movie: Not suitable for words <br /> <br /> Technical skills used in the collection. This cruelty: Nothing. <br /> <br /> This garbage can be called a movie. The movies in most family homes come close to receiving that difference rather than Revenge Quest. This is not just a ten car video attached to the video. <br /> <br /> We will skip the story in this review because there are holes. Too many to cover at one time Suppose that it is worse than the rest of this movie. Calling one-dimensional performances will give them credit. The cruel little things that begin with and do much worse by scary videos and editing. <br /> <br /> The worst of this cruelty, although apart from the plot, must have an effect ... or rather it is disturbing. There are no gaps in the gun, no flashpots, and there are a few sound effects that are included in the "gun" sound of the music library or caused by the mouth. (Yes, you read it correctly) The filmmakers have the courage to record "shh" sounds for the elevator doors. I think he feels that it makes them sound even more. This should be set in the year 2031, after all. That does not explain the sound he created with the mouth for the fist fight. <br /> <br /> If it's not bad enough, the sound quality is terrible. (He just used the microphone installed In the video camera and it shows) the use of stock gun sounds is worse than not using any sound at all. The sound effects stand out from the rest of the soundtrack like sheep, yak in sheep and them. This clumsy picture: The bad guy came into the office building to find his victim. The woman began to run in fear. He raised his gun (uzi) and shook it. We clearly heard the sound of non-uzi. The woman ran away from the camera and suddenly one blood (just 1) exploded on her back. (It looks like she was a paintball) and she lay flat on her face. <br /> <br /> Please note that my explanation is too fair for the inaccuracies of the actual sequence. <br /> < br /> In another order, which is almost - but not too much - makes the movie look funny enough to be seen on the stairs. The bad guys pursue good people and women he protects the stairs down, shaking his plastic uzi all the way You may want to duck; There is a time-out effect flying around the place. <br /> <br /> I think Alan DeHerrera can't be locked to cause damage from this train. But he did everything to fix and release it. If there is any justice, there would be some karma with his name. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch industrial waste This - and I would highly recommend it - be sure to watch. For all scenes, raised almost every word from Bladerunner and AM radio that is twice as much in a walkie talkie. Try not to focus on the story. It will hurt you more if you do <br /> <br /> 10 stars and that is generous.
