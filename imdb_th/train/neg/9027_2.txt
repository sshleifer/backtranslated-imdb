May be revenge on us in front of the audience I watched this movie for 2 hours and I waited for the second actor to kick to make this movie alive by the name. But Costner never avenged his lover, her fate died and the movie ended. I was left wondering what the rest of this film was. If the movie is named Revenge, then the hero should get this movie at the end. I can choose to watch this movie or Black Rain. Fortunately, I saw other movies at the cinema instead. There is one good thing about this movie and it's a beautiful song. Listen to cd.dont see this. It's terrible.
