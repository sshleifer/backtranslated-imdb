Have you ever watched a movie and after that it was like "wtf!?" Great. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Decoy. <br /> <br /> Swipe to action video again. You can Forget immediately what you see or better. But have not watched yet Peter Weller and Robert Patrick are the stars and are wasting their time in this fast-paced mercenary mercenary for boring deeds that are very bad stories. Robert Patrick is especially interested in making action scenes that allow him to shoot a machine gun while standing on the hood of a moving school bus. Performed in Charlotte, Lewis and Scott Highlands of Canada (from Night Night Fame)
