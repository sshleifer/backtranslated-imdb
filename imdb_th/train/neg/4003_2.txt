Big disappointment This is one of the UK's best drama / detective crimes from the 90s, which developed an interesting character shown by Robbie Coltrane of Scotland. However, this once had little to increase and might suffer from submissiveness Inevitably lost due to increased expectations when the favorite program returned after a long absence, Coltrane couldn't do much. But he paid more attention to the murderer that was not interesting and in what he had to do, it seemed that he was not bored and almost bored. The story of a former soldier was written by the book and an attempt to update us about Coltrane's family life seems to be light. Perhaps if the author had all the series in front of them instead of just two hours, they would have written much deeper. Skip this step and watch the old crackers from the 90s which are much more superior.
