I don't think any of Van Damme's movies will beat Universal Soldier, but you don't know. This movie is good But not as good as 1 VD returned. Luc & have to fight again. He tried 2 here, but it might be worth the laughing smile. VD has a child this time. 2 Goldberg is cool. He made his famous gesture. VD and Goldberg had a good fight. It was the ending as of Day 1, but it was not that good. VD worked his best in his career, such as KICK Helicopter. Although the final ending should be longer than this. However, it's worth seeing. But it will never be above the top
