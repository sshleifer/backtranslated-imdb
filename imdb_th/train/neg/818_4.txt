This film is characterized by three reasons. <br /> <br /> First of all, it is clear that the success of both serials' Superman ', these low-budget features, were created and published to the George Reeves' and Phyllis. Coates' first appearance as Clark Kent Superman and Lois Lane Part of the opening was reused in the series outside the city. Silby oil, deep six miles, infiltrated the 'hollow world', let 'Mole-Men' come to the surface, forget the other holes (in the plot). > <br /> The second, unlike the SF movie that came in the fifty era, the hero played as an important force (and control) in preaching and forced to accept and accept the differences. Against the mob of the screaming group, there is no "gentle manners journalist" here! Clark Kent has the knowledge and self-confidence to be able to control the situation at any time. ("I will deal with this!"), Even helping in a hospital set to remove the bullet from the mole-man! As Superman, he is more gentle than Clark with Lois who is witty. But it is the voice of reason and patience as he stands against the vigilantes as "Nazi storm forces". <br /> <br /> Thirdly, you will notice that the transition from animation to animation Like Superman's Flyer in the two-story series 'Live Action' that flew in 'Adventures of Superman' has not happened yet.
