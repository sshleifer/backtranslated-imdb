I have watched this movie many times in many short film festivals and it has always impressed me that I have seen movie trailers! <br /> <br /> For movies, schools are well produced and directed, but the story ... It needs something else that will be a big and interesting movie. This is something that is lacking in some Portuguese short films - the script is quite shallow. <br /> <br /> But still ... I like this movie ... <br /> <br /> Parabens! (congratulations!)
