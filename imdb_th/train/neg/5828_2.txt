I disagree with another examiner who talks about Jodorowsky. <br /> <br /> Barney seems to be the most boring and without words. "Wise content" he can produce eye candy (And I like sweets) but the boastfulness and basic artistic emptiness just reduce all happiness (But really on the surface) of Jodorowsky or more filmmakers like Tarkovski or Kubrick (I love the Odyssey 2001 and never bored with the ending scene ...) That kind of art that M.Barney created is confusing. And fight with audiences who may start to appreciate the experimental film In general, empty post-modern "conceptual" art and check his interview. I'm just not buying it. Sorry. <br /> <br /> I never get tired of watching Alejandro Jodorowsky's movie while Drawing Restraint 9 is the most disappointing. Especially as it proposes the possibility of being something that actually tells something in the heresies (Such as the beginning and the dance, excellent choreography and preparation for ships that will sail out "boats" on the sea ... of feces is a valuable object (If it's a stool) Those "pearls" diver ... Everything can create fantastic surreal movies with some content. But it was not and the scary scene of dressing and fake tea ceremony ... it would be ridiculous, forgery and deceit But how ridiculous? <br /> <br /> I have a very beautiful scene. But the whole movie became boring and hypocritical and empty and fake until it made me Physically ill <br /> <br /> And it doesn't have a good rhythm. I like movies with slow rhythm. But this was just boring in some scenes - because it was a fake and fake - so I was forced to see for a long time. <br /> <br /> The image of this movie is a killer art and spiri in my view. <br /> <br /> I want Jodorowsky more !!!
