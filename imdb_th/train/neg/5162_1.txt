This movie reminds me of "History of violence" which pretends to study closely about violence and violent behavior But ended up being a cheap action movie disguised as a movie about violence Dustin Hoffman and his new English bride moved to a small town in England and faced endless threats from a group of local cowards who didn't do anything but hang at the pub. Throughout the day and creating problems These men do not have a job, right? However, Dustin used everything he could and at the end of the movie he kept in his home and fought with each drunken attacker in a gruesome way, like boiling whiskey poured on somebody. The foot man was blown with a shotgun and someones head trapped in a bear trap. Funny that someone must have a large bear trap in a small British town, except maybe put a human head in it. <br /> <br /> Sam Peckinpah, who made "Wild Bunch", which covers the topic of Blood let the violence that no one lives. But it's done in style and you believe it Unbelievable dog straw First of all, the location is wrong and not working. Why should I put it in England? I might think that maybe in a place in town or in a small town in South America in 1930 or something. Second, it is not in my view that it has been clearly explained why these people were so violent, except that they were drunk and felt the need to kill Hoffman and rape his wife. br /> <br /> This Sam Peckinpah.
