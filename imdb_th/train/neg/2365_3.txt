This movie is terrible, bad, bad, bad, now I get that. I feel better then. This movie is not good from beginning to end. The story is lame The three-dimensional segment is terrible. Freddy is his worst comic character. Thank God that they killed him. And anyone who wants to see Roseanne and Tom Arnold is concerned. <br /> <br /> The only good thing in the movie is the little backstory we get from Freddy. Alcoholic (Alice Cooper) who is insulting. <br /> <br /> Besides that, everything is terrible. There are quality actors here (Lisa Zane and Yaphet Kotto) and they do their best. But the results were terrible The half hour that I used to watch this movie was and an hour and a half I couldn't come back.
