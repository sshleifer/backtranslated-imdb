Hobgoblins .... Hobgoblins .... Where do I start?? <br /> <br /> This movie is for Manos - The Hands of Fate and Future War for their money like the worst movie ever created. This is fun to laugh at, which Manos is just a pain to watch. Hobgoblins will end with a time capsule somewhere as the perfect movie to describe the words: "80's cheeze". Performances (and I'm using This word is loosely), so badly, Hobgoblins is the worst puppet you've ever seen and fighting in the garden must have faith. Movies are the perfect vehicle for MST3K and that model is the only way to watch this mess. This film gave Mike and a lot of ammunition to pull one of the funniest liners they had ever made. If you try to watch this thing without getting help from Mike and Bots ..... God can help you !!
