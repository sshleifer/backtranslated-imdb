I didn't comment But i think i have something to say I watched this movie two days ago and although I think it is not a complete waste of time. (Probably because of the money for the manufacturer), but apparently it has serious problems It has a very good movie shooting and good (but little) songs. There are many talks about Ana Cristina Oliveira, but let's talk honestly. She is not a true performer and she has a permanent balance between acting beyond normal and unusual performances. Her performance went well because there was no one like Odete in another movie: Crazy? be sad? innocent? Fraud? No one knows, so she ordered the rules here. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is a good example of the problem that most Portuguese movies suffer from: soundtrack, no permanent copying and results. Is the normal sound coming out of the blue People in other countries may think that Portugal is the most popular place. What made me excited was that some conversations were dubbed. But no need to solve the problem I have to say too It was strange to watch the movie, the first thing that made my mind in the first scene when the first character said: it was dubbed and all this to say that this movie has technical problems. <br /> <br /> In addition to This is also a problem with the script. It tries to classic from the first scene to the final scene. There is a fear of despairing to leave things temporarily and that shows. Obviously the author tried to make everything straight and he did it ... but it shows !! All the conversations are too expositive and there is no single speech that sounds like a line from the movie. It's quite raw and a little unpleasant. <br /> <br /> It's not that this movie is messy. I just think that the good part is so clear that I like to concentrate on the bad things. <br /> <br /> The direction makes the screenplay soft. All images are classic and not creative. But a beautiful image Great work from Rui Po√ßas now. <br /> <br /> Now, what I think is a problem is something that makes people disbelieve and laugh all the time instead of seriously thinking: men who play Is the person who is clearly not an actor Actually, it's an important role and I can't see why non-actors are involved. This guy is not an actor or a man who looks good. Which means that the whole film rolls down from the mountain because we never believe that one second that this beautiful woman is obsessed with him, even though he has gone away and his lover survived in a bad time Bad, get lost when all We see that this character is very indifferent. The world is full of beautiful people who are even tempting lovers. This world is full of good actors who are cute boys and can make people fall back after they leave. This world is full of great movies and great movies. C'est la vie!
