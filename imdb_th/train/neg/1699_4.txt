I'm a big fan of Lynche's work, so I'm excited when I find this DVD. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. Is a short comic that tries to show offensive and disgusting humor The animation is very rough, no doubt that using Macromedia, each cartoon has a big fat man, beat his family and act like a jerk to everyone he knows. Familiar with this vein movement, they may be quite impressive. However, if you spend time with Newgrounds.com Like me, these cartoons are no different from anything you have seen before. Many popular amateur artists in Newgrounds perform better than what appears on this DVD. If Lynch submits this work to the website, he will perfectly blend with some Newgrounds artists But since I saw this on the DVD instead of Newgrounds, I gave 4/10 instead of 7/10 because I would have something else. These cartoons are suitable for the internet. But with the name David Lynch, I expect better quality in both the story and the animation.
