Who might want the sequel to Bert I. Gordon's legendary "Food of the Gods"? Nobody of course But director Damien Lee thought it was a good idea. However, he gathered a slow sequel, which is one of the most repetitive films in horror history. "Gnaw" is the sequel in the title only because of the setting moved. Also the location of the late 80s (university campuses) and also the perfect and magical effects that were shown to the 80s perfectly This script hangs together by clich√©s, incredibly written dialog boxes and planning scenarios that are not thoroughly stolen from other horror classics (and more successful) Neil Hamilton.

In the event that you can't get enough of this garbage, there are many creatures that revolve around the mutant mice, such as the movie "Rats: Night of Terror" of schlock, the Italian movie "Willard" and "Willard". "Ben", 2003 "Willard" remake, starring Crispin Glover and the movie The Amazing Mouse recently by director Tibor Ticaks ("Rats") and John Lafia ("The Rats"). Go nuts!
