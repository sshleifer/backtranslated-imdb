I love horror movies that create a lot of mysteries, such as saying "Silent Hill" (which I think is quite good. But still lacking something) and movies that make you guess. I think this is one of those movies. At first, the movie begins with a really good suspicion and creates a good starting point for a good horror scene. But after that it collapsed from the hill and then it would be faster and faster I spoke quietly at the beginning of the hill because I was able to see a lot of "stealing" themes from this movie .. All I wanted to say was watching the hills quietly instead of this. than There is more doubt and the ending is much better .. and the best is that you won't feel torn like I did with this thing .. It seems like this will be one of them. "I like that movie, so I I will make it a very bad version of myself. "A kinda movie .. Oh and another thing ... Lordi .. In horror ... that's like trying to make a child with a bear that care" hug me and I will love you forever "Write on its stomach ..
