While I was sitting with an ordinary person on television, I wondered why Dianne Keaton agreed with this trash. This film uses a plot of nonsense designed to send garbage to thousands of homes. This film brings the political agenda to the next level. This film has no meaning and all credibility has disappeared from using too many rules But in the end, you have to remember the old words that you can't polish. I hope you will not lose your New Year's Day to see another movie that doesn't care. Now I know why the network started broadcasting Sunday night series to get rid of junk!
