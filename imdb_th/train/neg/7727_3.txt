I am commenting on this drama from the perspective of someone who read the novel first. And from that point of view, I can honestly say that while enjoying, I can see why it has not been broadcast recently. In particular, this mini has some serious problems such as: <br /> <br /> 1) It is a very scary miscast. The actors playing the new generation are 15 to 20 years old. Ali McGraw (45 years old) is playing Natalie Jastrow, which should be around Jan 26 - Michael Michael (39 at that time) playing Byron Henry, which should Will be around 22. Other Henry children and Pamela Tudsbury are played by actors who are too old for the characters that should be in their 20s. <br /> <br /> 2) Some performances are really bad. Ali McGraw At times, almost this mini can not be viewed. I saw more reliable performances in high school drama. <br /> <br /> 3) Bad governance. To be fair with Ali McGraw, poor performances and character development seems to be directed. Hitler's description is more than necessary. His characters come out to watch and behave like a villain rather than a charming, sometimes charming. But is often a brutal genius. Herman wooed him like a novel. Some of the other characters were created in a finished (Berel Jastrow). They didn't get the depth of the characters Wouk created for them. <Br /> <br /> 4) This mini is very old, hokey songs, subtitles that are pretentious. (It sounds like the words of a junior high school movie) and the melodic drama of the mini-melody makes it almost funny sometimes. In addition, often, Byron and Natalie have been prepared and it seems that they will be in 1979 rather than 1939. People who watch this story without first benefiting from reading the novel may not sit. Read all books Because it will come out more in the late 70s / early 80s. "Make yourself too serious." Drama plays a more important time than a television drama that is a modern American classic. <br /> <br /> Older and similar things do not work well. But this may be one case where creative and inspiring directors can create amazing, memorable and impressive works. I have never seen that happen because the remake will take a long time (15 hours) or longer to do that correctly and when receiving short attention from most people watching Americans in present
