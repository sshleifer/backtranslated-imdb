When I first saw the plot, I thought it would be a good movie. Am I wrong? The beginning of this film made it look like a strange group of people together and decided to create a low-budget movie. In the first 10 minutes, you didn't notice a wonderful performance, scary sounds and terrifying special effects Worse, just about 20 minutes, I asked myself I can only ask that question when I don't laugh out of the weakness of this film. The main actor has a preference for emotion and he attaches to it throughout the movie, even though he should pass love and hate and everything in between. The background makes me vomit because it makes me live another minute from the previous picture in the movie. Now we enter the center of the movie that is clear that they tried to cut Morpheus out of "The Matrix", even though he did a horrible job. Actors talk about "Star Wars" and the fortune cookie phrase is almost unbearable. At the end of the movie, you don't realize that it's the end of the movie because you think that the plot is finally developing. The character "Morpheus" dies. The only good thing about the movie. He mentioned a few words and what is the roll credit? There is no plot of bad performances. Everything is wonderful. It's not bad anymore. Please if you value human suitability, don't watch this movie!
