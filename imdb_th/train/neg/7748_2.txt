This movie is quite bad. Sci-fi is often my favorite channel, so I watch all the original movies that are playing. I don't really know whether this movie can be called original or not. Starting a zoo / amusement park on a remote island sounds familiar. What is it? Yes, Jurassic Park. But here are the Sabertooth tigers instead. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with children who don't like college. How many people on the island are searching for some treasure? One of them ended with a horrible death with the worst special effects I've ever seen. Blood looks like a lot of tomato sauce. In addition, at first, there were scientists who wanted to create the most swords, saber-toothed tiger. They had 3 people fled and were eating out or people invited to the island to see the tiger first hand. Again, sounds like Jurassic Park. The coolest thing is the Saber tooth that crawls on his front leg, killing the mad scientist with a strange toothy statue and passing through their necks. The funniest death I have ever seen on TV. <br /> <br /> The performance is wonderful. The special technique is terrifying. The CG Tiger is almost through the ground and even some sounds are closed. For example, when a student tried to escape, he used an ax to break the ax door into the door, and about 2 seconds later you heard the sound. This movie is quite bad. The magic of death is quite funny.
