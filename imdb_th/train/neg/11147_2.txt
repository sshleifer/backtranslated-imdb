I have nothing to comment on this movie. It's terrible that I have to put my first comment on the IMDb website to help some viewers save time and do more interesting things instead of watching this "movie" .. . What will everything do? Even staring at the wall is better. <br /> <br /> And because I have to write at least 10 lines, I tell you that low-budget movies, bad performances, no stupid actors. Wolves and others ... The story also presents something new. Special effects were created in the 80s style. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost as bad as the movie "Megalodon". <br /> < br /> Have fun! ;) (Not watching this movie)
