** 1/2 for Diane Keaton's jokes <br /> <br /> People should tell Ms. Keaton as well as your philosophy and Annie Hall's hat. <br /> <br /> This flick is too much. Sita, Keaton's daughter, died of a road accident while her boyfriend was still alive. <br /> <br /> Keaton, who was unable to contact the phone at first because she was in the sack with Her friend and pulled out The phone plug is sad with a new way for the grief. <br /> <br /> She retreated to the summer place where all Sara's friends stayed. She cleaned the house for two days, then began to reveal things. Various things that should not be disclosed It seems that Sara is so sweet that she will sleep with her boyfriend and a married man later. In addition, she had an abortion with this man. Now we all have this wrong trip. <br /> <br /> Her only hope is to find a hard diary that Sara kept. She also hoped that Adam, a playwright fan, would not include all of this in another drama. <br /> <br /> When you find a notebook, it will be written in Japanese. It is not a good news for mothers when the excerpts of the diary are translated by Japanese chefs in Japanese restaurants. <br /> <br /> In nature, everything seems to be bound in the end. <br /> <br /> The name of this shmaltz is from the Wizard of Oz. Every time Mama and Sara talk to both of them to surrender, Dorothy <br /> <br /> As if it wasn't enough during this strange mourning, Keaton told Adam that Will not be another Woody Allen In his film, the interior which he tried to imitate Ingmar Bergman was successful. Keaton also tried drugs with the group as well. Come, we can believe in realism, whether anyone in his right mind can be sad like this? <br /> <br /> Fair enough for this movie.
