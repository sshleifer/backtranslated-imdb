Why, oh, why do people take good material and feel the need to change it? When reading a book that was alleged to have been based on a movie a couple of years ago, I can say that there is little from the original book. I went into this movie with low expectations - I knew it would feel telemovie crappy - but it failed to find these things. <br /> <br /> This is not a prequel - the only relationship with Originally the name is not the story of Carlito Brigante. It is a story of a totally different character who received the same name. They just spit in front of Carlito's fans. Everybody there added insult to injury by selecting Luis Guzman, who plays the main character in the original movie in a different role. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. The most is now that this movie has been created. Discusses the original content of Carlito's Way book - what I want to see I feel the same way as Chopper - they have four books, including valuable interviews about content that is not a great character and able to create an excellent biography of Australia's most terrifying Underworld. Lick instead, they make a small movie of a pathetic crook (although Eric Bana's performance is spot-on). Now we will never see the first real up and down. The truth of Carlito <br /> <br /> The three stars are because of the flickering look alone. It's not shocking - there is a fairly good performance (Jay Hernandez is not Carlito, but he can do well in other roles. ) And the story is not bad, even Puffy Combs is suitable for his role But they misunderstood the nature of the geothermal world at that time (I'm a non-fiction crime) - What original movies and books are eligible. (Written by a lawyer now, Edwin Torres). <br /> <br /> The truth is that even though it doesn't stand alone - it may be the most frustrating prequel ever shot.
