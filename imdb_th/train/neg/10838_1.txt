The minute you give 'Art Movies' On 1/10, you have people who keep an eye on your foolishness. I will not try and prove that I am not a person who is able to challenge aesthetic aesthetics by issuing programs. 'Art home cinema', all I like or talk about the way I give "Classic cult" in 10/10. All I ask is that someone has explained to me the purpose and message of the film. <br /> <br /> This is the way I will summarize this film: editing. Picture of three unrelated urban legends, events followed by (short to help you 3 hours of pain) following - game host for children who are dying of lung cancer trying to fix things With a daughter who is addicted to coke, which he may or may not have raped when she As a child and a police officer, intertwined with the relationship problems while the star game contestants decided that he didn't want to be a failed boy, another fate that occurred in the game show. The contestants from the 60s that we see now are homosexuals who don't have a job. Fall in love with a bartender with wrought iron and need money for 'Oral revision surgery' while game show manufacturers are dying of lung cancer He collapsed with the son he had left many years ago and later became a master to help himself as a woman, even when the master's second wife suffered from guilt from being cheated by people. Dying And finally the rain (You read it correctly) and I urge you to collect the truly incredibly long and incredibly ridiculous speech that each character seems to be born without touching or other possible reasons to be sure. That this movie skips 3 hours and is classified as 'Modern epic' <br /> <br /> You may be thinking that I will be able to do better in the movie summary. (And you don't get confused) If I write a damn thing a bit, it may be possible in some sentences. Instead of being one ... Now you know how I feel.
