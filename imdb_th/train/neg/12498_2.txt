This film has a really good kernel story. The work of the men and women of the Coast Guard, especially in the North Pacific, is an item of heroes and legends. This film creates a good story with three endings (not satisfied), an unnecessary and pointless bar rival and two "romantic" relationships that refer to the same spark as the fire. The rescue scene is great - even though this model is a hockey model and that situation is not true. But the background seems weak and frustrating. Costner is particularly good. His hands are shown (see) Ashton Kutcher is flat but not scary. The main female character is one dimension. The best woman is one of the crew of the Coast Guard in the help center and she is on the camera for about two minutes in this movie. It may be a great movie - and Costner wants it!
