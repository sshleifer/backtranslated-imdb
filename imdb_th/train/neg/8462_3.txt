"Bullfighter" was made in 2000, but was released on video 5 years later for some reason. I wonder why? Possible: confusing stories, incomprehensible conversations said by Oliver Martinez, and annoying fixes? It must be I think the plot is Mary (Michelle Forbes) and Jacque (Oliver Martinez) going on a mysterious road. They meet many strange characters and avoid some evil ones too. The movie looks good and has a lot of style. But without content Most movies when trying to be subtle, do not call their own attention by developing a plot that is not answered and weak tricks. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the cover: Willem Dafoe is there for a time 2 minutes at most.
