The school of boredom (Simon Scuddamore) was sexually degraded by a classmate and then an explosion in the laboratory Many years later, every twitch employee was invited back to high school (since closing) to meet again. What they didn't know was that Marty invited them back to kill them. Then the storm began. They were trapped in the school and Marty began to take revenge. <br /> <br /> Very stupid. But that is about it The shame in the wound on Scuddamore is more cruel. (He was stripped of his head in the bathroom and caught fire) and felt uncomfortable to watch. Considering from Scuddamore, suicide soon afterwards made them almost invisible. In addition, the film also has nudity. There is a full forehead of Scuddamore (surprising for any movie) but a woman decides to take a shower alone ... after they know that the killer is walking around them! And there is a partner that must have sex This is the type of movie that the killer seems to know where everyone is and can move himself to them. It ended with a twist that wailed and rolled my eyes. Then another twist, which I wanted to throw something heavy on the TV! That show can be accepted - not good, but can be accepted. Caroline Munro is here too. She is a very beautiful but not very much girl. <br /> <br /> This thing has been 3 for murder and a bloody atmosphere. Otherwise, it will be the work of the mill and memorable. Scuddamore's tragic suicide caused the film to pay more attention than it deserved.
