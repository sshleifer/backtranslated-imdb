This movie is not good. Perhaps it is just the impact and expertise of acting and directing that we have seen with The Sopranos, but I just watched Prizzi Honor for the first time on DVD alone. <br /> <br /> Experience to watch. With the audience 24 years ago, must be very different But I must say that I was shocked at the end, not only the violence. But the idea that this will be a satisfying end. <br /> <br /> I enjoy a good shock. But it doesn't look like the character ... should be set? Every car looks like they were from the 1960s and still have the World Trade Center. {Completed in 1973} can be clearly seen in the scenes in many cities. <br /> <br /> Another way that this movie is bad It's just the idea that passengers can travel to the shore by using a knife on him. <br /> <br /> The audience of the mid-1980s found that the film was charming and funny. In the mid-eighties, the end of the difficulties: only you are alive.
