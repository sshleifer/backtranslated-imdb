That is the best way that I can describe this film, which focuses on a newly married couple moving into a house that is haunted by the first wife of a deceased husband under mysterious circumstances. Played out for one hour of pure boredom In fact, one of the funny things about this flick is that there is a warning at the beginning of the movie that promises everyone who dies in the coffin fear free. Believe me, no one took that offer unless someone came out with plastic skulls, peacocks, peacocks, strange planters and doors that were knocked out. And the worst song contains fixed tuba songs that sound like playing with the sixth grade students And you will understand the scary secrets clearly until you have to wonder what the people in this movie are thinking There were people killed while running and bumping into the head and the police would not be called to investigate. Yes. In the end, this is very slow. (Which is terrible when considering this film, it only takes one hour) boring, little things that people think easily Obviously, there is no average character in this movie.
