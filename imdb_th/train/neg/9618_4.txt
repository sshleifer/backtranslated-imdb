I must say that even though this movie will be formulated throughout the story that has been stolen from the movie, like Friday the 13th / I know what you did last summer. But this movie is not bad In fact, it's not as bad as most horror movies that Hollywood has recently released. Killing, though sometimes too little creativity is often like that. Actors are ordinary people, which are expected to receive from low-cost properties. But better at the Artisan / Lions Gate studio, which is much bigger than that My only real complaint that is not caused by the budget of this film, which must be small, is to end the planned "twist". I'm sorry. But this is what makes this film in the category that is not. Good for me The ending is stupid and stuck. Before that I felt a little bored but actually enjoyed it. 4/10
