What is the issue of creating a sequel that is not truly relevant to the original movie? There is no point. This is the reason why the next part of the Prom Night is not as good as embarrassing. <br /> <br /> The original movie with a group of children hiding a dark secret that eventually caused them to be killed. Can someone explain to me how the Queen Brahma would go up from the grave to the crown associated with that first movie? Prom Night 2 has a continuous plot hole that makes the audience suspect it was born. And how should it happen? But in the end I think you might call it one of the worst movies, you have to laugh by yourself.
