This movie really lacks talent. There is nothing really good that I can talk about this, in addition to the moral truth that is shown in the film's focus on people in the neighborhood participating in the fight against crime In addition, the movie has nothing: no good pictures, no good performances and no good script. I gave this movie with F and 2 out of 10
