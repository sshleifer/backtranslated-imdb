Gillian Anderson is an arrogant, driven professional woman with a career that selects the working class. OK. Danny Dyer for a night of fun. After a stupid accident in the countryside, they were brutally attacked. After recovering and after having the opportunity to meet one of the attackers, their thoughts turned out to be revenge ... <br /> <br /> I think "Straightheads" are terrible, violent, brutal, hateful, women and not at all. pleased If I don't like many phrases, I'll call "Straightheads" nasty videos Of course, it's a type of movie that doesn't have a direct budget release to the video during the dark days of the 1980s. Frankly, I don't know. "Straightheads" have been released. <br /> <br /> I'm not a rude person. I don't care about sex and violence in movies. But they have to marry a movie that has a) good plot or b) good looks or c) especially both "Straightheads" No, there is no progress in the plot or characters and do not explain too much and unexplained. Fortunately, "Straightheads" disappear quickly. It only takes 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because there are many interesting movies here. How often I say this But it's good if it's done correctly It's a shame. I really like Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer, but they don't hide anything with this movie. In particular, she is very insulting. (And still be especially suitable) <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good British revenge movie It's a little masterpiece last weekend. I should see his "This Is England" instead of serum serum ...
