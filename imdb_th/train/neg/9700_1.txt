I agree with most other people, losing photons and precious time. <br /> <br /> Almost no jokes that are worth writing. The only highlight from my point of view is Olli Dittrich as Pinocchio ("Egal, ich muss eh Waldsterben"). This reminds of the old times with RTL Samstag Nacht. It is difficult to explain the actors' performances because most of them seem. Will not have a good time during production and just "doing things". The camera is ok. The plot is ridiculous. I think you are ashamed even if you talk about this with a lot of beer. <br /> <br /> In addition to this I yawn all the time Has been considered for production and waiting for the end. <br /> <br /> My 9 year old son is happy to score 1 point here, almost 1 score too much ...
