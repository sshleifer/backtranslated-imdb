OK ..... This is the third time in the series of Carnos. Let the stars and dinosaurs dummies! At the beginning of the movie, you can't see the cause of Dino. When the body starts to count, you can only see Dino's vision, smart enough to hide the bad puppet! And in the next 16 minutes, on some special film teams with Scott Valentine as Rance's head, the team went into the warehouse and then they began to find parts of the body and bodies after the dino rampage after some big boxes. Fail in the team and you can hear the creepy screams of the Church !!! And then there was a black woman walking forward and now found one blood! It appears, hands hunt and slash her face. But if you pause when the hands hunt it, you can see that it's just a man with a hand puppet! WTF! The story is easy. 1. Terrorist attacks Some trucks cause, even if they wash the weapons there. 2. Where are they wrong, it will be a ten-ton hunter and one of the giant t-Rex! How can the t-Rex get together? 3. Rance and some nerds will kill the dinosaurs! Unfortunately, some stupid blonde girls tell him to catch one of them alive = (4. Sacred Jesuits, raptors, have a wheel on their success! T-Rex has a strange story on the neck. 7. Finally, this movie is good if you want a good laugh. 5/10
