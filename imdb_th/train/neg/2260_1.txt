Oh, Darling, Jerry may be the king of the talk show without problems. But this movie is a completely different ball game and he separated from his league. The script for this movie was so bad that I had to believe and regret to see a familiar actor like Michael Dictoff (80s action ?? B'movie king), Michael Jai White (see The latest in Sci Fi flop? Spawn '), including Surviving the Games' William MacNamara (who is involved in only half of the comedy situation in all movies!) Bowing down for employment If you are a fan of Jerry and then go to his TV program because it wasted both an hour and a half. After I finished watching this thing, I was able to catch Rocky 5, the last half hour on the TV, which seems to be a movie masterpiece in comparison. I think it is more than enough !!! <br /> <br />
