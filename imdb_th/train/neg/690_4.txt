If you've seen an eighty slasher, there's no reason to see this. Often the initiative is not the strength of the slasher cinema and is something that this film is seriously missing. There is not much that can be said about the Pranks. So I will make it faster. This film is one of 74 films that are included in the DPP Video Nasty program and that is the only reason I see it. Plot according to a group of children behind the dormitory during Christmas. While they were in the slasher, some people decided to start picking them out and this led to one of the most boring mysteries ever seen in the slasher movie. The fact that this movie is on the Video list Nasty is strange because even with a few blood-staged scenes, this movie is almost undamaged or vandalized. Anyone can not. But then again, there are five movies. Which has less blood than this film (For example, the witch who came from the sea) However, the conclusion of this film is the best thing about it, although the audience doesn't care who is the attacker at this time. It is quite well done. Overall, this is a boring and depressing slasher that even slasher fans can't miss.
