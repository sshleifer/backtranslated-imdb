I was unlucky to see this garbage in Sky Cinema Max on a cold winter night. I'm not a big fan of horror movies because most are just trash. This is worse: it's one of the most ridiculous pieces I've ever seen in my whole life. Horror movies? Yes, there are terrible things in this story: acting, scripts and special effects - Gosh. I laughed with this ludicrous effort to flick 90 minutes. In fact, it's a cartoon movie that I will give 5. You don't think of renting unless you want to ridicule the manufacturer. <br /> <br /> Vote: 2 out of 10 - don't vote one because it makes me laugh all the time ;-)
