This movie is terrible. It's good - in an unintended funny way. I can't stop watching it. I laugh a lot! It's like a parody of a romantic thriller, except that it's not a parody. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul plays Emily Wendell, the oppressed preacher wife who falls in love. C (Corey Xavier) The stranger and mystery that we learn in prison. The only thing that Xavier did wrong was a bad performance! Please note that he is not worse than other actors. You understand that the actors have no idea at all. They are in a really scary movie. They are playing it straight. Everything about this movie is not good: acting, scenes, scenes, love scenes, walking, plotting, twisting, music options. The climactic scenes are very ridiculous - before shooting in the church, then the last words of Luke. With Emily - I was wailing with laughter. <br /> <br /> Clearly Luke performed a lot of weights and knelt ab in prison and we saw many naked bodies. That may be the highlight of the movie.
