When this movie started in the first 4 minutes, it looks like a California travel book. I wonder if I got the tape together. Then I sighed in relief to see Paul Thomas in one scene with Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. Lovely. This is being spied on by Jimmy. (Tom Byron, younger) Jimmy's aunt (Honey Wilder) is concerned about his behavior, so she hired him as a private teacher. (Kay Parker) I can do without animals, play roles, robots or incest between the Byron brothers and Parker. There is a good sex scene. But it's not good enough to record this movie. Grade: D
