I don't know what is great about this movie. Even worse, why are everyone bothering to see this? First of all, there is no story. One can say that although there is no movie story, it should be worth watching because it creates a strong feeling. (Laughter, crying, fear ...) But in my opinion, <br /> You just see the picture for +/- 2 hours. It's more useful to do. <br /> <br /> I think you probably Can say that this movie is an experiment and it is a scary thing because it lacks everything But is this worth your valuable 2 hours and 7 Euros? For me, the answer is: No
