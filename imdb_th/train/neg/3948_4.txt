This is not a nasty video. But because it came out in 1994, when they were bored with the whole story in the UK, it was 75% The Boogeyman's repeat and would be banned for the same reason - whatever it is. <br /> < br /> At first, I was confused because I thought Annie (Kelly Galindo) might be different to Lacey, but she was a problematic person with the vision of a boogeyman like in the first film. They are not the same person. <br /> <br /> After seeing the murder in the bathroom and seeing the address as well, Annie, her psychiatrist and psychology psychology student who looks very much like a man. In a cheap romance novel and butter advertisement, head to the house and of course it's the same bathroom. 24 hours later, a murder occurs as she explains. Of course, we have no idea who this boobilicious woman is or why she was murdered. <br /> <br /> Then the movie will turn into the story of The Boogeyman, with a special image that we didn't see in the original. Like the original Unfortunately some good scenes were cut, but 90% of that scene was there. Why should this film be shown again? Do they find images in the trash? What is the purpose? <br /> <br /> We will never know, and even if the psychologist tells Annie that she is missing But we all know that bogeys will never die.
