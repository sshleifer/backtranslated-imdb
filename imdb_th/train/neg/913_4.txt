OK now, let's see What's funny in the first movie? I know people with funny accents, people who fall into the water, stupid boats and funny comments between the two teams. In this movie, they have twisted the parts that focus on the highest values. Many people fall into the water for unpredictable reasons. Boatcrash examines the funny opinions between the two teams. They try but fail. There are also personalities they follow in this movie This film should be about what happens in the water, not on land. I regret having to say that there is an excess between the comedy section and the sponsor of this movie being badly exploited. Overall, I give four out of ten because it has some funny parts
