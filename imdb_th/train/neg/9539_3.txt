Many children set up the theater to watch horror movies all night. However, at night, someone among them kills them one by one. Who is it ... and why? I saw this in the cinema. Back in 1991, I looked forward to it - but the boys! It doesn't work at all. The location is a good place. They have attractive young actors and some advantages like Dee Wallace Stone on board ... but it doesn't work. The story stopped halfway through. (It may be because there is a big cut before the film is released) The killing is quite bloodless and stupid. <br /> <br /> It's really terrible. With a better script, this may become a great horror movie. It stood even though it had been forgotten and the actors were shy. (I heard that Stone didn't talk about this.) I gave 3 and that was for the actors.
