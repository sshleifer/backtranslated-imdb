In the first forty minutes, the empire has a real shape: it seems to be a strong gangster, confident and unknown. At that time, I didn't know why I thought it was good - but now I do it. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems of this movie is that it is purely obnoxious. I don't care about movies that have the mind and things to prove the point - for example, Jackie Brown - but all of them are very shallow. You literally feel a knot in your stomach. Another important issue is the protagonist. He was satisfied with himself, being an arrogant person. But still a nasty person, not bad He seems to be not tight enough to be a female killer. The truth is that at the end of the day this film is completely pretentious. Not slippery, not smart, just boring and meaningless - this regulation should avoid all costs. <br /> <br /> * From ***** (1 from 5)
