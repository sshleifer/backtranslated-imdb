Let me first identify that I like the story of the West and the Civil War. I still consider John Ford to be a great director. I have the same high feeling of acting ability of John Wayne & William Holden. <br /> <br /> I can't remember how I watched this movie when it was first released in 1959 last night. First I saw it since then. <br /> <br /> According to my vote, 4 people can say that I don't like movies. <br /> <br /> Now I'll try to tell you some bugs. <br /> John Lee Mahin, the screenwriter of Harold Sinclair's novel Which is very talented and writes very good scripts, this script is poorly written and poorly researched They spoke of the terrifying condition of Andersonville prison at the time of the movie. Andersonville was not activated. They also used rifles that were not used at that time. <br /> <br /> John Ford directed the movie for over 40 years and won the Oscar four times. He had to be sick during doing this style. His normal disappeared It may be that this film is in the south and east and not in Monument Valley. <br /> <br /> Usually, he has a company that shares the shares he uses in most movies, most of them disappear at the time. this This time, only the youngest cowboy, Hoot, Gibson & Ken Curtiss, has a role and of course Anna Lee has a small role. There are no other familiar faces except the 3 stars (see below). Most of them are Miss here sadly. <br /> <br /> Now we arrive at the main star John Wayne & William Holden. The Duke must be sick. He seems to be leaving here. This kind of role often fits perfectly with his style. He is enough here. William Holden doing the best thing possible But nowhere is it as good as he used to be. <br /> <br /> Need an actor in this type of movie. In her first major role (The second movie) is Constance Tower, which is a very beautiful person, but not really an actress. She still has a TV role. Let me be kind and say that you have a long career based on her appearance rather than acting ability. Also in the caas because Ms. Towers servant is Tennis Star Althea Gibson. I'm glad she's stuck with tennis. > <br /> The remaining production credits are far from the high standards of John Ford movies. Others, others, a few military songs made by poor cavalry The action scenes are good. But coming to the end of the movie <br /> <br /> Score * 1/2 * (from 4) 47 points (full 100) IMDb 4 (full 10)
