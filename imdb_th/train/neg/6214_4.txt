What?!?? Why do people say that this is Just facing it, the ending is the worst ending in the history of the movie! 4 people left and the whole world has ended! Not to mention the character 9 is an idiot. Every time he kills everyone, 1 is correct all the time. If he sacrifices 9, then this will not happen. People give life for stupid reasons and for nothing ... to rain. I admit that movies have different parts and all the concepts are interesting. But most of them are monotonous Is there anyone else that feels like this? The "Lord of the Rings" character died for stupid reasons, almost without character development and asked himself honestly that it was good to have only four people in the world. It's ridiculous and ridiculous It's one of the shortest movies I've ever seen and thank God! Robots change the way human creativity works in some way! It's been done hundreds of times! This movie is very stupid. Go to see a valuable movie. Look at Star Trek, The Hangover or Inglorious Basterds. That's a good movie!
