I searched for a copy of The Forest because I was watching VH1 special. I think "Where are they now?" And saw the video box blinking across the screen between the part of the Corky Pigeon actor. This Silver Spoons list is an important lease. Nothing here In fact, I spent four months watching from beginning to end. I kept it as a boredom, put it on the side and forgot it and then stumbled it and tried again to pass it. Obviously, the angle of this film is intended to make it different from its partner, the supernatural element is manifest. And of course, here it doesn't work. I can't get the leadership of a man. I expect them to look at their palms during longer conversations to read cheating. The situation at the beginning of the couple's decision to go camping together is awkward and dumb. I guess the only thing to say about this is the scene where the man fell and broke your leg. You will see the bone sticking out of his flesh. It is quite a good makeup. Man, am I really looking for positive terms? A horror movie that doesn't have a single budget at a level that isn't as good as it should be. Home Sweet Home
