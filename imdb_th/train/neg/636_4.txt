Two farmers struggling in life in a small village in China. Wang Lung (Paul Muni) bought his future wife Olan, who became his slave. (Louis Rainer) The American actor appeared in the lead role, talking to a fake accent and emphasizing the traditional and masculine ideals. Good wife, children and land is the best thing for men to have. They are seen as assets and investments. Since it is a film with limited budget, which has many specialties to collaborate to create a huge scene and special effects occur, filmmakers are not at risk to hire famous actors Luise Rainer to win an Academy Award for performance. This is the worst story in the movie. Her immutable face creates a barrier between her and the audience. Ohan should be the heart of the family and the best character in sympathy. On the other hand, Paul Muni gives better performance by showing his talent again. Another problem of this film is the ending. It seems that Franklin didn't know when to finish the picture. This movie can be dangerous if it is a true example of Chinese culture and tradition.
