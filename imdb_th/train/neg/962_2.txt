There is a chance that if I watch it again, I may be physically ill. This movie is very annoying ..... unless you believe in spirituality, reincarnation and other focus which this time promotes. big "The new cycling of the soul" They call it here Puh-leeze. <br /> <br /> This story has been done many times before with movies such as "Heaven Can Wait". also Unfortunately, they have to lose the ability of Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson. At least <br /> <br /> At least it's a rather convincing, intelligent language. That is the only redemption quality of this movie.
