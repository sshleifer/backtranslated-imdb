This movie is about Japanese women who have a passion for calligraphy on the skin. <br /> <br /> The story is absolutely strange. I don't see "sensual" or "erotic" undertones. The plot changes. Ancient art forms are porn fetish. In addition, scenes filmed in Hong Kong will show the bad parts of Hong Kong, such as airports in the city center, poor living conditions and noise pollution. I always thought that "The Pillow Book" was an insult to Japanese culture and Hong Kong's environment. <br /> <br /> "The Pillow Book" is a boring movie. Stay away from it seriously.
