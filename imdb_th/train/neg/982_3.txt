The true star of this nonsense story is the glorious technology. Movies that can be seen with eyes, movies cannot stimulate the mind and heart. At first I was intrigued by the thoughts of Ditrich and Boyer who left the religion to "find" their abilities for love. What followed was a huge disappointment. Boyer is the only true actor in the manufacturing sector and is suffering. Trish's amazing wardrobe shows her performance - sometimes her face is scary to look at - a scary mask. As a monk, Boyer holds the formula for the liquor temple. (Which reminds me of the true story of the tragedy) - when he left "Marriage to God" The reaction of his fellow monks was shocking and feared that they would expand their religion. The audience felt that Boyer eliminated his past very well. However, the subsequent journey is entirely predictable.
