I can see a little girl enjoying this show. But calling this program is a ridiculous family show. I was surprised that it was well remembered after many years. It was a very interesting and stupid performance of a widow who lived with the brother of a dead wife and foolish friends from the school and others in the season. In general, the whole line plot would have lessons. Boring In the middle of each episode, some people were angry with each other and each episode they did and it ended with a joke without light. For actors, I don't like them as well. Bob Zagat is not as painful as his father. As a parent, Dave Coulier is a note that is a 30-year-old joke that has a cartoon voice and acts like a child and he is scary. But he looked very lamenting, it was hard to see him The first female DJ on the show is a truly bad performer and has never had any emotions. Stephanie's middle-aged girl is too conservative as an annoying little sister. Michelle, the youngest woman, shows that the actress Olsen is a bad guy. You can tell at any time that they are closed. The plot of the plot of the story is too stupid. This is a "family" program that tries to replace good content with cuteness and love, and although these things are necessary for performances about the families they He used it too much. This will be remembered as the sitcom that I like the least in the 80s and 90s. <br /> <br /> My rating: Bad performance TVG 30 minutes
