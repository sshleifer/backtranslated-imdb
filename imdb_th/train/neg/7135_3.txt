I am sorry to say that there is no way in my opinion. Enzo will be able to truly follow Saleen S7 Twin Turbo. The power of the weight advantage that is possessed by the S7 is great. S7 has the power: weight 3.93 pounds / horsepower, while Enzo has 4.61 pounds / horsepower. The lower end of the S7s is also good. <br /> <br /> For other parts of this movie, I must say that it is below the pathetic standards. The story is too weak. The performance in this lemon is worse than the soap in the daytime. <br /> <br /> I can say that as much as it is an article about negative psychology, it is a kind of gem. There is nothing in this movie without a clear definition of narcissism and sociology. Everything about these wealthy functions makes their stones disappear while showing signs of remorse for innocent road users as they cause injury or death. <br /> <br /> Ratings because it doesn't force me to walk out of the cinema. I still think that having an amazingly beautiful brown hair with a blue-eyed executioner while leading a woman helps him to escape from the utter abyss ... even though there is no way that she sings to keep her on. The cover of br> ps: The person who plays the role of Jason is SOOOOO, the smoothest version of James Vanderbeek.
