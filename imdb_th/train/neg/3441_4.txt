What is this? Some people read Stephen King and Sartre clearly in the same semester. We have been a mixed existence with cheap fears. There are many disturbing moments. But each one was canceled by scary music. CGI or acting. <br /> <br /> The problem with this strange storytelling is that it feels lazy. Even David Lynch's work felt like that all the time, and as with his interesting shows and movies, it ran too far. And sadly, it only takes 98 minutes. <br /> <br /> The actors are interesting and that is a limited matter. But just didn't make the characters cute enough for us to take care of their fate ... no matter what they are The final scene makes the whole story vague.
