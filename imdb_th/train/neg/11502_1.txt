This film is slow, slow and without a plot. It conveyed the life of a group of workers who had been removed from the ship. One of the elderly is sincere in trying to get a job. There may be some social criticism here. But it was confusing because no one painted in a very sympathetic light I watched all the boring things and created expectations for many payouts. No luck. IMDb's ratings are always good for my taste. What is superior to 6.5 is worth watching. <br /> <br /> And my wife says that Javier Barem doesn't look good in this movie. He's not my type, so my agreement doesn't mean anything. <br /> <br /> Give me 1 sigh.
