Must see because it looks like a terrifying place - a prisoner looking for magic books, right ?! claustrophobic horror ensues, etc. <br /> <br /> But there seems to be no story to go with a good idea. Instead of horror, coldness / physiology, it relies on the effects of open fire and horror. OTT body - which is not afraid of anything if you are over 12 years old. <br /> <br /> The logic at the end is ridiculous. With the characters killed for anything other than the number of bodies Lose a good character - which is the best thing about this movie. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the budget is low, which doesn't make me lose. This movie is really nowhere and I believe I will say. Like this, want to remake Hollywood. You just relax in this version. Of course, not in the same league as the French film. Other films that were released in the last few years, such as the Red River, which is viewed / entertainment at least malefique, cannot be viewed until the end. And I bet you can guess the ending before you can watch the movie Really disappointing - impossible to recommend
