This movie is absolutely pathetic. Pathetic screenplay and lack of any story made me see three losers attacking a bikini baby. Sometimes I feel like watching the episodes of Beavis and Butthead. I can't watch the whole movie. Emran Hashmi disappointed and Hrshitta Bhatt wasn't that impressive. Celina Jaitley wasn't bad. Posing with Anu Malik and his passion for Shayaris. It's hilarious. The song "Sini Ne" and the remixed version are very good. You can rely on Emran lip-lock and lip-synching a chartbuster at all times. Overall, it seems that Emran doesn't have a good script from Bhatts to spare him this time.
