That's a good thing Have a bad story Then they are The Sentinel, the "political thriller" that ranked the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot of the mole in intelligence is good. But never had a movie with a lot of potential being fully killed Directed by "Edginess Hands" by Hampton Johnson, all actors in this movie seem to be working with an automatic pilot. Even the great Michael Douglas looks boring here. I can say that I have never seen another movie that has many vulnerabilities. The predictable twist of the first table and the character's motivation is so ridiculous that they inspire laughter from the audience. Avoid this at all costs. This is the devastation of the movie without redemption.
