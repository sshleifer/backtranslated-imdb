Brokedown Palace is not the movie I want to watch. I do not like this movie when some Aussie men smuggle drugs in Thailand and accuse Claire Denes and Kate Beckinsale about drug trafficking. I will not go to that country, whether after I watched this movie In fact, this movie has a foul odor. I like to go to Germany to meet beautiful single women. Germany is a country that I tolerate. I want to stick with the United States instead. After I saw some movies in the theater, including allegations of drug trafficking, I left the theater and received a refund because I could not tolerate this film. If you are going to Thailand to meet someone who may be a drug smuggler, forget this!
