Ok, I was bored and decided to watch this movie. But I think the main thing that makes this movie worse is that there will be a one hour video, then basically that same hour is repeated 4 times. It consists of 1. Collect troops and talk about the attack plan. Up with the wife of the man 3. the way of the soldiers walking in the long line 4. the men ran up the hill and shot, usually the first person to be shot in the head Then there are 3 other men to save his life. 5. Defeat the enemy and call the base to success. 6. The man flashes back to his wife and sings 10 minutes. That is the basic movie and the same event occurs about 4 or 5 times. Every time it goes back to his wife, it will show to the man, then his wife and him. There are about 10 men or more who have a history. Therefore, it takes a lot longer. In addition, they cannot kill their enemies except with a bayonet or bomb. I like music and there are many actions, even though the actions are repetitive. Overall, I might not see it again. But it wasn't too scary
