I apologize to all the fans, but this is a useless movie. The performance is not good, even the wood is too early and unexpected. I think there should be a twist at the end. But it became annoying and confusing what's up? A friend who kills everyone is one of the hunters? Try again. <br /> <br /> It's hardly the original. And that is saying something. <br /> <br /> I think anyone who has been chosen, who wrote the script and anyone who thinks about the concept, should be fired. This movie. If someone wears it at a party, throw the disc out the window and create a good horror movie such as Silence of the Lambs or The Shining.
