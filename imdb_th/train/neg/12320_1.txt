There are no spoilers here. But I am a fan since Waking the Dead started with the last series, which only 3 people have passed horribly. The story is not similar to the original idea of ​​the series. I found these 3 things in one of the last jokes. As a BBC license payer after the show, I submitted a complaint to the BBC to pass on my disappointment. I was surprised that Trevor Eve's talented actors and Sue John Stone didn't object to the story. These actors were with these characters for 8 seasons. Of course, they saw that it had disappeared in every direction. It's a good job because it's the last series or next series. May start with a team that investigates the death of Father Christmas! <br /> <br /> Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England
