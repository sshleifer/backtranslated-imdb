I love science fiction. I am passionate about Egyptian mythology and I like digital animation. I think movies that combine these three things at least should be fun. I'm not wrong: the story (or actually lacking) is not completely fulfilled and lacks imagination - while fantasy is often the biggest element of any science fiction story, the dialogue and performance are worse than in General porn movies In particular, Thomas Kretschmann gives a new meaning to the word 'Bad performance', bad performances will not be a big problem, if only 'director' Bilal is not serious about himself. Every line seems like they should be poets. It seems Bilal thinks that he really has created art here. There is no art or poem found in this piece of garbage. But only pretentiousness! This man should be attached to the creation of cartoons because he failed in every possible account as a director. The worst thing is the horrible digital animation that is really ugly that makes watching this movie a painful physical experience. The graphics seem so fake that the werewolves look like 'Van Helsing' like live actors! And because half of the characters are CGI animations, it is quite a problem that the CGI effects look very fake if the gods of Egypt actually exist. Bilal is dead because they have no doubt that revenge His horrors for the ridiculous way that he showed them in a terrible movie
