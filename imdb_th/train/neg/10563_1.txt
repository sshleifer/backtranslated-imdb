The time spent watching this movie was a waste of time. I don't like science fiction I do not reject any type of work because good work can be done in all types. This movie But not working well I can't blame the picture. (When not related to the make-up of aliens) and the special effects are impressive The story is not a bad book for a trekkish comic book, but the obvious image is where the attention / interest / money of every manufacturer goes. The direction that alternates between sloth and confusion. (Either not sure who did what and what to do with one person and at least one important connection point) There is no basis for reading most lines except the hint of "It's a way in the face, and the director told me that I should be crazy / sad / scared / scared / whatever. Okay, so it's a pilot of the SF series. Should be regarded as a must for the amazing media. I was surprised that the pilot sold the series or money in the hands of the expert?
