This is a sub-review that is not the first zombie to finish. But this movie is worth the review. Dinocroc is a good movie in general. Unfortunately, it's still an obvious b movie. Dinocroc himself looks good, but I think the movie needs a little more weight, like in the action and violence scenes, because whenever showing that the croc or In the fight scene, nothing happens except the croc appears. Running out in the process over and over again, Jane Longenecker is hot, which is a great advantage and the performance is better than the average and what is worth. The most disturbing thing is that the crocodile looks at the movie instead of a cartoon. * The Curse of Komodo * I enjoy this movie enough to be glad to have more sequels than I can say about movies. Some general topics, including 3/6 stars and worth watching
