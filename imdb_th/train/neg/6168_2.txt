Hmmm, IMDb ranking at 7.5, good comments, bla, bla ... Okay, my friends and me, two of us ordering pizza to sit down and want to see something cool like Ishi But bare blood It's a complete garbage. Okay, the scene with women who like to eat is quite remarkable, but that is nothing more than this. I will not make the page hot. Others do it. I just want to stop advertising. But watch and rate yourself Maybe we can push that rank into Another thing in my heart: the soundtrack is worse than Carpenter used to be - John's excellent ok ... :) 2/10
