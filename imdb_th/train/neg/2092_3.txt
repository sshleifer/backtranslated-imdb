In general, "Caprica" ​​is the story of the origin of the Syed. The location of the show is interesting. However, the author follows many stories and is clogged with too many POV characters, causing the narrative to fail. The plot progresses with ice speed spreading the tension that may have. No matter what happens in a small episode or nothing, <br /> <br /> Daniel Graystone (Eric Stolz) is a military contractor working on military robots using stolen chips. Unfortunately, his only work model is powered by the AI ​​version of his deceased daughter, Zoe, who died from a suicide bombing caused by the Soldiers of the One (STO), a radical group. Mono Adama (the father of the Adama commander of Battlestar Galactica) is struggling to keep his family together while searching for his daughter's AI version. Caprica also suffers from similar problems with many original stories. We already know how it will end. (Like Zylon developing their own civilizations and rebelling against humanity)
