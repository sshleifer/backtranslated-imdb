I remember this movie when I was 13 (many reviews looked like AGE 13!) With school friends. We all want to see Billy Crystal in his first movie and fall into a typical commercial advertisement that tells us that this is a great joke. We passed about 45 minutes and everyone agreed to leave the theater. It's strange and without the flavor and the distant vocals from Billy Crystal's ability makes us laugh. We don't laugh. I accidentally stumbled upon this criticism and decided to register just to tell others in the world that this movie is so rotten.
