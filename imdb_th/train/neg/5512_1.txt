Put a DVD of this flick in the time capsule and it will show examples for future generations as a perfect example of the lowest level guarantee of 1 to 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Bill Cosby and Ray Romano has received the highest rating and earns tens of millions per year with their TV series. But each person is not successful in the big screen offering This is true for those who have other TV personalities - probably because many stories that are presented for two hours or more seem to be suitable for dancing 10 minutes or at most, ie 22 or 23 minutes of drama. Half time Hour program <br /> <br /> This film has no single component that will guarantee two or three minutes of time on MAD TV, SNL or anywhere else on the screen or stage.> <br /> Its starting date. Was identified as 2002, but the release date - to DVD only - was shown in 2004. It was also filmed shortly before Rodney Dangerfield died. So one of its ransom values ​​was A few hundred thousand dollars for his heirs. <br /> <br /> I have never heard of this before. But found that when turned to my set Some movies are really scary as they give you the highest rating. On the contrary - very bad that you can call back to the 9 or 10 "Plan 9 from Outer Space" is the best example - and Bruce Jenner. / Village People commented that "Can't stop music" is another story. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this flick is too short. Although Rodney's previous work (including some of his fellow members) didn't reach "Citizen Kane" or "Casablanca", there were a lot of humor and stories that were of little interest. <br /> Unfortunately This presentation doesn't seem to have the value of this content, even a minute or two.
