I've seen bad movies (Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me, Batman Forever), but this movie is so scary so boring, so I went half way and couldn't bear the rest. Special abilities such as Kenneth Branagh, Embeth Davitz and Robert Duvall and the story of John Grisham. What happened? Branagh is a big lawyer who fled one night with Davitz, her father (Duvall), a psychopath that hung her cat, etc. etc. So Branagh sent him to the house and he immediately escaped. (I don't know what to do) Robert Downey jr, Daryl Hannah, Famke Janssen and Tom Berenger are all mixed with a story that is slower than the stationery. I want to be like this, and as a big fan of Grisham, read all about this movie and I (foolishly) expect something interesting. This is the worst movie I have ever seen and I hope I get a refund. * Exit *****
