"I went to see the movie to see 'Beat Street' / It's not bad. It's neat. 'Neat /' Krush Groove 'flicked. I'm not interested. br /> <br /> Want me to stop? <br /> <br /> That's just a small sample of rhymin, rhymin's stupa-fly style, which is shown in this movie and location license. Seriously lamenting (that 80s-speak for the great f * cking) as a spokesman for Mario Van Pee. Charles was one of the performers. And as an actor, Mario Van Peebles is one of the hell of bodybuilders. <br /> <br /> Every movie that calls itself "Rappin" "delivers better than the highest standards of that type. Why is a 6 year old child rolling in the corridor, even going back to the standard day as high as "Webster" is low because this rap is weak? Very weak so far, or Comedy Central will touch it with a gold chain 10 feet. <br /> <br /> Blondie's "Rapture" is a def po next to Dr. Suess in Hood. So don't be a fool. Avoid this movie. <br /> <br />
