OK. The first thing is good: Sher's acting and movies. Although I am not a fan of Cher, but it gives a great performance and her part is well written. The movie is well made and captures romantic love. <br /> <br /> The rest: some storyline, Nicholas Cage's performances and efforts without harm and totally weak to Describe the family of Italian-American families from New York. First, every time the cage opens my mouth, I'm cringed. I don't know what kind of accent he uses. I say honestly, not sure whether it's a New York or Italian accent that I've heard. It's quite surreal And it is not because I am a person attached to the correctness. His voice floats in my ears and I like Nicholas Cage in other performances. Secondly, this is detailed information. But I have a relationship with Italy, friends and many acquaintances in New York City, and frankly I laugh more and feel more happy to appreciate the Italian ethnic family than this movie. And that would be a boring night at home What disappointed
