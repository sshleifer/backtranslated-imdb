Often voted China's greatest movie by Chinese critics, including Chinese film lovers from the outside and frankly, I didn't get the story at all. What I have seen is one of the most ordinary songs that can be imagined, directed and made with gentle examples, with a complete template for the protagonist. Tuberculosis over the years It was a second world war, and they lived with the husband's teenage sister (Hong Mei Zhang) in a house that had deteriorated for a lot of money. (This man is rich when married) A close friend of the husband (Wei Li), who had been a girlfriend of the wife when they were teenagers. She thought to escape from her husband and this man, while her husband was still very forgotten, thinking that he might be involved with his sister with his friend. That is the setting and not going anywhere you don't expect. I saw a new creation directed by director Blue Kite Juang Juang Thian. It took more than half an hour and actually was boring too. But at least it's beautiful This classic should not be tolerated.
