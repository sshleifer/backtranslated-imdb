Major League: Return to Minors (1998) Â½ * <br /> <br /> Starring: Scott Bakula, Eric Bruce COTTER, Corbin Bernsen, Dennis Hale Bert, Jensen Dagett, written and directed by John Warren, 100 minutes for language and violence) <br /> <br /> By Blake France: <br /> < br /> Believe it or not, in the new film John Warren "Major League: Returning to the Minors" has a funny story about the scene. The angry man threw a baseball ball into the wall behind him, just to make it hit the cement and bounce back and bounce him at the front. It's not much, but with the exception of one of the few liners, it's all this film has. Let ... speak. <br /> <br /> This film is not only But will have structural defects, unpredictable development, unique characteristics and poorly written Even the unimportant audience will hate this movie with what they have received. It's familiar that it's not funny. <br /> <br /> How many times do you have to create the same movie about sports? Many years ago we saw the same content in "Air Bud: Golden Receiver" and not as good as it used to be. At least "Air Bud" is a family style. "Major League return to minors" is too rude for a healthy family to watch together on Sunday afternoon. It is too young for adults. So who is this movie for? teens? elderly people? People who are desperate for entertainment, they will rent something like this. <br /> <br /> This movie is like everyone else, like this. There is a fundamental point that it is trying to do, that is working as a team, winning all. Yes, it is like that and is a good virtue in trying to prove. Unfortunately we have seen and excluded it many times, with the talent and ingenuity that their cheerleaders are men in ballerina costumes. That the stupid announcer acted as "Regular joke friend" muttered one torpedo with himself, like "They sucked" "This child is fast, the ball is out of time with a glass of hours." His thoughts, "" Someone wants to take a nap "and" Have seen a beautiful sunset like that drama "in which the characters are of little importance to each other, which we never know them by name. And the place where the only heartfelt narrative scene about teamwork is unimaginable is that it's almost funny. <br /> <br /> "Major League returns to minors." Terrible. A boring ending in the middle of a good closing session. A good baseball team is coming back. They're going to win and are going to quit. I think the minute that this junk came to a conclusion But in reality, the last scene that is wrong is only available to add minutes to work time. In general, this film contains a series of unrelated sketches that will cause many rotten jokes that are not funny. There is another type of funny dialogue with coaches and players talking about why long-time players don't want to be in that position anymore. Coach's answer: "You're too old, too slow and too fat." The player's reaction is death for But that scene did not make this movie to be remembered for you and of course not worth your money. <br /> <br /> So this is another formidable story in this movie. With his own previous failures and other familiar stories. It seems that Dacha Woo will come back again. <br /> <br />
