This is an amateur movie shot in a video, not "Attractive drama" because the DVD liner notes are false. I have seen many better things from undergraduate film students. Most stories spread out by taking a taxi around Jakarta. This film can be created using a single video camera. But there are some parts that use two cameras and the content is bounced back together later Very rough correction The final correction may be done with two cameras that bounce the content back instead of using the appropriate editor. They may fix in a taxi as well? English subtitles written by people who do not speak English, such as "Where are you going now?" If to say that the production quality is at the level that is equivalent to Blair, the witch is generous. If you are not afraid, this movie is an ambitious and creative effort with cool and cool pictures from all over Jakarta.
