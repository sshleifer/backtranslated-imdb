I'm sure Operations Dames is a favorite game that drives in that day. There is nothing that is blocking the plot that you might miss if you are obsessed with other things. And if you want emotions in other activities, you are cute on the screen so you are in the mood. <br /> <br /> Otherwise there will be nothing that Operations Dames have to do. It is set in a war. Korea, in which the GIs, along with Tommy, the British, have been a bit far ahead and have to go back to the UN. Not good enough, but these people met with the USS and Kuan, a choreographer in the same situation. br /> You know? What's sad about this film is that the coming generations, women have been accepted in the end. The army and in these bimbos fighting situations from the USO make women freedom over the years. In fact, not even a professional soldier who was severely bitten by a sergeant who was able to keep it in his pants. <br /> <br /> But it might be better to remind something that They drove for. Throwing this name is no better than with me who do not know any of them for each other's efforts. <br /> <br /> The operation is definitely a failed team.
