Bingo is a game called bullshit. The screen is not stained with, for example, the past mix of half-baked conspiracy theories, strict regulations and a new era of gibberish. Most of the stories are located at Viciente Resort Cristian in the Peruvian jungle. Think of Tolkien's Rivendell. Meet the Planet Baku of Star Trek, which is the residence of a mysterious non-follower. But there was a surprisingly narrow love and peace. Thanks to the awesome design, acting and tasteful production (The creation of rainbow images of "energy". All treatments that are particularly mysterious, ugly), "The Celestine Prophecies" look and feel like a scene. Real mistakes about church history and many naming systems I do not want to believe that Hector Elizondo agreed to be part of this. Perhaps it was created without the consent of Bowfinger style. Ask God for mercy, director, screenwriter, novelist, and poor spirit who watched movies or read books.
