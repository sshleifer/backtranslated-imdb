I don't know what will happen on this planet or maybe Sam Marovich believes that this will be a worthy project. Ben & Arthur is one of the worst movies ever created. In fact, I do not see the reason why it should not be at # 1 in the bottom 100, although I haven't seen, for example, SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2 (# 5 at this time of publishing). Guess that this movie is good. More than wounds that are so stubborn, even though there is at least some depression, Baby Geniuses 2 is professionally created. On the contrary, everything and I mean that everything in this movie is completely unprofessional. <br /> <br /> This film is intended to attack Christian fanaticism and hatred and I will focus on "Intentionally" not only will it fail completely and completely for the purpose But also causes ugly scars Rather than creating a compelling and realistic image of gay couples with a society that is largely against them, it creates a weary and harsh attitude of each party involved. Ben and Arthur, who are called by two people, are innocent, have sex and romance that is innocent, married when the law changes so that they do so. This corresponds to the opposition of Victor, Ben's brother, a Christian minister, which is like every Christian. (Like this movie will make us believe) is loud, tampering, stupid and violent He tried to kill Ben and Arthur after his association with them, causing him to be fired from his service. Like in real life And if you think it's scary, you still can't see it. <br /> <br /> The actors (?) Manage here to destroy the traces of credibility in this movie, saying that their chapters are as if that They described the funny videos in the home of YouTube, but not even Daniel Day-Lewis and Marlon Brando as the title character who helped save this gangster because it was still a matter of irrational and laughing dialogue that filled every minute of the movie Every scene has at least one awkward or missing word. For example, in one scene, Victor tries to complain that he cannot have a grandchild or grandchild because of his brother's homosexuality. But instead of clearly showing this idea, he throws the most silly and confusing lines. "What do you know? I have never had a grandchild or granddaughter. Because you are F *** ED UP!" <br /> <br /> More clarity is the lack of complete production value. Yes, I know that this is not a black knight. But even amateur filmmakers should know some basics about special techniques and editing. For example, a six-point cake dye is not enough for real bullet wounds. People do not move across the room between times. And the object will not fall forward when shooting! <br /> <br /> Don't waste money on Ben & Arthur. I don't care if you are 7, 17, or 107. I don't care if you are gay, straight, second or don't hesitate. I don't care that you "just want to know". I don't care what the pathetic reason you might be tempted to buy is the dung. Stay far away The quality of this film only is the ability to use as a Frisbee.
