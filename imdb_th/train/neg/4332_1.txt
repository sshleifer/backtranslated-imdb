This movie is a bad attempt to make the original fans feel perfect. One thing that people have forgotten is the fact that the reason for receiving the original acclaim has been done strictly with the fact that it should make you feel incomplete. <br /> <br /> Movies This makes me want to go to the bathroom. I'm not a negative type. But the person shown in this flick is .... no comment The story is a bad reflection of Carlito Brigante's life and I regret that it took two hours and my money was wasted. I still love the original and will do my best to not let this film break my opinion about it.
