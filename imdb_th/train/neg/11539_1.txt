This is the biggest burden I've ever seen. The last time I hated the movie was that while watching "28 days later" and "Magnolia", there was no point in this movie except to see the sex scenes / rapes that were seriously ill and distorted. Anderson saved himself from the wayside. A few times in there It acts very cheap and has a very low budget. Eventually my friend and I closed the movie after about half an hour. We try to give it a chance. But nothing can help crud this. Don't watch it !!!
