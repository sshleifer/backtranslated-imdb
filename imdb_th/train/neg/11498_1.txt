Gadar is an example of one of Bollywood's most popular movies, directed by Anil Sharma, who likes to make movies that are relevant to the time of giving junk movies. Boring music and not the music you want to listen to in your car is full. Sunny Deol has a reputation for creating a crazy movie where he beat 100 bad guys on his own. He also kicked the metal prison door (India) and kicked the far away car (Teesri Aankh). I was able to illustrate 50 more embarrassing actions by Sunny Deol, but I'm sure most people know this Sunny gives the pathetic performance to repeat the same role again. The man claiming to fight for his country in pieces by violence. Amisha Patel is a sexy dead hand with an amazing body that I like to bone. But still she could not help to escape from the disaster. Instead of wearing sexy clothes like she usually does in this movie, she doesn't do it. Maybe because she is playing as a Muslim But she didn't act like anyone in the movie Overall, this is a terrible performance along the way. I'm sure it will attract the attention of some people. Let me take a break.
