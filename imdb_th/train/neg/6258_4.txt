Writer Tony Piccirillo adapted his drama about a recently widowed man. Learned in the last three weeks he was HIV positive. He searched for a homosexual couple that he had brought him to the apartment. And tied him to force the blood test for the guy and revenge for blood, if promised that the result will return positive Interesting thoughts sound better on paper than they were played. James Marsden's captives are insulting and insulting. But the character's acting manners are ashamed - it's like watching the Tom Cruise roadshow version. Scott Speedman has to work harder with more challenging roles. But changing his personality from shy people to modern kidnappings is unbelievable and there are no conversations that two men have Marsden's gay party boys are definitely indifferent - they soon sympathize with Speedman's situation - but he doesn't respond or behave in a manner that homosexual men will face in this situation. This movie is not a story that needs to be done. But it is more of a fraud for people with disabilities from poor corrections, bad events, low budget production and the last big scene * 1/2 from ****
