I like Boyle's performance, but that's the only thing I can say. Everything is too true to the point of being ridiculous. Most actors speak like you expect your 9-year-old nephew to say if he pretends to be a police officer with a rock-hearted or evil villain. The voice of the loud voice seemed unskilled for me. I can go to buy cheap synthesizers and better music. What was the torture of the police in 1984? It's totally extravagant and doesn't involve the actual events of the story. In fact, apparently, he thought he would be really cool, but nothing related to this matter. That was a big disappointment, because one thing that made the story of Borges good was his simplicity - they were tightly bound, no unnecessary details. This movie is the opposite. I stopped watching the scene where Lonnrot was asking the young man from Yidische Zaitung or there. I paid $ 4, but at least I was satisfied by writing this review and hoping to help others make the same mistakes.
