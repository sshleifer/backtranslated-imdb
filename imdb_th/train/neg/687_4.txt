I am a big fan of Fred MacMurray and Carole Lombard, and besides that, Charles Butterworth (a very supportive actor) is in this movie ... so why don't I especially like it? more! Even with good actors But this is one of the poorest writers and the most "images" I've ever seen. With the ability and money used to create this film, it is a very shocking story that the writing is slippery. I know that this movie will be boring once before in the movie. I find myself predicting what will happen next - and I'm always right! And this is not because I am "Movie actor" but because almost no imagination or effort, in fact, it seems as if this movie is an ancient idea that has long been! In addition, I found it a little annoying that Fred attacked Carole badly throughout the movie and in fact, according to the agenda, she ran to him at the end. Uggh! There is more suspicion in the movie Lassie ("Will he bring people to help Timmy or the rope he is hanging from?") <br /> <br /> Despite the tired and bored chapters So much Some advantages about movies It was quite cool when he saw Fred seem lush. At the end of this movie, it was very convincing and he seemed like he didn't eat, shave or sleep in a few days Moreover, "Butterworth" of Charles Butterworth created a moment with a little sense of humor. But all this is not enough to make this movie look different from "Movie B". It's a shame ... It's probably much better.
