Proved that not everything that Tarantino touched was gold This is definitely the plastic all the way. It's easy to see that without the involvement of Quentin, this thing should be on the shelf for many years, that is, assuming it will happen first. It is about the charming woman of death who got a job cleaning after the incident. Angela Jones is unbelievable in this role. William Baldwin is better as a serial killer that makes Jones do work! Very bad summary
