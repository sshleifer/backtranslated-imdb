Mt. My sister and I are self-proclaimed horror movie lovers. We have seen everything, especially the Kelley Zombies. Now we have seen many good zombie movies, and there are still many bad things. BY BY is the worst movie I've seen all my life. But special effects, graphics and make-up "Zombies" are the worst things I've ever seen. If you can call it a make-up (Black eye shadow around the eyes) This is a complete proof that you should not judge the book from the cover. The reason for this film is only attractive. Do yourself well and don't watch this movie. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I insisted on this movie, I went so far as to put a note on the inside of the movie before I went back to see the movie saying that "This movie is terrible. Others will lose a good movie night in this POS movie! I don't even know how to get the ranking that it does. T should be negative.
