What started out as a rather clever joke about a relatively shady security inspection company almost immediately became a completely unattractive and ridiculous murder mystery. David Arquette and the great Stanley Tucci tried to make The wreck of this train can be seen. <br /> <br /> What made Gail turn from a sweet, drunk, drunken man at Tommy's parents' house? Why did Hein, even though being a backpack, admitted that he wanted to destroy the business he gave to life by robbing and killing his customers? Why does Tommy seem reasonable, believing that Heinrich might be a murderer? (According to almost all dreams) and even if it is believable, why did he not go to the police and why Gale did not activate the warning when she returned home, especially after scolding Howie about the matter this Of course, all these events are necessary for the plot. (And I use this word very, very loose) in order to unfold and it may be forgiven if it causes a little comedy But everything from the explanation of Howy about rape to his date to the misleading of Gale's coroner until "the last joke" about Gail and Howie still dying Mark in the box that says that my comment has a "spoiler", but nothing that I or anyone can do to destroy this thing that stinks to heaven.
