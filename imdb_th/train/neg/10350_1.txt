We all know that the greatest movie of all time comes from books. While adaptation is not precise, especially these movies are excellent movies. Some good examples are the Harry Potter series, the Trilogy of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and all Disney movies that have been created. However, I am very sorry to announce that A Wrinkle in Time is not one of those films, not only failing to meet some basic expectations of Madeleine L'Engle fan base but also challenging the standard. Of writing screenplays, performing special effects and finally respecting the audience Mind you, I didn't try to be heartless. On the contrary, I entered this story with an open mind. I think doing it for T.V. The movie will do more for the lack of dazzling - dazzling in its script. Finally, Ewoks Star Wars come out well if a little silly. Think of the original Star Wars created as well. "Budget for lunch" and see where George Lucas comes from! However, from the first scene onwards, disappointment began to envelop me as if I were too close to Black Thing while teaching. <br /> <br /> The same way as the first Greedo photography became a symbol of the Star Wars Special Edition. 1997 (The devastation caused by the great proportions associated with the disgruntled director caused a horrible change to the beloved classics). Whatsit became my personal symbol for The confusion and ignorance is aging at a time. The reason for this is the fact that she has mutated beyond belief. In addition to a slightly controversial decision to select Alfre Woodard (Star Trek: First Contact and Radio) as our famous consultant, the filmmaker decided to introduce her to the crow. Correct, crow Moreover, the heavenly centaur style of this beloved character has been hacked by what appears to be eight years old. The majestic human half, the half-winged horse, became a large human head with a creepy smile that slowly stuck on the bowed body of the horse that occurred in playing a pair of wings in the middle. If I was five years old, this would hurt me because of my life. The worst part is the fact that when talking about it, it will be shown from the back to avoid responsibility for the lips, causing the scene to look behind the head and looking at the cheek that is not moved. Am Special effects that are less believable than ET. <br /> <br /> Get the most painful part out of the way. I have to walk to the end of tear: characters, performances and stories. Personally, I imagine Meg to look like Moaning Myrtle from Harry Potter: normal hair, glasses and a model number, most will find that ridiculous. She is often a pessimistic mathematical genius who always has pessimistic humor, which is not conscious of Nicaragua's import and export. In this film, she is the one who knows everything I don't have sympathy at all. In fact, she made me feel sorry for Mr Jenkins, the poor, the headmaster of her school, who had to keep in touch with her continuously. Calvin, a genius boy who everyone thinks is a jock, turns into a jock! The scary irony in the memorable Happy Medium section. They brought an attractive old lady who likes to watch things that are happy and replace her with "above sex" creatures and like to see "funny" things like women who Fall from the swing There are only three people that I can imagine who works well: Charles Wallace, Whatsit and Man With Red Eyes (nicknamed "Dude With Red Eyes" due to the creation of his new character. <br /> <br >> A messy story A good comparison with the aspect of this movie is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, which did not work well in telling the story found in the book. But still only the original work Here, a single book is talking to Hades satisfactorily in hell, not knowing that the body is being destroyed. While the Dark Master fulfilled only to show that the truth had to be felt and Ixchel's flat nose was not seen (which replaced the miraculous creatures that held the aunt's beast among them). Spine up While the God of Death recorded that the fears of Gamasot were deep, the pages were torn, scattered in sandstorms and disappeared into the darkness of the land of evil. <br /> <br /> I am very sorry that this movie exists. I do not believe that the actors are not really good. It is the way the characters write to destroy it. A Wrinkle in Time deserves to be adapted by Lawrence Kasdan, directed by George Lucas or Steven Spielberg, updated at Industrial Light and Magic, which was scored by John Williams. THX and marketed by Twentieth Century Fox in the current state of the film, do not deserve to show to those who respect themselves even Madeleine L'Engle thinks it is not good. This book is very good. Bad movies and ugly Whatsit. <br /> <br /> Score: 0.1 / 10 (if I can) <br /> <br /> Pros: <br /> <br> They have The name is correct. <br /> <br /> Cons: <br /> <br /> There's a terrible problem with the Cliffs Notes level of adaptation, acting script and special effects, not to mention. The lack of evidence that was read in the book Oh, and the main cover / poster has three main characters that rode over the castle. Some people may say that this is a symbol of high adventure. I said that it was a symbol of the responsibility of the cover artist that didn't really care about the sleeve of Photoshop Meg.
