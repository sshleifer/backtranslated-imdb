Perhaps this is the most eerie display of Santa Claus in any media, whether it be books, pictures or movies. Santa looks like a perverse child, looking at the children and a twisted story of bringing Merlin in to help him overcome one of Pitt's subordinates. It was ridiculous to say the least with bad effects, even in 1959. Standard If a child is watching this movie, he has a nightmare and doesn't want Santa to visit. They will have scar throughout their lives. Imagine a child in "A Christmas Story" when they started screaming after being placed on Santa's lap. This is the way that will happen if children watch this movie.
