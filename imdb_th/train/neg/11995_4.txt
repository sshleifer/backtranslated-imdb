I'm excited and excited to watch this movie when the promotion came out for the first time in November! It looks fantastic and the music! I'm quite disappointed when I go to watch it! This is a movie that connects 6 pairs together. There are 12 actors! Many stars have worked in this film. I think director Nikhil Advani can't handle the situation well and shouldn't have many people in this movie because it makes him easier. Compared to the release of Nikhil's 'Kal Ho Naa Ho', 'Salaam-e-Ishq' is quite depressing. I think Nikhil should have fewer actors. I think the best factor of this movie is music! This song is great and I think all the songs are great. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy Works great and has done great work for many years. I think the rating of this movie may be higher because of the great music! One thing that I am disappointed is that the director should not include nudity in this film, which was made by Sohail Khan and Isha Koppikar. Although some people may find that this nude picture is a joke But not what you want to see with parents! I think the best performances are performed by Salman and Priyanka. Overall, I think it's a good movie!
