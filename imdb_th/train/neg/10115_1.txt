I have determined that my personal mission is to follow those who are responsible for this. I also have a rental company to give money back because I argued that they made false advertising. <br /> <br /> It's not enough that the movie Will be a pos, but the cover is what sells me I made a makeup effect for kids on Halloween better than this movie showed when compared to the cover. You can say "raccoon eyes". <br /> <br /> I will not waste time with all the details. But the main character of the movie is the LA police that was born and raised in Alabama but with a German accent! It's too much to insult.
