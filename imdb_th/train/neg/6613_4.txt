Iam is a big fan of Mr Ram Gopal Varma, but I can't believe he made this movie. I was really disappointed. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag didn't really approach Sholay. It didn't leave a lasting impression on the audience. Ram Gopal Varma failed to create chemistry between the characters. There is no intimacy between Heero (Ajay Devgan) and Raj (Prashant raj). There is almost no scene where more than two people are in the frame together. The sequence outside the courtroom with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal is amazing. Amitabh Bachchan shouldn't make this movie. Ajay and Sushmita sen try hard. But is useless Rajpal Yadav's tuning - inefficient and useless Mohanlal has done justice and once again proved that the show is about facial expressions and body language. The remaining actors are lower than expected. The comedic situation that was adapted from the original sholay movie in this film. Ram Gopal Varma may work with the screenplay, making him do this Aag but without fire.
