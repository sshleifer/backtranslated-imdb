The only thing good about "The person I know" is that it is a perfect example of the movie that Al Pacino should avoid in acting. The first movie I did was Pacino trying to show Georgian accent Sometimes it is weak and not interesting while in other parts it seems too. The dialogue and interaction of the characters is very poor with weak plans. Supporting actors have done a great job in making the movie interesting and within an hour I still don't see signs of a strong plot. The overall story is really boring and I have to slap myself a few times to wake myself up. <br /> <br /> This movie will definitely bore you ... Avoid all costs.
