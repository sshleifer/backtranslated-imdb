I discovered that this movie was rented from packaging. The zombies in front of the DVD look cool and awesome. Then you went to see the movie and was a woman wearing a raccoon mask. Special effects are zero ... and even the fight scenes that you can see 2-foot punches. The funny thing is that Lommel performed in a short film and worse than the remaining crap actors in the movie The only thing I can think of is that Lommel is trying to create a bad movie that people dubbed. "Classic Cult" ... However, I can't imagine anyone who thinks this is what actually makes horror in this movie how bad it is. I was embarrassed. I rented it and vowed that I would not be able to watch the movie Lommel again!
