In fact, I have a passion for Christopher Lee. But this does not depend on his other performances ... and he is one of the better actors. <br /> <br /> This film does not depend on its location. It's not that scary. It looks exaggerated and it's draaaaaags every time I think. "Oh, this is a good part." The good part never arrived. <br /> <br /> The evil is unbelievable. Most other characters lack depth. <br /> <br /> Maybe if I In the right mindset I may enjoy MSTie-fication With the cost of this movie, but .... Naaahhh ... seems not worth the effort It's not really good. It's not very bad. It's just average.
