I know my conclusion will be for you. This movie is like Pet Rock and Disco! Well, unless you're in the 1970s or 80s, you may not be able to understand why anyone wants a new Coke or owns Pet Rock (and frankly, at least in the case of Pet Rocks. ) They are just two things that seem reasonable at that time. But messing up the new generation The same can be said for Kay Kyser and his band at the time (mostly in 1940). They were very popular and influential enough at the studio starring Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre. In this movie But if you are not at that time (It's good before my time) You wonder why everyone likes it. "Entertainment" like this. In the end, Kyser and his band mates are incredibly disgusting and their humor is very wide. Frankly, I couldn't stand their antics and I didn't appreciate that there were just too many musical numbers in the movie. Due to these factors, the great cast team received a back seat and the fans of these actors might be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film involves Kyser and the band coming to the maiden and her mansion. Strange, fresh water, when there is a bridge, will be washed and strange events occur. Eventually, it reaches its peak in some attempts about Sally's life and s√©ance (strange). Everything plays for - And it's not a horror movie, even though there are actors. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's the best entertainment. As a fan of Lugosi and Carlos, I feel cheated when watching Kyser and his knuckles.
