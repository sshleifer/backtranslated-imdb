I just watched Going Overboard. I have to say that we should send every copy of this movie to Iraq and make them look. I tried to make a blind woman look at this thing and she closed it for 20 minutes. Adam Sandler couldn't find a better project? For writing, if that's what you want to call, the responsible person should be forced to watch this movie forever in hell !! I believe I read somewhere that the budget for this film is $ 10,000 and they are under Wallmart. Got a good deal? Every store has a large large trash of this shit sitting on the sales area. The only good thing about this movie is that you can use a DVD as a roller coaster or exchange with friends. But then they may not be your friends anymore !!
