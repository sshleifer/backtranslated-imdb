Someone will tell shaq to stick to what he is good at basketball. This movie does not even provide entertainment at a stupid level. In this film, Shaq plays Jeanie who lives in a boom box, that is, not the original genome in the boom box instead of the lamp. He should help the little boy, played by Capra, an equally annoying franchise. This movie has the most subtle story since the water world. The performance is terrible and I think everyone who likes this movie is afraid to accept it.
