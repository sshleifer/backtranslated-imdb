While being one of the "stars" of this movie, there is no need to educate intellectuals. In any way, I know what I had in the beginning ... and what ended up on the screen. I remember seeing the cut of the "new" and very pleased. It's funny, sexy, obscene. All the main needs of the drive-in movie. You have to remember that this is a shock and released before all the rest ... animals, pigs, etc. So in their own way, this flick. Be true before For whatever reason, the film was given to the main distributor who edited the original half of the movie and edited it in (I should say "chop") the most random scene. Fat man with a goat head .... What a hell! I'm sure there is an additional T&A, but it goes slowly. It makes everything happen before it grinds down to stop the scream and stop. But overall it's a fun memory for me ... especially in the story that I can say is the worst movie I've ever seen ... I came in!
