Often said that Tobe Hooper had just been lucky with his horror horror movie 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' in 1974, and every time I saw another Hooper movie - that view was only added. It seems that Hooper wanted to create his own version of the movie, such as a scanner and Firestarter in 1990, so we ended up spontaneous combustion. Movies that have good ideas and have many burdens borrowed from other movies Gather it together and you will get a boring and messy movie that most people should miss! This film convinced the audience that it might be the first half that is appropriate for an interesting past story that focuses on some experiments that happened to two young people in the 50s. That was soon burned to death due to experiments with them Went fast for many years and now he is an adult named Sam But naturally he is not a normal person, and soon he finds that he has the ability to fire on purpose. <br /> <br /> The film is starring Brad Dourif, which seems to be the way. Good choice His success with Child's Play two years ago But actually is a decision that has not been answered because the central performance is terrible And did not receive help from horrible support The boring direction and boring script did not do many favorite things and the tendency of lack of favor continued with special effects that were very unrealistic and nothing in the movie. That this story ripped off All of this happened many years ago. The plot is very slow and almost an hour before anything happens again and I don't care at all. Soon it will be obvious that which movie will come and everything will end up boring as you expect. The final confrontation was a big disappointment and nothing could be explained during the filming. No matter what the revelation is interesting Overall, this is a junk movie, and another reason for Toboe Hop is the best horror film director. See Firestarter again instead.
