This movie may look scary in ads. But the actual movie has a reason to vomit This is lower than average, lower (lower) and no plot. I mean, every house can make you feel scared and of course the dead Japanese women will make the poop out of you. Create a movie that will attract viewers and not just But showing pictures of people who are afraid and thin hair (Japanese women die) Can you say "Samara (The Ring) that is terrifying?" Don't let me start with "dead children". Not scary! And what? He has a cat and he can imitate it. It's a big deal! Just bury the poor zombies and save some people who might be harmed by dissatisfaction! 1/10! Yuck!>. <
