To be as honest as I can, the Devil's toy (Or the blood of vampires or joy or curse of blacksters or ????) is completely boring This movie has good evidence behind it? The resurrection of a long-dead vampire through the body of the descendants through the help and help of a group of women dressed in black? But the execution was very scary Have a good time in the screen for a long time when nothing happens. The character stood dormant without doing anything. There is no mystery, no doubt, and there are no points of interest. The show is abysmal. Most performances involve women who look below average, dancing naked while staring at the camera. They do this repeatedly and plot a little story that seems to be designed to make these less charming women more naked so that they can participate in the dance. Although it is not bad or useless like dancing or plotting something like Orgy of the Dead, but it comes close.
