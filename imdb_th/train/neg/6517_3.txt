I went to watch this movie and while it had a moment that made me laugh it had a very important flaw. First of all, presenting myself as a humorous exploit of real life divorces trying to find love in LA. What it changed was depression, narcissism, and lack of movement in history, love life, film director and professional life. The jokes are fast and you will find yourself not interested in how this man is dating you. The nonsense is that the director presents himself as a very annoying and flawed character at the same time and expects us to be worried.
