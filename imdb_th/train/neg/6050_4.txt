I can't believe how many people compare this story to the first movie. It makes me have to comment on this! This is just a clear attempt to make money from the success of the first movie. The conversation is scary and there is nothing like the real thing or interesting like the original movie. <br /> <br /> A ridiculous story of a French policeman laughing. Down to the port to see the delivery The convenience that Doyle found his man was pathetic. Like all French police, just drink coffee until Doyle goes from America and works for the police. As a joke Try to go to a foreign city and discover the most terrible things in the place with a travel map and poor travel brochures. <br /> <br /> A truly terrifying sequel. It's crazy
