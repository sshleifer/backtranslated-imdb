I like Goldie Hawn and want another movie for her. So when I saw the protocol for $ 5.50 at Walmart, I bought it. But the movie never stepped Some scenes, such as the party scene in the bar, have just continued for a long time and there is no real purpose Filming tastes not as good as I am concerned. I don't think this scene will be added to the movie at all. I don't like comedians who are trying to teach me lessons written by crazy people in the 60s. <br /> <br /> In the end, though, I'm glad to have another Hawn movie. Of course, it's really worth the money!
