Blowing my mind how this movie happened I watched it while I was working at home, writing an email and answering the phone - I watched it just because I hoped that the "revenge" would be good. No need to say revenge and forced plans were not worth the email they look In fact, I'm not even sure what happened at the end. The show is not as good as the new legislative situation in the "FBI file" list - by the worst. New legislation (only "arrest and trial") may not be as good as the new legislation. I don't even know that the chief person is in the Third Eye Blind until I watch this movie at IMDb, but it's clear why he hasn't made a movie since then. I hope he will be a good singer.
