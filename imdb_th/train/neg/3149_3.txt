Being an independent filmmaker and a great fan of Edward D. Wood Jr. I bought this documentary because I believe that eventually it will create a clear record of how great Edwood has talent and greatness. <br /> <br /> What I have received is the collection of myself. Which is frustrating as a center of conflict and conflict with bitter self-bullying. <br /> <br /> People remember Ed Edwood Jr. In fact, people remember the second cousin of men with tape. fire The unknown man in the Plan Nine from Outer Space or not? <br /> <br /> Looks like the last minute that is interested in Ed Wood. These people will come out of the "Wood" event! To recognize the vitality of the people who give them opportunities when no one else does! After 50 years, I would recommend that many of these people should abandon the fact that they didn't receive the $ 75 they promised. <br /> <br /> Edwood is a great filmmaker at Know how to create entertainment In fact, that's all he lived. You might giggle when you watch Ed's movie. In any way, you know that you are laughing at him and not him. <br /> <br /> But I digress ... go back and watch the movie in my hand. If you expect to have a movie about Edward D. Wood Jr., you won't come here. If you want a movie about a crazy old actor, this is the movie for you!
