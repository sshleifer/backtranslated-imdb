This video has a clever way to confuse and manipulate Americans about Islam. It's a shame that people who do so believe that Americans are very stupid to believe in it. Perhaps, as every American citizen must protest against this kind of shit. If you want to know the truth about Islam, do not let anyone tell you ... The Quran is public! You can read by yourself and decide what they say is true or false ... <br /> <br /> Videos use many audiovisual strategies to manage and link things that are irrelevant. together Songs used at some point prepare people to hate what they see, even if they do not understand what has happened in it. They use misplaced images from the original content. <br /> <br /> To end the comments I want to reflect ... Do you think you can't make the same movie with all religions in the world?
