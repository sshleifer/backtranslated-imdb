I don't know where to start. Performing special effects and writing works But bad as you unexpected I can't believe that the production staff came to the point where they said "Our work is complete. The release time" I'm just glad that the first two in the series never made as far as England. I suggest watching this movie so that you know how many movies are made out well. <br /> <br /> I don't know how other IMDb users will find it scary The path with a rubber arm bounce back.
