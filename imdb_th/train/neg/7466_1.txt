Wow. Some movies left me without saying anything. This is undeniably one of those movies. When I left the theater, there was no single word coming to my mouth. All I have is an incredible urge to slap my head against the theater wall to help me forget about the last hour and a half. Unfortunately it doesn't work. In fact, this movie has nothing to suggest. Humor is at the best grade level, too stupid performances and a plot that is called far astronomical. I heard a vow not to watch other movies starring Chris Kattan or other SNL actors.
