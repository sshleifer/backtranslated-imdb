I don't see anyone who likes Van Damne to like this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie starts with a promise. I would say that the action scenes at the beginning of the great movie Action scenes with the Ward Family who try to save the twins are a good start and a good leader in the main story However, this movie is on all hills That is, brothers and sisters born in different parts of the world and learn different skills One brother should have skills in martial arts. But other brothers should have skills in using firearms. Comfort, when the older brother who had never picked up a gun before, suddenly became a great marksman and his brother who had not been taught any martial arts was split and kicked high. <br /> Plot, action, etc., ridiculous. My favorite scene? Then when Van Damne was confronted by an armed soldier with an AK-47, the soldiers were about 100 yards away. Instead of aiming and shooting at Van Damne, he was at war, as if he were using an ax to fight and run into him. Van Damne proceeded. Pick up a pistol from the fallen soldier and shoot him ... while he is still about 75 to 80 yards. <br /> <br /> The film has one of the most frustrating endings. Bolo Yeung is an art artist. The fight None skills However, instead of designing the proper choreography, Bolo is throwing a bucket at the Van Damne like Donkey Kong. The movie that definitely gets drastic with promises, if your Van Damne fans save your time and watch Hard Target or one of the previous movies. This of him
