But it has good actions and a plot that is quite interesting Nevsky acted like a body builder and he wasn't all that attractive She received her character to be developed. There are ways that too many men in this subject have too much romance as an action center. It is very violent. However, I love this scene. This movie takes you around the world and that is a bonus. I like that there is something too little or too little about the mafia. But it is enough to get my attention Actors need to be more handsome ... The biggest problem I have is Nevsky is too normal, not sexy enough. I think for most people, Sascha is hot enough, but for women who are action fans, Nevsky doesn't cut it. Overall, this movie is good. I don't love and don't hate. I just found it to be a general action flick.
