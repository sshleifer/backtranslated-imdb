I just watched this movie and I have to say that with the greatness and great talent, this turkey is there !!! A friend let me watch this movie and I watched with an open mind primarily because he was highly regarded in this story. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Kevin Costner as a pilot. Fighter ... Why? Why do they make him a fighter pilot? He should be hired by the character of Anthony Quinn to be his new pilot ... We never saw Costner approaching the plane for the rest of the movie! <br /> <br /> Costner met with Texan (James Gammon), selling horses for big Mexican businessmen and tagging Costner along with traveling without knowing what had happened. Weiner took him to a meeting that happened to the Quinn group! But nothing comes ... nada zilcho! Why do they have gammon habits? Why are they selling horses with co-quinn if nothing else comes? <br /> <br /> In addition, after they left Costner to death, they made Madeline Stowe's character become a prostitute She then attacked one of Quinn's men who paid for the launch ... and the next thing she was transferred to the temple! There is no explanation as to why she was moving or when it was finished. <br /> <br /> Too much talent makes the script weak and the editing worse !! I watched it just because a friend owned it and let me see it ... I'll throw it at him for 2 hours. I died watching the damaged thing!
