I can't find Al Pacino. I watched him in Godfather, Scarface, Carlito's Way and I thought I was watching one of the greatest actors in the past thirty years. Then I saw him in any Two for the Money, Sunday and Revolution, and I wondered what this man was thinking. <br /> <br /> I stumbled on Revolution a couple of years ago and thought I would invest in The next two days, this hour is the flash. News: Want to have prisoners say? Forcing them to watch this thing over and over again ... They will confess anything. <br /> <br /> I will not make a new plot because there is no continuous plot. But it will take place during the American Revolution and Pacino plays as a farmer without education that does not want to participate. But ultimately did While he has no money, no education and dress like a hot man Natasha Kinski falls in love with him without reason because they have only two minutes to talk. <br /> <br /> Quite straight. Go straight if "Al Smith" is shown in this movie instead of "Al Pacino". It will destroy their career. Scary script But Pacino's sound reduction performance and the apparent fake accent made it worse than before. The role of Donald Sutherland is ridiculous. I can not explain Natasha Kinski is the main character, but has 5 lines in the movie. In fact, no one speaks so much in this movie. <br /> <br /> One of the most ridiculous places in the movie is the way Al Pacino and Kinski have amazing abilities to meet in. battlefield It's like the entire northeast region is Starbucks. "Hey, it's funny to meet you here again on the battlefield for another 100 miles ... See you in a few months." <br /> <br /> I have to give this star by IM because there is nothing. Here to give a negative rating
