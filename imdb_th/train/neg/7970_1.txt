Regardless of whether you want to spend almost 2 hours to watch this, depending on whether you like your horror movie If you like them, so the god damn terrible, they're hysterical. Jigsaw is no doubt the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. (And I've seen 'Long Time Dead') and I say this as a big fan of budget horror / low blood. To compare with I will not go to see the specifics of what makes this movie worse because of it. The only good thing about it is that it is terrible. It is one of the most fun things I have seen in years If you can find this for rent at a cheap price, it is definitely worth looking at if you are involved in making it ashamed to you: o) IMDb needs to recommend ranking 0/10 especially for movies This matter is very appropriate.
