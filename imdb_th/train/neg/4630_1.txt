Launched in 1965, but was clearly taken years ago. This is a crime drama that is not suitable for inappropriate sexual abuse. As usual for the flicks of that period, the clothes were removed and dressed without reason, supplemented with flea music, annoying narration and awkward editing. The coffee shop scene laid a breathtaking foundation as we shuffled between the characters to avoid seeing them actually speaking. All we received was a response to the voice of the characters outside the screen! Beautiful 50-year-old Misty Ayers pulled out her French panties a few times before the action began. She came up with something that was noticeable from stock music from romance to the West - cooking a random mixed dish to produce, among other things, the most exciting cigarette ever recorded in a movie. Watch while he touches it! Watch as he strikes the match! Will he breathe in or be arrested by Apache? Only time will tell !! This film tells the vile story that Sally was tricked into going to work in his homeland, being drug-addicted and unable to escape. For some reason, we are treated to the most boring and boring gangster who has ever worked with a manicure or knitting filmmaking rather than having fun with customers. Some lame comedians (dame boozy drink milk inadvertently! har dee har!) and the silent movie show didn't help anything. This is one of the worst documentary films I've ever seen, even in Something Weird Video marquee. It's more curious about movies for those who are interested in the history of movies - a very bad movie theater.
