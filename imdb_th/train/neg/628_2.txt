This movie has the potential to be a good horror movie. The main character has been done appropriately and I feel sorry for him and have the right amount of backstory. However, everything else sucks. Emmanuel's director is quite incapable of making movies. He used to shoot the most stupid pictures ever I do not know that he tried to be profound and intelligent and poetic, but he couldn't. A random image of a trailer in which the main character lives in a random building. Random pans of random cat buildings that walk away. WTF? And a lot of cloudy clouds. <br /> <br /> - He likes this technique to make the scenes cut into various shots instead of just one continuous shot. EX: Men are trying to spot His weed fire and the camera circle around him Instead of editing just one match, he edited it into 10 different images, so it was really EDGY! And hips! And smart! Stupid <br /> <br /> The performance is awesome. But it is something that makes the movie very funny And the scarecrow is a gymnast that makes him flip and spin and spin all the time And some death should be better You expect the main bully to have a long death. Simple cob in the ear Love, attention, hot, voluptuous. This is why this movie received 2
