I still try to find out if there is anything that points to this movie. <br /> <br /> For the content that should be 'rebellious' and 'controversial', things that Maddox distributed to students are extremely weak. Will be influenced by ambiguous anti-authoritarian feelings and vague knowledge on the brochure. Every rebellious <br /> <br /> I think it is too much to ask for a teen rebel movie. The school does not have a fire alarm <br /> <br /> Obviously. 'The big fight on the football field' is a fight that consists of two people. <br /> <br /> The character's personality seems to be different. The football jock that Maddox is fighting (and later gets the face on the face) is smiling and apologizing the next day. <br /> <br /> The fact that it didn't come to the true conclusion of lot Makes me feel that all things may be specially installed half an hour after school If they cut the pseudo-soundtrack that was trying to do most of it
