You have to think that when the name of the star is identified as wrong in the open credit, you are not in a good time. (Credits will be read as "Cuba Gooding, JR"). Running a good car chase, shoot 'em up, blow up' em up action. And completely unbelievable The motivation of the character, especially of Gooding at the end, is even worse. Unbelievable. They are unreasonable when they are not busy without hope. All I can think of is that Andy Cheng must be a really good person to get many good actors into this project. (He has nothing in them, right?)
