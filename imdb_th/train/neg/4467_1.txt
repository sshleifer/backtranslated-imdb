<br /> <br /> I'm not sure who decides what kind of movie is suitable for this movie. But this movie is not a horror movie For this quite interesting But quite slow I am extremely disappointed with the ending. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** <br /> <br /> Tell me why you ran to Uncle's house. First detective or police She knew what had happened at that point, including a videotape as evidence. But she ran there and started crazy and said "I know everything. I have proof! Then she was surprised when her uncle stood up and started walking towards her as if he had done harm to her. DUH! Of course he will hurt the idiot. You just tell him that you know everything and there is evidence to reveal everything. What a dumb thing.
