Ronald Reagan and a number of US soldiers in a North Korean prisoner camp They were tortured ... We learned that North Korean communists were bad people ... We learned that American beards grew slowly during the torture ... <br /> <br /> I tried to suppress. it Laughed out at this movie It was the scene when Mr. Reagan came out of telling the Communists that he wanted to be beside them. Then he asked for a bottle of brandy. Then served as a cold-blooded man. He took a drunken partner, Dewey Martin, to sulfur to cure Mr. Martin's hangover. Of course, the North Korean communist defender was stupid as they came So the drunken man distracted the guard while Reagan went to pick up items from the drawers next to a few empty boxes. I'm sure the box he should have something; But of course Reagan made them tremble enough to reveal that they were empty. You have to laugh! I think "Prisoner of War" will attract a lot of attention to the family and friends of those who work on this matter - otherwise it consumes <br /> <br /> * Prisoner of War (1954) Andrew Marton ~ Ronald Reagan, Steve Forrest, Dewey Martin
