Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are one of the actors that I am always interested in watching, even if there are reviews. I found that Mrs. Ryan, a charming and fascinating actress in almost all of her roles and Kevin Kline, is always worth watching. <br /> <br /> I say "almost" and "almost" Because most From this movie <br /> <br /> First of all, Mek Ryan didn't play as a cute character. She played the weak-hearted gangster who started to feel stressed after opening credits shortly. That Kevin Kline's character is even more annoying and less pleasing So even if you like these two regular actors, I suggest you send this movie.
