Today "Debut" today in the SciFi channel and all I can say is "I can't speak." I recorded the tape today so I could watch tonight after work. I have high hopes. Now I tear the wardrobe out to find a long rope to hang myself. It may be the worst movie I've ever seen. I hope I can say some good things like "It's fun to make fun of this movie." But this movie doesn't let me do anything. I know you shouldn't post spoilers here without warning. But i will go on "This movie is terrible." There, I said! They should show this flick to film the students' films to show what they shouldn't do! My nine year old niece can make a better movie. The only good thing about this movie is the sound and / or music of OH! I just found a C-clamp that is rusty in my old toolbox. I'll put it on the thumb of my left hand and squeeze it tightly until the pain erases the memory of what my eye sees. I can only record this VHS tape, but I think I will burn it in the fire pit instead. I can wash with soap But I'm afraid I won't clean again Christmas is coming Buy this movie and give it to people you hate. -Mike
