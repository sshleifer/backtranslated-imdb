Okay, during the Thanksgiving day, while the whole family was together, everyone decided to go to see the movie and because Fred's vote was mostly voted, that's what we said. <br /> < br /> To start the movie, there are many plot holes. It's pathetic. A simple explanation of why some events are happening and therefore void the example; Who the heck is trying to 'close' Santa's sentence? Is it some company? A little explanation should be cute. <br /> <br /> Second: This movie gives you a subtle character that makes you not sympathize with their feelings or actions. Example: Little Elf Willie and the only tall woman in the Elf village They met each other twice and they were lovers, and I didn't care because this movie didn't make me interested. <br /> <br /> Third: I think this should be a family movie, right? Its score is low, just PG. For family movies, there are many conversational articles. It didn't bother me But if I'm a parent, I will see the problem. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, Paul Giamatti looks very boring with his role. But actually he is the only one worth watching in the movie Vaughan had a funny time. But played as the same character that he had in the last two movies. Baby (nothing compared to Vaughn. He's a good person in other movies) <br /> <br /> So this movie gets 3 From 10 stars from me just because some people have to try to produce, shoot and release this movie. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I will pass this flick for sure, or if you have to see it recorded for Rental date North West
