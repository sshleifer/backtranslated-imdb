Is just another movie that takes advantage of unreasonable male sexuality in the forehead. Scary performances, including the courtship scene, are the most sexy things I have ever seen. (And this is not about me that does not associate the thoughts of two young men who create love because I am gay) <br /> <br /> again like in Mil nubes de paz Julian Hernandez G directed an incredibly pretentious movie with a story that caused enough controversy for a short film about five minutes. But managed to do 2 hours of movies as well ... there is not even racism and making a product in the Mexican gay community to talk! God has mercy on us!
