I just couldn't see that the Concorde-New Horizons movie directed by Jim Wynorski and the acting talent of Andrew Stevens and the puppet might not be good. <br /> <br /> Well, don't do anything wrong. "Munchie Strikes Back" is a bad movie. Munchie is a puppet that has been for centuries. For reasons that could not be explained until the end of the story, he was sent to the world to help her mother and her only son. The mother's problem (her main problem at least) was that she had balloon payments due to her mortgage. In two weeks ... with an improbable amount of $ 20,000. Ouch is dead. You can't earn money because she's just been fired. OK ... just a key word in that sentence ... The plan will be paid by check or not. Maybe it's a good idea to spend many years saving for ... ya think? <br /> <br /> Munchie has a magical power, similar to those of the devil. There will be ... but there is no limit to the amount of desire you can do! Munchie makes children get a lot of new things one night. But the boy asked to return to the mall. Munchie was "borrowed" from annoying furry balls, also using his other skills to help boys win a baseball game by cheating. Baseball was hit hard until orbit around the world many times. Sadly, stupid parents who watch the game do not think it's strange. Well, <br /> <br /> Anyway, I want to wrap this thing because this has drained enough of my life. You will be truly impressed with the scene in which Leslie-Anne plays as a mother, kicking a dog. Your heart will melt in your charm when you notice the dollar banknotes that have fallen down in front of her house and you wonder how the snow will fall in the summer. Credit "Munchie Strikes Back" Make a promise to another movie that will follow. I believe "Munchie Hangs Ten" until today. Movie viewers have been robbed of what is the driving force of 1/10 movies.
