But I think they get E - because when they take it back to show their teachers! It's hard to say that this is a joke for a moment because what happens is a joke and is not true with the truth. That performance is especially ridiculous from the female lead Faye Grant. She still pulls a stupid face, or does she find it hard to laugh? It's hard to tell The worst order I have ever encountered is bad luck. 1 out of 10
