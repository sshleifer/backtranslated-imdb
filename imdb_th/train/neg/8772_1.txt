There is nothing new for me to say: 4 hours of people who are dying over and over again in the same mountain. The actor is the protagonist. Unfortunately, the producer / director / editor / God goofed. He should eat the lowly pie. (If not for himself, for those who died in Kargil) hire a good Bollywood director, hire a real script writer, hire an editor, actually hire a musician that is not related to He in any way (And those who seem to listen to "Apocalypse Now" bad version in cheap Indian medicine) Hire a professional team to actually throw all the fireworks and tell the real story. Unfortunately, he, like the chief of the Indian army, made a terrible decision for his actors and was scary for his audience. We all died again and again. <br /> <br /> Please don't do that anymore! Sushma Kathmandu, Nepal <br /> <br /> ps: The next time the Indian director decided to glorify the Gurkha soldiers, I suggested that he hire more than one Nepal to represent the team Of course, there are many Nepalese people working in Bombay - the latest count is 40,000 to half a million.
