It's a surprise. There is a plot! ;) I've watched movies with a little plot. (I don't want to talk about Asian movies, but ...) I think the camera is not bad for this cheap movie, and the atmosphere is not too bad. There is no real reason for what most people do and how they respond to what is happening. Even though I think about a lot of movies in this case, it's definitely scary. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible movie copying for a single scene. This movie is bad. But I saw it worse Watching this movie is an experience of boredom, laughing for, desire in life, sadism, liveliness and low level of entertainment. <br /> <br /> So if you like movies filled With blood. <br /> <br /> I give 3/10 because it's fun if you don't expect to see a good movie and you're in the right mood.
