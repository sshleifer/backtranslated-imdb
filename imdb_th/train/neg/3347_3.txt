I'm not sure why I like Dolph Lundgren. I think seeing him on screen makes me feel that everyone who works hard can succeed without regard to ability. That is a good feeling for all of us who lack talent. Some other comments point out how stupid detention is. But many people are pointing out the positive things. <br /> <br /> Every movie that is annoying at least one teenager is killed, not bad. Why do many movies with teen actors always have to incorporate teenagers into patterns? No other type of teenagers? Are all teenagers having an angry black man? The only genius that nobody likes? A young woman who is friendly and pregnant (In this movie)? An anti-social white child from a cracked house that everyone agreed to have. (But what is the ability) and a lazy black child who is in harmony with the universe and cool until other neurological children trust him. They don't talk much. But being shot at some point. <br /> <br /> The detention should be better if the villain has blasted the school. Especially with internal writers The conversation is not good and the story is worse than when the villain (and the girl) finally hijacked the van that was full of drugs. Then they sat inside the van to come out. They drove the van to the school because they wanted to paint the van again at the school's paint shop. But they never go anywhere to paint the van again By the way, it is easier than just putting all the drugs in another car or two, or another van or truck and then driving away without painting the police car. They never move drugs or sell drugs or do anything with a great score. <br /> <br /> For some reason, they decide that they have to kill children and teachers (Dolph Lundgren) though. The villain will attend school, no one knows from a distance, because it is time after school. A number of people who are still in school are not involved in painted vehicles, so why follow them? <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie is the villains armed with a lot of machine guns and they search for teenagers (Including men in the swivel chair) and shooting hundreds of bullets That teenagers and often miss At the end of this movie there was bloodshed. For every time someone is shot, there must be at least three hundred bullets fired at a miss. The acrobatics is terrible. <br /> <br /> I read one of the reviews that said the film had a budget of $ 10 million and I was surprised. When I watched this movie, I thought that perhaps Lundgren did it like a charity event for a movie school he was a teacher. Like this movie may be at the end of the year It's a test to see. But I passed
