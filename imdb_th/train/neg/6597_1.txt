This is worse than Laurel and Hardy cartoons in the 60s. They are scary. But at least they are simple people in the resurrection of Stan and Ollie at that time New audiences have discovered the genius of both comics and cartoons as junk that makes the mind stunned, focusing on cash in the interest of children. It is expected But how can we try to rationalize this work ... I can't even think of one word. I'm sure the creators hope it will inspire Laurel and Hardy again, but you can't inspire the past with a shallow and uninteresting parody of things that make the original look interesting. Impressionist (I hesitate to call them actors). Do Vegas and that's what it is. The plot is softer than it used to be in the past, trying to expand the two reel concept for the feature. If this film is the first time someone has touched on REAL Laurel and Hardy, I'm sure the audience will cancel the reputation of the old couple when the old age falls. The only movie I hate, more than that, is I spit on your grave. And you know that these filmmakers do the same thing with Stan and Ollie
