This movie is very stupid. It's just around the corner and ridiculous. I want to see "Darkness falls". Actually I think this is a movie. I forwarded as soon as I could and I still couldn't get rid of boring moments. I'm just jealous of people who pay to play or work in this movie. They get real money for this shit. It's amazing, right? I mean, in this movie, a man was killed and shuffled in a wood grinder in small pieces of blood, and a few minutes later, the mother and child spoke peacefully at the table because nothing had happened and drink your favorite coffee! Come! Who gives money to this shit movie? Oh and "fairy teeth" are weak, not scary, and obviously it's a stuntman who wears makeup that is not good.
