He is my hero all the time until he goes along with {If you call it a movie} I watch the show and come out, not just asking for a refund. But asking for more money, how bad it is Hero's performances and interesting things ............. I can't believe that Steven Seagal's career was so low that he was cut down to be the fourth movie producer with the 5th runner up. I watched this movement expecting it. Saw him beet shit out of some people in the way that he always did When he was reduced to use a single judo during the scapula to separate the opponent and the man fell like a brick that had something wrong. <br /> <br /> The story is unbelievable as a movie and even If you forgive the image and read this story as a novel, you will be left wondering why you picked up the book. <br /> <br /> Steve Seagal goes through the movement and looks like he is Do this just because he is under obligation. He doesn't show effort and is not enthusiastic, and in some scenes he doesn't appear. <br /> <br /> I hate to comment repeatedly with others, but using stock videos for cut scenes. And images of The plane in the flight was pathetic. The condition of those scenes is broken, shaky, and the scene itself seems to deteriorate over time. The zappruder film shows that the assassinated President John F Kennedy is firm and clean. <br /> <br /> My honest opinion. Is to tell you that you don't waste your time watching this movie Male flickering or wounds I read one review that said the movie had a budget of 12 million dollars (Seagal received 5 times the money) and the film is still in the budget. I have to agree. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that this is a direct DVD movie because there is no diligent theater owner to play this movie.
