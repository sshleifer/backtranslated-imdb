I think this cartoon is one of the worst cartoons I've ever seen. I would like to recommend this cartoon to people under 5 years of age. I used to like this show when I was 4 and 5 years old. I still only watched it when there was nothing. I am now 5 years old and I want to do more homework. The cartoon was a little funny. But it wasn't enough to make me laugh Now I'm old. I'm interested in showing witches, not scoring us. I started watching Doctor Who (12A), Torchwood (15) and Sarah Jane Adventures (PG). 5 years, this cartoon doesn't take long. It only has 6 seasons. It is canceled because of low audience. But some people say it's because the writer doesn't have ideas. But for most other items, they have at least 8 seasons
