Is this a movie ??? Is this what India is trying to show? I think this is another attempt from a heartless director to overthrow the Pakistani military and in fact the country .... But what we know is that Pakistan is the leader of India in every part of life .. . Not only in the armed forces <br /> <br /> Okay ... This is terrible when shooting the Border scene in early 1997 ... and the directors and writers tried to overcome the defeat. Defeated in Kargil by the Pakistani Armed Forces the Movies like this .. <br /> <br /> One thing that is very clear ... Whenever there is a confrontation between Pakistan and India .... We will win .... !!! So Dutta is trying to make a good movie instead of a nonsense movie like this.
