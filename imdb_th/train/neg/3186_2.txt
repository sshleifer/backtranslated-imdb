I don't think it is possible that Joe Don Baker will create a movie that is not as good as 'Mitchell' with his foul smell. But this movie was successful. <br /> <br /> I won't recommend this if you are The fans of Joe Don Baker can work much better. But if you really like to see fat people sweating, fighting the guns, you'll love this movie.
