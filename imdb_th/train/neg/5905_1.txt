I don't see this as one of the most stupid movies I've ever seen. It's hard to be a Mormon, sometimes when there are movies like this out there. It's a sad view of Mormon life. I can tell you whether you have watched this movie or not, that it is not like this in the singles ward. If it is, I don't think I will make it through it. It's terrible that most Mormon movies are created by a group of people who have nothing to do better. The performance was so poor that my wife and I barely did it. I think you can say that it has all the signs of the movie B or is there a movie C? Anyway ... I just thought that this movie sucked and filled with cheese. I hope some Mormons will start making quality movies.
