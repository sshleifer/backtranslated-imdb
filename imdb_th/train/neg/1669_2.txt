We are here: Two travelers from the distant future world arrive on Earth ... One of the desperate missions to save another life is a human killing machine that is committed to eliminating women that will give birth. All survivors of the race. <br /> <br /> What will we call this killing machine? It is almost as though he was a devastating person or an exterminator ... like a devastating person or something. What is the word I am looking for ... Hmm ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the guardian (Who dodged the white robes that he stole from Luke Skywalker in local clothes) found that the first woman and made her become a future hero - is. Evil uhhhh ... "The devastator" kills the narrow-minded people and steals their guns and clothes. Then tries to find the woman by visiting her workplace and asking around. /> Then start a desperate race for Survival as "Devastator" that seems to never die and ceases to find a partner across the countryside At some point, he may buy boots and motorcycles. But I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> Maybe in an exciting ending, he will try to crush them under a large truck wheel filled with acid. Then the truck will crash. They will be recorded ... but not! Then he will appear again as strong as ever. He will kill the guardian and follow her to the meat packing plant, in a terrifying condition. He is pushed into a large and destroyed industrial machine once. <br /> <br /> But maybe I anticipate too much. ... After that, I stopped watching this movie after the guardian was relegated to Sean Young by kissing her at the bar astonishingly and telling her that the child would be born in 3 days. <br /> <br /> Dress And the wonderful effects in this film ... I love them for the first time I've seen them on Star Trek: Next Generation! Sean also did a great job again as Replicant, without a trainer and Stephen Baldwin, a sweaty professional, still being a big fan of Young's Young. Not sure how he suits this story .. . Maybe he will import from other James Cameron movies?
