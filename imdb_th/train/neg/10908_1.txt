Nothing in this funny movie I think that the location of the human libido Ram human passion is interesting and should give some laughter wrong! Nothing funny about the movie. For example, the main character sent through a goat in the middle of the farmer's yard is not funny. They are playing with the naturalness of this film to a certain extent and it's funny. <br /> <br /> We all know that dogs will eat anything, anytime, anywhere. The main character who does this thing, everything, anytime, anywhere is not funny. <br /> <br /> Rob Schneider, I think, is accepted in the role. By this I mean that he is not a bad actor. But with bad content, it is difficult to comment on quality Romantic or not?) Seems to be embarrassing It seems that she is acting in some vacuum, separated from other actors in the movie. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie only if you want to be bored with boring, boring and repetitive material.
