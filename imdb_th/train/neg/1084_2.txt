I rented this DVD for two reasons. Excellent actor and director, although Robert Altman can hit or miss In this case, it's a big deal. Altman's efforts to create a suspicion of being with Keester after seeing Kenneth Branagh in a good movie, such as "Dead Again". Will not destroy the reputation. Robert Duvall seems to have failed to win the most Academy Award once. When spinning down, which includes acting in the movie, eating money like this Duvall was a great actor in a great film, although his best performance was not "Tender Mercies" but "The Great Santini".
