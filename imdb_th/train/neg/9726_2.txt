This is a very scary movie. It has little reason for it to start creating its own strange internal logic. If it didn't go out into the alleys until he was finally struggling under the weight of his own indecision The movie couldn't decide whether the movie 'Man became a monster' that was straightforward. (Just like in the 1950s 'THE INCREDIBLE INSERTING ING MAN movies' verbs) or horrible business conspiracy theories Afterlife contact story or ... or whatever your choice, it's a mess Weirdly above the top and shot in all directions, letting the loose end flick across the place as if Tobe Hooper had taken David Lynch's medicine. Unfortunately, he wasn't enough.
