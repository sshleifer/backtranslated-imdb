Slashers ..... If you like the horrors, it's a must to see. Otherwise, don't worry, it's obvious that this movie has a very low budget. For example, it seems like this movie has been filmed. Somewhere somewhere in the warehouse and in many times you will see the shadow of the boom boom and the shadow of the camera. Trust me that you don't need to look for them. Also, try to ignore the magic actor if that's what you call them. !! There are only a handful of people who decide to play a game show where they have to survive one night, a great maze, because they are 3 murderers in a busy life and whoever lives in the end will be rich. Now there is something about this movie that makes you look and rarely find a horror story about cheap budget today. For example, when I watch it, I think to myself, I don't want to play this game! Especially for $ 12.000.000, so I suggest you watch and decide for yourself
