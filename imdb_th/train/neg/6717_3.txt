This is a terrible God. Stories all over the place and more often than I am confused because of the horrible correction. I do not feel sympathetic to anyone because their characters are not developed enough. They are extremely superficial people that do not have a dimension. Cheesy, magic stereotypes that have subplots that are nowhere. The stripper chick is just a distraction, even if she looks good. I don't know if this is what I try to be. But I'm shocked when they show this trash in Sundance? I almost canceled my subscription. You think that such channels will show more quality movies. There are a lot better gay and lesbian movies. "The Celluloid Closet" is a great documentary. I like "Wigstock: The Movie" thoroughly. I'm sure there are others who slipped my mind while this But what I try to say is that this is not worth it. If you catch it on TV, ok <br /> <br /> There may be three or four pictures that look very good. (Sadly, I can count it with one hand). Otherwise, the movie is Pretty crappy as well The light is closed in many places. I think there are some effects to try and add something that doesn't really happen. <br /> <br /> I can't deny that Johnny Rebel is quite hot. Unfortunately, his performance didn't do anything for me. Next to real porn, close friends <br /> <br /> 3/10
