I am a current A.S.L student and are forced to watch this movie in class and what I got from it is an obvious prejudice in the movie. This film is clearly biased towards P.O.V of their "general deaf awareness". There is no middle ground. In addition, the film does not mention or consider other situations that are under discussion in this topic. I.E. Deaf people who have heard and after that are deaf. Is it right or wrong in that case? This film has a lot of prejudice and almost in the opinion of the deaf who has the capital "D". Not that it's not good. But for being a true documentary movie, try not to be slightly biased.
