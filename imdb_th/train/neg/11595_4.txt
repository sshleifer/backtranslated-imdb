Star rating: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Alice lost Freddy At the end of the last movie is Now try to adjust her life again. But her unborn child is acting evil - Freddie tries to come out to their world again. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to observe the director at Break the film director Freddie - Charles Russell Mask) Renny Harlin (The Long Kiss Goodnight, Cutthroat Island, Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2) and Stephen Hopkins (Lost in Space, Predator 2) While Russell and Harlin did a good job, Hopkins IMO created something. Puddle and this item that should be forgotten quickly <br /> <br /> The story that has been stretched as far as possible can go here too. Freddie laughs like a father and himself, a demon boy. That looks ridiculous Although it takes about an hour and a half But everything is quite boring and not scary. <br /> <br /> The phrase "bon appetit, bitch" is the only memorable spot here. Very clever, memorable item *
