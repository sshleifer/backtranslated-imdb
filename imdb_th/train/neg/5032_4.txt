This movie is in sci-fi. 50-pack my friend came to me for Christmas. It is similar to the first film of Gozilla and like that movie, there is a scene in which American actors enter without real reason. One interesting thing about the insertion scene is that there is tension from the Cold War shown between America and Russia. Just as Godzilla Gamera was awakened by the atomic bomb and rampant around the world with close attention to Tokyo. Overall, this is an ok movie. Some scenes related to Gamera, especially the scenes in Toly, are quite exciting and have special effects that are quite good at that time. If you like Japanese giant monster movies, you will be fired from this job. I give 4 out of 10 if this is the Japanese version that I am not resolved, which may be 5.
