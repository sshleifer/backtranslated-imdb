<br /> <br /> When summarizing the view of "Trance" or "The Eternal" or whatever the producer calls this movie, I wonder if "From all the bad movies I've seen At least I haven't seen someone who is fun? Although movies are not created well in terms of acting, directing, writing or anything that is in you, at least it is fun and worthwhile, but not only is this movie valuable in art. But it's incredibly boring For a plot that is so thin, it moves very slowly and has a slight tension. At least in an effort that has low eyebrows in the entertainment industry, the death of the character should be cool and / or full of blood. But the creator of this ship has failed in that department as well. <br /> <br /> What does this movie have to do for it? There is nothing surprising, except you will be entertained by watching Christopher Walken, who has a great talent, spending a little effort in his performance in which he falls into self-parody mode. br /> I gave this movie 3/10 because God helped us have a movie that's worse than it had been before.
