If you want to see animals that have been skinned, their heads smashed dogs that were crushed, crushing my people, stomping on them, so this is for you! But if you are normal and do not need to visualize the cruelty of the real animal, pass it on. This movie tries to shock the audience and make sure it happens to the animals at the beginning and killing the children in the movie. (At least a fake) It's enough to get myself off. I've watched movies like Previously showing a slaughterhouse (BTK movie) and this type of video should not be allowed in horror movies. We watched blood and horror because we knew it was just makeup and special effects so we should not sit down. Watching movies and watching the actual slaughter of animals is not what we rent for movies. If there is, there should be a large warning sign attached to this type of junk movie so that people win it. Don't be surprised. As a hardcore horror fan, this person turned my stomach. All movie actors and teams need to be examined.
