The incoherent movie about a man who belonged to and from the religious age of the 1960s advanced hippies that fought them sixteen years later. The man had a child with another cultist in the cult, which during the attack by the police was hidden and another named Hawk, who lived in a small cottage along the river. It is difficult to track who the character is or what time of the scene should happen. The leader was granted sixteen years later. (I received it from the box - I missed the time in the movie.) No one was clearly created to look older. <br /> <br /> One murder occurred from a large log saw and others made With a knife or a crossbow I never heard the name of the character, the title mentioned in the movie. But he is the one who conquers the most. Compression and hollering. <br /> <br /> This film has been modified quite well. To explain what happened Some sound effects are quite bad. A man was punched and we heard the whip cracking. The woman shot the gun and we didn't hear the loud gun. But heard ricochet instead! Seems to be not funny
