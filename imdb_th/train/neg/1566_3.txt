For the Beatles fans who have knowledge, the main value of this movie is to just sit down and choose defects, inaccuracies, events that merge, events that are ignored, exaggerated events, people who ignore errors. Of places, songs and (Disgrace) wrong tools and other mistakes that I just think now Defects come quickly and violently, so you must be at your toes. <br /> <br /> I don't give this thing. "1" is mainly due to the fact that it was filmed in Liverpool and the actors Rain) give everything to them (Lennon's character is reliable and works well). In addition, the song "Cry for a Shadow" is heard at one point and that is considered interesting. <br /> <br /> So watch it. For fun But please don't think that it is accurate in the past
