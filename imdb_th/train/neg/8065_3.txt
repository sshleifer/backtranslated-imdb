Steve Carpenter can't create horror movies First of all, the casting is very wrong for this movie. The only good thing is the hot brunette girl from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. This film has no bleeding. (Usually an important component of horror movies) no action, no acting and no doubt (Eg an important component) West Bentley is a good actor But he was arid in this matter until sad There are some that should be funny. (Continued from horror / comedy) and no one laughs among the audience. I think this movie has been rated R and I didn't care and realized that it changed to PG-13. However, watch this movie if you like me also know what you did last summer That is the only type that will find this movie scary from a distance. And seriously, this is Steve Carpenter to stop making horror movies This movie makes Scream look like Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
