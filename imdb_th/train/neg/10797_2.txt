There is a devil that is played by Shaq. His name is Kazaam. And he hit his crazy rhymes. This is not good. Some stupid children cry in bad deeds of the fool. This movie sucked Prolly not making 20 bucks. He lives in a boombox, not a sore lamp like cramp like wet food stamps ... <br /> <br /> Yes, you understand. Not shown in stupid movies with awesome special effects. Oh and it's confusing like hell. I will not continue Suppose it is in the category "It's terrible. Funny." Watched once with your friends and laughed well. But don't expect anything exciting
