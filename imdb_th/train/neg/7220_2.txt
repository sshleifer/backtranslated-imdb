Where do they get money from making movies like this? I mean, there is no redemption of this film. There are no known actors, terrible writing, unclear photography, nomadic stories while being a bad Repo Man with Western singers and unbelievable performances. For people who watch all kinds of movies, good and bad, I have to admit that this movie is the worst I have ever seen since Attack of the Eye People. Back in the 50s, I didn't like leaving the efforts of the people who tried. Create entertainment or heaven forbid art But this movie doesn't seem to attract anyone This is caused by a mysterious contamination of a person who is a bad Celtic Soul person, even though he acts more like a male succubus than without striking. Bad people must cooperate with the good people in the city that they cannot escape from. Take it from there, alas, is the best part My advice is that if you are not in a bad legend, write an amateur, unbelievable acting and boring settings, you will get the best service by letting this story stay on the shelves.
