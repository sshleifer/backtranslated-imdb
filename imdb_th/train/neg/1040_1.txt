I do not want to believe that this movie will get a 6 times higher rating! It's almost impossible to see and boring, which is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> In a way that doesn't have a budget, it reminds me of Star Wars Episodes I and II For the true impression that you are watching the wreck of the creative train. <br /> <br /> This film should avoid all costs. It is one "Film Festival" that pleases the intellectuals because they make those people think that it makes "different". So well <br /> <br /> Making a bad movie is no different. "It's just a bad movie creation.
