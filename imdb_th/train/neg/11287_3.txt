This is a movie that has many stories to live. In the year that the legendary film critic released Barry Norman, thought it was the worst movie of the year, and I didn't hear anything except the bad things about it, especially the story that was criticized as complicated. <br /> <br /> In fact, the story is red herring and the film suffers more when using the word "plot" because as far as I can see that there is no plot like this There is something about the Russian gangsters. The character is named Pete Thompson, who tries to get Sarah, his wife, stomach and Irish name Sean. They all fit what is called "plot". I'm not sure it's hard to explain Guy Ritchie's movie plot, but if you watch one of my movies, I'm sure we can all. Accepting that they all have qualities, no matter how complicated it looks at first viewing. In the same way, the James Bond movie, although the plan is extended with action scenes You will have serious problems believing that RANCID ALUMINUM has a central plot that can be accurately explained. <br /> <br /> Watching the actors list will be loud to remind the bell enough for any type of movie. You are watching Sadie Frost appearing in the worst British film in the past 15 years, and she doesn't do anything. Steven Berkoff shows a bad name. (And he plays as a character named Kant, which summarizes the results of this film) while one of the characters supported by the presenter on the television presumably because no serious actors will die in <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it can't be forgotten. I saw it a few days ago and immediately after watching, I wrote a very long review, reminding people of what they let themselves go to watch. But now I have forgotten why But this doesn't change the fact that I remember not really like this shit.
