I saw that movie and I was shocked! Robert Carlyle is not Hitler. He is the one who tried to Hitler. The movie is lying. It doesn't reflect the truth. In that scene, Hitler collided with his gun. Hitler never attacked anyone, he wouldn't attack people with fists. But with the punch of the military, understand ?? Another thing is: It is too clear that Hitler is evil. He is smarter than he appears in this movie. There was no German who accepted him as a leader because he saw that he was evil. So the real Hitler did not show his evil to the people. <br /> <br /> Did Yankees watch the movie "Der Untergang" or "The Dawnfall"? This is a great movie with an amazing actor. And is a German movie I think this Nazi-Germany theme should not be recognized as a movie by people who don't know anything about Germany. People! Watch "Der Untergang": <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/ <br /> <br /> It's a great movie about a very sad moment for Man around the world.
