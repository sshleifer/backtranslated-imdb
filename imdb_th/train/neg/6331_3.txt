Mr Mike is probably the most hated comedian of all time, so I am interested in seeing what he will do with creative control in the movie. Sadly, it is an indisputable matter. But not because of jokes, not some jokes (I'm not going to talk the most) and in fact, Mike did very well. The problem is technical quality (set, light, sound, editing, you name it) is a terrible god, this movie is too much. Some costumes, called "PKO Productions", receive credit for production. But it didn't look like. It seems that Mike would steal a camera from the live series and do everything in the afternoon. I know that Mike's goal is to torture the audience. But even though it deserves some basic standards such as being able to see, hear, or understand what it should be shocking However, the DVD is not a total waste: it includes the praise from Bill Murray and the three songs from SNLearry Loved Bedtime Stories of SNL. It's a great scene to watch if you want to make someone fall out. 3/10
