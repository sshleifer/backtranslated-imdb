I watched this movie in History Channel today (in 2006). First of all, I realized that this is not a documentary - it's a drama, but one might hope at least. The important "facts" that open stories may depend on real events Reagan is shot and the other characters are real people. This movie is correct. Then, dependence on facts decays quickly. I have never heard of this before. After being a TV reporter at the time of these events, I was stunned that I had not heard anything about the strange behavior of the secretary, Hague, as Richard Dreyfus described. The whole nation had heard the word "I am the controller ..." etc. But Dreufuss' The Hague is intimidating the powerful and uncontrollable cabinet. After watching the movie, I started researching the story on the internet and found real audio tapes and transcripts from most Situation Room conversations that the film pretended to show again. White House, Secret Service and others in chaos, including irrational national leadership They didn't happen! There are internal conflicts to ensure Hague made a mistake in acting in his press room. It was sad in the past and he was "hard" but nothing near the scene that appeared in the movie. There are too many errors in the list. But a fair comparison of the recorded and written notes and the imagination of this film raises the question of what producers are trying to accomplish. Teach? inform? Entertainment? I believe they failed on all three sides. It is difficult to define motivation for others. But must seriously ask what is an unscrupulous invention And for my beloved "Reel to Real" documentary, there is no mention of the central point of the film - an internal event on the day of filming Therefore, the audience was left to research those who do not have help from the network.
