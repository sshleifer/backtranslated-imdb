No, I have never seen any "Santa Slasher" series such as 'Silent Night, Deadly Night', 'Black Christmas', or this 'Christmas Evil'. I have heard about their reputation, MADS (Mother and Deranged Santas. ) I think I will rent this one because I hear that it appears as a reference in the section. <br /> Mother should be against this. But not for "killer" santa, but for ooooohhhh Even in just 92 minutes, crap. <br /> <br /> The little boy saw Santa go down the chimney in 1947, delivering gifts, eating and miracles to the chimneys. Boy into bed But returned to the living room to testify to the mother and Santa Obviously this made the child confused for the rest of the life, even though the scene was as hot as Ralphie's father received "Leg Lamp" in 'A Christmas Story'. He was very disturbed. He went to the attic and cut his hand. <br /> <br /> Fast forward to the future! It is now 1980 and confusing children to work in the toy factory. We made him flutter a little, and he stalked both children and parents. Who's naughty? Well, blah blah must use two-thirds of this movie. As if it were not predicted from one frame Movies shouldn't take a long time. <br /> <br /> I'll admit that this movie has tension. But just because I expect him to do something with everyone Finally, when he did so well punished "mischievous", it was a graphic card "trash boy" and I did not mention the end of WTF. I think it is a metaphor. But in reality it is strange, like the rest of the movie (Take the brother who is not satisfied with his brother's killing and his solution is? Eh-killing) Don't open this mess even on Christmas Eve or evil. Again I didn't watch "Santa-Slashers", others, but this one is terrible. It creates suspicion due to the nature of the movie and never delivers good gifts at all.
