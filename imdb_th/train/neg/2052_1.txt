This waste of time is creating a great movie that is not necessary at all. There are no new or original additions other than Perry's backslash, which is an additional benefit. It lacks the first documentary feeling and urgency that makes it effective. What is missing is painful. The Quincy Jones soundtrack adds clarity to the original movie. I can't understand the very high score for this thing. It's quite bad Why don't anyone waste time or money doing this kind of shit and why I waste time watching?
