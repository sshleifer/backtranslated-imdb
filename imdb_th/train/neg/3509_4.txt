Somewhere in this movie is a half hour episode from The Twilight Zone that tries to go out, while Cube is tense, well done, uncomfortable and attractive. I am afraid. Can have many things that do not add much Before this half-way sci-fi movie, <br /> <br /> Cypher managed to drag all the way through a relatively short 95 minutes until an incompetent ending. There are no characters that will spark each other and for movies created in 2002, the technology is really wonderful. It is difficult to connect a movie that is tired and unwanted with Cube director. It's not a bad movie. But it's not the best movie. <br /> <br /> When you look at the grass and paint it dry and bored with the insects, then watch this movie. But other activities may prove more exciting
