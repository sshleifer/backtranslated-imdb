What makes me follow this movie is watching Vampyres. I think I have to watch another movie that this man (Larroz) has done. I'm sorry that I follow this. It's a weak attempt of superstition / hell movies. Sex and single sex (With ugly actors and actors, this is an excuse for a sleaze. The only factor that is redeemed is the setting and the atmosphere. Avoid this stuff. Too much hype surrounds. Welcome to the smiling home version. I hope he has other movies that live with Vampyres. Oh and the goat scene is very boring. I understand that this is what leads to advertising.
