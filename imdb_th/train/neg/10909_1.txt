This is a terrible movie. I laugh once or twice and the story is worse! There may be funny jokes about one thing. It's stupid and boring. Throughout the short film, I fell asleep and wondered when it would end. <br /> <br /> No one acts as a human being, and everyone shows stupid and absurd attitude. I'll pay to watch it look funny, but the bottom line: Don't waste valuable time on ugly and stupid movies. <br /> <br /> I wonder if it's going to end even though the movie is short. We think it will improve. But it's getting worse. Stupidly, the way I walked out of the cinema and I remember that this movie was terrible forever. <br /> <br /> The writer and producer of this film is a writer. Simpson's TV But this is not what the Simpsons movie sucks !!!)
