I am one of the few people who are not independent who appear to see Steve's video. It was a quite experience ... in creating movies, propaganda and boredom. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie may be the true documentary of Michael Moore's visit to UVSC, but the school turns out to be Is another attempt by the freedmen to slash and burn to conserve slam and local religious communities. It seems that he will act as a documentary maker that reflects only his ideas on various matters. <br /> <br /> The more surprising thing is to see all the votes '10' at his house. Post here Do they watch videos? Golly gee Batman must be ranked with All The President's Men! Their ratings are as clear as the bias in this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, such as stacking points that IMDb will help lame movies. Maybe my vote may help balance this.
