Admittedly, I watched this work with very low expectations. Dieter Bohlen is a relatively uneducated songwriter who lacks the ability to only his ego size. <br /> <br /> This is The first animated film I watched is 100 percent free joke. It is blatant, aggressive, intolerant, and blatantly against women. As such, it is a suitable work for Bohlen, but the average audience is quite delayed by it. It is not surprising that it never appeared in cinemas: it would be a big blow. <br /> <br /> Not even the cost of 6.5 MegaEuros can help this shit. Save your time ... and money!
