The wisdom of the film school can enlighten everything they need about the important (imaginary) meaning of this movie. But it was like that: Wisdom drool. This movie went bankrupt creatively and there were some mistakes that never gave up. Yes. <br /> <br /> Godard is clearly not a fan of rock. Terrible because this thing is great. He captured the origin of the song that didn't have this time, and he chose to cover up the song with some men reading Mag. The real detective or the crap. <br /> <br /> Then there was an endless picture of What looks like a 60s librarian, spraying on people's cars And then there is an "interview" that seems never ending, which the actors get intelligently ordered to answer, yes or no, for all in-depth and intellectual questions Some friends in the purple suit are reading the shit from another book, which takes about 20 minutes and the black panther or something in the garbage collection. <br /> <br /> It sounds. Interesting, isn't it? <br /> <br /> But for Hipster, a film school that has never been showered, who doesn't care about losing the opportunity to reach the rock in full capacity, Sympathy for the Devil comes in the world The English people read instead while staring at the cover of nudie mag. This movie is a true winner. <br /> <br /> More precise ... Maybe Godard might explode.
