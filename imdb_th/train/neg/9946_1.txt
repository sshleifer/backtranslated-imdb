Spoiler here <br /> <br /> My high school is doing everything I can to try to encourage us to take the exam. But the most memorable way they used to put us in the right state was an invited guest speaker, who was none other than Australia's kickboxing favorite son, Stan "The Man" Longinidis. They did this to the microphone because he screamed half the time, even though we were sitting no more than 3 or 4 feet away from him. Now, his words are full of normal things. "If you fail to prepare, then prepare to fail." But there are many cases where I really work. The guy standing in front of us preached that throughout his life he did everything for himself. And no one else He received many offers in the past to stop boxing. But he never lost sight of Australia's biggest boxer award He said that he didn't sell out. He was happy and retired. He never participated in any other activity except kickboxing? He then plugged his film. Yes, you heard right. He plugged in his new film. As he spoke of it, he had a woman coming in and holding an advertising poster, and then he showed a 4-minute short clip of this bad movie called "Warrior Warrior" (all this was before he was defeated. Lost by Gurkan Ozkan in his final battle. Occupation (now)) <br /> <br /> Stan plays Ajax, the agent kicking a former special fighter who is pulled into the underworld of Melbourne, Ajax's cousin. , Theo (Arthur Angel) recently All (at least Stan didn't stray too far from everything) to the shepherd, and as a result, fleeing all forms of crime. Ajax and Theo entered every nonsense situation from fighting in the Kebab shop to Posing as a playboys at a slave party It's ridiculous, but if Silverstein intends to create a credible movie here, this guy shouldn't send the camera again. <br /> <br /> I'll admit that I was actually pumped to see this. I love action movies, though it seems repetitive and especially if it's in my own backyard. But what I was introduced to is a movie that has a horrible performance from the word "go" and still do so after the word "For the love of God, please make it stop!" Sub-plans are suggested and not even touched. Once again, after they went out, the characters were thrown in without any reason and the most choreographed fight scenes that did not reflect Stan's true ability in kickboxing from the stage. far The actor consists of a pendant that is useless by anyone famous in the distance. (Dermot Brereton, Mark "Chopper" Read and Greg Matthews) All the time you sit there and play a game that guesses who will stand in the background. Unfortunately, the film is based on the second appearance of a former celebrity. Can you remember the holes that I told you? Ajax, once upon a time, was clearly imprisoned for allegedly killing his wife. Now we hear that Ajax is in a special force through a single sentence in the movie WHOLE and then let it be debugged. Followed by a single sentence that persuaded Ajax to help the people who had locked him wrong. Then received this at the end. It was revealed to Ajax that his wife had not died. But was sold as a prostitute Do we see you Did Ajax go out to find her as soon as he heard this? No, that's marriage! <br /> <br /> Among this annoying nonsense, some websites explain that this movie is "a cross between Jackie Chan and Guy Ritchie ??" This man used to watch Jackie Chan movies? Chan shows more fluency in data transfer than Stan had done, right? Everything! And Guy Ritchie are messengers in crime movies and you compare him and Salik Silverstein !? This movie is like a combination of "Pizza" and "Enter The Ninja". <br /> <br /> Now, what is the name "Trojan Warrior" all from? Ajax's fierce fighting skills like the ancient Greek warriors? Does the grouping of gangsters in search of Theo like the Imperial Trojans? Is not it because ?? wait for it?? Theo holds a condom with him. Yes, correct, because THEO is always ready to receive the Trojan brand in his pocket, so he is a Trojan WARRIOR! <br /> <br /> I was not happy to see "Trojan Warrior" on the DVD including the feature " Special ": <br /> <br /> ?? Video clip of "Chop Chop" rap song by Mark "Chopper". Read: Chopper does this for the sole purpose of proving that everyone can rap. The funny thing is Chopper, just rapping for 30 seconds, then throwing it to two white teens from Doncaster using words like "dis" and "dope", etc. in their Australian accent. Confront the developed rap people in the United States out of there! The clip looks like a photographer, channel 31 on ecstasy. <br /> <br /> ?? Bloopers: There is no real difference between these and the real movie. <br /> <br /> ?? Stan "The Man "Longinidis Kickboxing Featurette: This is not so bad because it is a 6 or 7 different battle that is shown from different angles. (I think I saw Dennis Alexio falling about 15 times. <br /> <br /> I don't want to say that this movie has contributed to the reason that this country is going to hell when it comes to movies. I just do My advice for everyone reading this is for you to go out and buy "Warrior Warrior", a copy of 4 or 5 copies, tape together and use it as a document because this film is very bad.
