An ordinary thriller about every deceitful woman who she should love to add to her bank account.

The problem was not far from him. <br /> <br /> The script failed because it didn't develop a good place. The thrill and the lack of motivation of the characters, the background and the serious development make the whole performance even There are no actors who can create interest in their superficial characters, especially Bill Pullman, whom Andy suspects inexplicably impossible to believe. <br /> <br /> The amazing director Pity Harold Becker and can not entertain from one thing at a time when the 'secret' of the plot is revealed. You don't care. <br /> <br /> At least this movie looks good. In Massachusetts, also showing George C. Scott, Pet stars er Gallagher and Josef Sommer. <br /> <br /> Sunday 25 February 1996 - T.V.
