I received this movie as a gift. I know from the DVD cover. This movie is going to be terrible after not watching it for over a year. Finally I watched it. What is the pathetic movie?. <br /> <br /> I rarely watch this movie badly. But it is not fair for me to write a review without watching the complete movie. <br /> <br /> Trust me when I say "This movie sucked." I was really shocked that some villain filmmakers received grants to create pathetic movies. But it doesn't cost more than $ 20,000 to create this movie All you need is a cheap video camera or about 15 mobile phone cameras that do not have acting skills. There are leaves written by two drunken people. <br /> <br /> In the bad part of This bad movement One journalist (Tara Woodly) runs to the drunken man to report to the hunter. He is completely dangerous. They go to the abandoned house. But fortunately it was almost finished and there was a bottle of wine at the door Just to be drunk But all is not what it looks like. <br /> <br /> Then the drunken man who should start telling the story of Tara ghost / zombies <br /> <br /> Fist of the fool The worst lame story in history. <br /> <br /> His story. <br /> <br /> Sgt Ben Draper let one of his soldiers die from exhaustion. (I think this is what happened) After letting the poor soldier Wilson sit down, he let him dig a grave and the soldiers collapsed into Ben Draper. <br /> <br /> Buried He was in a shallow grave. <br /> <br /> But Sgt. Bendrer was very surprised. His wife / girl knew this and she and her lover killed Sgt. Private Wilson (Next to the grave of a soldier he killed) soldiers woke up from his grave in the form of zombies and killed them for revenge in his name. <br /> <br /> The ending twist <br /> <br /> Even if you like B HORROR, don't watch this movie.
