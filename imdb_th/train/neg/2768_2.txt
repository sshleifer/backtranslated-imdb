This movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> They didn't develop the characters at all and the story came out scary. It is definitely a bedroom. You expect the action scenes in this movie to be a strength, but D-Wars makes you surprised by giving up on that department. <br /> <br /> In addition, the show is still a step above The level of low budget flick And I mean seriously. <br /> <br /> I'm really happy to see the credit at the end of this story because it's terrible !!! Please, no matter what you do with others, don't waste time and money on crappy movies like D-Wars.
