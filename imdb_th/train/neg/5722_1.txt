First of all, I want to forgive my bad English. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of HOSTEL, but I like that movie. However, the live feed is a big waste of time! I have never seen a blood movie that has a great performance. But hey, who would be surprised? Performing in Live Feed is ... uh, not there! I've seen some people express this opinion because it must be a school project or something. Okey, but not by students in the media or acting schools. This is not a class! What about the story? Really sad hostel, gore? And the mental torture scenes that should make your courage twist and make you feel cold That's the most frustrating story about the movie! Short, fast and without edges Like death rather than torture But it doesn't look real The murder and violence reminded the Braindead more than any Hostel or Saw movie and the Braindead was fun! Okey I laughed at Live Feed a couple of times, but that was more frustrating than the fun
