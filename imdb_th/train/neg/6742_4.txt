For romantic comedies, I often judge the quality of this film by looking at the ambiguity in my eyes at the end of the experience. Unfortunately for "The Wedding Date", I can only score 4 out of 10 tears. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the fans of Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney, but I don't see much chemistry between them. Two characters The evidence of this film is "Pretty Woman". In contrast to Dermot, Nick is a high-priced male escort who is hired by Debra's character to accompany her to England to marry her sister. yours Romantic relationships should develop between patrons and customers. But the conversation seems forced and invented And the romantic sparkle is not enough in Nick and Kat's relationship. <br /> <br /> In the supporting role, Amy Adams stands out as Kat's sister. Whenever Amy comes on the screen She acts as a spark plug and catalyst for film energy. Maybe if Amy Adams plays the role of a movie cat, there may be more dynamics. But when it came out instead of looking for Kleenex, I was looking for a scene in an attempt to pretend to be at least that the film had true feelings and love.
