I think this movie is a bad documentary. There is no mention of anything. Seems to make the idea inferior and does not give anything new This film is not surprising or romantic or anything that will propel science. Most scientists appear "stereotyped" and sometimes strange. A woman said that her reward is not important. But only the children received help She said that after 10 minutes of the incident, which she described, all of her awards were playing "the humble scientist", right? "I have a dance equation in my head." Another person said. I didn't see the way that explained anything to us. It does not cover the major impact of science on our culture. The science of science is almost unimaginable. <br /> <br /> Not flick, not good for children 10-14 years. In addition, I feel that it is boring and undisclosed. <br /> <br /> 4/10
