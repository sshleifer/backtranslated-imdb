I watched the movie Herzog 8 or 9, and there is nothing that will affect me. <br /> <br /> I watched many documentaries about him. Obviously he is a wise man with knowledge about movies and a passion for creating it. But this makes him a good director. Of course not! Resist complete ability He can create a good documentary film because of the characteristics mentioned earlier. But movies with actors? Never <br /> <br /> He can't order or write. His screenplay is filled with situations that are not well thought out and many situations / conversations in his films are made like children and are so bad that they cannot hide behind every word of "art". No way. No need to talk about unskilled directions. So like an amateur. To say that he wanted to direct that way and write that shit as a lie. <br /> <br /> Like the scene in which Scheitz was arrested and Storszek hid behind the store. Who is he? <br /> <br /> He is a rogue. He knows what intellectuals and critics want. He knows what elements he needs to put in the script so that you get the attention and receive an empty compliment. Don't be interested in the rest of the script and the sloppy direction. <br /> <br /> Just look at Julio Medem. If Herzog can create a movie like Medem, I may check his old movie again and try to find out Can be special in it
