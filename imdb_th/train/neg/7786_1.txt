I shouldn't watch this movie at all. The style of filming can be an art for some people. But is considered a migraine that makes me obsessed I think it might be an interesting plot. But since I can't see it in the long term, in times that I miss a lot Flickering images and stopping the movement, filming my brain seal I stopped watching in the middle of the way and would not come back for a second time. I think if I was home alone in my own lighthouse in the dark and stormy evenings, this could be just a ticket ... PS Not sure what the lighthouse / movie is regarded as a spoiler But i don't want to be Blacklisted in my first review;)
