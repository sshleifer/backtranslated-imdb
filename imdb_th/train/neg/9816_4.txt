This movie is like a horrible train wreck like the original. You still have to look further. My girlfriend and I rented it and wasted two hours on our day. Now don't understand me wrong. The performance is good. Just the movie as a whole makes us both angry. Nothing good or good about this situation. After this film, I had to rent something else that was slightly lighter. Jennifer Tilly is like an amazing actor. Her character seems crazy and not at all. Darryl Hannah, even though playing more, she has done a great job in the situation where she is more than one time when I find myself shouting at the TV. She fights In all matters, movies that are very violent ... not for impatient people
