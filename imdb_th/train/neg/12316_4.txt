Director Jonathan Lennon made past bad-value comedies such as 'greedy' and 'smiling'. This is not one of them. Similar to the movie 'Police Academy' rather than its inspiration, it was the star Steve Martin in the old role of Phil Silvers as an army sergeant. But Bilko's beautiful life and his lazy military division seem shaky when the old enemy visits the base that is determined to catch Bilko in action. Nothing really happens. It's quite boring. It's not very funny. Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman squeezed out a few laughs. But they are still better and it is quite painful when watching them work with thin materials.
