Watching "Kroko" I want to leave the cinema for the first time in my life. I would not recommend watching this movie: the main character is flat - absolutely undeveloped, like Kroko. German children with metaphorical problems are still pure metaphors without the ability to participate positively. Despite having a good chance of doing so The actors do not get inspired, the plot does not develop. I guess this movie tries to explore the environment. But without success: the camera looks more shaky than motivation Pictures are low contrast, gray and black - I'm sure intentionally. But that component does not increase the credible impression of the social environment The story has some potential. But it may make a good short story
