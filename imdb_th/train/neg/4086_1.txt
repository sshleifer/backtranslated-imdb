I came to this movie with high expectations. I recognize Greenaway's work and 'The Tempest' and are interested in adapting. The first time I want to close after ten minutes. But felt that it would not be fair There is a representative of the storm. But in your mind, do you think the little boy peeing the toy boat? What is the symbol of I proceeded for another ten minutes. My finger twitched to the 'off' button. Some things would catch my attention. This is not Shakespeare, not a movie. Have time and place for it But I will not waste my time and there is no place for Shakespeare's education After twenty-five minutes, I gave up and that was the end. Then I read all the comments on this website and the film's pretentiousness was matched by the defendant only. 'It is a painting ..... and put it in the gallery', 'It's a ballet ..... Keep it on stage.' Shakespeare can do it wisely and plays. Being shown to a large audience, they can be reached and this version allows the connection between Shakespeare and the general public in general
