And THE WEDDING MARCH. Basically, we have three grifters wearing a number of Russian and two Russian princesses who rented a villa in Monte Carlo. Their goal is to use counterfeit money at the table. Day and luck Part of that plan is for the Count (von Stroheim) to provoke himself between the American ambassador who visited and his "stupid" wife, seeking her and hoping to earn money from playing with her weaknesses. He made a mistake in saving the lives of housewives, whom he promised to marry. When she saw them together, she set fire to the room. (Von Strohem and his victims on the balcony of the room) This is the first time that von Stroheim defines his personality as "The person you love hates". He is completely bad and the shortcomings of his character eventually lead him to a bad end and eventually deserve. This film has rawness in movies and editing and is not worth seeing unless you are impressed with the director. There is a lovely bit - when he tried to meet the ambassador's wife for the first time, she was reading a book - we saw the name - FOOLISH Wives by Erich von Stroheim.
