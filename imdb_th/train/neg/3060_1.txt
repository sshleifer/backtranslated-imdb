This movie must be the most frightening and distorted holiday I've ever clapped and said something. I know that Mexican people have strange ideas about religion, mingling ancient Aztec beliefs with traditional Christian theology. But the day of death is not as scary as it should be in Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> So .. Santa doesn't have fun, cheerful, alcoholic, suitable for red fat. (Try looking at those rose cheeks) Sometimes!) But he is a skinny sociologist who lives in heaven. (Or heaven, anyway) with a group of children working harder than them in Kathy's sweat shop Lee Gifford. They sing a lovely traditional song in their hometown while wearing stereotypical clothes at I was surprised that there were no small African-American boys singing black songs. Looks like 'Mammy'. This Santa is a sneak peek at Tom who is watching and listening to everything that everyone is doing. 'Eyes in the sky' This is so that he can tell who is naughty or good. (With an emphasis on naughty people, I bet) <br /> <br /> No lady, Santa Claus, no elves. (What did he want the elves? When he had child labor?) And reindeer as a mechanical winding toy! This strange expression floating on a cloud, presumably caused by a silver lining. <br /> <br /> Santa's nemesis is ... a demon? Santa is the Lord and our Savior. What is strange. Anyhoo, Satan sends one of his minions, theatrical, amazing, the demon named Pitch, to try to make Christmas. Let me get this straight, the forces of pure evil are trying to destroy a completely commercial holiday and greed? Looks like it is redundant. <br /> <br /> Pitch doesn't work at all. He tried to talk to some children that they were bad people. But without much luck I am passionate about the story of the little girl Lupe who is a very poor family. Everything you need is a doll for Christmas. But his parents couldn't buy her (They spend all the money on the cardboard that they build the house out of). So Pitch tries to motivate her to steal the doll. In fact, that is the only way that a poor girl will receive a doll, because being a saint and praying to God and Santa is not really effective, but Lupe resisted temptation and told Pitch to take She goes behind her and is rewarded by giving the doll an eerie look until you know it's Chucky's sister. <br /> <br /> On the way to Pitch, manage Santa. Stuck in a tree (uh-huh) from where he was saved by Merlin! Merlin? You must be kidding me! When did the legendary druid figures appear in Christmas tales or what was associated with Christianity? And does God not agree with magic? They wanted to burn Merlin at the pole a few hundred years ago, without asking him to save his life in one of God's views. (Or that is what I think Santa must be in order to fight Satan). This movie has a length of HUH from beginning to end and it will make you wonder if the eggnog you drink isn't stabbed or something. Probably because this movie is like a giant DT that is long.
