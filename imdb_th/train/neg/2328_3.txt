I saw this thing recently and I have to say that I am impressed with the actual content. However, "Holly" as a movie does not work. However, I look forward to watching a documentary produced by this project because I think it will be more interesting than this movie. <br /> <br /> International actors include B-actors in class. But their performance is appropriate and I have to talk specifically for the actress who plays Holly This is her first screenplay and she works very well because she is the most challenging part. <br /> <br /> Ron Livingston is enough. But it is worth watching as Patrick, an American whose mission is "saving lives". Holly, but Chris Penn excelled in this, his last role. Unfortunately, the comments of Virginie Ledoyen and Udo Kier are highly appreciated. But both actors do not remember and perform the best in this movie. <br /> <br /> I believe in the text and intent of the movie. But I have to be fair, so I voted "Holly" 3 stars as a flaw as a movie. But I think this issue deserves serious consideration, and I am pleased that the people behind the film have made a documentary as well, which I hope will launch on BBC and other television networks.
