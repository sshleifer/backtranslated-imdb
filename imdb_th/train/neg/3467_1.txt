The front cover of the film is Kyle Minogue's name, but she has the same fate as Drew Barrymore, who performed in "Scream". That's the first thing that makes this movie weak. They are trying to market a movie with someone who is in there for 5 minutes. Of course, we have to have this movie, which is a young, hip college that has forgotten that there is a killer walking around Molly Ringwald from the famous teen movie in the 80s was the star of this beautifully written movie. It's a good career for Molly to get a crappy movie in Australia, so she won't be ridiculed in America. <br /> <br /> In any way, this dumb movie is a story. With a stupid horror movie that doesn't end because this stupid creature kills everyone in it Throughout the movie, we should guess who the murderer is. Short story, remember that our little friend Molly, she helped that day ... or she <br /> <br /> This movement is not good, normal. Rent it if you feel like torturing yourself or just Break it Layers of video stores in your area if you see it on the shelves. Don't spread the horror.
