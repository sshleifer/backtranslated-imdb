Now what happens to the actors who are involved in that shit? Michael Dorn should be stuck with Star Treck products. John Diehl, who can remember him in Miami Vice? Like him there ... no matter what - we expect from a movie with a savior from Baywatch as a leader? Nothing and that is what we get There are no characters that are fond of that special effect. Hilarious (but not funny) This story is funny (terrible). There is no reason for what happened. I get the feeling that the filmmakers are trying out certain types of "Attack of the tom killer", especially in scenes where everyone is important, talking about national security in some wardrobe ... <br /> < br /> If you see it on TV, change the channel - your TV will thank you.
