Kevin Spacey is very talented. But unfortunately the director is not his right hand I have high expectations about this movie before I rent it, and that's probably the reason I don't like it very much. I admire Spacey's efforts in making movies that happen mostly in small scenes, but it's not an effort that counts. I found that the movie was boring, boring and stretched out. The performance was nothing exciting. Gary Sinise did a lot better, especially when he was conscious of his other films. Skeet Ulrich was disappointing but this was one of his first films. (I was kicked out of Scream Star to see children and fat.) The only thing that impressed me about this movie was one picture from the car wreck from above. The center line of the road is completely centered and the camera moves along the line and through the remains. However, the shooting was "Usual Suspects" ish and I guess Spacey had ideas from his previous films. (Which is good for you) If you want to watch a great movie that takes place in a single small scene, watch Hitchcock's Lifebo. Maybe Spacey should watch it before filming this story.
