I have no exact knowledge about the author Phillipa Pearce or any of her novels, and if TOM`S MIDNIGHT GARDEN is normal for her work, I may be interested in her books since childhood. When I was a child, I didn't care about litreture unless there was a soldier fighting a monster with a tall body. <br /> <br /> Judging from the film of TOM`S MIDNIGHT GARDEN I guess Pearce wrote Low middle-class children, due to the story of the protagonist revolving around Tom, moved to a house without a garden and found metaphysical metaphysics. Having your own garden, there is no doubt that there is something that people in the working class do not have in the 1950s. So I think it has some political narratives that have some political class. There is also a love story related to a girl named Hatie. But again, is a cynical child who loves love stories? Perhaps the worst criticism is the excitement or little adventure that happened in the story. <br /> <br /> This is a movie for children that seems to be the source of the day. It's not dangerous But I was surprised by the high score from the IMDB voters. I wonder how many people get a very high score if they are 10 years old who just saw Lord of the Rings trilogy.
