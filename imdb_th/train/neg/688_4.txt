I always like Fred MacMurray, and although her career is tragicly shortened, I think Carole Lombard enjoys watching these two main and attractive stars together, adding top players such as Jean Dixon, Anthony Quinn, Dorothy Lamour and Charles Butterworth give a romantic script together with director Mitchell Leisen and you will get a moderate movie experience. <br /> Skid Johnson (Fred) and Maggie (Carole) "Meet the cuteness" While she toured the Panama Canal and used Wala, a few weeks ahead to fall in love with Skid, is a great trumpeter, so he started his music career, anticipating both up and down meteorology. While he climbed to become a stage actor, he often neglected Mackey, who inspired him to start a new one after he was hit by a rock. Ah, yes, it's a truly happy ending of Hollywood that comes too quickly. <br /> <br /> Stars and directors with this ability should guarantee success. But this movie is difficult to predict To see all the time, the first scenes in Panama were so creepy that it seemed that they were going to be forever and later. People with Skid's ingredients wandered in New York. Fred and Carole tried their best. But the script that is tired and the direction of S-L-O-W does not give them a chance. Even the last scene that Maggie encourages to slip from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment doesn't actually sound. <br /> <br /> This movie should be watched only once to watch the show soon from the stars. MacMurray and locals. However, I guarantee that it will take about 48 hours.
