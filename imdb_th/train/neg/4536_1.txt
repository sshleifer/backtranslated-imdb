This movie is nothing but a religious story that promotes classical Hinduism and modern superstition that is composed with western images that are swallowed by people who do not know about basic religious comparisons Basic Hindu tenants have elements of reincarnation. (Some characters appear both now and in the 1600s). Reincarnated clearly. God is an impersonal force. Life of animals and plants is the same. (This is a pantheon) Redfield has tried to blend East Mysticism with Western Christianty. His efforts in linking may trick or confuse those who do not seek truth But this movie is a weak excuse for the ultimate reality. As advertised in Berkeley Barb, who spoke for $ 10.00, will show you how to start your own religion. As one prophet said "Use the power of Luke"
