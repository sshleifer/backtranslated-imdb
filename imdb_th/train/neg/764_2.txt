The script for this Columbo movie seems to be drawn from the 80s drama that is not so good. The movie that is driven by a profound character is excellent. But if the character is interesting And in this movie, the only thing that is interesting is my desire to change the channel The villain's dialog box sounds like it was written by a romantic novelist, Lt. Colompo. The great man is not near the famous, lovable, generous, self-inflicted, crumpled and brides / people. Was kidnapped as a girl who was shaken in one dimension (she cowers with fear from a small scalpel, suddenly shaking her hand - come on !!! Hold your hand and kick him in what you know within 2 seconds.) Regardless, in fact, this character must try at least to fight or fight at least. And talking about reality .... The story is related to kidnapping, which police use and can fix police ?? Let me take a break. Everyone knows that the FBI took over every kidnapping case. This is NO Columbo, just a crime drama that is completely shallow and predictable with our familiar Lt. Columbo, written and stretched for 2 hours.
