Now I have this movie out of the library and I still can't finish it. It's terrible that I don't believe. Audrey Hepburn completely lost her ability, even though she had done it in 'Robin and Marian'. This is the worst thing about this horrible movie. It was only interesting because it was her latest documentary and because of Dorothy Straten's appearance before her murder. <br /> <br /> Nothing but stupidity. Between Gazzara and his followers, little signs and bows and a small nod to the real comedy about the ball screw, which is a light and dark shadow. <br /> <br /> Who will believe that there is Bang Si Some things from Manhattan in the same environment at Hepburn in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty years ago? The soundtrack of the old Sinatra song and Gershwin's song that the name is too loud and clear - you are sure not to wait for the credit to find out that there is something that is woven into a movie movie. To know when the song bursts out at you. <br /> <br /> 'Change to a genre' means back up or back. I guess In this case, the modern European woman of Audrey Hepburn is what you see from people who used to be actors and celebrities. Here, she lost her talent as a star. If the person who has the ability to continuously increase during that time, such as Ann-Margret, has a role, it will have something in life, even with unbelievable bad content and Mongolian situations. br /> Hepburn is a great person, of course, much bigger than the movie star that had dreamed of, and she was one of the most charming and beautiful actors. After this terrifying performance, she created a brutal television movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Between Thieves' in 'All of them laughing' as if she were still playing places in the 50s. She, even the smartest and less intelligent actress, who clearly made Lana Turner more effective than Hepburn. Turner performed seriously, even though she wasn't good. Hepburn didn't take anything seriously, not pay attention to it. Even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last good performance was 'Two for the Road'. Maybe she was the perfect one, if not the best in many ways. <br /> <br /> And the girl who plays as a country singer Oval John Ritter is terrible. There is nothing to recommend this movie except to see Dorothy Stratten, who is really cute. Otherwise, critics frequently use the phrases of David Thomson. 'Lose his / her ability'. There has never been any reason. <br /> <br /> Ben Gagara has lost all sexual attraction at that time. The latest movie of Sandra Dee, the pathetic 'Lost' from the next two years, nothing on a low budget is more than this. At least Dee spoke with her voice in 1981. Audrey Hepburn's accent sounds silly. She will go to the PBS World Garden with Audrey Hepburn and have an annoying accent as she walks through the English garden with the nobles or waxes about 'My favorite thing is when the flowers return to nature! 'But in the movie, the real character, she sounds ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The idea of' Breakfast at Tiffany's' is a deep light poem with Audrey Hepburn, one of the most beautiful things. Women in the world. Of course, she is one of the most beautiful screen actors in 'My Fair Lady', which is paired with Garbo in many stories and Delphine Seyrig in 'Last Year at Marienbad'. And her final conclusion as an angel 'Hap' in the Spielberg movie 'Always' is just a story of a woman - trite, witty and unbearable. <br /> <br /> I go to serve the memorial Her fifth episode, Avenue Presbyterian Church, a beautiful service that includes a boy choir singing 'Shaker's Simple Gifts'. The only thing that isn't on the list is the sudden play of Hepburn's 'Moon River' singing. When Remove the fire in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' and this is what causes the emotions and tears flowed /> <br /> ladies in the congregation, the Great <br was once a great actress. (As in 'The Nun's Story') and one of the greatest and most beautiful movie stars in many films in the 50's and 60's that became truly bad people - that's not all. Commonly found And maybe it is just a great human being that makes things such as movie performances a little But there is a great idea that there is a merciless point that is mercilessly pointed out that all of her late films Most words about Hepburn's mockery are about 'My Fair Lady', but what should be the traditional female actors in it is 'Wait until dark', which was performed by Lee Remick in the Broadway drama Not as famous as Hepburn. She is a better performer in many ways (Hepburn can't play anything completely vile), although Hepburn is enough in that part. After that, all of her performances were down.
