It's really terrible. In a short TV series "Dirty Dozen" starring Ben Murphy and created at the same time (Just like cheap in Yugoslavia) <br /> <br /> I feel shy. For the cast members of this film - and for Telly Savalas, especially he is old and too fat for this chapter (pushed 70 when he made this garbage) and the examiner who painted similarities with Telly the Greek in this regard Wayne in "The Green Berets" concluded well> <br /> Other examiners pointed out that many people who laughed at this crime against celluloid had so I wouldn't say it again. But I would add that I was surprised that no one was talking about a ridiculously small helmet that Savalas wore on his bulky head. <br /> <br /> I was amazed at this movie. There is a rating of 4.7 at IMDb. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, it's "1" is correct across the board. If you want a good example of why flying a franchise really is a bad idea (Especially 20 years plus after the original) - Look no further than "The Dirty Dozen - The Fatal Mission" <br /> <br /> Mighty - Avoid !!!!
