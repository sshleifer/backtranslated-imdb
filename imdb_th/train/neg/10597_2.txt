This movie is extremely scary. I can't think of a good thing about it. The hole plot is very large. You can drive the Hummer through them. The performance was so bad that even Jean Claude had to be ashamed and that was so much to say !!! And what conversation is the conversation that I think I am the first fan (I use that comment loosely. This movie has Goldberg in there because crying out loud !!!! There is nothing good that will happen in this movie. What makes this movie worse is that it's so bad that you can't even watch with friends. Have fun !!! This must be my worst movie, the top five, forever, 2/10 because it's hard for me to give 1
