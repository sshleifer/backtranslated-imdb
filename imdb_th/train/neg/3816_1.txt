It shows very badly. The story is not good. The character is not good. You shouldn't see this item if you see it. Turn it off. Or you're crashing in 30 minutes ahead. Please do not turn to THE CW for Smallville. Or Disney Channel for Hannah Montana, Wizards Of Waverly Place or Nick for Drake & Josh. These are much better family programs. So believe me on this issue, I have watched it before. And it was straightforward, and I said honestly that this was the worst program I have ever seen and I had watched many TV programs So I like and never watch this program.
