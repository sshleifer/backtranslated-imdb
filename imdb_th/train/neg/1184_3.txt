This movie has a good sound plot. But putting very slowly ... very slowly indeed Although some people think that this is a classic cult, I think there are many better movies from that era to watch <br /> <br /> The movie is not good. I still don't recommend this to anyone other than film students. <br /> <br /> This film doesn't have music. Do not make good either And the woman was meditating on the edge of the bed that was a fool. <br /> <br /> No win here. I've seen worse. Believe me. But this is just a waste of time and I don't get good reviews here. Especially high ranking ...
