I made a big mistake in watching this movie a few nights ago. God, I'm still trying to recover. This movie doesn't deserve an average of 1.4. IMDb needs to have 0 vote for the movie that deserves this. 1.4 is too high. <br /> <br /> I've heard that this movie is scary. But I don't think this movie is really bad, especially in this era and era. I think horror movies about all gods are from the 1950s and 1960s. My God, I'm wrong. Trust me, this movie is really great. It was terrible. It's beyond the pitifulness It is more than any words I can think of. BATTLEFIELD EARTH looks like the best picture of the year compared to this movie. SNAKE ISLAND (which until now is the worst movie I've ever seen) seems like it should be. Oscar, compared to a pathetic effort. <br /> <br /> I can't really believe that the creator of this film thinks. This is a serious attempt to legalize Hollywood movies. This is not a business that is called a movie in the first 25 seconds of this movie. I seriously thought that I was watching a high school class trying to make a short film. Or better, I think it's Saturday night ago I mean, it looks like that. The performance was terrible. The whole movie seems to have been taken with a 20-year-old VHS video camera. Special effects ....... The great lord who was bewitched from the day before had a special effect that was better than this movie. The scene in which he was shot in the door was too laughing and beyond magic. I mean seriously. My intro to acting class, 4 years ago in college, all of us should be able to make a better movie. And the worst part of this movie is Arthur naked in the bathroom Oh my God, I'm almost there. I have a strong stomach. But wow, it's scary Some people should not be naked and he is one of them. The story of this movie doesn't seem to go anywhere. They talk about legal issues that we have never heard of. Ben talks about listening to music that we have never heard of. Arthur said he was looking for work and money for college and the next thing we saw was that he was opening a porn shop. Everything about this movie is scary. <br /> <br /> This thing doesn't matter much to my criticism. But to let everyone know that I'm not gay However, I support gay rights and believe that all of us should be treated equally. And I will support gay people in my church, which is different from the cruel clergyman in this movie that seems to swear by other words (F * (Where is the # * ing gone?) Hahaha, but I don't want anyone to think that I hate this movie because it's about two gay men. There's nothing to do with this. Scary like a movie, if it was Ben & Jill instead of Ben & Arthur. <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie to see if it's as bad as they say or not, and yes, it's even worse. I've read, let this be a warning for everyone: watch this movie only when you want to sit and watch and laugh that some pathetic movies in the 21st century are still if you watch this movie. Or some entertainment, I don't have sympathy for you. <br /> <br /> From the last thought: In this world, there are 7 movies in the list below. In IMDb there is no way to have 7 movies there. Worse than this!
