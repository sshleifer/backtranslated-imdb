What happened? 'Doubt' has a lot of potential to be a great movie - but it turns out that it's a simple plot line that makes me want to stop watching. The only thing that the movie presented was the greatness of Meryl Streep, who had not been nominated for an Academy Award. Although it is not one of her best performances But she still has a strong and true character with us that bloomed across the screen. <br /> <br /> However, despite the legendary ingenuity of the screen, it was unable to help the film from him. Starting boring, without power or punching - to an unbelievable end, this movie is truly frustrating - especially when it has great potential through promotion. And Trailers Clearly, the director had a problem with the simplicity of the plot and he ended up with a boring movie that dragged too long with too much talk and inadequate action. <br /> <br /> In addition, another story Oscar nominations are less than convincing, although Philip Seymour Hoffman gives good results. But it wasn't worth the Oscar (Especially when they left the show completely, like Will Smith in Seven Pounds) Amy Adams did not deserve to be nominated Watching Amy Adams is like watching a cardboard box because it's one-sided and simple. It would be more logical to nominate her to Razzie because I am confident that she will win. But the length of her performance prompted me to ask if the institution should really be nominated. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it is one of the most disappointing movies. In 2008, it was a mess of many potential movies and I didn't recommend it. The only bright light in this film is Meryl Streep, which gives an amazing and strong performance - although not enough to help this movie *** / 10
