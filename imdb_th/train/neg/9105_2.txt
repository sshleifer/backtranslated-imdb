What can I say about cruel intentions? 2 I can honestly say that I will watch this movie again if I hold the chair and open my eyes in the orange-orange courtyard. <br /> < br /> Movie Robin Dunn (star) No, I have never heard him.) Ryan Phillipe's impressive impression makes me feel pain all over. In the case of horrifying casting, Dunne tried (and failed) to play a charming and attractive drama. Because the actors are not handsome or charming or charming, the characters are so unbelievable. Amy Adams (She was in the Buffy scene once) tried to choose Sarah Michelle Gaillard. Traveled and made Catherine's plans alive ... However, Adams was not very good. Lack of true emotion, often she looks like she is reading a cue card, just turn off the camera. There are two great actors in the movie. However, Barry Flatman (Saw 2 & Saw 3) and Mimi Rogers (Mrs Kensington in Austion Powers) have performed well and have fun as parents of Sebastian and Katherine and are the only reason for me. Rate this movie as # 2. No. 1. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is a bad version of the original, with conversations and low-carbon replicas that do not have the beginning of the previous movie. br /> <br /> I think as a TV program it may work. But if it is recycled with someone who can show in the main section
