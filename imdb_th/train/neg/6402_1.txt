When I watched this movie about 1979, it became the first movie I walked from in the middle. There is nothing worse than comedy that just thinks of humor and this is missed every time. (Although I can't speak for the last 25 minutes of the movie) There is nothing original about any games while I enjoy the sense of humor as appropriate. These games are unnecessarily rude. The more annoying thing is that this movie was advertised as "Robin Williams' first film, taking advantage of the reputation he discovered in the television series" Mork and Mindy ", but his role turned out to be so little that you couldn't notice him on the screen.
