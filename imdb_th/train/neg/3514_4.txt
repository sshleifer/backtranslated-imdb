Philip Keane Films And it's a good thing for that, better than Paycheck (Woo) and the nasty thing called Minority Report (Spielberg), but to face it, twisting and ending with that prayer is too much for me. Halfway through the movie, I started to fear that I would end this way and I felt sorry. But that does not mean that this movie is not worth the time. No. The first half (very much there are comments) is scary. There are parts that you start to wonder if the director intended to convey the message that acting is something. Very important in the future (We will do this with repetitive things because we can) or as a combination. But the paranoia is there and the feeling "Out of the joints" is also good.
