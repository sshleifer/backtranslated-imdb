I understand the jokes quite well. They just aren't good. Scary acting I understand and that is another scary matter. The only cool character that has ever been in the show is one. But I saw another episode, including that, and the performance was terrible. It's not funny, not funny! I don't want people to say "Only those who are wise are given" because if they are very smart, why do they judge the people they don't know and say they are not wise or wise enough to understand? It's like saying "The sky is red" but never looked outside But anyway, this is the worst show I have ever seen in my life. The story is terrible. I mean, you can understand them. The liquid is really dumb and often consists of really bad performances. I'm not sure what these "smart" people see in this show. But judging others when they don't know anything about any of us
