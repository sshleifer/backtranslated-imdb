Disappointing movie The performance of the actor is weak. The scene is going to be better. The story is also weak. The fight sequence is terrible. The sound and quality of the movie is worthless. The history of the Kazakh people is said to be terrible. This film should have a lot of Kazakh actors in the leading role. And should be in Kazakh language too Kunno Becker and J. Hernandez are the birthplace of Spain. I do not understand since when the Spaniards played Turkic-Mongolian, this movie is a shame for Kazakhstan's Rustam Ibragimbekov cinema. He is one of the best filmmakers in the world. The director Cecse was asked because he was not a nomad. He could not know the true spirit.
