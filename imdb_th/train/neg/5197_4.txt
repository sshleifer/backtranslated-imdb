A weak list in the Bulldogs series. Press Rummond and John Howard in the role. Prank wheel and regular comedy But not much. The plot Barrymore made something as an exchange inspector disguised to track the Drummond, Algy and Tenny in the wild goose chase. Want to lure Drummond to his doom For keeping this score, Drummond is planning to ask Phyllis to marry him and Alkek is concerned about the disappearance of baby names. It's fun to see Algy and Tenny dress up as a fisherman to blend in the rest of The Angler. But it's a little more stupid.
