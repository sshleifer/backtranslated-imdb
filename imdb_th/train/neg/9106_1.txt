From the opening scene you will notice that they are trying to imitate 'Cruel Intentions', how intelligent and powerful and how flat it is. In addition, you'll notice that they have a great selection of options by selecting Robin Dunn as a Valmont ... Then, in the second scene, you find two of the best things in the movie. This story is Amy. That is, if you can pass the fact that Kathryn is not a blonde in the first movie ... then the next movie, you will see a cheap romantic story many miles ago and you observe See that Sebastian The past here is called Daniel and Cecil. Here is called Cherye ... traditional for prequel. From then on, it became a 'Wild Things' with a low budget, with a lot of twists and twists. As I mentioned, Robin Dunne is a terrible choice. Not that he's a bad actor. He's a good person .. He doesn't have Ryan's charm at all. Amy Adams, in my opinion, is one of the most talented actresses of our generation. But with all the abilities in this world, there is no way to help this trash. Overview "This movie" feels like 'Beverly Hills, 90210'. The score was stolen from 'Cruel Intentions' and 'Jawbreaker' ... Yes, they use points from JAWBREAKER ... at least they can't leave it alone! You have to go through this. If you want more brutal intentions, see the dangerous coordination of Stephen Frears.
