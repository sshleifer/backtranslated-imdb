This is the worst performance I have ever seen. I like Almereyda's Nadja, but this is just the exact wreck. In addition to the short period of interesting movies and music, this movie is just a bad performance. Jared Harris is especially bad. But no one is good at this from a distance The story is funny. But not like haha I don't even know if you can forgive bad movies. Please delete the last hour and half my life. How did this director make Nadja and Another Girl Another Planet?
