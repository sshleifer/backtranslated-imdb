Director Spike Lee is famous for making movies that point to racism. In many movies such as "The right thing" Most white people are cruel racists. In this film, the marriage of the lineage is a racist issue all over again. <br /> <br /> What Lee does, but shows the stubbornness of Christianity. It's amazing with the double standards that exist in the film world. If Lee or anyone who has had this kind of prejudice against other groups, he will be slandered. But Christians? Hey, it's the "open season" for them. <br /> <br /> The famous Ossie Davis in this film shoots his son and puts a gun on his Bible. They zoom in closer, in case you miss it. Hey, this person is another scripture reader and see how he is! Lee did this in every movie he made. <br /> <br /> He expressed the same hatred when dealing with racial relationships. Who will argue with racism as evil? However, Lee is still in this movie as he has in his other films. His obvious bitterness towards white people did not help the situation. It only adds fuel to the fire. <br /> <br /> Hey, needle: Start "Do the right thing" and leave the prejudice in the closet. Better "Get it." <br /> <br /> This thing is too bad because the content can be created as a movie, provoking thought if done with integrity and intelligence.
