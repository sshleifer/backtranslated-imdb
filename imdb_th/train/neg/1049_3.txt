This film gives the feeling of a broad Broadway-backdrop, acting, 'noise' - and that's all with the 'feeling' of Broadway without a bang. <br /> <br / > The movie slowly directs the singing of 'pop-up' with you so that you will be warned as a musical. <br /> <br /> Disappointing: Sinatra <br /> <br /> Too much: Sinatra's fianc√©e - of course, the highs and accents of her voice are not necessary. <br /> <br /> : Mr "I remember the numbers on my dice." <br /> <br /> Delight: Brando's singing (very biased!) <br /> Surprised: How much does Jean Simmons look like Vivien Leigh in Her havana scene It's a bone structure! How can I kill when I see Miss Leigh in the role of Brando again?
