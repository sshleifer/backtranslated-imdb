DEATHSTALKER is suitable for B-fantasy movie fans; Imitating the creation of a movie that takes 80 minutes, almost everything that an advertiser can request - a plot that does not exist. A horrible performance. (Save at least the old woman with a stubborn temperament), a laughing script and editing settings without interesting or interesting characters. (Especially the actors brought nothing to attract him) and the actors gathered together to do everything to get higher from grade F material. If that wasn't enough, then the lack of interesting plot stories (This movie has nothing to do) in order for Death Star to qualify as a big turkey. I also felt indignant that women in this movie barely responded to any purpose other than 1) not wearing clothes and / or covering impolite bodies 2) being raped; 3) having sex with the hero; 4) All right.

Strange electronic noise, explosions, choirs, choirs and hymns of the orchestra The ears dazed and the eyes stunned in one, packed with things that made people interested. Death Stalka would be best suited for people who are looking for something to laugh at. (And believe me Otherwise, I do not recommend CONAN this 100th grade that wants everyone.
