Irene Dunne ended her famous career with this so-so movie. She should go out with Pang, a top-class actress. She's not in a movie that nobody knows and almost doesn't know about it. <br /> <br /> This lightly funny movie is ok but nothing special. The first half is better because it's rather stupid in the second half. Perhaps Irene may see the handwriting on the wall and go out. Even her high pitched voice was a little annoying here. There are rumors that she is not happy with this movie. Who knows why <br /> <br /> The story reminds me of the sitcom on television in 1950. When talking about this, I think David Nelson from Ozzie & Harriet is in this movie. But it turned out that Richard Crenna was very young. He looks and listens like Nelson. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's the best and the conclusion of the best actress.
