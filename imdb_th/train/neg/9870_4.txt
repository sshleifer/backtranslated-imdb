I have many problems with movies: <br /> <br /> (1) Screenplay - especially Kim Bazinger's voice: The movie is not a book; They should show more actions than to say, tell us what happened. Sometimes I find movies that have sound that can be used. But here seems to be a more lazy script. In fact, it sounds as though she was reading an excerpt from her novel in her voice. <br /> <br /> (2) I feel no sense in the relationship between Jessie and my brother. Tomas Carter's performance is terrible. That was a major failure for me to determine the character of Jesse and Thomas - without the connection between them. I felt as if she just needed a stud and for him it was a matter of being right. Sexism If done correctly, the relationship between them will give more context to the story. <br /> <br /> (3) With this book, I understand Jesse's life crisis. In the movie, it seems like boredom. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, I don't think this movie is so bad that I have to turn off the TV...
