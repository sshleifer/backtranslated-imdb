I began to believe that Seagal was on a mission to see that his movie became a crappy movie. This movie was a complete and very time consuming thing to see. My first complaint was the DVD cover they had made. his And making him look thinner and younger when in this movie, he looks like shit. He has a big belly and a double chin for him and the most miserable and boring face. <br /> <br /> Plot It's all ridiculous to start and pull out for too long. The whole film leads to the final episode that Seagal and his team have to fight with a lot of people under the influence of military chemical additive excitement. The top secret The conversation is very useless and doesn't have to talk about the nonsense and constant voice of the Seagals. Even in the middle of the voice-acting press, it sounds like a person with a frog in his throat and is quite funny. > <br /> Scary movie scenes during Seagal foug ht. You can't see what happens. His image is tight, fluttering his arms on the camera, and people fly through the wall or what it reminds. The Remember the old kung fu sets on television. The slow-motion image is too slow for the fight scene. <br /> <br /> I believe this is the worst movie of the Seagals and I'm glad I didn't buy this movie or I'm very angry because I am. The big fan of the action actor Seagal the Aikidoist disappeared quickly and seemed to get worse in every performance.
