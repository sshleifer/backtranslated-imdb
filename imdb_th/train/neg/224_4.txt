The worst thing about Crush is not a bad action or the plot does not exist, and it's not bad that camerawork would be better. <br /> <br /> Not the worst part. Of this movie is that it has a few wonderful moments that make you hope to have more. <br /> <br /> But in the end it is too little too late. If you are a fan of violin and cheap tear scenes for women over the age of 40 who cry and hug and talk about babies and marriages - all in all, don't miss it. No Very excited to see the things listed above in the movie and for this reason I had a terrible time. Some great jokes cannot be compensated for the rest. <br /> <br /> Verdict: 4/10 Wrong to waste my time. <br /> <br />
