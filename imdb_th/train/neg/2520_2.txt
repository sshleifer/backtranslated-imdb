There is no reason to give credit to this movie just because the director may sometimes fall asleep? I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because it was wonderful and ridiculous. I had to laugh. Actually, I had a good time watching it, except for a cowboy consultant who became a killer. (Believe me, no one will see this man as a killer, so it's a wild surprise. I'm sorry to see Mst3k not doing this. I rate two stars. But since nothing is worse than "manos the hands of fate" <br /> <br /> Budget doesn't matter either.
