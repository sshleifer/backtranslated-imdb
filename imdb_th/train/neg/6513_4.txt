I want to have 20 canals more than to read this movie again. Prince of Annoying, Myles Berkowitz has lost my life for almost two hours with cool artificial parts. The only amusing thing in this mess is the disgusting story of Samaha, who talks about nipples and asses. Berkowitz brings a great idea to grind it into dust. In order to look frustrated or funny, it's not. I don't really feel that this movie is a waste (or tape), but this movie is suitable for differences. That If the recommended date to watch this movie, run
