There was a lot of love that was put into West Anderson's "Fantastic Mr Fox". Unfortunately, all love is for yourself. Received a lot of time and effort to make this a quirky, self-conscious universe But if at the time and the same effort was put into the script to try to make it funny The worrisome thing is that I think it is and this is the best thing that Wes Anderson can think of. <br /> <br /> The animation is good for shooting animals at close range. Far away, everything became fierce in the eyes and to be perfectly honest, it seemed a mess. There is nothing special about the show as Wes chose to choose his friend and big name more than a talented actor who might make this film better. I'm quite sure that the voice of George Clooney's performance consists of two styles of pendants in South Park, one of which he plays the dog. <br /> <br /> The film is too tight and tries. Too difficult to be wise and Is different and in general, although this film is located in England But every good animal is an American who plays baseball while the villain is a traditional Englishman with the most insulting English accent. I can't stress how much time is wasted on this movie. I didn't laugh once.
