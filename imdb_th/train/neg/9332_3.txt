It's not a really bad movie, and Glenn and Katel are top performers. In addition, they work acceptable with very weak scripts. The scenery is lush and the area is interesting. In addition, I understand why these actors and filmmakers are professional and they get money for it. But I wonder why the studio takes time and money to create a movie and don't let the theater audience? Although the movie is a box office movie, of course it generates revenue. If you are a fan of Keitel or Glenn, renting a video or catching it on TV, just as I received this movie will not help solve the immigration problem with Mexico But the experience is better than the standard 90% of today's TV bills
