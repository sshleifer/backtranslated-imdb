This film is not good from the start. The only purpose of this film is Angela, wanting the body to have a high proportion. The performance was terrible. The killing was very bad. For example, when the partner is stuffed into the bathroom, I think it's in an abandoned cottage. But when the movie ends, Molly and the others are in the cabin that you see Ally, so Angela has to go to find her. The part I actually received was when the black girl and Angela were in the hut and Angela took the guitar and supported her. One, it's a terrible show, and second, why don't you turn back and punch the puppy?!?!? If so, when Molly was chased by Angela, if you have someone nearby, why not turn and stab her ??? Very stupid. This movie sucks ...
