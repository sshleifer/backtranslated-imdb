"Wrinkle in Time" series is my favorite series from childhood. I read and read again more than I could count in the last 35 years. The characters with good qualities and various flaws are close to my dear. This adaptation has a spiritual story that is a wonderful miracle that I love so much. If I say I'm disappointed with this movie, it would be an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> If you have never read a book, I think you will enjoy the movie. That performance has been through special effects, well done for movies, television and the story is interesting. However, if you love books, avoid this film free of charge. <br /> <br /> I found this message on the Wikipedia page of this novel: "In an interview with Newsweek, L'Engle mentioned the movie. 'I expect it to be bad, and it is'' <br /> <br /> I like other critics here, feeling that I need to read the book again to dispel this film from my thoughts.
