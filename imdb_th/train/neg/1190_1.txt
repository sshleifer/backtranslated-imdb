Weak Bobby "Pineapple Salsa" Flay and Mario Batali make this thing worse. <br /> <br /> The weakness is the worst. Of course, as a trick of a horse, I think they might have other American chefs come to this table as an iron chef. This kind of food really happened ... Don't reflect the creativity of the original Iron Chef Series. I don't think Batali will go to the real chef school. There are many excellent chefs in America. Not appearing in the Food Network. <br /> <br /> It will help to have more ingredients in the region and maybe a co-host who can handle the pressure. I like Alton Brown. But he is quite funny / too funny for this chapter
