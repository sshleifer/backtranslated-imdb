To Die For (1989) is just another dtv feature that appeared on the nasuem cable ad in the early nineties. The only notable thing about this feature is the latest film that Duane Jones appeared. In addition, there is no reason to watch the vampire flick This, unless you like a tricky chick, is a horror movie. A weary vampire needs love and searches for the streets behind the L's that are looking for it. Will he succeed, or will he come out again like in the last century? <br /> <br /> This movie must grow because of a few sequels. They are terrible to make this look classic. I know this is a movie about vampires. But the filmmakers may be accustomed to the light. <br /> <br /> Not recommended by me because I don't like <br /> <br /> 'Did Nuff talk?
