The plot of 'Edison' is good, but an actor, especially destroying the entire movie Justin Timberlake destroys all the movies he speaks during the movie. He is one of the worst actors I have ever seen and should face the same fate with the FRAT team. <br /> <br /> Whether it's an emotional scene, an action scene or a silent scene, Justin Tim Berkeley tried to destroy it. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time watching this movie. Don't even download it hard. The dwarf should be a better choice. <br /> <br /> And Justin if you read this. Even if you are not good But you can do a great job, tricking others into thinking that you can actually sing
