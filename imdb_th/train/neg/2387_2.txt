I can't believe that this is a weak and pointless thing. In general, there is nothing to laugh in almost every movie for you to be interested in the rest of the movie. This movie draws some big celebrities. But they all lost my mind. I think Keanu Reeves had to spend a few years studying acting after this film before he stared at The Matrix. Fortunately, I received this film at a very low price because it was not a movie to remember for good reason. I will not write anything about the movie story. But as you should know, she means being the most famous hitchhiker in America because of the big thumb. I will give this movie 2/10 before I watch this movie. I wonder why this movie is only 4.0 / 10 and now I know why. Very disappointing movie Don't buy even if you see the price below $ 5.
