Although people who have watched this movie are 99,99% Brazilian, I will follow English because it is the language of this website. <br /> <br /> This movie is part of cr * p. The most I've ever seen for a long time. Children are scary. The boys are special. This is the first time I see someone who expresses facial expressions less than Arnold Schwarzenegger and the same tone as a 5 year old boy who is reading in front of the class. How might the worst person be the main actor of the movie? The story is shallow. My daughter should do better (she is 3 years old). It's easy to write with a napkin and tell in 3 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are only three possibilities. Only that people will enjoy this movie: 1) You are a teenager before. 2) You are brainwashed with Globo's stupidity, which you think is anything that has the seal of Globo. Excellent. Serious damage <br /> <br /> avoid All costs! Shame to the Brazilian movie scene
