My main opinion on this film is how Zwick can make a reliable actor to work in this movie. Impressive actors ?? Even the supporting characters have nothing to really help this movie. I must admit that Tom Hank's pendant is almost worth it, right? And Tom, do you lose the bet? The best thing of the movie is Joe Isuzu - by classic! The evidence is good. Basinger's character struggling with his existence as Lady Pink is heading to a motel in Vegas, where the hotel is located in the midst of the glorious pyramid sales of cosmetics sales. This happened when the character of Corbett was traveling to Vegas to deliver the Elvis suit to his ex-wife who was inspired by other things as they both The couple went ahead. They had a lot of impersonation with Elvis's disguise, who was traveling to Elvis's identity conference in Vegas. Soon, the FBI took part and began tracking what they He thinks that Unfortunately, the evidence does not mean that this movie is good. <br /> <br /> When watching this movie When the story and continuity are not important It's more fun than watching Basinger look beautiful in her Pink Lady dress, rather than wondering why the things she does not really make sense. Movie trying hard But eventually will be shorter In the end, it was filled with ideas that could be funny in theory. But in practice, it's not funny. <br /> <br /> It's not the worst. But you may find yourself feeling like you want to leave the building when watching this one ???? Don't say I didn't warn you!
