The average audience looking for the feeling that there is an internal connection in this movie should allow this to pass. It creates the same feeling as staring at an array of individual images that seem to have a one-to-one relationship. But not combined as a whole. <br /> <br /> While this separate method to create a movie-style photo montage May attract a small number of students or critics in the language of contemporary film making. It is annoying and influential to ordinary people who have just fallen out of desolation. Open access avoidance may be the mark of the respondents' intentions, such as Kar-wai Wong and Tarantino. But for me, it was met when Andy Warhol warmed up. The only rewarding feature I found was production and them. <br /> <br /> This is one of the productions that you watch and listen and wait anxiously. And useless for the development of ideas or clever ideas to preserve the scene, each scene is breathtaking and beautiful, apologizing for the calligraphy calligraphy begins unexpectedly, just as your attention begins to stir. I have read and yawned and read what I thought had thorough knowledge and opinions about this movie that never led to truly understandable things. Ideas and pictures without external context are not my thoughts that are fun. <br /> <br /> Call me on the road in Hong Kong to look for a bowl of chopped suey. <br /> <br />
