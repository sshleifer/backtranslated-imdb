Usually I know that after the first minute of the movie, if I hate or love it ... but now I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> The beginning is great. "This depends on the true story" and what blah blah blah is a joke. After that, the cartoons and explanations about the life of men with pictures made me think that I had chosen the right one. <br /> <br /> Then when I saw the fake image of Toronto, it looks cool. The situation and appearance of the house seem to confirm my first thoughts. <br /> <br /> That may be the first 10 minutes of the movie ... which later seems eternal. <br /> <br / > Maybe because I don't understand Canadian humor (It may be possible, British Canadians do not always understand Quebec's humor.) But wait ... there's nothing enough for short films. May be meaningful for the title? However, almost everything is filled and some things are close to the jokes in my mind. <br /> <br /> In truth, "creating" is better than movies. At least you understand the motives behind things that make everything worse. The potential of the idea is great. That's why I rent this film with interest in things. "Annoying people disappear." Yet, I don't know that the entire universe will disappear and even be a key point in the movie. Local by considering the surprising number From the people who gave this movie 8, otherwise think again before wasting your precious time ...
