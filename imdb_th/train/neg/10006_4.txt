I don't know who to blame, shy writer or innocent director. It seems to be one of the movies that they paid for many stars (Angie, Charlie, Denise, Rosanna and Jon) that were not enough to make a movie. This can be a very fun story. But there was a cowardice, even the cowardice hanging over each scene Because of the R score, why is the bubble bath scene prevalent with 70-year-old women, not Angie Harmon? Why Sheen reached sleepwalking through a relationship that might be hot with two of the world's most beautiful and sexy priests? If they are looking for a laugh, why not choose Whoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenuta instead? This is a predictable thing. I was surprised to find that the director was less than five years old. What is lost is not just for the audience. But for actors as well
