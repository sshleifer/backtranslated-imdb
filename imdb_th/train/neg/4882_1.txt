There are bad movies out there. Most of them are quite fun. "Criminally Insane 1" is one of those movies. Terrible that it's fun and worth watching again. "Criminally Insane 2" Must be one of the worst movies ever created and came from me. That said, because I am not the type of person to say the worst But believe me, this is so terrible and it only takes 1 hour too long. 1 hour. <br /> <br /> The film has a story that is quite inconsistent. But who is interested in this Fat women run to kill people because she doesn't get food. You don't see that in this movie, except for all the sequences from the first scene. The new story may be very funny, with Ethel being sent to the halfway house and killing everyone in it. But nothing happened until the last 20 minutes of the movie and at that point you were sleeping. <br /> <br /> The camera's performance in this movie was so bad. This thing reminds me of something that I took with my friends when I was 15 years old. The sound quality is something else because you can't understand the words that most characters can say. To be an example of badness, go to the New York subway station and try to understand what was spoken from the loud speaker. That's the nature of this movie. It's not that it's important that they're already talking about because the actors are dry like dead wood chips. <br /> <br /> Now I know that saying this is the worst movie. Came out quite strongly Did not explain how bad this movie was If you don't believe me, see for yourself. 1/10
