Just awesome! My old roommate used to watch this garbage and it made me crazy. This book is one of my favorites and is a shame that some people never know what it is because their first impression came from raising children like this They changed so much that it was almost unknown. Which baffled me since the book was read like the next TV drama, providing enough animal food for entertainment on a modern day It's like one of the lifelong movies that says "Based on real stories" but is completely fictional. There is no emotion or depth of this book at all. If you are a high school student looking for a way to read a book, I suggest you try another version.
