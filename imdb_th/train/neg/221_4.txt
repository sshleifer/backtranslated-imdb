I have talent in this movie because of the wonderful location, the friendship of three women who fell in love with a young man. <br /> <br /> Dear <br /> <br /> Can't! I quickly added these women. But drawing mockery, not supporting each other and conspiring and planning to make each other <br /> <br /> Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton couldn't do anything wrong in my book. But here they were dismayed and instructed to adjust the actions between slapstick and hangover, which were not very effective when all women were well known in small towns. <br /> <br /> And for wise women, they spend all time groaning with the lack of men / sex / sexual desire in life I felt that I could do more because of the better and more tense scripts. The lesser lesbians were nowhere and women who smoke / drink (all three of their forties ???) were very unrealistic even in Baby Scene - Baby Screws Take Cigarettes! Yes <br /> <br /> like I said 4 out of 10
