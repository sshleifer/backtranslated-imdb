After reading a very good review of this movie, I thought I would give it a look and after much disappointment with this movie, I thought I would give my own review. This is the first time that I am naked with me. <br /> <br /> First of all, I will scratch the horror from the genre that there is no way that it is scary or scary Make you jump, unfortunately, one that works for me) I would say that calling this movie the thriller is pushing it because I'm not particularly excited! This film is about a mischievous mischievous young woman who fainted a few times. During these times, she visited a house where she had painted pictures. After each visit, she decided to add another thing to the house to make it more lively. One of the qualities of a boy. A little sad in reality She realizes that the world of her imagination that she created was better than the real world that she lived until she added her father who was away all the time in the house because her father turned her into an evil person. And the boy must escape from his clutches. <br /> <br /> Think of this as an attempt to become a slightly more mellow version of A Nightmare On Elm Street. But like going to the beach, <br /> <br /> In summary, 3/10, my kind-hearted person, hope to stop you at least one person to watch this drab!
