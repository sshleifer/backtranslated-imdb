"Nat" (voiced by Trevor Gagnon) with a brain friend "IQ" (voiced by Philip Golden) and "Scooter" (David Gore) at Always starving is children. They want to be the first fly in space. And what motivated their dreams was the first spacecraft to land on the moon. Apollo 11 is waiting for a historic journey on a rocket launcher near the point where the three go outside. <br /> <br /> The first thing you notice is Movie animation I found it very well done. The scenery is deep while the things in the distance seem like they are really behind the scenes focus. I do not see movies in 3D because it is broadcast on HBO. However, I can see that there are no scenes that take advantage of 3D effects, except the fight between characters is near the end. I was not impressed with the character design. For me, they don't seem like anything like flies, especially in coloring. The fly is an unusual blue-gray color that makes me annoyed. <br /> <br /> The performance from the actors is not bad. But it's not as good There are times when I focus on my computer more than The writing was written for a younger audience, of course, with funny moments that would make younger children laugh. I don't see anything for adults like jokes that they will have fun in understanding the meaning. <br /> <br /> Not according to history in this movie. In fact, I think it's completely ignored because the main focus is the fly. I also hate when a well-known astronaut pops up on the screen and explains that the story about the flies in this movie is the work of novels and no flies in Apollo 11. I like that he thanked men and women who sacrificed. But their lives for space exploration. <br /> <br /> If you are an adult, this is not for you. It was not created for the whole family. This is just for kids of course. But recorded this on a rainy day
