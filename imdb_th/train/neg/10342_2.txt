Jameson Parker and Marilyn Hassett are the most unbelievable pair of screens from John Travolta and Larry Peerce's direction. Swinging uncontrollably between nonsense and Roman tragedy Of course, Robert Klein thought it was a past and his self-acting acting in a secondary role represents a lack of balance and chemistry between players in this film. Usually I don't like letting myself be energetic, but The Bell Jar is one of my favorite books of all time and watching what they do with it makes me truly crazy.
