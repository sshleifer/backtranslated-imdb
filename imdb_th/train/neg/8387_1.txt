This is the worst movie I have ever seen in a movie theater. It is just a collection of recycled materials. People who are not funny The kicker is not a joke. After the third time someone was kicked in the ball, not even the youngest member laughed anymore. It was exhausting. <br /> <br /> I went with my sister. She laughed out loud at King of the Hill, but the masterpiece of this film made her bored. I wasn't surprised. The story was quite lame. Stealing the dwarves, stealing large diamonds in the most easily stolen things in Hollywood history. Then he hid himself with a family that pretended to be a baby. I know it sounds exciting. But that's the whole story Say these two lines over and over again for 1.5 hours. You will see a lot of predictable jokes. I felt that I was torn off after seeing this. I didn't expect much and I was still disappointed. I hope Keenan will hire a good writer to write jokes and / or his next script. This is worse than White Chicks. If possible, I've seen better and cheaper high school drama. <br /> <br /> There's nothing useful about this movie. I don't like my entertainment to be dumb.
