Prom Night 2 is a horror movie, okay, but Prom night is better and this movie is about the way that Queen Mary Lou in 1957 was hit by her boyfriend and returned 30 years later to avenge the best actors in The film is Micheal Ironside and other movie stars, actors and actors such as Justin Louis (I), Wendy Lyon, Lisa Schrage and Richard Monette (I) and some good scenes, such as when Mary Lou kills A woman trying to hide in her locker by Crush the lockers together and the way in which a student is on the computer and Mary Lou invites him to death. All of this is a good / good horror movie and my score is 4 out of 10.
