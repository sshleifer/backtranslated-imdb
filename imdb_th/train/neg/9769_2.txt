I read this Thornton Wilder played last year in the eighth grade. I was also forced to sit and read this weak translation on the screen. Let me tell you that it's not a great play. It's easy to do. But the person who deserves a much better shot Actually, the view that is straightforward with God seems to be designed from cardboard by a group of three years old. As if it weren't worse With Emily Well not actually All the actors felt uncomfortable to be there. There was no music. It had black and white, which was ok. But it will bring more of its greatness In any case, I think that if you are going to make it a point to see this movie, which I didn't really recommend, don't aim your high Playing as strong as it should be.
