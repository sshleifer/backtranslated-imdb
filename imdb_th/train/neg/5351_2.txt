If you like the first two movies, I'm sorry to say that you won't like this movie. This is an unnecessary garbage and does not need to match the video. A silly but cute scientist Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) still lives with his family and he has his company, Szalinski Inc. Unfortunately, his wife wants to get rid of the statue. Very much, his brother. Then he contracted his wife and brother-in-law. Now adults have to find a way to bring their children home bigger. Repeating the other two items with just one or two new things, such as Roller coasters, toy cars, swimming, water immersion, etc. Very bad!
