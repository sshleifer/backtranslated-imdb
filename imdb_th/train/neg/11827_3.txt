Just returned from the free screening and I'm very glad that I didn't pay to watch this movie. The theater is filled with many people, both young and old. It looks like it's just kids who laugh at every joke and fart. (Great God, they love to hit these poor rats in the crotch)! This film is a child and youth who are not intelligent, understandable, predictable and mostly annoying. The characters seem to be thrown together to fill the empty space and the relationship between them all seems to be greatly forced without any charm. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this movie Common They work well to mimic the soil image from Wallace and Gromit, but other than that it is a very memorable picture. <br /> <br /> Even though I feel tired all the time But I laughed a few times Of course not failure. But I don't want to see it again. If you are a parent with children (and you don't care if your child will see cheap jokes) don't hesitate to take them to see. But everyone should not waste money
