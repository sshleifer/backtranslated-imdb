After watching KHAKEE, I felt that I could see another good movie. But sadly, this movie is a joke and tries hard to introduce Aryeman Afterall. His father, Keshu, is the producer. <br /> <br /> RKS talked about it very much. During the promotion, saying that the film has meat, which is different from the movie released at that time, I wonder what movie he talks about <br /> <br /> This movie is a typical Masala movie that is full. With humor, romance /> <br /> The ease with which children kidnap families is one of the most fun parts ever imagined. Children who were kidnapped by Dawood's family <br /> <b r /> The end is a complete confusion with sudden changes. RKS gives the weakest movie to date, except for some scenes of Bachchan. This film is boring. <br /> <br /> Boring music < br /> <br /> Amitabh tried to give his role. All he did his job well, even if not the best, even though he insulted his face too much when pulling the trigger and making it look strange while smoking a cigar. The reproduction is not correctly matched at times. <br /> <br /> Akshay is there for a moment and just repeat his actions and ham. <br /> <br /> Players who Seems to be emotionless, trying hard, but too much. Some scenes <br /> <br /> Bhumika appeared the best. <br /> <br /> The rest is ok.
