This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I expect to have a wonderful movie But at least there are cool scenes / racing. What do I get? The race scene has a very low budget. They accelerate it. It seems that the car will "run fast" in the same scene. Mercedes SLR goes from more than 200 to 0 in 4 seconds by rotating in a circle It's ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch movies about cars, see the series that is fast and intense. They may look a bit magical. But better than this movie, expect 100x better than just watching Mischief 3000, the best car movie I've ever thought of.
