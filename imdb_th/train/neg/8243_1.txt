Overall summary, d'oh;) Five girls trying to find a way back home when they stopped at the store to find a route. They crashed into a car by destroying a single fire. They fled the scene fairly. There was a problem, but suddenly they saw a fire in front of them (ooooh) <br /> <br /> Then everything was screaming, crying and violence when they tried to escape from the lost madman It went because of the fire ; Screaming and crying of the entire movie (Very annoying) This movie was shot with a cheap camera that tried to make it look "real" or "shocking". I guess it's embarrassing and Though useless If lacking anything better in comparison with "Blair Witch Style" <br /> <br /> Screaming and crying of the whole movie that is crappy is quite annoying. You will really headache :) <br /> <br /> I'm sorry but This is not a scary matter. But the annoying crap movie
