I have to watch the movie when it starts, regardless of how bad it is. This movie is painful when having to watch the "sparkling" bullet. A reporter with a "ninja" is similar to the movement. The way in which the villain shot hundreds of bullets and seems to be innocent, innocent, predictable results and performances Well, that is very scary. Like a woman who met a reporter in her friend's apartment and went from "What you are doing here (Holding a bat) "and" Hey, you're cute. You want @ @ $%! ??? "in 1.2 seconds .... very bad .... save yourself an hour and forty minutes and then play with your kids Your (or dog)!
