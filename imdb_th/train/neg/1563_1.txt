I saw this film in Sundance 2005 and was shocked by the badness of it, even though according to the catalog details, I was excited to see it, assuming the "mockumentary" of two high school students made a documentary about life in high school. It pays attention to bad performances, bad governance, lack of involvement of characters like written. I love good movies about high school and this is not one of them. The characters are one-dimensional and "cool" consciously, even if they should be expelled. You get the overall impression of a lot of people sitting around to create a movie that has a bad purpose to show your friends a mystery.
