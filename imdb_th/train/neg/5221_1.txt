Hello, I am from Denmark and one day I have an evening movie with a friend. Bring this movie to him "Russian terminator" and it is very scary. After watching less than half a minute, we decided to fast forward, just stop at the laughing "highlights" or should I say "lowlights" in the movie. Here in Denmark, my hometown ... That must be the biggest mistake this country has ever made.
