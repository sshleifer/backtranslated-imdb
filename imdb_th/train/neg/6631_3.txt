Ram Gopal Verma proved himself to be an innovative and talented director. He made a remake / reworking of the godfather and Sarkar and achieved great success. Ditto for Lolita, which he did as Nishaabd <br /> < br /> Sholay is a movie that he repeatedly said was the most inspiring for him. Unfortunately he was able to disappoint, frustrating and bored. <br /> <br /> The performance has been very good, with Amitabh Bachchan as bad as Babban. <br /> < br /> A scary and forgotten song. Mehbooba Mehbooba is a second-rate music video. <br /> <br /> The worst part is walking and forgotten conversations. <br /> <br / > Watch movies in theaters I found myself waiting for a break and then ending. Some audiences don't have to wait and be seen throughout the movie. Finally one of the worst movies made by Ram Gopal Verma
