In many movies I've seen Warren Oates, I have a clear conclusion. This is a talented person. I saw Mr. Oates for the first time in the 1960s television series Stoney Burke. After that I followed his career like Closer and felt that he was set for a great role. This happened in 1974 when Sam Peckinpah gave him the highest charge in the movie 'Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia'. Of course, claiming his greatest reputation is a role. His beauty in 'The Wild Bunch' I always thought he could bring some spells until I saw him in this failure. The film is called "Chandler", which is a tribute to the influential detective of the 50s created by Raymond Chandler. Because the conclusion says that it is about the nose and the eyes are so stiff that I am interested However, I sat patiently throughout the film and found it to be boring, uninteresting, slow, twisting and confusing. If it had a theme or plot, it must be left in the dark room behind. Overall, there are some of Hollywood's best stars, such as Alex Dreier, Mitch Ryan, Gordon Pinsent, Charles McGraw, Richard Loo and Scatman Crothers. This movie is powerful enough to reach Mach 5, but it's Dismissed on the launchpad and none at all. As a result, one of my favorite actors stuck in a poorly made vehicle that never left the floor. **
