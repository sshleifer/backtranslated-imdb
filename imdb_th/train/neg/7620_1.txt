I rented this movie because it sounds interesting. But for my horror movie, this movie is the worst movie I've ever seen! I read the comments from Gumby-8 and he must be part of an actor or team, unless Gumby-8 is a 4 year old boy or a member of the mentally debilitating cult. This matter has any potential. <br /> <br /> I don't want to believe Gumby's comments. -8 <br /> <br /> Reference: "From" Dune "which is an open animation at Was inspired to arrive at a fast pace ... movies   งนี้ทำให้ดวงตาของคุณเคลื่อนไหว /> อนิเมชั่นเป็นเพียงส่วนหนึ่งของภาพยนตร์ที่น่าสนใจและความจริงที่ว่าภาพยนตร์เรื่องนี้ทำให้ดวงตาของคุณเคลื่อนไหวนั่นเป็นเพราะคุณมองหาสิ่งที่น่าสงสัย I mean, take a break with Halloween with a budget of $ 100,000.00 and a painted mask and then become a classic cult as "unexpected replay" I think he's wrong. <br /> <br / > Other words from Gumby-8 are the only fans: "The performance is a strong aspect of this movie." <br /> <br /> With great respect from the actors, their performances are not there. What's more than Robert Napton's talent <br /> <br /> The eye-catching slogan: "Be careful. When dark and dark "/> <br /> That is because there is no darkness or darkness in this movie. <br /> <br /> MPAA rating" Rated R for violence / hurling "<br / > <br /> The only person you see Is red on the corpse that you have never seen As far as I know it may be a clump of grass. <br /> <br /> In summary, I saw the horror of the 50s, 60s and 70s. I saw what I thought was the worst and some. Very good The director of this film didn't try to do anything, sleep or get acid. In any case, I think the actor deserves the applause when trying to recover the bad direction. I will rate this movie as 0.5 for the movie 'B'.
