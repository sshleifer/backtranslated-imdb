Then, thank you very much for disrupting the lovely memories I had used for my favorite movies in the past. I was about 5 years old when the original movie came out and was one of the first movies I remember seeing. So now I am 16 years old and feeling chaos when I decided to rent this movie. So I poisoned all the memories of the original movie with an excuse to apologize for this movie. This movie brings everything that creates original love and destruction to the last detail. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Ariel and Eric celebrate the birth of their daughter, Melody, and then show them. Everyone in the ocean ... style of the pathway! After the number of music ended within a few minutes, the sea witch Morgana appeared and threatened to kill the melody if Triton did not give up Trident. So he gave up without having to fight even a little. Eric stood there, gaping, although Ariel thought of using a sword and helping Melody Morgana escape. Ariel and Eric decided that Melody should not go near the sea until Morgana was caught. <br /> <br /> Okay ... uh, nothing really happened. Eric is a fuss. He never really did anything. Ariel did something Melodies can handle various matters. In addition, the animation is a new low point of Disney. Computer graphics ending the collision with the background. The only opportunity for character development that has been wasted. Biting music <br /> <br /> Look, don't waste time. I'm pretty sure that even small children will get bored with their skulls with this because there is nothing exciting from the distance that has ever happened. They don't want to sing. If you manage to grab this copy, throw it into the ocean and hope that no one will ever find it.
