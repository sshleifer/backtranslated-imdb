Of course, this isn't really a blockbuster and doesn't target that position. "Dieter" is the first name of a very popular German musician who loves or hates his performance and that's what That this movie is related It is based on the autobiography "Dieter Bohlen" written a few years ago. But it does not mean that it is correct The movie is full of sexually abusive content. (At least for the American standard) which is amusing (not for "actors", others of course) or dumb - it depends on your humor or you are "Bohlen" - or not. Not much to criticize. When talking about me, I found that this movie is an ok movie.
