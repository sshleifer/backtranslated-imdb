Ok, I've seen many movies related to witches and mysteries. But this one is unusual. This movie started when the sorceress of this cult led by Orson Welles, who played a terrible role. (They didn't get someone to watch and act like Satanists). He wasn't in this movie at all. However, the covenant accepts new members and stabs a doll that resembles someone and makes her mistake. A woman who had a miscarriage and her husband went out to a place called Lillith on a mess and a young woman at the same time saw a picture of her sister or anyone calling her and warned her to stay away from there There or she will die Both after they settled in a strange city, found that all the inhabitants were all witches and she became a nosy person and was afraid of all her neighbors and friends. Then strange things began to happen when the young woman discovered the funeral that had occurred on the hill as soon as it disappeared. (Creepy) and saw the little boy of Orson Wells at the playgroud, which he later asked the young woman to bring him back for life. Soon the woman tried to escape from the city. But only to find himself stuck with it as a city and powerful and found himself not interested in what the spirit tried to warn her about This movie is ok. It has a suspicious moment. But it should be better than Orson in that really
