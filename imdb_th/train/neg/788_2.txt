A movie that has very little to say about this. <br /> <br /> Firstly, this movie has no pace and no drama is good. <br /> <br /> In addition to being slow. Obviously down Use the same stock images over and over again. I lost counting the number of times I saw the "at" field at night or the cracked ground. <br /> <br /> There is also a fundamental flaw in the idea that if viewers don't know about things Where they Will be arrested instead of being confused So without any signs of any problems, we find that marriage is not something that seems to be, even if it gets good results. We find that Jacob may be the worst farmer in the universe because he seems to have spent a long time on the farm and seems to buy land with all the useless space. Beth has the key to the bookstore? There are countless other questions that some questions have been resolved later in this film. In fact, too late. <br /> <br /> And on the spot of the acre. The horror movie creator knows that objects that do not have a large life are not scary, isn't it? And if they intend to be a large acre, it makes them like that. <br /> <br /> There is also a lack of horrible reasoning as Beth (the best actor on the record, followed by Jay Fusson) seems to be accused of everything under the sun just because she is in "medicine". <br /> <br /> Ten minutes full while running around the fields to look for missing children. Go (He crawled out of The window is six months old). The film is written in a scene that is badly written after a poorly written scene. The song "Horror" is fantastically plinky. Poor plonk can't add to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Often the movie. Which is not good can be fun, but not The Empty Acre, which is not good
