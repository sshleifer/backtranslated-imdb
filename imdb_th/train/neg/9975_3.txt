I remember having watched this movie many times since I was a child and had some parts of it. (Actually many things) that I don't understand I think I've seen it once as an adult and then I understand those parts. The only problem of watching it as an adult is that it's not fun for me. So what is this movie? Is it "child movie"? Not difficult. It has language and content that is not suitable for children. Is it true of what every parent feels like they are going through with their own children? Maybe, but why doesn't it focus on John Ritter's character more than junior? When the movie has a 7 year old character, it is the main character to do good with the audience. It should be a movie for both seven and under the crowd. Age does not want to watch movies about younger children all year
