Is an unusual movie. <br /> <br /> There is no allowance for "Hollywood special effects" or entertainment No background music, no special effects or improved sound. <br /> <br /> The facial expressions are often covered with thick beards and Spanish is a language that looks like a strange sound that sounds like. Whether in the midst of fighting or Talking around the fire <br /> <br /> I watched these movies (Part 1 and 2) as an educational experience, not a matter of having to go and be entertained. It is quite long and is in a dull place. <br /> <br /> But I think that without the development of the plot, I don't think it will be a very educational subject. <br /> <br / > It is difficult to Recognize any story from the movie dialogue - it's a good idea to read a little history so you can understand the context of what happened due to some reasons that the director disagrees to tell the audience that Why Che's band moves the way they do - there seems to be a group that wanders around the forest without any reason and is shot. <br /> <br /> I want to give this star more. Under This movie Anyway, make me more sympathetic and develop the depth of the character. But every character is still a stranger for me at the end. The star received is for realism and demonstrates the difficulties of guerrilla warfare.
