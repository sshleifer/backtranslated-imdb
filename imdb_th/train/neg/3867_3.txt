A familiar joke. Oh, about Paul (Jason Lee), an important person who, after the bachelor party, the night he woke up in bed with Becky. (Julia Stas) The attractive blonde girl he met last night. After lying about this story to Karen fiancee (Selma Blair), he was forced to tell a lie to cover up his traces. <br /> <br /> I'm sure most of us are Witnesses in this matter At least once before ... in movies or on TV This film is a very successful and predictable formula, with the ending that you might see one mile away. <br /> <br /> At least the actors will be interested and watching. Lee is the right leader and style is a fun person in a funny role that is different from the very serious role that she often plays. Becky is a free spirit that seems to change jobs as often as others change clothes. > <br /> But you know that this is not a good writing. At least one question has not yet been answered: For what is certainly Ray (Lochlyn Munro), Becky's former cruel boyfriend is questioned by IA. <br /> <br /> And I don't like Buck's character (David Koechner) Paul's stepfather. He is a terrifying moron. I quickly ask someone to come and punch him. <br /> <br /> Add another debit: the cartoon cameo / actor Larry Miller again playing. grouch (in this case, it is slightly wrong - body Each Christmas, was the minister at a very conservative) <br /> <br /> not good, but as usual for me, I gave it three out of ten. One actor's effort
