The idea is to have interesting things that happened in the first ten minutes for the audience to be addicted. Late shopping can avoid interest for longer. When we got to a certain point, it was a surprising thing that I still thought I had to misunderstand, but I couldn't. <br /> <br /> Sean tells the story of Osaka homeowners who Rent the same apartment with two people at the same time that work differently and don't know how they share it. His friend asked "But what about the weekend?" Sean didn't have enough explanations. Sean then tells the story of his own similar problem, which is that he is not sure that his girlfriend still lives at home while he is working at night and she works during the day so they don't. Have met This happened for three weeks. But his friend didn't ask: "Yes, but as I said earlier, on the weekend, you have to see her. It doesn't make sense. What are you doing? Sean, are you taking drugs or something?" Give generously and assume that they work seven days a week. <br /> <br /> We see Sean checking that the soap and towels are used or not. (In fact, he started taking soap too) but what about the hair conditioner and girlfriend's shampoo sanpro and moisturizer, toothpaste and toothbrush Let's go to the kitchen What is food and drink? What's missing? Is there a purchase? In the bedroom there is a shared bed made up? Is her clothes used and exchanged for cleaning? Fuller laundry basket? In the toilet seat up or down? I mean good sadness. <br /> <br /> And to cover all that Paul had to leave before, to see if his girlfriend was still at home. Why doesn't he call you? <br /> <br /> But it's worse in the last act, even if nobody tells Vincent that the rest of the group will go to him. Lenny's love and Sean's girlfriend seem to be the best friend and can still find a group. There is not even a little effort to explain these unlikely coincidences. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the dialogue is ok. But still not good enough to create weak characters or annoying stories. <Br >> <br /> I heard an actor interview and he promised that "No guns, no drugs, no straining." I think "great." But after half an hour of boredom, I yelled at the screen: "I need a gun! I want drugs! I want to fasten! "<br /> <br /> It doesn't take a lot of time to identify these problems. But on the official website, the director is proud that the movie was not edited That's all you need to know.
