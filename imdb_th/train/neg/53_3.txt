I am studying Catalan and am happy to meet Elmar. The movie with Catalan dialogue is mostly at a video store in my house. <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... not happy. Who saw it. Br /> <br /> Yeah, as other critics say, it's done well and can take beautiful pictures. Although the opening sequence of the children is surprisingly violent But with enthusiasm and credibility (Mostly that is ... Mallorwin will gather bodies to prepare for the burial at the center of the town square in a view full of 10-year-old boys of the dead?) Uh .. Slightly fine At this point, it has the feeling of a non-magic labyrinth of Pan, which was set in the Spanish Civil War. <br /> <br /> Fast forward and the three children who survived the opening event came to the age of. Francisca As a nun, working in a tuberculosis hospital and two boys, Manuel and Ramallo, both of whom are sick, I know, but he accidentally happens. <br /> <br /> The same problem as many Spanish movies. The Almodovar fans) That is one exception (Francis). The character is horrible. * Strange *. Inspiring their personalities and conversations are not intermittent. <br /> <br /> Moreover, it also has a terrible excess. Prepared for many pain and many blood The investigator called it "potboiler" quite a follow-up. If it was created 40 years ago, the poster would say: SEE FORBIDDEN LOVE !! rape!! Murder !! Tear !! Frantic !! Cruel animals !! The betrayal !! <br /> <br /> The opening sequence is not enough to make the character and relationship of the characters believe. In this work, there should be many incidents to separate the characters. It seems to be a strange and depressing thing between "Brother Sun, Sister Moon" and "Pulp Fiction". If it sounds like you see it I think I went with something that didn't make me feel like I needed a shower to wash my blood and sorrow. <br /> <br /> For Catalan, it is Mallorqui, which is different from Barcelona like fair Language, although I was surprised by the comments that said that even the Barcelonans apparently needed Catalan subtitles to understand it.
