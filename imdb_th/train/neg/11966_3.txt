Bob Clampett's 'Poory's Poor Fish' is a comical cartoon full of terrifying play and a good time or two. The time is set in Porky's Fish Shoppe. Standard black and white with one of the Merrie Melody books that were popular at that time. In general, at the beginning of the early Porky cartoons, Porky was far from the star appearing in the opening numbers of the songs that were quite exaggerated and the focus of the movie. During the rest of the time, Dao was a witty cat that saw a fish shop as an opportunity for free food. But received more than he negotiated Unfortunately, the audience received less than they negotiated. Sometimes in the series-book-to-life series, Spotlight is cast by an amazing signal that may work well as well in non-animation media. The laughter is rare, and while the cartoon is rescued by Clampett's energetic direction, there is very little to suggest 'Poory Poor Fish' rather than the early Porky cartoons.
