That song is still humming in my head. Not the greatest song, but in the 80s, this film is about the lead singer "killed" while being accused of being a murderer as he follows his girlfriend who sings a backing vocals on he The lead singer name is Billy "Ta" (Yes). After two years and his band returned to the concert, only the backing vocals were the lead singers. Billy stalks her and eventually kills all of these people and scares the girls and scares the people around her. She thinks something is wrong with her and she finally imagines things. Decided to go to the cemetery and dig his grave to see if he was still there or not. She saw that he was dead. But still saw and heard his voice At the end of the movie, we find that the reason behind all this is that Billy has a brother named John. (Right again) and John admits that he is jealous of his brother and says that he killed all the people and came back to him and placed Blaming his brother and taking his girlfriend and threatening her because she called him crazy The ending is very funny and the performance is weak and made of wood, but .... I like it anyway. I watched it for music. I hope i will have it
