Good, fun ... except the fun part. <br /> <br /> It's my second favorite, until now I still think it's worse than 'Lazarus' and 'Ghost in the Machine' /> <br /> Start well The teaser has done incredibly well and still has emotions. It's a great animal lover that I am. It's fun to see many beautiful animals right now. <br /> <br /> But then there are all bad things. There are a few reasons so that those animals were kidnapped by aliens and being moistened? Whaaa ??? The conversation was terrible. There are about one or two lines that can be calculated. <br /> <br /> And the worst, having all the animals that die is not satisfactory for me in the end ... What is the point? They all died a lot. We didn't learn anything. We were not entertained and I couldn't even find Sophia's death. Sad ... Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> * The shameful stars because of the 2nd season did very well
