I was amazed that this film was rated very high, even though I went with a general grade 71, a c- or d, so maybe it's okay. But this movie is just a general thriller, except slow and unrealistic. Not that the general thriller is true. But seems to be trying But the rap woman did not charge because she didn't want to be examined in court, even though she was wearing a man who Breaking her arm, breaking the shit out of her and raping her for life But also protect the lawyer that she has feelings and his family not only But the random person she doesn't know has a similar problem with the movie, which should be cheap if there is some morality to remove from the movie. But a few moral questions, such as whether it was correct to try to kill / beat Kady before he did something wrong Presenting little things since Kady ended up being just a berserker in revenge to make sure the lawyer had a reason to protect his family since waiting for Cady to rape his daughter. Add my life to stupid movies, so please don't see it. At the very least, your life will not be at my waist and so 2 1/2 hours or more. That means something.
