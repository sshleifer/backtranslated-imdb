Deathstalker directed by John Watson and actor Rick Hill, who is the body builder and is famous for it if I understand correctly? The following plot, when Deathstalker (Hill) tries to take something back from the evil demon and he must travel to the lair of the Lord. He met many dwarves and monsters during his travels, and that setting was close to Tolkien and of course Conan the Barbarian. This is the great success of Conan and although this is a very stupid movie But there are many advantages to throwing garbage and suggesting fans to trash and tolerate junk movies. <br /> <br /> Merit in this movie The two scenes are almost atmospheric and fascinating, but what Deathstalker focuses on is the nude woman and the big muscle of Hill. Usually the female is a victim that is not very stupid and too stupid, so this is a movie with a lot of men and may not make many women popular! The fight scenes are nothing special and boring, and the monsters don't have anything special. And other aspects of the movie are also skilled and do not work well But what do you expect from this low budget effort? This thing is trying to be as big as Conan. But failed miserably As I said, this can make the turkey theater fans. But no one else This is a terrible category. It's wonderful. <br /> <br /> Deathstalker isn't as close as it should be, and in the turkey movie, I would like to thank this turkey for almost the same! If a bad movie is your cup of tea, try doing this and have fun. But if you don't understand "Happy movies that are not happy" to stay away, and if someone is unable to get a lot of nakedness, stay away as well. There are more nudity here than violence, and because of these scenes, the movie has a rated R. Otherwise this may be the safety film of the PG family that is safe. <br /> <br /> 4/10
