Ah, boring, acting and pilots that were knocked together in the 70s to make t.v movies! Some examples will ride with death. (The most mysterious in many) caught in space (Confused and not interesting), San Francisco International (San Francisco International) (boring and incredibly confusing) <br /> <br /> Shooting in Hawaii (even if you don't know from the picture outside) It looks like it's a pilot who failed to Showing a weak spy The real problem is that you don't like most characters, including the main characters like Diamond Head, which seems to be half asleep for the entire movie. His boss, 'Aunt Mary', which had a really strange delivery of him and shellacked white hair, as well as the color of the skin, instead looked like it had been stuccoed on; Girlfriend / friend representative of Diamnd Head (Hell, I can't remember her name) A girl made of wood with a flat, non-sexy or interesting way to speak. And Zulu friends sing (Again, I can't remember the name of his character) which wasn't that bad. The most interesting person in all production is Ian McShane, who is soulful as a bad guy. But still proving his ability to perform. Alothugh, a makeup called "Chameleon" that used to disguise itself is ridiculous. I don't know what he is doing or trying to steal from the lab, which makes him dress like a South American dictator. I don't care The plot is not interesting enough to attract your attention, even ten minutes each time, let alone one and a half hours or more. Just call this thing - Hawaii Five No!
