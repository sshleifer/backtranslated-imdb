I watched anime But I'm not a big fan And i don't read manga I say this because a lot of investigators in the lyrical waxing of this movie seem to have that background. I saw "St. John's Wort" and even though it is not a masterpiece from a long stretch of imagination. But it made me choose "Shinobi" especially since everyone seemed to love it. <br /> <br /> I watched this afternoon and fought hard to see it. Yes, it was very beautiful. The leaves fall on the tree, even CGI eye flicker - majestic. I like hawks, costumes, even some fight scenes. But overall, it looks boring like earth. <br /> <br /> Looks like someone took "Romeo and Juliet" - translation, even if they say they are Cross-star celebrities - and throw in "X-Men" for good measure. Two characters separate Wolverine's power. - Men dressed in bear costumes have his claws and men with gray hair have the ability to heal themselves. If so, then you have women who kiss the poison - that is, Poison Ivy (from Batman). Why do they give these women power? Poison girl shows her legs and kisses you until death. That guy is a great power for you. And other girls can create a bug from this yellow dust that she rubs on her hand Another woman, one of the famous couples, received the power of staring at hypnotic wow. <br /> <br /> I made it to the end of the movie by fast forwarding and watching more tragedies than that. I expected a little Some people are comparing this to "House of Flying Daggers" and "Hero". Don't make mistakes. They may share similar endings. But that is something similar. Ending "Shinobi" made by an amateur - another film made by an experienced filmmaker. <br /> <br /> I'll say, avoid this film unless you are old. 12 to 18 years
