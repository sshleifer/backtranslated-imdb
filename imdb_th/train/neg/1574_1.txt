No matter! Hopeless plot! Filming using a car with a throttle attached, no brakes and an automatic transmission lever stuck will not be good! I will stop that car within a minute, regardless of whether I'm in there or in the police car. After all, I feel sorry for the actor who has to endure the poor script A few scenes in which the similarities of the action are beyond reality and as much as you can. There are also many errors, such as the hood of a car that runs at speeds of 100 miles per hour. At first it just folded the windshield as if it were true. But after that it exploded The car later in this movie noticed with Hood when .... <br /> <br /> This film has nothing but annoying to stay away.
