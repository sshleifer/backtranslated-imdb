One of the requirements of science fiction, at least before it became a word, is that it has reason. I think the bombs against the object will cause more damage than what was intended. But I will leave this story with a physicist who may have seen the solar crisis. <br /> <br /> It is a crisis that the world is facing because the solar flare is completely out of hand. They were so close to the world that it was unreasonably hot, as if the whole world was Death Valley. The answer was a bomb against objects that the spacecraft had to bring to the sun and explode there. This will turn the flame away by saying that the direction of mercury is not the same as the world. <br /> <br /> Who is delivering? But captain Tim Mathison and his team That is, if he can make his business in his hand not in Corinemec Taking care of the personal problems of the family is Admiral Charlton Heston, the father of Matheson and Nemec's grandfather. <br /> <br /> There are criminals here too. Peter Boyle, the CEO of a multinational company, is a crisis. This is trying to control the world's food supply for survivors. The idea that he may not survive is not in his mind. He did his best to sabotage Matheson's mission. <br /> <br /> The solar crisis seems to be a bad mix between 2001, A Space Odyssey and the Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. Boyle from Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor, Superman. He is clearly the only person in the actors who knows that he is in Turkey. Real blue and boring In addition to the desert, I may be a Jack Palance who meets Nemec and cares about him. <br /> <br /> The main thing here is this film directed by Hollywood film director Allen Smithee. Up to four stars for the relevant actors and it's time for carving Thanksgiving.
