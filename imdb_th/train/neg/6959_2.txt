I went to see this story a few days ago and it's hard to forget that movie ... for the wrong reason. This movie should be funny, not laughing at the cinema. (Probably because josé garcia and gérard Depardieu) and it's boring, boring, boring Sometimes it is difficult to understand what they say. They just talk to fast food and don't be open enough to let us understand. I am with friends and more than 4 or 5 times. I caught myself talking after the line that should be funny. "What did he say?" And I am French. I hate to say that because I think good movies are created here. But I'm sorry in advance for all foreigners who are going to watch movies Sorry for cr @ p 2/10
