Since there is nothing wrong with the show, etc. The writing of this script is difficult for this series or does not have a fan. It is a waste of 42 minutes to watch the Mars hunter. You have to know that in the middle of the 6th series, no matter what happens, it is not true what happened and did not present any stories of this series, except met with human hunter Mars again. Time and wasted 30 minutes, far away from other cases of bad writing in Smallville's television drama I like acting But mostly from actors and episodes 3 or more each year But those who used to be a playwright who used or used to soap work must be canned. This is one of the worst things in the first 4 minutes. You know what happens is a fake thing and what happens is a dream caused by Clark's feud from the characters in the zone. The devil and when he wakes up he will win. Must create a really bad character that will make the story progress this week May add another villain in the final episode where the Mars hunter is there and makes him fly away again or come back and tell Clark he has forgotten his sunglasses. Look closer now and call it today
