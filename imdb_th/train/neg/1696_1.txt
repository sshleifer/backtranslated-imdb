I hate to show this role. But in this case, I feel I have to do: the American movie THE GRUDGE is the worst movie I have ever seen in a movie theater in the last 5 years. There, I said it. And now I get that out of my system. Please allow me to explain why. <br /> <br /> "When someone dies in a handful of powerful anger, the curse occurs. Death. Those who find it will be destroyed in anger. "That is the evidence of THE GRUDGE and I will admit that it sounds interesting. Unfortunately, the filmmakers didn't do anything anymore. Those who found "curse" would be consumed by anger and that's all you get. Do you want more? Too bad Some critics and fans point out that THE GRUDGE's sole purpose is to scare you. The problem is that when there is no plot to speak about the creepy images and sounds that can go far. Director Takashi Chimizu drew George Sluice and created his own original movie, boldly trying to create the atmosphere in the first hour ?? By repeating the same scene over and over again It seems like this is so. <br /> <br /> - People walk into the house. <br /> <br /> - There is something flashing with the camera and / or hearing strange sounds. <br /> < br /> - People go to check. <br /> <br /> - The sound begins to sound. <br /> <br /> - People see ghosts. <br /> <br /> - Scream loud and / Or screaming cat <br /> <br /> - cutting into black <br /> <br /> Before the audience is guided by the plot, this same situation will unfold 5 times in the first hour. The first time was really creepy. Each subsequent use becomes a laughing matter when the film continues. At the end of this film, rolling around my friends and I laughed with the suspicion that this scene would end. "With loud screams and black cuts," We never proved wrong. <br /> <br /> The film does not have a storyline instead to unfold in a series of articles that confuse the audience. I have no problem with non-linear narrative when it is correct. The movie jumps over time into moments without touching or reasoning. I have never seen movies in this state since the launch of the Highlanders 2 drama and this storytelling technique makes Mars any kind of mystery that may have If you already know that ghosts are afraid of two characters until death, how shocking is it when their bodies are found in the attic? And why do we have to pay attention when the detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearance when we know what has happened to everyone? <br /> <br /> Obviously, the second green light in the US version of THE RING is done $ 15 million in the first week There is nothing but imitation from calculations that are disguised as real movies. The most frightening thing about THE GRUDGE is making $ 40 million in the first weekend and some people think it is. "The most horrible movie ever created." I wonder what will happen to those who have received the rage of paying to see regret?
