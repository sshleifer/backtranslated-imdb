The horrible movie that everyone said What makes me laugh is the image of the pendant by Scott McNealy giving a reward to a programmer who was murdered in the logo wall. SUN McNealy is the CEO of SUN Microsystem, a company that defines itself with Microsoft's hatred. They are tools. Important in filing an antitrust complaint with Microsoft. Are they stupid enough to think that this bad movie will fuel that fire? <br /> <br /> No None public record that I saw the participation of SUN, however, clear that the film is Scott McNealy mystery interesting.
