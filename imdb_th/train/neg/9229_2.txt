This is a movie about making movies. Such movies may be entertaining. But they need some content It didn't happen here. I'm afraid Mr Coppola didn't inherit his father's skills. Unfortunately (Did not do his sister But who can make movies that may look) <br /> <br /> I wonder if this movie received such rave reviews. <br /> <br /> Let's see: The male lead is expected As a director, expressing feelings like a frozen octopus and his voice having the same volume, everything he said, a female lead, has her face that has never been seen The plot changes are divided into sections, which may have a single connection element. Movies in the movie's mind must be older than the stone age ... Is that enough? <br /> <br / > I regret every moment I watched this movie Walking with dogs is a superior entertainment for this unbelievable movie. As if the plot Fran√ßois Truffaut was directed by Dick Cheney ... <br /> <br /> Brazilian, other classic SF movies? You have to be really kidding ...
