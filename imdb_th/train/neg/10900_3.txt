You can't tolerate this too much because knowing that it's been built in four days and I expect it to be a camp. (Not all camps are in reality except Kevin Kalisher and Huntley Ritter, who are not serious with the rest of the actor's characters playing halfway through Riley Smith, especially bad). I think the whole purpose of these low price horror movies is to satisfy the worst sexual fantasies and not to curse the story. But they use a lot of words like "technology" and "physical" in the script to get Their point across (Although it is possible that the story is just important to explain why there are only a few members) No one is interested in this stupid story, and the only thing that is interesting in this film is ridicule, cult and homosexuality. Not all that frustrating.) I will have more fun if there is only a random kill without reason. This movie is small, with TV look and quality. There are a few "sexy" scenes that are okay. The boys are twisting on the bed in the boxers feeling themselves up. Or tied and made the face to a climax while the wine was poured on them - some people were funny and I liked the digging at L. Ron Hubbard and the interesting story about the evangelist With gay men who are striking But it's still not good. 3/10
