Even though it is not worthwhile to see this tacky spoiler's wreck, everything about 'Annie' looks like the character is being reduced to a story that is written badly and they feel humiliated in production It was made clear for the TV. But if I find it on my television, I will flick it straight than the kids in the movie do a good job. But the adults shown are unbelievable, so the movie can't really pull you in. This movie has no music / dance numbers that make the original wonderful, all love. Johnson, Annie is sometimes amazing. Annoyed and done .. You can't convince yourself that she is Annie. The difference in the character's character is still annoying to me throughout the movie. Sad to say that this sequel is all a failure.
