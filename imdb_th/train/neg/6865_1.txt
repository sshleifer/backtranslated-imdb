This movie is terrible. It's ridiculous. I can't resist watching it. The plot is standard, the show is quite scary. (Supporting actors like crazy neighbors and fellow lawyers are better actors) amusing. If you have time to lose and like to see an amazing conclusion, <br /> <br /> the actor who plays the drama "K Thi "is fascinating because I can't decide if her flat face affects or not. As a result of poor surgery or poor performances (I decided that both). This makes the script to comment, which is very scary. Pat speaks negligent and ignorant decisions in the negligence of every character in the movie. Maybe this is a very exciting thing. I don't know. I just watched to see how bad it was. (In fact, the dialog box does not have the property to be called "cliche" "- but it is almost incomplete) <br /> <br /> All in all, things are very bad. Scenes, same scenes (house, Buildings have been repeatedly shown without real art or performances. Like a scene that is randomly placed in a scene that does not play well The chase scene may be shot by children and youth in a warehouse or old school: bad shot, cheap equipment, low action .... and I still want to see the ending.
