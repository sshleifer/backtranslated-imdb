I was unlucky to have to sit and watch it for 102 minutes. In my opinion, it was a shocking movie that wasn't good. It fails at all levels. The actors are horrible, the actors - the most ham and the plot lacks depth, causing me to feel strongly indifferent to the outcome of the complex story. <br /> <br /> Plan B doesn't have this type of charm, with scope to convey and I find myself being flattering at many points that the script makes it unusual to go anywhere in the area of ​​comedians. <br /> <br /> This film is truly popular.
