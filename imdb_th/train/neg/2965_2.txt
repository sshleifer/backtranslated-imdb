This movie is interesting ... I have to watch it for college classes about India. But the conclusion tells you that this movie is about one thing when it doesn't have very cold and hard information. It's not true for conclusions until the end they try to tie all the elements together. However, the great factor is Although at first you want to look out because the blood is quite intense Watch this movie only when you want to see the bright blood because of some story and will make you sad that you waste time listening. I've seen rumors on other websites about this movie that are based on real events. But you can't find any information about it online ... so basically this movie is a waste of time to watch
