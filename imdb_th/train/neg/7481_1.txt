Some people should tell Goldie Hawn that her career as a young teenager ended thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies in recent years, which is a disaster. Clear, both of which lead to a violent expression of their trademark tics in an attempt to create a bad script. Directing this should be concealed from birth. <br /> <b r /> I hope John Cleese gets a lot of money for his name and this disaster. He is the only actor who has been muddled in this way, more or less, not being injured. His only mistake is the failure to know that the remaining actors will sink.
