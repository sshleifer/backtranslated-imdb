I've seen many stupid movies in my life. But this is undoubtedly the worst movie! I always like dumb movies if they are quite fun. But I can't think of a good thing about this movie. I like "Teen Witch" for heaven's sake, but S.I.C.K has a terrifying performance, weak porn songs throughout the story and even sex scenes are still sucked! I have to compare the weakness of this movie to people who like "Twin Dragons", "Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys" or even "Very Brady Sequel" even though this is worse than that. I ask, don't waste your time. Believe me, it's 2 hours. You'll never get back.
