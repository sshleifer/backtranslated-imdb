I don't want to believe that in the previous comments 34, no one said that this movie was a movie that was born yesterday. Men are hired to bring blonde hair that is noticeably dumb, according to the needs of the gangster. The hired gun and blond hair fall in love and live a happy life forever. The remaining gangster in the lurch But born yesterday was a wise treatment while it was very fluffy. The transferring technique to DVD is a shame. Natalie Calamus will roll in her grave. Try to watch the newspaper, remember him, but in the past it was interesting to see the roots of Rock 'n Roll. Interesting thing is to introduce Ewell's new CinemaScope at that time.
