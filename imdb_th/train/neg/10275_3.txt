The location is amazing and some parts of the show, especially Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp, are charming ... The music sounds as though it comes from a copyright-free online website and lyrics as if they were written with a poetry dictionary Open on the lap Most singing is the key. I think they might be filmed by singing accapella and putting the song in there ... The conversation is really stupid and boring. This film works best when talking about real estate. But unfortunately, it is hidden in a foolish subplot. I found myself checking the clock after the first twenty minutes and after 40 wondering when "will end."
