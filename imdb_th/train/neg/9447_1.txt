Most movies that I can sit easily even if I don't like movies in particular. I am a type of person who knows great movies even though I don't like the genre. This is the first movie I can't watch. Cat in the Hat is the worst movie I've ever seen - and I've seen a lot of movies. The show is fine. (Meier is as good as a cat. It's just that he's really annoying.) A silly song that the cat sings boring and monotonous, even with the children in the audience. Through bad conversations The words of the parents "cunning" disgusting is not a joke. (I remember some horrible comments about the garden hoe compared to the type of person that people call "ho"), although this movie is very short. But it seems to be forever Do not waste time I know little children who hate this movie. If children can't stand, I don't know how adults can do it. I want to write more about this movie. But I don't feel like wasting more time writing reviews about I hate it! So in summary, don't spend 90 minutes in your life. See this! Watch the movie GOOD! <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars - the lowest comment I've ever received from a movie
