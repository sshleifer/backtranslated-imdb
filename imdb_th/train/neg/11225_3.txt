This documentary shows the career in the past few years of career Betty Page (Paige Richards), a parody of Tennessee is the queen of the most recognizable pin-ups in history. Her most memorable work occurred in the 1950s and was a photograph of fetish, bondage and fighting with cats. Irving Claw (Dookie Fly Statist) at New Star News ordered Betty to do what he had to do in front of the camera. There is no nudity in the famous photos or "Young Film" but nonetheless, Laos is charged with selling pornographic materials and ordered to destroy them in order to avoid being prosecuted. It is not surprising that Betty has a belief in her career. The next girl who has black hair, blue eyes, and an hour glass image that is worn in a fetish dress or is not likely to be fascinated for decades. In the end, it was said that she was photographed more than Marilyn Monroe and the second, after the most photographed image in the world, was Elvis Presley. Betty Page will disappear and devote to religion over the years. This movie is probably much better. But good enough to pay attention. <br /> <br /> Miss Richards is an interesting person in her own underwear, underwear, belts and tubes, not harming her image at least. In addition to the performances: Jaimie Henkin, Jana Strain, Emily Marilyn and Julie Simone acknowledge that this film can change your heart rate.
