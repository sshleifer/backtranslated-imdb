I bought this video quite cheaply. The former rental thinks that the cover looks quite good and it's good, but this movie is trash. I can deal with B grade. Sometimes I enjoy playing a wrapper (like 'Surf Nazis Must Die' is a classic example of entertainment in this genre). Incredible boring scenes are destroyed Down too sparse because of good cheap pornography and the horror scenes that entertain This movie is very rare.
