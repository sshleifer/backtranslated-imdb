The thing about calling "House of the Dead", the worst movie of all time, is not true. There are worse movies out there. I watched a lot of Hong Kong ninjas movies, which were the result of an unfinished Japanese police drama with a picture of a ninja inserted at the end of the picture to create what can be called "movies". <br /> <br /> The Dead is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in a movie theater. Half way out, I actually felt that I was quite stupid because I had to throw this piece of 45 minutes.
