This woman who worked as an apprentice for the photographer returned home and took a bath where she discovered this hole on the ceiling. So she found that her neighbor was over. She was a photographer. This movie may have a good plot. But the plot that drains any hope. The problem I have with this movie is every ten seconds. Someone is heroin. If they bring the scene where people talk about heroin, this is a good movie. Every time I think the scene will go somewhere somewhere, inhale the white powder. It's really a lame story that has a lot of drugs in one movie. It attracts attention from the main story and is a great story about the photographer. Lesbian things don't bother me. I'm looking for a movie about art. I found a movie about drug use.
