I think this movie is one of the worst movies in the Nightmare series. It's boring until I can't remember anything for 20 minutes. After the movie ends, it makes me have to write a review. <br /> <br /> OK # 4 is a joke and Freddy is a joker. # 5 Try to return to the root of the series. It's darker and more atmospheric than Nightmare 4, which is generally good. They tried to shoot horror movies instead of jokes. Unfortunately they forgot to add suspense and fear. Because of the nightmare 5: children in a dream are not funny or scary What we really get is a boring movie with a bad actor (maybe except Lisa Wilcox) <br /> <br /> Story (Freddy kills Lisa's friend by using the dream of a child in the womb Lisa) Base, but it's not enough for a 90-minute movie. Sometimes the story is very confusing. (Probably because of none) and you can't stop wondering what the filmmakers aim for The screenplay must have more holes than Swiss cheese and the movie is so wonderful. (Let me say that I don't like cheese even though I am from Switzerland) Not even the special effects as well as in Part 4. <br /> <br /> Don't bother to rent / buy. This film, if not for perfection, is quite messy. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (familiar with it # 6 is a mess ...)
