This is the first time for me. The first time I was disappointed in Tim Burton's movie, POTA is not a bad movie. (A wonderful set, a set and a fantastic performance) but it can be created by off-site Hollywood directors The walk was very strange. The third time ago, just spent waiting for the movie to end with myself and the actor. Tim Roth, excellent, would be the only happiness in this movie. Come back to Tim.
