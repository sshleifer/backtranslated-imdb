On the stationery for many years (reported), the reunification of the television of the two most beloved characters in the sitcom history started badly - and went down there. Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore ) And her best friend, Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper), met in New York after a long time of feud and followed each other's lives Is a new concept! But sad to be involved, nothing to say about (To make a single movie) happened to both of them over the years Therefore, the content of the script itself uses one old plot device (which is mostly related to older women at work), while there is no charm and complexity that makes the original performance a winner. The supporting actors immediately recognized the absence of humor and chemistry that Moore and Harper had previously lost. Moore was accused of delaying this project for many years by waiting "Just the right script" before deciding for yourself If this is what she thinks is "correct", what are you changing? It's not the age of the characters that do this in (For the inevitable time of walking) but the lack of almost complete imagination coupled with ignoring the elements that make the series work Once this thing was intended as a pilot But everyone clearly says it can't create interest among potential supporters. Or for that matter among potential audiences Forget fast and have mercy, this movie is a classic imitation and insult.
