I saw this movie at the London Premiere and I must say - I didn't expect much. But I expect that there will be at least some entertainment. <br /> <br /> Traditional "basic instincts" do not have great movies and are still "smut classic" but it's fun. I can remember countless times, flipping through TV channels on Friday nights or Saturday nights, past movies and found myself starting to pay attention to it. <br /> <br / > However, this cerebral palsy waaay- sequel delayed nothing. Is Sharon Stone still beautiful? We look better - for 47 years old, she is quite hot. Is she the same beautiful person? No, she still has clear plastic surgery on her face and her haircut in this film is quite unattractive. She doesn't look soft or genuine or innocent, just like she did in the original - which is the whole point of being an evil deceiver and anything. <br /> <br /> The rest of the performance has since Worse, terrible - and Michael Caton-Jones (general safety director - who doesn't do a great job But able to create a cost-effective movie) giving his first official turkey The movie that the bad guy laughed at when he was determined to be serious. <br /> <br /> I heard that the film had been modified many times and it was very clear from the beginning. Nothing makes much sense. The whole plot is a cosmic mess and ends - Oh, I! Talking about stupid and unbelievable people (Still guessing) I saw "Gigli". I saw "Son of the Mask" - and although I didn't want to "smear" this movie, I can speak to my own authority (which you don't have to accept. Please note) I like both movies about this failure. <br /> <br /> The stone left for five minutes before the film began and the people in the theater started throwing things. Various on the screen in between Outrageous and insulting, especially in nightclub orgy <br /> <br /> "Basic Instinct 2" - basically, it was a foul.
