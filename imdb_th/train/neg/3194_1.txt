I can't believe that this movie was created recently in 1984. It has a laughing performance, not to mention one of the most stupid plans ever. Who would ask Texas sheriff Joseph Baker to take the Italians that he had been illegally arrested in Mexico back to Italy? Not to mention that the name of the movie doesn't tell you anything about it - in fact, it's a common name for action / police movies that I think. <br /> <br /> I'm glad. I saw this in MST3K with Mike and Bots only as armor. They talk about the similarities with Elaine's female leaders from the scene file. ("No, they are disgusting") and don't stop Baker's weight. This movie may not be worse than "Mitchell", but Baker's fame came before him here: when his name appeared at the beginning of the movie, Tom said "I wish I would not know the book so I didn't have to read it."
