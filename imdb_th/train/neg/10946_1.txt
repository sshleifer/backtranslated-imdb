"The 'Malcom' program on FOX is really killing ... We can't make our own version?" I guess and definitely transcribe. But in our hearts we all know that it is true and the only thing that NBC has added to the 'Malcom' indicator is sex. And the boys, they add sex ... <br /> <br /> Thirteen-year-old Tucker gets a mistake and conceals it with his skateboard. Tucker accidentally walked into his aunt in the shower and she accused him of watching her and dancing out. He spies a lovely woman in the house next to his bedroom window and she knows that he wants to see her naked. But she teased him by smiling and closing the window And this is all in the pilot Funny for the main audience The only time that anyone who has ever approached came into the movie and you can count with one hand. It is not surprising that "Tucker" is warm and inviting from the club bathroom. The network thinks that we really want to watch the kids. This is not something that people have to go to jail for, right? If you suspect the bad thing of the program, consider this story: There were 13 episodes, but NBC canceled it after only 4 episodes. Episodes are sarcastic, since children are the same target group. <br /> <br /> In addition to the general ambiguity, Tucker also has voice overs Each cor leads to even less written in 2000. It dated horribly with ska and satire with it. I don't like any one character that can laugh at jokes and jokes do not happen for a minute. ... NBC's shame for the dirty scam ... they are good More than that. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
