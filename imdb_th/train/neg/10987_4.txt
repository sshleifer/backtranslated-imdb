I like Margaret Atwood's 'The Robber Bride' novel and I am excited to see that there is a movie version. A woman laid a frame for police fans to kill herself and a former colleague, a former police officer trying to clear his name by checking the crazy female friend of the dead girl. Fortunately, the movie script helped to fix the story of Mrs. Atwood's plan, focusing on the story of these two men, the victims of the women. I already If these people are mentioned in the book and I'm pretty sure they all make up for the movie, I'll eat the dust cover of my hardcover copy. Clearly, the three main female characters of the novel are not enough to bring the movie. Zenia's routines are not interesting if we don't see them happen to a man. one man Because it doesn't matter if a man doesn't hear them. <br /> <br /> I like the characters in the book. It hurts to see them pushing out to the side to tell the story of a man. I normally don't look for feminism in the media and I try to enjoy the movie as it is. If I didn't read the book, I might enjoy more movies. So if you like police and former police and you want to read more about them, you are unfortunately. Read a novel if you want to enjoy the charming prose and subtly break through the plot. It is the same plot: the movie that dug it rolled and sprinkled with male anger. It's like Zenia's revenge at Margaret Atwood.
