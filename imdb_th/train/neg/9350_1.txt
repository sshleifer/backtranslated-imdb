This movie is terrible. The first half of the hour was like ... Uh, sorry for the lack of art. But it was A Clockwork Orange, a bad version. The first scene was almost a copy from one of Clockwork! Suppose it is a tribute to the appearance of the Clockwork poster on the protagonist's wall, but "ripoff" is more appropriate. The movie feels as if it was torn from Kubrick classic, but filmed only through the eyes of the new director. Blind director Unfortunately when it stopped Kubrick's massacre, the movie was even worse. As one reviewer said that the depth of the film was pushed down your throat. Arrogant, self-absorbing and eventually drifting without meaning I don't feel anything for this guy. And I am an alcoholic, so I think if anyone can feel anything for him, it will be me Character development, dialogue and terrible plot. <br /> <br /> The worst part about this movie is the name. For a movie called "16 Years of Alcohol", alcoholism is hardly a factor in flicking. See the first paragraph - it's a work of A Clockwork Orange. I can't pass. The better name is "16 Years of Violence" or "A Clockwork Banana". <br /> <br /> Just do your favorite things and avoid this movie. If you ignore my advice and take it out to drink, believe me.
