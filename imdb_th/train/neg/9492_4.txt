One star for "plot", one star for acting One star for the voice of the five-star American voice for Monica Broeke and Inge Maria Granzow with the liking of removing clothes And ten in ten for the sacred Emmanuelle Béart two years ago. She created the 'Manon des source'. Béart took off her clothes a few times. But even though she is fully clothed, it is enough to make this film stand out clearly. Beware of the scenes in which she told her friends about "first time" three times for girls. It was repetitive but still more erotic than the "love scene" that choreographed with Broeke, Granzow and Patrick Bauchau. Slide for closing credits is a better indicator of what David Hamilton can do.
