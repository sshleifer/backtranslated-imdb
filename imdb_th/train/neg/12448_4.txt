Clint Eastwood is the Bronco Billy leader of the Wild West Corps, which is one of the six regular series that includes a difficult tour program. The seventh member of the bunch is Billy's assistant woman. But the woman is not long and the chronic opening position enters Antoinette Lilly (episode of Sandra Locke's girlfriend ?? Of Eastwood). It seems that Miss Lily, while the Doctor (Scatman Crothers), called her the heir to the legacy of a deceased father long ago if she married at the age of 30 on her birthday with the cartoon Geoffrey Lewis. <Br /> <br /> So what is the plot of this movie? It's hard to say. There is tension between romance with Billy and Miss Lily. But the problem is that in the first half of this movie, she looks boring and disgusting, until when she becomes 'one of the faculty' through the film, it is unbelievable, but the audience feels very concerned about her. There is a lack of chronic funding after the Wild West performance, but this topic is not enough to be a hot scene of the movie. There is the situation of Miss Lily, which is stuck in the west of the countryside, cutting money that makes her luxury life go away. (She believes that her family and the media have died wrongly) but should we really believe that she can't go back to New York and wait for her fate if she takes a bit of effort? > <br /> Not the point of this movie seems to be Billy. Is the leader of a family who is a group of cute people who are defeated by thick and thin This is a warm and vague film ?? Or at least trying to be <br /> <br /> Clint shows his skills with guns, even bank robberies, in a very unusual shot in a movie without violence. One of the gang was arrested for avoiding the old body; Billy bribed the local sheriff. The tents of the list were burnt. Orphanages make them new. But many worldly mistakes do not cause problems. <br /> <br /> Combining the problem is acting or lacking. In addition to Scatman Crothers, the supporting actors are not yet skilled. Eastwood is not at the top of his game, although he looks better by being surrounded by a group of fierce people. <br /> <br /> And all this movie is stubborn. For 116 minutes until which point? Good question? <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
