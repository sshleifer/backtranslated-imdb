The film is based on a genuine 1950s novel. <br /> <br /> Colin McInnes reporter wrote three novels in London, "Absolute Beginners", "City of Spades" and "Mr Love and Justice". I read all three. already The first two are excellent. Finally, it might be an experiment that didn't come out, but McInnes's work was highly regarded. And therefore correct This drama is the author's biggest nightmare - to see the result of his own thoughts, becoming an apology in the same dimension of the film that says it captured the spirit of London in 1950 and did nothing. /> <br /> Thank God Colin McInnes has no life to be a witness.
