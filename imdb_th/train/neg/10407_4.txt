I found the Tremors 4: The Legend Begins to be boring and boring. All the action scenes are so stupid that "GRABOIDS" will reduce the size of modern home cats. If not smaller, the show is scary and This movie is just a film that is not necessary in the Tremor fairy tale, because although it tells the story of the formation of graboids, but the story looks stupid and useless, so if you want to tell the story back in time, you use SAME ACTOR ( Michael Gross) is a person in the past when he is currently in other shaking movies. Geez ... If you haven't watched this movie, don't waste time sticking to Tremors, 1 , 2 and 3 in a good time. However, this movie, make sure that you are far away, sitting next to you with the STOP button that works to escape from this nonsense.
