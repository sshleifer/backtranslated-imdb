I have to tell you in advance. I am not an authority in Bollywood movies and only see a few people. However, if you have never seen anyone, don't start with this one! I am very happy with what I have seen until now. But I couldn't bear I have to tell you in advance that I can't finish this movie - it's very annoying. And why is it annoying? <br /> <br /> 1. There is a character named 'Rambha' in the movie. He is even more annoying than Jar-Jar Binks, which I never believed was possible. He is # @ ^ ! # annoying !! He spoke with a beautiful voice and I thought that would be a joke. He just scrape my nerves and want him to die ... slowly! His voice and horrors - he didn't seem to close and dominated every scene he had - and he had to die! <br /> <br /> 2 The hero has an amazing ability to easily escape the AK-47. I am not a child - there is a scene with weapons that are not used in the army of these assault rifles !! And again and again, they avoid shooting one bullet and beat the gangsters !!! This makes Stallone's actions in "Rambo II" look normal !! <br /> <br /> 3 This movie is so loud in your face and intense - it makes my brain bleed. !! As if the movie was created by people under the influence of Paya !! Crazy camera angles, intense music and action, action, action ... This movie is clearly designed for people who cannot make a movie with PTSD and want to Almost 100% action. <br /> <br /> 4, the two main characters and their actions and aspirations are unreasonable. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if you are the most enthusiastic and a Bollywood fan, you can show this movie. But for me, I can see why it's on IMDb's embarrassing Bottom 100 list. Wow ... this movie is very bad !!
