Added to the caricature program: Southern Preacher and "Rally" torch singer (Sophie Tucker)? Singer, dance, and The Mills Brothers - it's even worse they Although the movie "Negro comedy" may be accepted today But it was very disgusting today and I wondered if it was funny. Even though I am not offended But I don't think I will laugh about the humor that is weak. However, as a 11-year-old white boy, I may not understand it.
