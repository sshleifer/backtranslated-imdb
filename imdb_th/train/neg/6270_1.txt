Somehow, women who work with scientists put round metal balls into the mouths of people who change their personality. But in reality, they became a zombie-like killer. "The guinea pig" for experimentation is a young woman with a disrespectful husband who wants to study acting. This movie is terrible, bad and terrible. It has little or no logic in the script. You will have trouble tracking what really happens. There are no special techniques. The computer screen that represents the great scientific progress is nothing more than the old Atari screen, and the worse thing is that there are puppets with hair in a line. (Looks like a lonely boy at a summer camp doing) named George like a private servant / close friend with Jessica. Throughout the movie, you have to fall into the stupidity and confusion of this puppet. But wait ... You still get a softcore scene, naked scenes with girls who have the most annoying soundtrack bars playing in the background, like some spiritual discoveries happen. There are no good actors. Have different levels of badness Scary aspects and "horror" are taken especially improperly. This movie looks like a teenager will bring together. No coincidence, Henry Sala, directed by the name But not commercial, not creating another movie I was almost bored of this foolish coma! And how does the competition end? What happened? If you know, let me enter the secret, because for my life I can not figure it out. All I know is that I wasted time watching this garbage, which made my weekend a real nightmare!
