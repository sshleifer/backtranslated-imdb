In this film, there was a chance in 1930 and launched in 1931. I predicted that speaking of the film had a huge problem in the transition from the silent era. However, this Zane Gray plot seems to be very weak. In addition, Gary Cooper may also learn to show. The result is something that is not accepted in the current standard for 1931. Probably for 2004, it is not acceptable. Some actors work well. Sadly, Indians tend to receive weaknesses in the early part of the West. They lived in the land long before the white people came. But according to the distorted history, they have no right to protect themselves.
