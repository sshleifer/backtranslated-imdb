I don't like this movie But after that, I didn't think of any books, even though it was regarded as "Masterpiece" but I found that the lack of character development and disjointed and irrational in the plot Read more easily than the first attempt of Fante "Road to Los Angeles" that was not published until Fante became a fashion in the mid-80s. <br /> <br /> I was amazed to see what the Towne soup would do with Rare ingredients like this He worked hard to fix many of the book's shortcomings. But for my money did not help it There has never been a movie in the Ask the Dust as he tried to be honest with the book. I considered the folly of this movie of Towne. <br /> <br /> In one word: forgettable
