This movie is terrible. Bad screenplay, ordinary script, and even sex scenes are worthless. The excitement and intrigue of the original movie is completely absent. This film was filmed in a dark, shiny style and monochromatic (a la "War of the Worlds") which is very disappointing after the beauty of the original movie Greg Morrisey's lamentable character shows only one facial expression throughout the movie. Twists and turns of the original plot, lack of grief here; A few that exist are just anti-cancer. The only highlight is the performance of Sharon Stone as Catherine Traamel, which is faithfully attributed to this sequel. The only situation that should be done "Basic Instinct 3" will happen if Michael Douglas agrees to participate in the selection.
