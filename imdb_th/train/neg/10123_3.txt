I imagined when Hitchcock's academics and experts met together. The talk was not a great movie of Master, such as "North By Northwest" or "Strangers On A Train" but was a lesser known effort like this since the year. 1931 Obscure and seriously flawed Which shows the excellent director in the form of experience. <br /> <br /> Emily and Fred Hill (Joan Barry and Harry Kendall) are the middle class lovers of London who are waiting. in front of He blamed them a lot. She accepted it. The change came in the form of a letter from the uncle, saying that he would set them up so that they could enjoy the extravagant luxury life. They plan for a cruise around the world. But their problems just started. <br /> <br /> Just ask Richard Hannay, Roger O. Thornhill or Marion Crane. Take Lamae. But you get the idea Travel and Hitchcock together, like butterflies, night and candlelight, starting with a dangerous journey. This may be Hitchcock's first attack on this theme and not his most successful or memorable. Hitchcock tried to combine humor with other elements. In this case, domestic drama instead of a thriller. But both are not together, at least not here. <br /> <br /> Hills are a boring and flat couple without chemistry. Or personality When they found themselves at Folies Berg√®re in the form of a montage with images that looked older than the remaining ten years of the film, they were attacked at the set of actresses. "The curtain goes up too fast!" Emily gasps, "They don't dress." <br /> <br /> When the hill cruises from each other on an ocean cruise, it seems that killing mercies is more than a sad story. They are allied with drops. Gordon (Percy Marn), Emily's man, holds a photo of himself sitting next to an empty chair which Emily suggests to him. Fred's girl "Princess" (Betty Amann) has the eyes of Clara Bow and the shadow of five o'clock of Wallace Beer In addition, there are terrifying fellow passengers who are hustlers, which Hitchcock often recommends with cartoon cues. Wisdom still occurs. <br /> <br /> Everything was shot in a sudden manner with confusing blocks and stressful conversations. Hitchcock tried to find a joke with Fred and his umbrella that didn't come out and Kendall seemed to set a goal to laugh while the berry played for tears. When Fred and Emily break up, they are seen being dragged by a double drag truck that is full of fierce, one of the great efforts that symbolizes the effort. <br /> <br / > Emily is the only sympathetic character. About her husband and suffering with her relationship with Gordon But mostly because she was one of the first people of Hitchcock's magnetic blonde. Many of her platinum plates leapt to her face like Botticelli on the Chinese garbage ship deck.> <br /> The story concluded with A dangerous situation as a piece for the protagonists to come and capture and assume that their relationship has been repaired, but they are not involved in the problem solving and exclusion. The karma of a friendly cat has nothing to do with resonance. <br /> <br /> At least you will get a fun view of London in the early 1930s and the chance to see Hitchcock when he was still. Working to find food, "rich and strange" is Hitchcock paying fees and learning his trade for academics. But not a casual movie
