There is little to be excited about. "Dan in real life" First of all, all the settings were unbelievably invented. Do you really believe that during the first conversation at the restaurant, Marie didn't tell where she was going? And since Dan spoke everything during the conversation, why did she like him? For that matter, I never thought of why Marie was attracted to Dan throughout the story. He was very narcissistic and didn't make us believe that he was really good (for example, he lied to Marie in the bookstore), mocking his brother about his former girlfriend. There are more plans, such as the ridiculous scenes at the bowling alley, where both the family and Danny are arrested. Yes, that may really happen. Real life is slow and witty. Even the chickens like the Jane Austen Book Club still score higher than this predictable "tearjerker".
