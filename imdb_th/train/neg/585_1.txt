The original movie, Man From Snowy River, is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The story of Lady and the Tramp in two touches - a rich / poor young woman and the ability to compare with the bloodline The sequel is not only But is an unscrupulous attempt to take advantage of the original good name But also a ridiculous thing that is ridiculous beyond the expectation of the best Disneyfied charm of The Black Stallion. The young hero returned from a 3-year absence and suddenly he was a superman on horseback. In a good original movie, he is a true and believable person. But sadly dropped as a parody in the sequel I almost never disappointed in the movie and sometimes this thing makes me very angry - they miss words that are not very thoughtful. Dealing with a bustling audience - the studio head thinks what you have to do with the audience who loves horses is to put beautiful horses in front of them to make them happy? Movie regulations
