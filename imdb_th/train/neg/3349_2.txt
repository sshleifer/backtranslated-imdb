I have not read Shirley Jackson's novel, which is something I intend to do sometimes. I'm sure it will be more scary than this movie. I remember jumping once when I watched another day, even though I couldn't remember the scene. <br /> <br /> The special effects were great and I watched it on a DVD. But I'm sure that in the theater, it must be a great picture. After using the first few special effects, I'm waiting for the story to be developed. <br /> <br /> I think this movie must at least be based on a classic novel so freely. A good story should be there, but it's not. I was relegated to stare at the beautiful character Catherine Zeta-Jones throughout the movie. In general, because there is nothing to see. Lili Talor is a soulful character I don't like you a bit. The thing about cheaters. In addition, the guy in this movie reminds me of Dudley DoRight, a cartoon with his voice and face. I can't relate to the characters. Quigon, ahem Liam Neeson. An admirable work. Try to pass this movie with some performances. <br /> <br /> Half to three quarters of the way I just died for Go see the Friday 13th camp or the Scream Queenish movie! At least there is some entertainment value. If there is no matter, at least they fill with blood-filled death or interesting women. This is nothing. <br /> <br />
