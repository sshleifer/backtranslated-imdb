The case is the best part of the movie. But only not worth the purchase price I expect to be a movie "Based on the real story" only to search for the home video hodge-lodge of low quality clip shots linked to the pathetic acting scene The video scene has many reverse situations which may be used to extend the length of the feature over the effects. I started this review before I got halfway through the movie and waited until it ended in the event that it ended better. But low and see only worse If I mark below this, it will be minus ten. Learn from my mistakes and save your money and time with this one.
