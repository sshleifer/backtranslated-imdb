What movie is this garbage? Location is ok. But even at first, there was a crappy effect to mix in the giant with people of normal size. But the scary part of this movie is the dialogue. It's not perfect, stupid and stupid. I felt it was written by the 9th year students in the creative class and received D-I want to hit Casper van Diem and other actors to follow this movie. <br /> <br /> I There is a share of bad and bad movies. Not recommended at all. It is a silly story and a bad conversation that will completely make you cringe.
