I'm a big fan of warrior movies. Some of my favorites are Braveheart, Troy, Final Samurai and Gladiator, and after watching Mongol, which is great and I highly recommend. I have high expectations from the movie Sergei Bodrov, but it's terrible, scary, even poor. Not a strong word in this case All the movies I waited for exciting things to happen. But it was not possible. At least I expected the big fight at the end. But even then it was very disappointing ... There were many good warrior movies, this movie was not a movie.
