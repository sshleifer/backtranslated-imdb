There is a similarity between Ray Lawrence's "Jindabyne" and his latest movie "Lantana" ?? The dead body and its reflections for incomplete life, but while "Lantana" offers some hope and solution, "Jindabyne" makes everything not resolved in a cold manner Which will make most of the audience dissatisfied or may be cheated It became an element in the 1993 Robert Altman Lawrence classic "Short Cuts" series. Use this theme to explore and show relationships within a small community in Australia under stress. This film has questions about morality. "Will you give the discovery of a body that ruined your good weekend?" And even worse for Australians "Will it make a difference if the dead are Aboriginal people?" The performances, especially by Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linney, are commendable. And there are elements of magic added with haunting music, unlike "Picnic that hung a stone" <br /> <br /> If all this sounds like the basis for a great movie - get ready to step down. Very slow and the murder will appear near the beginning, thus eliminating the elements of mystery. So we left these empty lives and empty endings.
