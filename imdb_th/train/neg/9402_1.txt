Why does this movie happen? Although taking into account the many tax cuts that Australian film investors receive But there is no reasonable explanation for this film to be received in the future The lead actor in the film is Aussie Celebs (not the actor John Michael 'Hollywood' Howson, the original drummer from Hey It Saturday's band and the voice of Countdown. But in saying that this is still something that can be watched as long as you pay attention to the brain that deserves: no bad script (Even though it is a horror movie at the level b) and the quality of the show and the movie is worse Often it looks like it's a movie at home. But even movies at home have 'realism'. Anyone interested in Australian movies, please for the love of God, pretends to be a film never made.
