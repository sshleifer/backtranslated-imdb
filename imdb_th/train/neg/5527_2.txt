Revolt of the Zombies is BAD. There's nothing fun from a distance about movies. It is a boring, life-threatening, poorly written and poorly written script. I often complain that Dracula is a bit slow for my taste. This movie makes Dracula look like a roller coaster ride. Time spent 65 minutes. It looks like 165 minutes. <br /> <br /> Story: The journey was sent to Cambodia to find the secrets of mind control through "Making a zombie" A man finds a secret and uses it to make the woman he loves marry him. When this happens, he will release the zombies that are under his control to get that horrible result. That's the whole story. <br /> <br /> For most movies, I try to think that I can. See where the male protagonist is. He looks familiar. I have plenty of time to think about this. Nothing happened in the movie before "revolted the zombies". It hit me. It was Dean Jagger. I saw him as a general in the White Christmas. Recently, this is what I "entertain" myself throughout the story. br /> <br /> I'm glad I didn't buy a DVD for this movie. King of the Zombies is on the other side and is a masterpiece of filmmaking compared to this movie. For valuable things I will give 2/10 (I will not go 1/10 because believe it or not, I've seen worse).
