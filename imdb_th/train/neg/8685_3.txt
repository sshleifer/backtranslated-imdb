Honestly, my expectations for Little Bush are low. I expect to have a little cartoon series that has lots of fun. Obviously I should reduce my expectations. <br /> <br /> Writing is extremely pathetic. In addition to Cheney-Kai jokes - eating and small flicks, it's boring and unlikely. <br /> <br /> The animation is as complex as the ten-year-old flash project. three years It's a shame that they use Macromedia's products because they can do more. <br /> <br /> I don't like Bush a lot and I like Bush-joke as much as the next guy, but this is just a sweep. For half an hour at the President, with many painful moments that are not funny Mark Parker and Matt Stone can do more, that is my bush. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favorite. Cross "Lil 'Bush" and go buy short funny copies. You will thank me
