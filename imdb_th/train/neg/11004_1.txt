It really impressed me. The director / writer / actor must have a real charm. I think there is no other way to go through the scripting process. What I want you to consider is ... while watching movies, I feel sorry for the actors. Feeling like being in a funny club where a young man is dying by sitting and sitting there, not having fun with it, just feeling terrible for him. The code wants to know what the budget is. Guess it's still low because the quality of the movie is really bad. I want to write 'The gags do not attract me,' but the truth is that they will attract you. It's impressive, right?
