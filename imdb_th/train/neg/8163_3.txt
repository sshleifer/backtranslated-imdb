I agree with everything that people say here. But I have to add that the soundtrack is probably the worst I've ever heard all my life! There is a real cry at the time you should listen to the actors. Speak! And the singing voice is like a wide version of Danzig singing "The darkness of the forest! Oh, the darkness of the dark and dark forests! " <br /> Yes, the male side is terrible. So is a woman This is one of the bad cases of gender patterns - it's terrible! Everything that they say revolves around themselves as men or women, just playing the pattern as much as possible, making me sick. Soooo boring !!! <br /> <br /> Children are ringing in the line. he And why the ghost of a girl wearing a cute little bow in a beautiful blue dress and long hair And the ghost boy always wears clean, long pants with a cute little blonde hair? <br /> <br /> Father's face is a clean and clean way than a man lives in a cave. Beautiful beard and father's face You cut the knife yourself completely, or did you walk into the city and go to the beauty salon? <br /> <br /> Stupid movies
