The fact that I do not like music is a very personal opinion, historical innocence is not I know it's opera and not a documentary. But some important issues are missing, especially if others express false opinions because of it. <br /> <br /> Abbu Abas is the mastermind of this action, which is staged And reorganize due to the discovery of ships aboard the shiph for the terrorists from 50 Israeli prisons, one of which is Samir Kuntar, the evil terrorist whose story you can find by searching for the word Abbu Abbas, responsible for other terrorist operations Although he never stepped into Achile Lauro, Ben Laden never stepped on an airplane that attacked WTC. <br /> <br /> *** The destroyer that is going <br /> <br /> Eldon film *** almost excuse the actions and reactions of terrorists. Because they may have an awful life, always stressed and exaggerated what the Israelites do to hurt them However, they never demonstrated the pain that the Palestinians had done with Israel. Movies using pictures (Scary, scary !!!) from Sabra and Chatila and nothing can be said to understand the general belief that Israel was responsible without ever mentioning that the Syrian-Les Lebanese army operated The massacre <br /> <br /> The performance in general is terrible. But I think that's what is expected of an opera singer. <br /> <br /> In another note, I was shocked that people can justify the terrorists. Killed the hostage because the hostage tried to urge 400 innocent hostages to armed terrorists and added that the person should not sympathize because he was a supporter of the Zionist ideology Imagine that his wife was an impatient man with a terrorist who shot her husband and threw his body into the sea. I hope that no one in this world is cruel like you (wink)
