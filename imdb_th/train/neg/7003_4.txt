(aka: TRINITY is still my name). This sequel seems to be done to take advantage of the success of the box office that dominated Europe in THE CALL ME TRINITY. Embassy wants to use it in America as well Unfortunately they didn't go very far, because the image of Hill / Spencer was a little successful in the United States and the most boring movie that didn't help anything. <br /> <br / > Trinity and Bambino swear by Harry Carey Jr. that they will become successful outlaws and take care of each other. After that, they were involved in arms dealers who smuggled guns from the temple and those who thought they were federal agents. Everything broke down despite two funny scenes, especially the scenes in which Trinity and Bambino were in a luxurious French restaurant and didn't know how to carry themselves. And the scene with a shark card is a little funny as well. <br /> <br /> Gene Roman's debut song sounds like Bobby Goldsboro's pop music like the 70s, early Middle Ages. Not sure if I want to buy a CD soundtrack or not, but others may <br /> <br /> This movie may take half an hour to show off and it won't be dragged for a long time. There seems to be a lot of scenery that is chewed here. In fact, I lost interest in this, about 2 / 3rds. The DVD was terrible with the constant humming sound in the soundtrack and the poor print that seems to have been sent to the great debris. In the sky <br /> <br /> Step down from the previous movie. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
