The lowest possible score is one star? That is a real shame. I will go to the IMDb lobby for the "star center" option to make this movie, even if the single star gives way too I was the only one who noticed that the microphone hung over the head of the hopper at the station or not. And acting or should I talk about lack of it? Clearly, talent is not a factor when the selection director arrives in the city. Performing special talents of my little sister's elementary school provides a wide and deep range of emotions. And those fake Irish accents are like nails on a chalk board The only thing that makes this movie worse ... Oh, wait a minute. No, it's not bad.
