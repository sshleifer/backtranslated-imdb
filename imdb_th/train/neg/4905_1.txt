I am always disappointed with the movie network. Even Flix that attracts big name actors is often destroyed by TV people. However, this is the worst of the worst. The screenplay is weak and the performance, especially the story of Tracey Pollan, is disgusting. I was cut out to see the drama of the children at high school and was treated better. Pollan behaved as if she were reading the script as she spoke. When she tries to express fear, anger or grief Due to the overall quality of production, I find it difficult to be serious. If you decide to dare to prepare for the big disappointment The scary thing will not make you scared. The sad thing doesn't make you sad. Love will not make you feel warm and fuzzy and you should be worried as I see the end. "The first person who died" spoke about this movie very much.
