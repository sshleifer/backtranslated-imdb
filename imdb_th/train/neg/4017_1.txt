Yes, this film has received a lot of attention and is considered a classic movie in the category of adult movies. Still, I don't like this one. About a woman who committed suicide in a scene that is more suitable for horror movies, she was given a chance to return to the world for a moment to live the sexual desire that she had never done before in her daily life Crappy sex scenes to follow Why are they so crappy for the people they try so hard to be the art they bring out of the actual sexual acts? I mean, we watch porn movies for sex that we can't do. Little Girls Blue did things in an artistic manner. But still has arousal and looks good Of course, the girls in it are very cute. Here we have a rather ugly lead actor and that doesn't help anything. If you find that the protagonist in your adult movie is not attractive, there is no art image that will make me enjoy the movie. The sex scenes are from yuck to strange ... I mean there are snakes in one of them. So for me, this movie failed because it didn't make me excited. But it turned out that I closed
