This film is about a family trying to understand the death of a mother / wife by moving to Genova, Italy. <br /> <br /> The plot of "Genova" sounds like a promise. Unfortunately, it is empty and lacks focus. The film contains various scenes that show the daily life of the family, such as swimming, piano lessons or egg cooking. Such scenes are mostly redundant and boring, unable to attract the full audience. The ending was very disappointing because it wasn't exciting, moving or emotional. I can tell that I'm disappointed and bored by "Genova". The only good thing about this movie is the sunny weather and the beauty of Genova. "Genova" can serve as a travel advertisement. Extended for the city But not in the form of movies
