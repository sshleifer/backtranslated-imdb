I stole this movie when I was a college student. I tried to watch three times, twice because my friend wanted to see "Cute Adam Sandler. I've never heard of this before. But because he is very funny, it must be funny "is wrong! I can't make myself look at this garbage pile after a boxing match / insulting, burning a man with a good zinger, causing the physical pain of an opponent. You will think that the scary comedy that hurt you is ridiculous. But after watching, you will know that it's true. This movie is not worth the price I paid. I have watched a movie about Steven Segal many times and I watched Crossroads twice ... but I still can't see it.
