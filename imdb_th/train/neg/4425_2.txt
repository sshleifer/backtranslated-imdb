Movies about Harlem Renaissance and a particular author It conflicts with modern stories about young black gay artists. <br /> <br /> If that sounds vague, that's because the movie itself. It's well directed, well written, and (mostly) good people. The scenes in the past were taken with black and white emotions. It is also one of the few films related to gay men who are not shy from the sex scene. (Not clear and without a forehead) but even then I hate this mostly I thought to leave the theater three times because I was bored most. But the director was there, so I stayed. <br /> <br /> His talk shows that this is a work of love and takes 6 years to complete. I hope I will like this more (There are a few movies about black gay) but I can't. If you are not interested in Harlem Renaissance, there is no reason to see this.
