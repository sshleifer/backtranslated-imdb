I didn't bother with making movies because I was bored. I thought I was going through. I was watching in a movie theater and I and my friends were just so tired. 2 minutes of that movie again, I thought I would shoot myself ... and I knew that the whole movie because my friend told me what had happened at the end and I was not surprised at it. The mean, who does not recognize her. I'm going to do the right thing and let him be happy. I mean, in reality, you have to be a complete idiot to not know. I know I didn't miss anything and if someone asked me to watch that movie, I would say "More than my corpse"
