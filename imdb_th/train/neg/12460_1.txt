We gave up at the point where George Clooney's character extracted his finger nails. We're not nauseous - when sitting through this one hour wave, we just know how it feels. To say that this movie is difficult to understand, boring, and pretending to be tweets will receive too much praise! How do people manage to sit in the corner of this movie that is confusing, slow and depressing? Clooney doesn't look as good as we feel watching him. What are they thinking? Oh .. and what are those narratives? - We just have a DVD, watch it, or is it a traditional movie that does that - a sentence hanging in the air? This movie is hard enough to follow without as well. I pity the actors, which obviously they do best with the materials provided.
