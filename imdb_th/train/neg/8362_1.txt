This is a very bad movie. I crushed my brain and couldn't get a positive opinion. The performance is bad. I see more reliable performances in cable access. Nonsense story The stolen diamond, the secret presidential record and the shark that attacks everything that comes close to it should create the most fun. Shark night is not bad. The conversation grew and was sent as if it had been written a second before filming. And beyond that, the Night of the Sharks also has the worst soundtrack I have ever heard. I was surprised that my ears didn't have blood flowing out of the 80s synthesizer that someone cares about to save. <br /> <br /> From everything I read Sharks are like nailing the last nail in the coffin.
