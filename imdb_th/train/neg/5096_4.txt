Kurt Russell (as Steven Post) worked as a child, sending a letter to fight with the UBC television station (ie United Broadcasting Corporation); Where did he go to work? He offered a ridiculous project, such as "Doctor's Dog of Abraham Lincoln" to studio executives because Lincoln Medical and Dogs were popular. Programming director Joe Flynn (as Francis X. Wilbanks) cleverly rejected Mr. Russell's proposal, but had no idea how to choose a popular TV program. His secretary, Heather North (as Jennifer Scott), who acts twice as Russell's girlfriend, has a chimpanzee who is out of Russell when he wants to watch TV. It turns out that monkeys see all popular programs and can easily choose popular songs. Russell discovered the talents of chimpanzees and used him to develop his own career. Can understand that things get HAIRY for Russell and the actors! <br /> <br /> Keep a look at the chimpanzees (managed by Frank Lamping). Work well; Raffles will look boring and / or distracted in certain scenes when chimpanzees should be interested. These things can be solved by reusing or editing. With a soft satirical edge - think of buying a hit TV show of monkeys! And it's a monkey that gets beer during the ad (Drinking in Disney movies)! Looking through the actors will reveal a fun TV actor to remember and try to place. You can create a drinking game in honor of drinking beer, drinking of raffles by guessing the actors and that you've seen them before. This is the beginning - Hey, that's not "Dr. Lung" from "I dream of Jeannie", right? Hatch down! <br /> <br /> **** Barefoot executives (1971) Robert Butler ~ Kurt Russell, Joe Flynn, John Ritter
