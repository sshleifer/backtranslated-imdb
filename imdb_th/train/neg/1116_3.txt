This film appears to be a professional training exercise for the Coppola family. It seems that I do not know whether it is "A" or "B" in the west. I mean the hero called Hopalong Cassidy for the benefit of God. William Boyd must spin in his grave. <br /> <br /> All western cliches "B" are here. Two heroes with pearl teeth in a white hat along with a trustworthy horse ("C'mon Thunder"). All black bearded villains, the heroine are in trouble, the sheriff, the sheriff, the coward, the bad guy, etc. < br /> <br /> The performance, with a few exceptions from the school, shows Yakima Canutt, Chris Lybbert (Who?) as a hero and Louis Schweibert (Who?) as the villain that looks like they are home. This in the 30s of row poverty In addition to the experienced actors Martin Sheen, Robert Carradine, Clu Gulager and Will Hutchins, little help, but they didn't get enough to save this one. <br /> <br / > What is the purpose of Martin Sheen / Robert Carradine's framing order? Do we have to believe that the Sheen character is a ghost? What is the purpose of black gloves? It doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> As a great lover of westerners of all types, I try hard to find the redemption properties in this movie. The movie shooting is quite good and the settings look very realistic. In addition to the main heroes and villains, other characters look real. <br /> <br /> If the producers will revive the drama, Hopalong Cassidy, they may give him the idea of ​​drawing him while he writes the original. - The ranch's hands were frustrated with gray chips on his shoulder. The kind of part that Lee Marvin had to excel in <br /> <br /> What I can say, but .. in Thunder and big friends.
