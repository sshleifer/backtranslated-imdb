I do not believe when I see the Calvin Kline-esque ad for the first time, but I think I'll give you a chance. So I watched it and everything I could say was bleak. This movie is terrible. It's rare that I hate this movie a lot. Watching this flick reminds me of those funny scenes in Altman's "The Player" when the author expresses their bizarre comments to the producer. I want to know which MTV producer decides that Bronte's music video is for an hour and a half. (But this time Heathcliff's name is Heath and he is a rock star and the name Hindley is Hendrix) is a good idea. <br /> <br /> Although it may not be bad if they don't get all aspects. Of this movie Direction must be "You are lonely, lonely for me." I laughed out loud in the "serious" scene and was constantly bored. The camera work was rough and reminded me repeatedly that I was watching a bad movie trying to be frustrated. My theory is that people who are bored of noise and go down to the beach to drink a few beers and boom - all I hear in half of the scene is waves and in other scenes, I hope that's all I hear. And when talking about the sound of what they did with the "More" song of the Sisters of Mercy was absolutely inexcusable. Then again, it was a pardon as they did with Bronte. Bright - especially the moment Johnny Whitworth licks Katherine Heigl's face and if you can tell if that scene is related to the rest of the more power for you or not.
