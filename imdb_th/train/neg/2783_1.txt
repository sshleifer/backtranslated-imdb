I visited one of my relatives while coming back and we popped by the theater. So we thought we would go and let this movie go. What a mistake! This movie is scary in every department. I have never heard of this before and actually everyone hasn't It is not surprising that this is the ranking received. It's a joke, so it says that the only thing that is funny is the ability or lack of director to create this movie. Approaching Christmas, this should be a way to cook turkey in less than an hour and a half - or how long while I walk away. At the end of the movie, you will feel as if you have been poisoned in turkeys that are sick and regret that you have wasted time on raising children. Who knows why these things happened? Some people walked out of the theater before the film ended and I blamed myself for not going anywhere earlier. It really makes me annoyed that you pay to see good things and everything you come out and watch as a poor TV movie that should be screened at 2 o'clock in reality. It's really bad. Don't show it. Anything that can be said ... may be a word that is not good enough to cause justice.
