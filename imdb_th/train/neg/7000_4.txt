Hollywood, the source of glamor, temptation and profit, is ruled by spiritual values, so it's not surprising that the effort to investigate spiritual life is slim and stupid. (Better to go beyond - with the movies of Bresson, Dreyer, Rossellini and Bergman for proof of spiritual images) "Strange goods" are no exception.

That the image of prudence and salvation will work to match Verne (Clark Gable, with his most courtesy and self about) and Julie (Joan Crawford, roaring and spitting out every other word in an attempt to be The best laugh This is the patron saint of the star system at work, matching the egos of war before sending them to criminal punishment against MGM... There is a good performance here and a visually appealing moment: the camp Shadowy soldier The ship that is fleeing from the moonlight or continuing with the dark sky Julie walks along the sea while the wind blows. Julie and Monsieur Pig (Peter Lorraine) talks to Verne's freedom while the storm is forming. The romance of a gay prison that has been unusually increased between the two prisoners.

Back to him During the most remarkable time in this film, Hessler from Cambreau stood outside the cabin. We heard the sound of the wind passing through the forest, watching the shadow on his face, which conveyed the moment of fear and self-doubt. Then he went out at night. During this time, Hessler succeeded in ambiguity, depth and existence, with no other characters to succeed. Is the secret of the film that is deeply sympathetic to its allies with Hessler?
