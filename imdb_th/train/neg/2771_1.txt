This film will be shown here in Bangkok with fanfare and even in theaters. But it failed miserably. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the author of the story doesn't just hold water. There is something missing. In my opinion, people must have a reason why they watch it, in addition to glimpse the history of the past. The accuracy of history is not what we look for in entertainment. <br /> <br /> Movies just don't have any content. The only way to make this movie is to make some changes as some myths instead. Is just a story And the legend will have some elements that try to tell you something that people forget forever, such as the meaning of sacrifice, nationalism, etc. It is called the main theme. <br /> <br /> The film failed to Answer Why would I watch it? <br /> <br /> At least some legendary flying elephants, elephants, psychic kings or unusual kings such as "The King and Me" are cute. Some things will increase dramatically. To attract movies I guess there will be no other attraction except ordinary vanilla movies. <br /> <br /> When you receive an appeal, the story is the next thing we focus on. In terms of marketing, we call it "must see" when hearing the name of the movie that people will say. Oh, I have to watch. Where is the appeal in the Kingmaker? Why not just repeat the name and call it "How can I not be a king?" And create a black comedy in the ancient Siamese era according to the style of "Dr. Stregol". That would be more interesting. An experience similar to the story of the king's weakness from the first person who makes mistakes will make the most funny movies. <br /> <br /> Most movies today have the words "must see". Appeals like Spiderman , Men X, these names speak by themselves If they do not have familiar characters, other movies such as The Island have an appeal. "Do you still believe that there is an island?" <br /> <br /> Or for the movie retitled "Why isn't a king?" May ask the question "So you still want to be a king?" <br /> <br /> Parhat
