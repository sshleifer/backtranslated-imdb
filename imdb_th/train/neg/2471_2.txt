I remember when I was still at the camp and we set up a camp under the stars. There will always be someone there who will have a good story to tell about the forest that surrounds us and they will crawl me away. When I meet Wendigo at the library, I try to see it. Hope to be one. In movies with supernatural things that haunt the people of the forest, like the story told at the camp Very good to my fear, I'm still far from the truth. Wendy isn't really good. The story begins when three families drive to their winter hut, which looks like your usual suburban house and nothing like a hut in the forest and they run into the deer. It seems that local strangers are hunting this deer and being angry at our people. The movie takes too long to track the daily activities of the family instead of going to the point of the movie. Until about 15 minutes ago, we had some actions about "Venigo". My advice is that you are very far away in this movie. It will make you want your second half hour.
