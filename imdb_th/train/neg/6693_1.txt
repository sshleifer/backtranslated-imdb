Escape from this movie Even according to the standard B-movie, this movie is scary. It is also insidious in its form. The main issue is people who reject society and don't respect anything that is cool and admirable. People who treat others with respect as losers The state does not work as it used to be in this movie, etc. Watching this movie makes you know why writers use bored words. Mija is a completely sympathetic drinker who is not living Terrible However, she is a terrible person that the audience cannot identify by herself. <br /> <br /> There is usually no one thing that movies can recommend for use in this case. It is a ridiculous movie that is insulting to those who try to identify the main characters. The performance is sufficient to meet the standard of the movie B and the direction is nothing new or interesting.
