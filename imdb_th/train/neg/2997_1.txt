This was a retrospective filming with the rebuilding in 1992 of Conan Doyle's famous novel 'The Lost World'. And it shows <br /> <br /> The film begins well enough with a brutal organization that intends to take advantage of the lost world and Challenger et al back to protect the prehistoric plateau. Everyone is stuck on the plateau and we are left with a boring and boring film style. Long films. <br /> <br /> Dinosaurs (which almost never saw before) are ridiculous. Do we expect to use cuddly toys that should be seriously anarchists? And it seems that the tyrannosaur is already rooted. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favorite and join the peaceful world of 1925. Unbelievable in the era of CGI and advanced effects. Other, this twenty model is the best and will remain until someone decides to do the right thing.
