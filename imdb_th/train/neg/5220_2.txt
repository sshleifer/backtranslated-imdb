A young basketball genius professor is conducting research on genetic sequences using human embryos. He hopes to be able to find a cure for all diseases and age. He pressured to summarize his research because he did not publish, so the university had trouble finding funds to support him (I think). <br /> <br /> He injected a test on the monkey that died quickly. Then he tried himself. He started a relationship with the only mother of a very annoying little boy. She is the one who demands results from research. <br /> <br /> At first, he seems to have no effect from injections except some new strength. Then he realized that he had amnesia and began to think of what had happened. In addition, he began to appear very unhealthy. <br /> <br /> Since the film was eventually changed, he changed to something else. You will not believe your eyes - whether he becomes anything or a crappy dress like the actors wear to describe what he became. Unbelievably, there are more changes in the store - at the end of the movie, it's really ridiculous. <br /> <br /> About the only thing this movie will do for it is Laura Gemser is there. She has a very small part. <br /> <br /> One time I saw a video box for this story with a plastic pattern carved next to the box. It may be possible that there may be electronic devices at the same time. (The eyes of the main characters turn green in the movie from time to time.) The copy I watched has a box with torn marks on the glue sticking on the plastic that was removed. The new box, if it still exists, will be the only reason I will arrange for this movie. I will definitely get rid of it.
