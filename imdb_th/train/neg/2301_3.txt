Does anyone think that this program helps some people or people who are angry? When I flipped the box and came to this program, I was half careful with unusual curiosity. I understand that Pat Roberson is not together. What I don't know is if his audience is like him or if they are good people and think that they will have a better life if they listen to what they say. Pat Roberson has little effect. He is an old man who thinks in the old fashion. Fear of curse has no effect as he did again. (Thank God) Now, if someone will please answer my question, I will dodge lightning bolt for the rest of eternity.
