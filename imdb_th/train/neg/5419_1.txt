Why do filmmakers always resist the author's work? I mean, yes, things must be shortened for the benefit of the audience, but look at the Anne of Green Gables. I can't believe that they chose to combine the three novels so that the Anne of Avonlea became a terrifying story. See what they missed by doing that ... Paul Irving, Little Elizabeth, Widow, Lindy Poplar .. and Anne's College Year for the benefit of heaven !!! Wouldn't it be a pleasure to meet Priscilla and other Redmond groups? Kevin Sullivan should shoot one thing at a time instead of confusing them and combining the characters and events that he did. This movie is good if you let the novel come out of it !! But the beautiful work of ML Montgomery is something that should not be denied. This film was disappointed after seeing his success in defeating Anne of Green Gables for life.
