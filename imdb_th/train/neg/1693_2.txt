My husband and I went to watch this movie which is a horror movie that we are. Two hours later, I found myself wanting money and time back. I'm very disappointed Teaser for this film generally has the best point of this film. There is nothing very scary about other movies other than good times for surprises, entrances, etc. I find that the scary part is funny. After watching other films from the works of Japanese writers, I have to conclude that the horrible things in Japan are not terrible in the United States. My advice: If you're a fan of horror movies, really help yourself to the pain of watching this movie. I can't say that I would recommend renting either unless you have a free rent to come to you.
