By the number of Kid (Prince) figures, the singer is traveling to become a star. He then fell in love with Apollonia (Appolonia Kotero) but he had to deal with his wife's father. (Clarence Williams III!) And his own self-destructive behavior. <br /> <br /> I saw this in the cinema in 1984. I'm not a big fan of the Prince, but I like music. Three songs from this movie - "Purple Rain", "Let's Get Crazy" and "When Doves Cry". The concert scene in this film is fantastic, full of energy and excitement. Unfortunately it is a small part of the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is very clear and has been done many times - and it's better as well. The sub-plan is well managed. The love triangle between The Kid, Appolonia and Morris Day is predictable and is really exhausting. His wife is bashing father, is necessary for the story. But the scene was poorly managed (In acting and navigation) I can't believe it. The script is a terrible dialogue and truly "funny" routines. And there is a lot of hatred for women here - the mother of The Thinking flogged; Appolonia children and (without reason) Appolonia strips and topless to swim in dirty rivers In addition, the character of Williams and the prince still treats women horribly all the time. <br /> <br /> The performance is where the film really failed. Appolonia is sweet and beautiful - but no. actor And the Prince is the worst actor I have ever seen His empty face and the wooden dialogue were terrible. I couldn't believe it. This movie is alive during the concert only. But there are not many scenes that are "breathtaking" that have been treated and dealt so badly that the film is boring to sit and watch. They should make this movie as a concert. I give this one 2 - for music only.
