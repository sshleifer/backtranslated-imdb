It's a pretend and stupid perception. Brutal conversations and conversations and truly embarrassing performances The movie is worse than I have ever seen. (At the cinema) Nothing in my opinion recorded this movie from all disasters. I saw it when it came out in the cinema in Brighton. People are walking out and there are more people talking outside of the toilet in the auditorium! At the end, there was a lot of cheers and disdain from the crowd, which was quite sad because one of the main actors' relatives appeared and looked shy. However, this movie is so bad that I cannot feel sympathy for them. Everyone had to start somewhere and their son started his acting career with a truly terrifying effort that 5 years have passed, but sometimes I still cringe in the memories of a sad night In the movie! This is a movie that has no redemption feature! I give 1 because 0 is not available. They should invent 'shameometer' for everyone involved in this film I know that some of them move to better things. The good thing is that no one can sink.
