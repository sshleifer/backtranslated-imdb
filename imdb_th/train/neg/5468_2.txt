I like the 'Toxic Avenger' series, but the weak presentation of the people in Troma is not reasonable and it makes me yawn all the time. The weeds that are next to each other) make the children of the Tromaville High go nuts, which make them join the gang with sex, explosions and whatever. There is also a breeding of monsters in high school ... My God, this movie is messy. <br /> <br /> Actors stop their efforts after this and they should Doing too much (intentionally) starts to get on my nerves in about 5 minutes ... <br /> <br /> Disappointing 2/10
