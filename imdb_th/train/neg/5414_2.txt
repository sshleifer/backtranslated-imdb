This film is a big step for popular fare by Bollywood. The performance is very scary, even Boman Irani, who is always shining. The soundtrack is not memorable as well. And even trying hard But the actress is not sexy. Vivek Oberoi has a much better project ability, while Fardeen Khan seems to be stuck in similar fares right now. But what is surprising is his limited ability as an actor. Esha Deol and Amrita Rao are horrible people in bad poetry. It's time for Indra Kumar to put on his director's hat. Hope that he will not make eye contact like this again The future of Hindi movies is in better hands now. To summarize away from celluloid waste
