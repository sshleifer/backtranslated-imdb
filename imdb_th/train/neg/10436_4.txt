The 1930s saw the trend of documentary films about the distant corners of the world, focusing on wildlife, exotic landscapes and traditional people with strange cultures. Despite the logistics of transporting film crews to distant and dangerous places and then bringing them back to life (With pictures from movies) Such movies are often much cheaper compared to the general features of Hollywood ... High-end costumes or movie stars. <br /> <br /> The most successful filmmakers. (Art and Finance) is a team of Martin E. Johnson and his wife Osa, who have made many documentaries (sometimes with blatant incidents) in Africa and Asia. The Johnsons safari movie has gained a lot of popularity, inspiring the parody of many ... Wheeler & Woolsey's most eye-catching "So This is Africa" ​​which Esther Muir sexy. Although many other filmmakers are producing safari documentaries at this time, Johnson's films are the most popular in this genre, because they rely heavily on humor. Watching from our more enlightened standpoint (I hope) This is a serious flaw in Johnsons documentary: There are many scenes in which people brown or yellow, funny, stupid, smart, clever, indifferent to white wise people. bwana johnson and his wife <br /> <br /> One thing that is clear about these movies is that Osa Johnson's presence is ten years younger than her husband. She is able to watch enough children to Is his daughter While Esther Johnson is not as interesting as Esther, the blond hair is in good shape. But it is a dark brown hair that shows the performance in front of the camera in every movie that she starred with her husband. <br /> <br /> 'Congorilla' is probably Johnson's best movie. The image of Congo is interesting and has historical value as evidence that this environment looks like in 1930. The images of Pygmies and other indigenous people are also interesting, although these things suffer from Johnson's inclination. About events in a manner that Make the natives look 'wild' and aliens. <br /> <br /> The best scenes. (And the most fun) in 'Congorilla' is an unresolved scene where Osa Johnson tries to teach jazz dance to some Pygmy women (dance is a little black butt ... dancing like the same as Bob Baking Hope, known to Daisy and Violet Hilton, the famous twin twins), wearing jodhpurs, boots and helmets. She followed the high steps and slapped her knees in an attempt to teach this dance to African women. At the same time, they stood at her and wondered if this white woman was trying to accomplish it. It is a very funny scene, but it has unwanted undertones. Osa Johnson is a dance that was invented by American blacks: meaning it seems that African blacks should be able to perform this dance after the demonstration. Short (using natural rhythm, I guess) because it is in their blood. <br /> <br /> I will give 'Congorilla' 4 points out of 10. This film discusses African life. In the 1930s Iron and rather less about cultural perceptions of America in the same decade.
