Another movie about a character that is self-tortured, arrogant, not hateful, self-destructive, that we should pay attention. <br /> <br /> Don't understand. For all types The movie The Wall, which has a leading character, is a very devastating character. What I oppose about this is that there is a little background with this man. Why does this man hate himself and the world? If the script handles more of these things, they may be able to manipulate him. Because he just came out as a character that shows offensive hate, not sad and hateful. <br /> <br /> After trying hard to make this guy crazy and anti-social The most and make his fate gloomy The possibility that the writer will have the nerve to make the ending happy .... <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I've ever seen. But it is a good fight! male! do not waste time
