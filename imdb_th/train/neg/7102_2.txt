OK, I agree that I watched this movie on the Mystery Science Theater 3000 (which I am a big fan of) but I am not one of those people who automatically rate the MST3K movie 1/10. They play and some of them are the worst movies I've ever seen. But I was able to enjoy the MST3K movie that was said to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. (Not surprisingly, the writer MST3K commented that this is one of the worst things. Don't believe me. Try to see their website.) <br /> <br /> For me, this movie is A good example of things that shouldn't be done in creating a movie. The conversation is terrible. The acting is worse. The movie is pathetic in the direction. (While perhaps the best thing in this movie) is not good. <br /> <br /> The rhythm is the worst part of the movie. A few times in this movie, the audience had to wait for a minute to make something happen. While minutes may not sound like a long time But in this film, especially in I'm sure it means creating emotions. But i'm very bored It really feels like ten minutes. <br /> <br /> If "disbelief" means "sleeping almost between movies", that means there are many. But the screaming skull was so scary that there was no way I would be interested in what actually happened in the movie and therefore <br /> <br> One of the worst movies and probably the most boring movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1/10
