Freddy's Dead: Final Nightmare, the sixth episode of Nightmare in the Elm Street series and is a bad sequel. I think it's related to the last part of Dream Child. I'm lucky enough to get the Nightmare from the DVD set of Elm Street on my birthday so I can see all the sequel. Can I say that I feel more and more disappointed, even though there are at least two of these sequels that seem to have lost his ability? It's almost like the writer tried to give Freddy's spirit and they just destroyed it instead of creating a new story. This is a sequel that does not need to apologize to Robert Englund, but this is lower than what Freddy Krueger shows instead. <br /> <br /> Freddy is back, but he has something we don't know. He is her father But soon she found out what his dark secret was and he needed help from her. She must do her best to resist his power. But it was difficult with all the good memories she had for her beloved father Ironically, right? But Freddie doesn't give up if he doesn't interfere with her. <br /> <br /> Freddy's Dead: Nightmare is finally presented in 3-D, radical, huh? Note of friction This is one of the worst sequels. It is linked to the fifth sequel of Nightmare in the Elm Street series. I should watch the second Nightmare on Elm Street for honesty. This story has bad performances, stupid fixes and a bad idea for the story. I don't like the concept of it, and it destroys all the ideas that Freddie Krueger is the master of bad dreams, not the father knows best. <br /> <br /> 2/10
