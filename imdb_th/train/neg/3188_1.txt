Joe Don's opening line speaks everything about this movie. It happened on Malta. (The Island of Pathetic Man) and associated with Joe Don Baker. Follow the Italian gangster. The character of Joe Don is called Geronimo (pronounced Heronimo) and what he does in this film is to shoot people and be arrested repeatedly. Tell Everyone in the movie hates him like everyone hates Greydon Clark. I liked the Greydon image earlier "Angel's Revenge" because it was a shirt for a year old boy who was excited. Avoid this movie at all costs !!
