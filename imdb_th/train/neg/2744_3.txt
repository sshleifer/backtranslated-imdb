I'm bored about 22.00 hrs. So I watched this movie. And I can't stop laughing Everything is very ridiculous. The way children behave like they are over 11 years old just makes me crack. One child had a ring that would kill people after 3 years or more. It makes me feel like he wants to be a gangster. <br /> <br /> It's hard to take a little kid seriously, especially when it's about eating worms. They act like everything is a big deal, like if Billy (Main character) not eating worms, then the world will end Want to waste time
