This collection is terrible. <br /> <br /> I rent and think I will enjoy the fight. This guy sucks! The sudden cut, extremely annoying loudspeakers and their struggles were greatly modified and shortened. (I think, especially Jetle's fight in the fists of the legend and Jackie Chan's fights from drunkenness> <br /> And what is the deal with the street fighters! What is "cool" about that? I've seen more interesting fights about martial law. <br /> <br /> This is a silly collection for stupid people. <br /> <br /> Don't buy this movie! Do not support those who do this shit to make this shit more. <br /> <br /> But go buy a movie that the fight comes from and fight with their uncut glory!
