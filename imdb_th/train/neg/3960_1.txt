Hello, probably because I'm not a Theater Major or a complex movie watcher ... I think this movie is "Boring" and "Dumb". <br /> <br /> I rented this movie because Charles Bronson and it was the title. ... but the kids wasted time ... just watching 2 people sitting in the grave and talking ... <br /> <br /> The movies on this DVD are "dark" ... I There was a hard time watching movies. Darn ... I knew it was a movie in 1968 ... but He put it on a DVD, then they should make a model /> <br /> In addition, the new digital I <br totally surprised with. Look at the high mark of IMDb for this movie ... As I said earlier, I'm not as complicated as others who have commented on this movie before.
