This is a truly miserable little movie. The original accepted (un) Holy Trinity is controlled by the law of reducing the third reward. "The Last Conflict" has deteriorated into a ridiculous subplot about halfway through the film. It seems that people who need to die unnecessarily By now becoming the whole set of raison d'etre "prophecy", but when preparing this additional TV movie (Beware of buyers of Omen boxes that are placed on DVD. Don't be fooled by the widescreen transfer ratio. This is something that is strictly a small screen) on the back of the series. In general, the great demon chiller cannot be forgiven, especially as it was endorsed by the author, producer, and creator of the first three films on Mace Neufeld and Harvey Bernhard. Scenes other than normal death scenes (Despair decreases for TV sensibilities) and the worst performance I've ever seen. Everyone involved in this project, even if the banquet should be ashamed of this maintenance that had been done on the screen If someone believes in my opinion to avoid this mess, I will feel better.
