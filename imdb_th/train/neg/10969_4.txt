Maybe I am outdated or do not know what Electra is like in current publications ... But the Electra that I read is more distorted and seems to have a plan. She often uses other people to do dirty work and often does not have any involvement at all. Just think that you have everything you think. She pulls the fleece to your eyes and follows her way. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite weak in the conversation. I am looking for something. More along the lines of Frank Miller's book "Electra Assassin", which is much darker than this movie. <br /> <br /> Special effects that are cool, the action is sometimes interesting. The hand position is not scary enough and Electra is not bad. She is a woman you like to hate ... but in this regard, I just don't care what method
