I actually saw China O'Brien II before I saw the original China O'Brien, and I must say that the first advent is worse than before. And fun = better if you are a bad movie fan like me, this is a great material However, if you are looking for a plot that has the means of acting or movie creation skills The best part is the way they shoot all the fighting scenes in a stuttering fast. Not good fun Saw it for laughing, watching it for irrational entertainment But no matter what you do, watch for free on TV.
