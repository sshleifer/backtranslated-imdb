A painful, bad Christmas movie with equally bad performances by Vince Vaughn, which pays himself for an ordinary boy. But this time is a movie for children But without the wisdom or charm that is in his movie rating Vaughan seems to be an automatic driver. But most of this film and he still ran into the wall with his lackluster performances After 30 minutes, you will experience the inner disaster and say "Bahumbag" in this unsightly movie, and after another 30 minutes you will have to walk out to see if the film is unbearable at times. that From all the actors involved in this story, only Paul Giamatti and Rachel Weisz brought some life to a thin role in the paper's perspective and that was about men because they were too good actors. Will be shown in this film. Paul Giamatti brings depth and warmth to Saint Nick's character. But he was forced to show John's child and youth behavior when they made their sad brothers You can see in the face of Giamatti that he does not enjoy his role and it shows painfully in some parts of the movie. Rachel Weisz brings fun and spirit to her role. But in fact, she doesn't have many characters to work with, and you can see her face that she is aware of so much that she seems to be frustrated at some parts of the movie. Fortunately for her, she isn't in this movie. Very much and able to maintain his face, unlike Giamatti, who seems to be shooting his agent at the end of the movie The direction is still not interesting as there is no feeling or anything flowing, and this should be a holiday movie. But it ended up feeling as though you were staring at a torn fancy widow's screen.> <br /> I don't know what happened here. But there are only two actors involved (Giamatti and Weisz) trying their best, at least bringing something to the table with a strange script that they have to work with. Feelings on the subject at hand (And this is the Christmas movie of everything) and the actor who doesn't care about his performance (Vaughn).
