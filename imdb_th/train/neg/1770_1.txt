My wife and I both agreed that this was one of the worst movies ever made. Of course, in the top ten of those I watch all the way, at least "Plan 9" is fun. <br /> <br /> I enjoy "Christine", "The Dead Zone", "Firestarter", "Carrie". And some of his other movies, I don't care much for "Cujo" (just because of the terrible sound of the version I've seen and I often can't tell what people are saying) or "Pet Sematary (Pet Cemetery)" > <br /> But this mess is all wrong in every way possible. "Life" seems to have been designed by a 9 year old child (no offense against 9 year olds). <br /> <br /> Even "one ship" makes us lament and not Amusing from a distance
