I will not criticize the movie. There is not much to talk about. It has good animal action scenes that may be surprising at that time. Clyde Betty is not an absolute idol. He looks a little bit and doesn't look good. But it's okay He was in a lion cage. We know that when he cannot spend time away from his lion in order to tend to be his girlfriend, he will end up in an island with her and must help him all day. Someone said earlier that this is a history lesson. The circus scene is another day, especially the children hanging around. I didn't realize that even in the thirties they sailed three boats. Looks like something came out in 1860. I guess it's a stock image they have. Not surprisingly, that thing was completely destroyed. They often talk about repairing her. Even with rights It tells us a little about the relationship of women at that time. But if you are not too serious, you can enjoy it.
