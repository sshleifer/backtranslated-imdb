For me, when I graduated from the film school recently, during the time when the film New Zealand went to the top, the general public seemed to think that all films produced from New Zealand are excellent. Sione's wedding proves that this is wrong. <br /> <br /> It's completely overrated and not funny and far from the 'hilarious' movie. Other IMDb users have commented. The only funny thing I found in this movie is Derek. The black man scrambled. But other than that, the jokes that were recycled, the shit that we all had heard before. <br /> <br /> A good Samoan half I Want to see how this film will deal with Polynesian representation? It's a perfect ball - I know it's funny. But I do not feel that the character has something new to say about Polynesian's identity, although it is in the manner of a tongue cheek I was most disappointed with the ending of this film and the resolution of the character's relationship - Mikaele was a busy player just with a white woman coming to a slight turning point when 'Dusky Maiden' arrived in the city. Perhaps he should start looking for a stable relationship. Then, at the last minute he refused it and accepted his position as a Polynesian Playboy for Palaki women. I do not understand why they do this. <br /> <br /> It's all very disappointing. Everyone in my family saw that they hoped to have a good laugh. But finally felt bitter about paying to see the cinema The best jokes and performances, especially Sefa's fans, were shocked and honestly. I would be happy if I had my hands on pirated movies to help myself. The ticket price was 15 dollars. <br /> I think the only thing. The good thing that comes from the movie is that it is the second step (after number 2, of course, is a film that is superior to this story) in the origin of Polynesian cinema. I hope that future Pacific filmmakers can learn from Sione's wedding in a way that will not reflect Polynesia and have something meaningful and appropriate to say. Although it is made in a funny way
