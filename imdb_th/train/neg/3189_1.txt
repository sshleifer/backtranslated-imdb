I guess this will prove that Joe Don Baker will do everything to flirt. The concept of this film started not good. This movie has a lot of bad things about it. I don't know where to start. The performance was terrible. The movie is the best part. The soundtrack is quite bad. The score is very bad. There is a reason that this movie ended at the Mystery Science Theater 3000. I voted before I wrote this story and I can't believe that there are 9 people who think this "movie" is great They have to like two cocoa dancers. The final justice will be if they lock this problem in the movie vault outside Wichita and won't let anyone see it again! Score 1 out of 10 is better than it should be.
