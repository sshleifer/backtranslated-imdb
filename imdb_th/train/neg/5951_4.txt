Written by Great McGovern and directed by Frears, this movie is a bit disappointing. Seems too short It took too long to create the atmosphere of the Holis and laugh at the needs of Catholics. Then you have a fascist and a socialist who hijacked the interests of the family and the bad conclusion. <br /> <br /> My wife still thinks Liam is cute.
