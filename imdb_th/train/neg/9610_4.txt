In Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s, I think every studio can cook western food except Warner Bra. A few times they always tried it ridiculous. (Except maybe for them to die with their boots - which is a Western cavalry) I read that Humphrey Bogart caught James Cagney with a large cowboy hat on his head He looks like a true mushroom! Cagney and Bogart are more urban people than XXe century to believe in Western movies. The story here is no surprise and it doesn't help every 10 minutes. I think I saw Bogart and Cagney drop their small guns and catch a machine gun to escape from a black tank in 1930.
