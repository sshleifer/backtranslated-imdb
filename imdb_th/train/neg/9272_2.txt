Recently, I decided to revisit Omen's trilogy just to discover that {Insert the demon song here} There is a quarter. I don't expect much from it, and in that sense it lives according to my expectations. If you are watching a movie that is not good for laughing then this may be the movie for you. Oh, where do we start from? <br /> <br /> From the beginning, the image "Built for TV" of the movie is clear. The songs are often incompatible with what is happening in the movie so improperly. (Best) to distract Scripts have doubts about the 8-year-old novel, but one thing to say is that the missing script works well with the horrifying performance. Many scenes make me think of it as a script or performance that causes nonsense. <br /> <br /> The story itself is quite thin, centered on the crazy comedy of Damien's daughter. Thorn by the nun doing wrong and behaving badly There are a lot of deaths, mysteries and complexities that make me yawn as "drama" unfolds and the usual third-party detective on the whole story. Later, from some medical phenomena, Damien Thorn was born and that was the plot. The whole thing was executed quite badly from the beginning due to lack of doubt, making this movie a boring and / or ridiculous scene. After that, <br /> <br /> Do you have many WTFs ?! Too many moments that help to relieve unintended comedy For example, what was the big reaction at the beginning of the movie when the baby scratched the mother's cheek? Premonition revolves 360 degrees. Almost, I laugh at the response that was baptized with. The child cried and everyone looked very worried. The suffering mother ran out of the church and the priest was left to look panicked while crossing himself. Then there is a new generation of mentors who seem to have a list of sequences to reveal 8 year old children to all types of demonic creeds. I laughed when the mentor advised Delia to have a problem at the spirit fair to meet the hippie friend of the nanny and the mother just shrugged and allowed it. With all my problems with this magic thing, it's really cool. I don't need to be there. "Of course, this happens from a mother who allowed her daughter to use Rottweil. The mature er that they find on the street that can bite the little girl. All the scenes in the psychic show are quite funny, in the way that the blacksmith from the horror horror psychics reaction to Delia to hell <br /> <br /> I also laughed that "Weird accident" Here we have religious enthusiasm. (Which has been described as part of a religious cult) who preached like crazy in a hole full of rattlesnakes to prove how the glory of God will protect them She made the enemy into a snake by manipulating them and some people were bitten by a snake many times. The accident is almost distorted. More like successful suicide attempts. <br /> <br /> Snakes - vs - Nuns are not funny. There is a low speed car accident causing the loss of parking in the school. Then there was a slow demolition ball that headed to the detective. I believe I might go and make coffee when the slow motion begins, only to come back to see the demolition ball, still heading straight to the "worrying" detective. Then there is the quintessential who shot - who thought of the ancient gun Go out and both act as if they were shot for several seconds while exchanging horrible sight Then someone fell down the stairs, revealing who was the true victim. In addition, the death of a priest at the beginning of the movie looks strange and useless for me. He runs around to see the architecture of the church. It is clear that this discovery caused him to suffer. He eventually collapsed and caught his chest and died. Obviously, something like the devil is going on like this is what the song suggests. Hmmm. OK. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that others criticized the film in a positive and particular way. Even as "Worthy sequel" is difficult to not notice a chapter that is not sensitive to feelings, unrealistic performances, and improper music scores. The movie lacks any suspicion, relying heavily on Delia's "staring devil" to give horror that becomes annoying after a short time. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: This is a bad movie that has only one exchange feature because it is Unintended movie
