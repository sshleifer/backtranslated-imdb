If ever there is a movie that deserves a high zero fat rating, it is a shit pile. I love movies, zombies and even the bad guys often have something going on for them. But not this cruelty > No plot and no plot is cut With sadism and slap scenes People do not respond, act or in any way similar to humans. All movies were filmed in two rooms that were improperly decorated to look like the place they should be. The whole thing is a pointless thing, either. It doesn't go anywhere. And when zombies finally see the garbage and do nothing You can be a person who has never seen a movie before. It's pathetic and no doubt it's the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> Actually it's the worst movie of all time. You will know by the way that this only positive comment is 10/10 and asks you to buy a DVD. I can't imagine that anyone who is neutral thinks this is a good movie. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> 0/10 And that's generous.
