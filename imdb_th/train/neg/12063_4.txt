The husband and wife team of Bennie Fields and Blossom Seeley are big stars in the song. But they created very few movies Like the case of other actors in their era (George M. Cohan, Fanny Brice, Gertrude Lawrence). The most easily accessible movie piece for Fields and Seeley is a biography about them. Which they performed by other actors, 'Somebody Loves Me', starring Betty Hutton and Ralph Meeker, an impersonal songwriter and dance <br /> <br /> in their heyday. Fields and Seeley is overwhelmingly popular - Jessie Block Eve Sulli - almost as successful as an actor, performing almost the same action effectively, becoming the "second team" and Seeley fields, although the stage has a significant difference in the management of a couple's life. Fields and Seeley live in the hotel suites by paying room service fees for every meal they eat and eventually lose money. Block and Sully live politely and invest in income like Major clever ending with retirement /> <br /> comfortable 30 seconds of the first <br a Vitaphone short, this is occupied by a pianist who wear two. Obviously, these two men had their own little name in the 1930s, although I never heard them. Finally, the field and rushed in and started the show. They both had a lot of courage and she was quite attractive. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed that the two actors were constantly moving as if they were dancing as dancers. Three songs that they performed in this short period of time. Finally, when they started hoofing, the results were not impressive. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to have the opportunity to see these two important actors show their attitude. Now that I have seen, I understand why they have never starred in musicals. My rating for this list: only 4 out of 10 and I'll stick with Block and Sully
