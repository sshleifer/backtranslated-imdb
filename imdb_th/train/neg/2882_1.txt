This movie is the biggest steaming piece that you know where it came from and grew up in Wichita Kansas. I know that 90% of this movie is Bogus. In addition to the names of the victims, there is nothing else right. The movie seems to have been created with Father's portable camera. It has videos that I believe come from other movies, along with stock footage from slaughterhouses. I always enjoy watching movies that are not good for fun. But due to poor performances, badly prepared scenes or absences and boring and very short endings, it is struggling to watch through the ending I suggest that you do not waste money on this movie, otherwise you will have to regret the crunch.
