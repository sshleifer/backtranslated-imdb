I watched this movie for two hours and didn't know what it was about. Someone is killed or maybe they can't, and maybe someone has done it or maybe they can't. This brings back memories of the good old days (bad old days?) When all CBC Canadian films have a bad smell. Recently, the smelly person was excluded. But this caused confusion in feminist claims, an era in which anxious mind and mumbling wasted time I have never met Margaret Atwood's book that is easy to read. This movie still maintains a good Canadian tradition. It doesn't seem easy at all. Perhaps the trendy people at the Chi Chi Chi Toronto cocktail party will pretend that they like it. Those of us in the forest are people who are not polite.
