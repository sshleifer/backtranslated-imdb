I enjoy this movie mostly. But I still feel that I am watching a child movie I sincerely thought that someone wrote the pg script. Then while filming, decided to add blood, nudity and language. It's a big deal There is a belief that magic children exist in movies such as "baby" (pig) or "angels in the field" that defeat evil tooth fairies Finally, parents believe that their daughter is about the ability to see ghosts and use this skill to defeat the tooth fairy. When I bought this movie, I thought it would be a response to the movie. Somehow manage to create a better movie with 1/4 of the money, but they don't. They make movies that are worse and may lose the same money when they are in the dark.
