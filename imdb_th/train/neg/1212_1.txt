Overall, this movie is scary and should not be done. One of the problems of this movie is that there is no link to the audience and the characters. For example, if you are going to be attacked, you want to feel "Oh My God, No!" But you don't. In this case you don't care because there is no Link to know the characters In the example, it looks as if this movie is excellent. But there is no doubt that it will be There may be some mystery, but there is no "she has just a tool box". There is a speech on the back of the DVD. You will think that it is carefully planned. Film and do it wisely. But it's not the end, it's scary, straight forward, and pointless. Performances may be average or below average or may be lower. In my opinion, it wasted an hour in my life. "Special effects" and the scene is also normal, nothing special. There is not much blood or blood violence, no blood. This movie is advertised so it sounds quite amazing. But actually it's not worth looking at. I don't recommend this to anyone except that they are easily satisfied by a few battles and boring stories.
