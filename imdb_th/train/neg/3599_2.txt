Hmm .. I was quite surprised that someone gave a really high score. <br /> <br /> Let him face ... Tori Spelling is not a great actress .. and this film proves her talent " "The story of the movie is weak ... I bet that what happened to this concept is that Tom peeked in the wrong way. If there is something good about this movie, I will say that it is Tommy Chong's daughter just because of the fact that she is his daughter ... and then there are male leaders. Soap-Opera-ish Which looks quite good, makes him interesting But stop to help his tremendous ability. * Why IMDb needs at least 10 lines, you can say "How bad is this movie?"
