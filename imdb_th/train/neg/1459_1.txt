This is the most boring and scary story of Adolf Hitler's early days that I have ever seen. Robert Carlyle is a great actor. But to show him that Hitler is unusual In the selection of Liev Schrieber as Hitler's friend and aid, Haefengstal must cry out of despair and anguish from the center. Simon Wiesenthal J-W plays as a Nazi supporter. This is not a fun family movie with a good historical background. This is the best garbage in Hollywood, looking for strong support from the actors. (But was used very much) supporting the actors who seem to have disappeared from the radar show in the past 5 years. <br /> <br /> Fake German accents (vee vill vin zis var) insulting German people everywhere My mother is a German and she listens to the sounds that change from American / English / German in the same sentence. A supporting actor made the cardboard cutout at a local video store better than on the screen. Jenna Malone as Geli Raubal, the lucky winner, caught the innocence and confusion of a tragic girl who ended her life. To escape what her future would be like the shadow of Hitler. <br /> <br /> If you want a wonderful and accurate story in Hitler's history in the early years that led to and W Reaching the War / Holocaust for Rent "Inside the Third Reich" 1983, performed by Rutger Hauer as Albert Speer and Derek Jacobi as Hitler. It is a good and more rational story. /> As a historical researcher of the Third Reich, I can tell you honestly. This gives me access to my books to confirm many inaccuracies.
