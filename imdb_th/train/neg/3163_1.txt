This is the first post I commented on IMDb. Do you understand this movie that made me come and remind everyone of the good spirits that will stop experimenting with movies <br /> <br /> Most of them Gave their opinion, I thought to watch this movie because it seems that there are appropriate actors (Even though reading the worst review of this movie) I think the experiment is assuming that it is a funny movie, flick .., the actor ... then everything starts to be pathetic. .. The person you believe in yourself, you wud feel like going and fighting your head every time a woman who looks pathetic, called the heroine of the movie helpless .. Huh ~~ People who can digest sick people How many witches can POSSESSIVE A ghost that tries to do everything she can to make you annoy and stop you from what you are doing. <br /> <br /> The next worst thing about This movie is "ZOMBIE" Hero. Yes, while he loses his fianc√©, he travels around like a goat with your black mark. His eyes and with the sister of the "foolish" hero .. You wud be blood from head to toe if you try and succeed by watching this movie completely ~!
