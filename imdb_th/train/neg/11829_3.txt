I walked into this movie after watching the night "Borat" 82 minutes and was quite disappointed. I am a big fan of Wallace and Gromit and regularly watch animated movies. Being said that I found myself nodding off and at one point almost walked away But still waiting for this film to improve <br /> <br /> The image is beautiful and the sound is great, especially in my thoughts. Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen (I have to remind myself a few times that the weak lizard head. Is Gandalf and Magneto) The problem with this film for me is that it is one of the animated features for ADD-set. It registers after the fact that one somersault zany one after another weighed down by the plot. The filled syrup that pulled out every time in an attempt to convey "Important message" looks like an Oscar victim caught in the animation genre, and considering how scoring with critics, I'm not surprised if Oscar makes a mistake and gives the hardware. But if you are looking for fun animated features about mice, use my advice and wait for Ratatouille.
