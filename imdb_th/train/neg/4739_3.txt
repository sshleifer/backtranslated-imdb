Finally, that day came to me to witness the fate of Azumi as a killer, the result of her character and the last attempt to pull me deep into the world that she ruthlessly rampant in. The first part of the adventure <br /> <br /> That's the poem that I can get when talking about Azumi 2: Death or Love because when I lament the heavy feelings of the House of Flying Daggers and complain about Credibility Aya Ueto, who shows the blood killer after watching Azumi 2. I began to appreciate the flaws that were mentioned earlier than ever before. <br /> <br /> Not only the commitment of each killer is felt Sluggish and unattractive But there are still many important elements that have been eliminated from the whole experience. In Azumi 1, we see that killers use various hiding strategies. (Which is their number one priority) including logic to make the work of their mark easier with faster executions and faster capabilities But I will not keep this story in this movie so much because this story has been slightly modified at this time and there are many obstacles created in the form of Azumi to prevent her from reaching the fate. However, Chiaki was stupidly an example of a large part of the film and generally played the Go Go version with a negative tone with super weapons. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the final. The explosion, which is just a disguise in the name of the epic 'death' in the first half of this movie, will see the launch of many prospective opponents with flashy looks and even weapons. Sparkle Not surprisingly, they will find an end in some way. But this movie is short, when each person begins to die too quickly and easily in Azumi. 1 Most young killers overcome a fight with a quick battle But quite satisfying and the final showdown between Azumi and Bijima Maru, compared to fighting in Azumi 2, at least worth it There are some interesting effects introduced. But they cannot achieve innovation due to the limitations of each encounter I never failed the traditional samurai style with fast and realistic battles. But the characters in the movie Azumi, both imaginative and straightforward, from the anime that the rules may break and the action should be enhanced even further. <Br /> <br /> Azu's romantic side There, to fill the time between the fighting scenes and unfortunately, at the end it doesn't have the objective or the necessary resolution. <br /> <br /> As a fan there is An open mind for a variety of movies and animations. I will not lie and I will accept neutrality and not be impressed with the first Azumi movie. But I will step up and say that after watching the original Azumi 2 is Making it look like an impeccable masterpiece For something worthwhile, Azumi 2: Death or Love may enter the video immediately with a more complete budget and failing to increase or expand the path of the hopeless killer and try his best. To restore peace Courage to death
