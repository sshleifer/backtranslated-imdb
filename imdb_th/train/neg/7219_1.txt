I also find it difficult to understand that this movie is not as good as it should be done in Hollywood. The acting and the story are pathetic and the direction is terrible. I do not see any reason behind this trash, except it may be that the director has nothing to do. I spent ten minutes to realize that I had lost my precious rupees. It made me full of fear that I would waste my life in this shit. I bet that this movie was created in less than a day. I don't know what kind of it is. Please avoid this film at the expense of just doing anything, even hitting the head and the wall. But don't go to watch this movie
