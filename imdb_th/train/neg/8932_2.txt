I must say that I was very curious about watching this movie and it was considered a famous disaster when it was published by 20th Century Fox in the 1970s. It has also appeared in many critics' films. Bad I just have to see what makes this movie so bad when I see it. I think I have an answer. Although I said that it was used for viewing that was curious to see, acting, directing and scripting very badly, Racquel Welch seems to be trying to bring this movie. But after opening the sex change operation, the film went so far that she could not do this job alone. John Huston, as Uncle Buck Lone, didn't receive any help, of course, as he licked and looked at the screen. He sometimes seemed like he was wondering what he was doing there. Rex Reed bounced around. Is Myron, the altered ego of Myra, and also has his own famous masturbation scene Cheers for the first show! Farrah Fawcett plays as a silly blonde She certainly seems confident in this role. But of course, the most famous content goes west. The eyes of a 75-year-old woman with a plastic face makes sexual participation seem more appropriate for horror movies. I didn't intend to leave this story personally. But in this movie, no one looks good. The direction seems not confident and does not exist. Therefore, this film is not only But only bad But also boring Throwing old images of old movies of stars and movies will be even more disconnected. For himself, everyone who is happy with this thing and I'm glad I saw it at least. But Myra Breckenridge seems to be a disaster that is always famous from the beginning.
