When I was a teenager, seeing this movie for the first time, I thought it was one of the best movies ever created. Of course, the reason is Bo Derek and the state of the strip in this movie. However, now I'm older, I can honestly say that this movie is terrible. In your heart, Bo Derek is incredibly beautiful and she and John Derek, husband director, make sure you see her a lot. But when you take that aspect from the movie, it will become extremely boring. Tarzan is a muscular person that you think he should be. But when he saw Jane (That is Bo, of course) for the first time. He doesn't know what to think. This story, despite the fact that Bo wore a wet see-through shirt with her breasts appearing clearly. Tarzan is the only primitive person in the world to have that problem. If you are looking for movies that are salivating on beautiful nude figures, this may make the tickets full. If you are looking for a movie that is fun and rewarding, try to go elsewhere ... almost everywhere !!!
