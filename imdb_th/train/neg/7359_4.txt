Anyone who looks at movie networks throughout their lives, few will know that the credibility of the plan is the first thing that has been eliminated from the planning table. So when Lara, the madman, moved into Patty's house and began to have a mess to drive her car, she didn't flash. Eventually, Lara increased her activities to threaten the poor Patti and dare her to do something about it. I nodded. You will see that on Planet LMN, people do not work the way they do for any reason. They just do it to keep the action going on in the Planet LMN that someone can have the landlord thrown. Leaving their own home using their enchanting powers !! Poor Patti - She is too trusting and Lara leaves her medicine and has this big fight at the top of the ladder related to the syringe. t M cool with all the dangers that ended injected into the stomach of someone and body bags to the front door. The horror! <br /> <br /> But from me, Planet LMN products are classic. You have to watch it once for the wonderful laughter you have. In an improbable scale, I gave this movie at 95/100, made a large group of popcorn and received some apple pieces as well. You will understand later
