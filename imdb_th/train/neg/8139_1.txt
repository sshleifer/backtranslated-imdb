However, "The Bat People" is as smooth as a carpet, gentle like a sack of flour and exciting as a stone ... and as smart as the three together. <br /> <br /> OK, short ( The right container, that ...): The doctor (Moss) has been bitten by a bat while examining the cave with his wife (McAndrew) and later became a bat-good, not a bat, but a bat-like thing. There is a life that looks like a human being. Come to the forest that killed his victims in the first person's camera view .... <br /> <br /> But then there is the business of the sheriff (Pataki), which is the worst story.

He smoked a cigarette holder in his mouth and talked at the same time. "Smokey and the Bandit "and (this is At worst) ... He was the most adorable character in the film! <br /> <br /> All movies But it's just a television movie crapola like a week (guano in this case). It's AIP for crying out loud! What you expect what the Oscar talent <br /> <br /> and what you can say about movies that are not even MST3K can record. <br /> <br /> ... no stars. For "The Bat People" full version or MST3K version! <br /> <br /> However, if there is a sequel to this movie, I will bury my TV.
