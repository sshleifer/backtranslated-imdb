This movie also reminds me of his thoughts. This movie is not only bad in a low budget, bad performances, etc. Even though it's all those things. The problem with this movie is that it seems to try to make the audience annoy and intend to do it successfully. What I want to know is whether this should be a horror movie or not. I mean it's scary But not in the way that horror movies should be I can see the first segment trying to make horror and fail. But what is the second segment? It's very annoying The third part is like watching a student movie that is full of art which is amazing enough to make it the least painful segment. It's very brutal that this movie will not be low to the top 100, so vote for your (1/10) !! I know some people give good reviews. But they lied with a sadistic attempt to trick you Trust me, it is impossible to like this movie. The only benefit of this movie is the amazing life-long effect: it feels like you've watched this movie for many years after the first half hour.
