If you are looking for eye candy, you may enjoy Sky. Captain Sky Captain is just a video game packed with live actors. The vision is good and interesting to watch throughout the movie. Now, saying that the image is good in Sky Captain. <br /> <br /> After ten minutes, I know I am watching one of the worst movies of all time. I hope this movie will improve. But never achieved any level After thirty minutes, the urge to walk away steadily increased. Now I own more than 2,000 movies and have seen that number five times. But this is just the second film that I feel like going out of my whole life. <br /> <br /> Actions --- none. The three main actors are poor. Jude Law (in other movies that I want to walk away) is just a scary movie script. I want to sit Ben Affleck on Gigli more than watching the law again. <br /> <br /> Paltrow tries hard to camp. The last article I read said that Paltrow was thinking of being at home and being a mother rather than acting. After this performance, I would applaud the decision. <br /> <br /> The story --- soap operas are better. The story behind Captain Sky starts badly and worsens as he progresses. <br /> <br /> Direction --- There is not everything that is put into a special effect that shows the story and The governance had to suffer a lot. Even "The Phantom Menace" was able to perform better and that was not a good speech. <br /> <br /> I would have to give "0" from "10" movies this story Avoid paying the cinema and wait until the video is opened.
