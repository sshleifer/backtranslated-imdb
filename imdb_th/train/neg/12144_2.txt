Although nothing can compare with vampires and Zombies ... In all matters of filmmaking, I will try to judge this movie first. <br /> <br /> At first, the special effects are amazing. When there was an explosion on the television screen, I thought my whole house was about to explode and when the automatic machine gun was shot, I thought the shells were landing on the floor next to me. <br /> <br /> But the scene when Jack Black's voice gives the worst monologue I have heard, I almost killed myself. But do not worry because he is frantic The movie that he can perform very well in the story "I must be high" seriously. He must watch for himself without reason, babble about unreasonable ideas that are absolutely unreasonable and just add that he will Must be "high" to demonstrate his great performance If you can say that it is a terrible excuse if you talk to the writer, director, producer, sponsor, you may get the same response ... seriously. <br /> <br / > With the production team called "Shock-o-rama" I was shocked. I didn't put a shotgun that had been sawed in my mouth and ended my life after this terrifying excuse for the movie played. /> <br /> If you Want to see This movie, you should be killed. <br /> <br /> Truly <br /> <br /> General
