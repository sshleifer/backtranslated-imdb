First of all, the big name actors have to spend money ... The surgery scene is ridiculous, and of course they have to know that a person with little medical knowledge will find it the most ridiculous ..... . Anesthesiologists do not leave the room during heart transplantation .... and they do not perform surgery in a small room without tools, lung devices, heart and sterilization techniques ... just a joke ... can't have Equation Works featuring Because every stupid surgery scene ... no blood, no personnel But who is the technical advisor .... It looks like it's directed by all the stupid people .. Collect your money and wait until it comes out on DVD and don't rent it ..
