Wow. In Twin City, we have a station that shows "Big Bad Movie" Monday through Friday. Tonight, the nuggets are movies with Carrie Fisher called "She's Back" about a really annoying woman who was killed when a gangster broke into her house. you She wants him to seek revenge against the murderer. "She's back" and she won't let him stop until he does so. She made him irritated at the end ... and the audience too! This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Hey i like bad movies (My favorite movie is Xanadu.) I shook my head throughout the movie. Wondering who thought this would be a good idea for the movie. Will get my drift However, if you want to see a really bad movie - a very bad movie, try watching this movie. You won't be disappointed.
