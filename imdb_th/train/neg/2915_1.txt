It's a bad movie. It looks like there are only 5 police in Hong Kong. They don't use guns and make me feel like Jackie Chan's movie. All the time they use the gun to point to the suspect only. Finally, when they use their guns, when they kill each other, what funny movies? In the movie, it seems like all the good people died without a reason. <br /> <br /> They have stories of this movie and the story leaps into here. But if you want to watch blood movies, I think this is a kind of movie only. I think the zombie movies in the US make your blood harder.
