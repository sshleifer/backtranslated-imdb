I tend to feel like Scrooge, a movie that hits other people, is praising - or I write a review to balance the unverified compliments. I found that this movie is almost impossible to see and unusual for me. But only through clich√©d conversations that are boring Whether there is an initiative in this film - an unusual domestic setting for musicals, many fantasy, some animations - are compensated by scripts that do not have intelligence development. One by one, June Haver and Dan Dailey seem to be good people. But cannot bring the movie as a team No charm or sex appeal They are both gentle. I like Billy Gray But his character is cute The best part of the movie for me is the beautiful dress and the wonderful shape of June Haver.
