There is a saying that a heroine was raped "rampant drunk" by a Russian soldier who was not true. Shouldn't show this movie because of this. <br /> <br /> There is also an order from someone who KGB has prosecuted with "Jews, Gypsies, etc." which is "worse than the Nazis". KGB is looking for Agent called "Zion" which is a representative (Imperialism KGB) believes that this is completely different from setting up Jewry as a whole nation like the Nazis do. Gypsies have never been prosecuted. KGB is a political and political tool. But from a global perspective Communists do not distinguish between races. <br /> <br /> All movies smell like fake. The main hero does not speak Russian. Signs in Berlin are typographical errors. KGB looks completely fake. Some people call it "Russian proverb" was created entirely and the program continued. <br /> <br /> Don't recommend it - this movie is full of lies and illusions on "Good Shepherd" instead.
