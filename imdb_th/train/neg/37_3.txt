Devil Hunter gained a negative reputation due to the fact that it was on the 'Video Nasty' list, but it didn't really have to be like that. Many movies on the show with God (and DPP) are just well-known reasons. And while this is not boring There is not much here that guarantees a ban ... which is a shame because I won't be sitting through it that it's not because of the fact that it's in "Shopping list" plot. The real story for this film is a good base - or at least a better base than most general human movies - and it follows the actors kidnapped and dragged into Amazon Forest The hunter was hired to find her. But according to the way he dared the native people led by men calling themselves "demons" (this name). In general, this film takes about eighty-five minutes and contains many interesting scenes. It is truly a shame that Jess Franco created this kind of movie because this man is clearly gifted. As seen from movies such as The Diabolical Dr Z, Venus in Furs, Faceless and She Kills in Ecstasy. Unfortunately, his good movie is just a jewel among the shit and Devil Hunter is part of the shit. I see this movie purely because I want to say that I have seen everything on the DPP's list (the next two!) And I guess why others who saw it saw But if you are not looking for Nasties; There is no reason to interfere with this.
