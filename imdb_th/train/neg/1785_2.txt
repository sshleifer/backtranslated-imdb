.... And after seeing this garbage, you will not be surprised that it will not be published. <br /> <br /> !!!! SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> This is the movie that Terrible as standard But when I pointed out that it was one of the worst movies with Stephen King's name on credit, you can start to imagine how bad it is. The movie begins with two characters staring at Horrible: <br /> "My God, what happened here? <br /> <br />" I don't know, but they are sure to hate the cat. "* <br /> <br /> The camera turned. To the outside of the house with hundreds of cats frustrated and broken Life This boy is right. Someone hates cats and by breaking like he should be a cop. Oh, hey, he is a cop and when the movie starts with the police makes it noticeable, you just know that you're going to watch a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The reason SLEEPWALKERS is not good is that it's unreasonable and very confusing. Finally we found that the monster in the position needed the blood of the virgin to survive. Will they not look for virgins in the Western Western Bible band than American coastal cities? Must say that at least we know the motives of the monster - that is the only thing we learn We never learned how they could change their shape or make the car invisible and this bottle with the ending that seems to be stolen from THE TERMINATOR. A strange mother walks around, killing many police with her bare hands or Blast them through the police hand gun (!), But if her monster species are excluded from the police shooting power, then why would a monster want to change its shape or become a mule? The? The demise of the creature is not as good as it thought because it was killed by many domestic cats. If they were killed by cats, why didn't the animals kill all the cats around the garden? There were all the moggies sitting around, but the monsters never thought of killing them. I guess that is to allow the creation team to finish the story. It's what they started with the movie that I complained. <br /> <br /> We were treated in many scenes that the famous horror film director John Landis, Clive Barker and even Stephen King were still. People I think the reason for this is because whenever an actor who is not struggling to read the script, they decide immediately, no matter what happens, they will not appear in the film so bad. His morale is thrown out. That's the way SLEEPWALKERS are not good. <br /> <br /> * Unbelievable because it seems not the worst line in the movie. The worst line is - "That cat saved my life."
