Wow, this movie is really disgusting. Terrible in the fact that even though I didn't pay to see it, I still wanted my money back. <br /> <br /> This film is nothing to understand. It is a mistake of sci-fi boredom that has been improved by more skilled filmmakers. The performance, especially with the leaderboard, ended up being Edwood's favorite. When talking about Edwood, he is proud of the character's dialogue. It was too quiet, without friction or humor. Moreover, it is not reasonable, there is no plot or lack. <br /> <br /> The visual effects are ok. But not enough to go "Oh, wow, it's great." That will be thrown to "cool" rather than being a good plot device. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is another mistake of things that have never created any emotions. Again, it seems that the director has just thrown the song in the movie in an attempt to "cool". <br /> <br /> Which leads me to my last point. Maybe if the director is worried about the plot and the conversation rather than trying to "cool", he probably won't make a short movie with short content. <br /> <br />
