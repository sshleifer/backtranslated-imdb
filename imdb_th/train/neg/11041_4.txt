Average performance It doesn't make me laugh especially. Anyway, I think Courtney really brought it down. She doesn't look natural. She has three ways to talk to all robots. She spoke quietly (without tone). She spoke normally. (Without a tone of voice) or she does what she starts to say normally and starts shouting gradually However, her shouting is like "Make me shout because I shouldn't be too loud on the scene." <br /> <br /> She always knew that this cute actress who made this joke was annoying. Her personality is real because she doesn't create emotions and doesn't feel angry. She has this husband who is doing all these stupid things and doesn't have any reaction from her. She acts very dry and simple.
