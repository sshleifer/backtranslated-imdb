I registered for IMDb just to comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> I just finished watching this movie and the only thing that impressed me was that I had the power to stop. <Br / > <br /> I've seen The action movie is quite good and not anything but Princess Blade has the worst fight I've ever seen in a movie. Most sword fighting involves unintentionally swinging the sword back and forth, and hopefully the opponent will not do the same. I have seen many student movies that have better moves and stronger plans. <br /> <br /> So now we have action movies "Future" with bad action and almost no action. The signs of the future <br /> <br /> Most movies do not have any actions and show the relationship developed with princesses and young men, terrorists and sisters who are disturbed. This movie has many plot lines and no matter what it is worth. <br /> <br /> Some problems may be that I watched the dub, which is quite bad. All the actors mutter all their lines, so it is difficult to keep track of what happened. But I get a general idea (Knowing what is being said will not record movies in my eyes) <br /> <br /> If you have heard about this story, it is a modern action / flick of the ninja. That's what I thought it was when I heard about it and now I lost 90 minutes of life. Don't let this happen to you. Steer clear of it
