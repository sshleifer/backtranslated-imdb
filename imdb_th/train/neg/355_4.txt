Just Cause is one of those movies that initially made you wonder why it was hard to determine when it came out - nothing special. But with enough talent and with great support from Ed Harris, then you hit the last three times and everything starts to rise and stupid until you have a killer with a flashlight in his forehead, threatening to kill Sean's wife Connery (Which is unbelievable etiquette) in Skinner Skinner's hut. <br /> <br /> The type of movie that should be best seen on the plane and even once.
