Wow ... True ability <br /> <br /> Change the thriller / suspense / horror into a joke. <br /> <br /> After watching this story, I never laughed so hard. In horror movies before The story is ridiculous with 3 characters that are developed like crazy, whether written in depth or too deep. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a horror movie written completely with silly conversations Ignorant, useless scenes The characters that wasted bad sound and development. Overall, this is something to keep an eye on. <br /> <br /> Don't forget to focus on the classic "food processor" scene and inappropriate police investigation scenes. All /> <br /> This is a remarkably reduced screen performance and writing and reading throughout the period makes you silly, brave or brave.
