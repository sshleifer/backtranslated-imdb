True disappointment from the ultimate skill. Ridley Scott G. Jane tells the story of the first woman who has gone through a terrible practice at the Navy Seal. Training is the most difficult and real thing, while the instructor says in the movie about the character, leading to O'Neill, played by Demi Moore. There are no specific messages or issues in this movie or I cannot access properly. It may be a statement of rights and abilities of women. But it sank under the weary scene and stupid gun fight at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't really understand why Ridley used the zoom in the last gun battle. the desert! It looks stupid and annoying and almost expert, so I want to know what the director sees in that technique. When I watched his latest movie, Black Hawk Arun, there was nothing wrong with the fight scene. (Which has many) and they are concentrated and skilled All the endings in GI Jane look ugly and there's nothing more than filming and killing the silly and stupid. <br /> <br /> This is Ridley Scott's worst movie, in my opinion and without. The important touch that this great director knew Even so, I'm glad I saw this in widescreen format, because there are still great scenes and examples of Scottish abilities. But they are very few in this film. <br /> <br /> Disappointment and nothing compared to the classic (Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, Alien and others ..) of talented directors. this So I was forced to give G. Jane 4/10
