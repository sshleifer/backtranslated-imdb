Top competitors for the worst movies ever made. Joanna Pakula's characters seem to have I.Q from 3, which is less than the writer and director alone. The screenplay will not go through high school writing classes. "Funny" is a child and youth; The concept is monotonous, obviously, these actors are desperate to work. I'm at the end just to see how it gets worse. It's done. Life is too short to use any part of it. Watch this movie.
