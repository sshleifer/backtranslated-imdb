German filmmaker Ulli Lommel manages the work that many horror fans think is impossible: he is a friend who has not been tested for Teuton Uwe Boll to wear the crown of the worst horror film director. <br /> <br /> The new millennium, this movie looks as bad and ridiculous as possible. EW's best. I'm proud and embarrassed to say that I watched it in the form of Toto. The more that the minimum setting, the answer is: soil; Lommel dug a hole and buried it. <br /> <br /> The fun begins with the performances of foreign nobles. Only those who live in Los Angeles, a car mechanic, a doctor and a postmaster, all who are actors or screenwriters waiting to be discovered can easily understand that Lommel is trying to find an actor. How many newbies? <br /> <br /> The main character, the police, the villain, was played by a German actor with a German accent. In addition to being a serial killer, he is also the oldest beat cop in LA, despite the fact that he stopped women, innocent drivers, and brought them to custody and then dragged them into his house. (Which is mysterious as the top floor of the furniture warehouse) and doing all of this in the normal eyes of his new partner <br /> <br /> The scene is terrible. Obviously, the designer's budget includes enough money to paint. Enough to paint "Precinct 707" on the cardboard wall. <br /> <br /> Because the actors are not paid for non-professional - a sad European immigrant group. (May be sent if they do in the traditional land) bimbos mimbos and hopeless middle-aged women - and because there is a little money if using money as a set, special efx, places or other production value To mention that they made a genuine police uniform Sadly, they couldn't buy a police car. Police in uniform, cruising on the streets of the new Mercury Rental. <br /> <br /> More than half of the stories focus on the dirty actions of our German LAPD officers who have been criticized and their futile attempts. Show two new faces to stop him. One of these young actors is especially pathetic because he is the only actor in this messy story, even filming the vague in the real career in the movie. Another fit with a rockabilly hairstyle and tortured brando that must be appreciated. <br /> <br /> The back of the film is where the title gets our victims zombies. The murderer resurrected after he killed a woman who had just visited a voodoo priest to protect the spell. Do not ask why women from Romania have to use voodoo to expect to be murdered, just accept Lommel's logic and enjoy the ridiculous ride. <br /> <br /> After prolonged use of hands The tomb covered with straw Zombies girls manage to create their look. They seem like they've done before, maybe even more cute, with black makeup, glamor around the eyes. Looks like zombies, they look like high fashion models ready for the runway. <br /> <br /> At this point in the movie, Lommel lends a creative message from his famous national boll and injects a large sum of euro-trash trash Nino in music We are talking about prehistoric electronic bumblebee sounds. What they might play in the Ibiza disco when Lommel is still young enough to shake his thief. <br /> <br /> Unlike other zombies, Lommel girls speak and work normally .. . Uh, I mean, they do. Before becoming a zombie This is an opportunity for our assistants to fully bathe us with his gold dialogue. Yes, it's a golden shower. <br /> <br /> I won't lose anything. All I can say is that it is perfectly consistent with the rest of this masterpiece. Edwood's soul continues to live ... or should I say his soul?
