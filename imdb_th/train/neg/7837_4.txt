Most of Stephen King's short stories are small jewels with original ideas that take a long time to develop. In general, the average value - he sets them up quickly on a small number of pages. You read 'em and you're done before you know that you have begun. They are like McDonald's fried boxes - they have really good taste and you know that there is no nutritional value in them (again: from the literary point of view, they don't say a lot about human condition. International) But you will still keep the scarf. Do not be a pig and then go to find a large part that is extra and add too much fat. ("Too Much Grease" is a metaphor for prose in the King's novel when Found that he was reading one of them and said that - when observing pop culture or Yankees, Yankees were smart - with the story!) He collected four books, a collection of short stories I have read them all - from NightShift to the last, everything in the end, and they all show the effectiveness of the point to point, which sometimes lacks in his novels of size. <br /> <br /> But his short stories Never exceed their hospitality ... which leads us to the adaptation of Nightmares And Dreamscapes TV ... <br /> <br /> How are they in hell? (The creator of the series) has been green-light to change the story, which usually averaged 15 pages into 50 minutes episode? I will tell you that - two words - "Stephen King". The story with his name may not be correct, and the one hour show makes the ad more than half an hour. So ... what should be the anthology of episode 23 or 24 That minute became twice the length and Doubling the commercial time ... Ka-Ching! <br /> <br /> I won't waste time compiling these stories - this review assumes that you read the story and / or watch. Items already; The following is just my courage for what TNT offers ... from the last four sectors. This is my ten percent assessment. (From the very first to the worst): <br /> <br /> The battlefield - not classic, but hey, who would argue that William Hurt would not open his trap by shooting now without One line conversation And the reference to the tongue and the destruction of the Zuni doll. The murderer from Trilogy Of Terror proved to me that the producer (and the author of the teleplay, the son of Richard Matheson - TOT writer) knew their mission with this one. Is a serious action But at the same time it's fun It took too long to get to Hurt's apartment, but I thought it was true. 8/10 <br /> <br /> Umney's last case - like this mainly because of William H's performance. Macy. I think the writer / Umney should appear in this story faster in the eyes of the private / Umney. Start because he is the true truth of the story and everyone who is familiar with the king's short story. (Maybe half if not more than the audience) know the settings of Chandleresque That was interrupted by the writer's realities. So we came up with it and cut the cute and clever parts of the impostor. Private Dick banter was out when the tragedy of the author / Umney family began to reveal. Come, I think this list develops emotional relationships that make the audience. (At least I) felt sympathetic to Macy's efforts in real life to escape his sadness. Life. 6/10 <br /> <br /> The end of chaos - Er, this name is what I feel about. With now when it ends After twenty minutes, I was ready to scream at the TV - okay, we got it. The brother is Mega Mensa Genius Prodigy Extraordinaire! We know from Ron Livingston talking to the camera. ("Time is running out for me" - Not fast enough. I think) A young boy who is really discovering bad things for humanity - we know this because he had already built an airplane but almost died because he couldn't. Take it out of the path of the tree And he explodes the chemistry laboratory while teaching chemistry (To think that the end of the world can be prevented, if only this child has more parents to take care of), wasting a lot of time creating uber-the genius of Henry Thomas when we resolved his discovery - the end of the world through unintentional stupidity - how much we can see the world "end" - a cheap video footage of the journalist Began to forget what she reported and short radio broadcasts, announcing the day of the decision to be near. Oh, and your parents are drooling and singing old. My point is if your story is true about "The End of Chaos (World)" I want to see "chaos" as it burns and burns and burns. Talk about ending with a groan of 2/10. <br /> <br /> Crouch ends - now just ticks me completely. I live with the expression of the everlasting happiness of happy couples arriving at their hotels. Play slap-and-tickle, eat lunch and pick up a taxi. (That is half the time there). If when they cross in Crouch, finish the cold transmission. But it failed to be miserable. Not only was it not terrible. But it's really ridiculous. Oh, oh - Kitty ... Wait, it will change ... Oh God! Look at the horrible eyes! Oh, they may take a long time to shoot the Crouch End scene at night instead of the daytime. Things that you might find funny inadvertently may become scary when you see them in the shadows at night. But I guess the budget is not high enough to be filmed at night in London, forging them together for this one. On this page is a very scary story about tourists who walk into places that they shouldn't and the horrible things that may lie close to each other. The only thing that is scary in this modification is directing and acting. - It's really scary. 1/10 <br /> <br /> Average overall series. (Until now): 4/10
