I am not very satisfied with this move. Everything is terrible from the beginning. Humor is not ridiculous. Excessive actions Even the story is weightless. From writers who write successful scripts like Guru and Dhoom, I have high expectations. The actors worked too hard and didn't help. Of course, Kareena shook the screen in a bikini. But for two seconds I think Hindi talent directors should study how action movies are being done. They are often too exaggerated. In this Chinese style movie, it works because it is their masterpiece. But the signature of the Hindi movie is the song Good action movies should not be more than two hours and cannot seem unrealistic. But in the future I'm sure these action movies will be sharper. Things to observe: Comedy and action movies are not mixed together unless done correctly. Good luck next time
