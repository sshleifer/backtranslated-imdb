Follow the usual formula for new recruits - this time being the first African-American. (Cuba Gooding) after President Truman canceled the military draft - through the US Navy's deep sea diver training program. If the program is not good enough, it must be in Bayon, New Jersey. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with the show. Robert De Niro activates his southern accent and shouts in an effective gibberish. Cuba Gooding is raised by a strict father. Child farm Poor black girl in the South - I was not a woman - Charleze Theron Lonette McKee and they have a role, and most were there to argue that men should use their common sense. Other famous actors - Powers Boothe and Hal Holbrook - have more possible roles. <br /> <br /> That's about it. Almost all computers can be assembled. Boat called boat Robert De Niro greeted in the open house After the brutal attack of the hospital staff, he was removed from the suit instead of being arrested. Someone shouted "I am here" in the early 1950s (maybe it was normal at that time, if that was the case "I was bad"). People were talking about each other - "Lieutenant", "Ven's boat" " Commander "as they do in the army Navy. They are simple "master" (if the officer) or modified by their surname (if the criteria). I am not interested to check if there is a position called "Senior Master Chief" in 1950 <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding has a difficult line to hoe. It seems that everyone in the navy will hate the negroes, except one man from Wisconsin. He staggered and was despised by others in his class.

Occurred during From an emergency that does not have a movie like this will not exist If I get a mechanical problem, it's because I guess correctly. The direction doesn't help as well. This film is filled with many people that they have lost a huge impact they may have. And the emergency is confusing because they focus badly. <br /> <br /> Why should we continue? Want to see a better example of this type of movie? Almost everyone will do it - except perhaps "G. I. Jane" in which the abused hero is heroin. Try the training camp scene in "The Young Lions". There, the victim is a Jew or try to use "from here to eternity", which has no button press. And being an enthusiastic person in bringing conflicts as well as "Cool Hand Luke".
