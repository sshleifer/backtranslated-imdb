I am not an art person I am a passionate woman in science and I feel that this movie may be one of the budget art movies in the budget. I watched my part with my fiance and step daughter in the future. We try hard to find something in this movie to preserve our interest. My fiance and his daughter voted. We moved to Ocean 13, but that's another story. In order not to be prevented, I wake up the next morning and shoot another movie. I seriously began to watch this movie again. I do not understand. I think I will get it. I think the most fun part is to wash the ashes and urns to find the place where the fireplace is used as a vase for what appears to be a flower Interesting and still have dead inside It's a strange and strange movie. Maybe this is what they followed. However, I won't be tricked for the second time!
