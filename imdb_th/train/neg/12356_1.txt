Watching this movie is a waste of time. I was tempted to leave the movie, but I refused. I didn't know that Ridley Scott's intent. But I learned that in the army women are stupid like men. They learned to spit, insult and fight in the fight, and that was a waste of time. (In my opinion) What was the last scene in Lybia? They continued to fight with Gadafi, or was it easy for everyone to believe that Islam is often dangerous?
