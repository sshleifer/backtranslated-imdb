I hardly believe that I watched this story again tonight after more than 25 years ... <br /> <br /> Some time back, I watched 6 movies in a row ... Boris Karloff and Chris Lees, all 5, 2 Lees, the latest, both directed (And I use that word loosely) by Jess Franco is a nasty thing At that time I skipped this thing, remembering that in some sense it was bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I watched it no longer. Do you know what is worse for a nasty movie? Parts of S *** that are well made And that's what the devil's plan It is a movie that looks very good, excellent production design, dresses, costumes, music, photography, editing, most good actors, some good performances ... <br /> <br /> ... and of course, plus, one of the worst scriptures in movie history !! !!! AAAUGH !!!!! The first minute of this movie is a scam ... Anyone may misunderstand that it is a good movie. Then they started singing. "Happy birthday to Fu" ... and it was depressed, with Bert Kwouk (whose boss said "Your face - is familiar") accidentally pouring water from Amu's fairy tale to extinguish the fire, causing him to be cursed, tortured, buried and his ears cut off Is the most funny thing they have It's like someone decides that they want to make a movie "campy" - ridiculous. So it would be funny. RIDICULOUS It's ... funny ... it's not. <br /> <br /> It's sad because it's clear. During the first few minutes, there were many people doing research on the Fu Manchu series in order to get many "rights" with different scripts - whether it was really funny or serious serious things they might have - maybe - Should have - should be classic in The The movie that made people forget the horror of the brutality of Jess Franco ... instead of making them want to dig it into a masterpiece by comparison. <br /> <br /> There was a time in the late nineties. 70, when the entire 30s classic characters were revived in an international horror movie Buck Rogers Flash Gordon Tarzan Lone Ranger Charlie Chan Even Doctor Savage I'm not sure if this might be the worst of the lot. It has excellent control of itself, not to move forward quickly, especially in any scene with Sid Caesar (the head of the FBI, Al Capone's cousin - you see what I mean). It's not just the idea of ​​the movie. It's not a joke ... They don't always feel anything. Like when they were "auditioning" police officers to disguise themselves as kings and queens, and we saw people who "auditioned" regularly dancing in the halls, such as singing, dancing and cycling wheels The author of this story has to use a lot of drugs to make the story fit with them. <br /> <br /> As I say, shame ... and the true loss of all abilities, including the matter of Peter Sellers (both Fu and Nayland Smith players), Burt Kwouk (who had been in the movie of Chris Lee Fu at his time) Helen Mirren (a police woman who fell in love with a horrific villain and cursed near the last half hour theft Of the movie !) I began to wonder if anyone would create a "suitable" Fu Manchu movie or whether fans would have to admit that Karloff was almost alone?
