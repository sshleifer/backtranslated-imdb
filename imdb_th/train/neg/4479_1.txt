I will be honest. This is one of the worst movies ever. If not, then it's very close. Had seen a bad teen TV drama This is one of them. Except that worse For example: (POSSIBLY SPOILER) Women: I want to go elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Men: All we want is here. <br /> <br /> Girl: But I want to bring myself to stay Elsewhere br /> <br /> The guy: I'll take you elsewhere. <br /> <br /> ... Continue this line. They have sex. Pop, pop and punk rock are not good. If you have read a book, avoid this movie like a plague. They completely change the character's character and events. In addition, they also eliminate things. In addition, the movie ends before the book is finished. It's an AWFUL movie, so if you haven't read the book, don't watch it. If you read the book, write (film). If you like opera, teen soap that is lower than the average quality soap soap drama. Then again, should we expect something different from MTV?
