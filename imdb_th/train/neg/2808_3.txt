Actors from movies, television and television dramas in 1980, guest stars (Misty Rowe, Pamela Hemsley, Clevon Little, Seymour Cassel and many others) in the story of a photographer who dreams about killing his model. Of course, the models and others started to die, which caused all kinds of complications. <br /> <br /> The thriller that made out was bad, with nudity and violence enough to get a rating. Pon R, but there is not enough good content for interest. This is best explained due to the movie genre that gives Cinemax another cable TV with Skinamax's name. I can't see this point unless you have to watch the thriller At convincing (I still have to comment that this movie is full of smoking, to the point that it becomes a laughing story when everyone is brighter)
