Sorry, people have to say that this is / is a really boring movie. It may be worth it, but it's boring. I almost cried with boredom when watching The performance is quite scary, the story that pulls out and guesses the score and the camera works well and is not exciting. Is one of those movies that you are not allowed to hate (Because it's about people with disabilities) but hate me, thinking that almost everyone will do It is interesting that critics are very kind to this film. I think they are not allowed to have a purpose. This thing was created for the award - which I remember that it was correct. But it's not interesting or fun I didn't see the play, so I couldn't compare it.
