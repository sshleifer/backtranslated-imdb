This movie has good intentions and is a good story to work with. The director and the writer of this film failed miserably and created a boring and boring film that made me feel like returning to study at the 8th grade of social studies of Mr. Hartford - back in 67 years. > <br /> What is it? Someone will please bring this story out and make a real movie out of the story. - The story deserves <br /> <br /> Every time there is a scene that may happen. Get something We left is a clich√©, plus black. And the white video that they may receive from The History Channel to show embarrassing action. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis is the only light in this boring festival. Other performances It is incredibly boring - it fits well with good movies and players that the captain has created a new low standard for line delivery. <br /> <br /> However, if you are willing to accept the flaws Many in This Movies and not related to fear or entertainment But want to learn about USS Mason. It's worth watching
