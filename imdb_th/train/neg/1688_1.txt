Gee, this movie is terrible! I can't understand what people find very scary about. "Dissatisfaction" The director receives a trick. (I have to accept the very good thing, that is a very chic life). Then he repeated it over and over again for the rest of the film over and over again. For this reason, I startled two to three times in the first quarter of the movie. But when I realized that the practice I slept a lot while The Grudge grew up in the minute In conclusion, I can say that there is a much better movie in the genre that begins with what is called "The Ring". The predecessor pioneers are a more scary way and buying tickets for "The Grudge" is a waste money
