This movie is terrible. It's almost good ... almost. We love the theater. But not this song Although there are excellent sound quality, bad movies and many actors who are unable to sing or dance Anthony Rapp can make better performance. (Especially at the end) Marjorie, a drunken woman with fun And some songs (excellent) are quite catchy (But not in a good way) <br /> <br /> The Open House is a funny movie that must be viewed because it's terrible! We think it might be a good stage. (With excellent actors)
