Mark Hamill should feel awkward with CORVETTE SUMMER! This time, he uses a new "power" to occupy his dream machine, which is bright red. 'Vette seems like a sour young teenager will flick the first half hour and return in the wrong direction Writing and directing work can be frightening, with some scenes that you can't resist. You expect this to happen and you smell the Hodges Hop breed of the 1970s. Only the former newcomer Annie Potts stole the poor acting and recording of this movie. From creepcom! Bad personality But her delightfulness makes you interested and this is the best chance to see her in a swimsuit. Cheers for Annie! Sorry, mark! I guess the army is not with you at this time.
