There is a movie laughing about it. Of course, Michael Keaton is a talent and he's been funny. (Before he decided he was a serious actor) However, the thing that bothers me so much about this movie is the character that everyone doesn't like. In addition to the two main actors, everyone is a jerk. I mean, these small town losers are as incompetent as you can. You just watch and think that these losers should be unemployed. In addition, American factory workers also show that the sluggish and ungrateful. It makes me wonder if this movie was created by Japanese nationalism. Oh, in the end, they all come together as one. But I don't enjoy traveling to get there.
