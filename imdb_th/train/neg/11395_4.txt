Whether it is a new story But this romantic movie makes this concept a reality. A young man (John Cusack) and an elegant woman who died (Kate Beckinsale) meeting by chance Although both of them were promised to others ... Strange enough that they still felt that their partner was somewhere. There are few places in some places, but viva la love being a romantic person I am almost attracted to My favorite scene is that Cusack is on the ground and the snow begins to fall. The final scene of the drama is too sweet. But most appropriate This is not one of Cusack's deep roles, but anyone in hell cannot be attacked by Beckinsale. Outstanding support is provided by Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon. John Corbett has the worst role. I have seen him in return. Eugene Levy is a quirky and funny person. See this with your partner
