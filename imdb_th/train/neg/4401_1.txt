We went to watch movies with the group because the play we were about to be canceled. No doubt it is one of the worst movies ever. Not that I don't like the cult movies I do. But nothing happened in the movie There is no feeling associated with the character at all. Time is endless, without having to interact and the car. They carry a tent and a large bed and clothes in that car everyday It's two seats! I must say that, however, the scenery is beautiful. But not in the movie, the director should shoot the movie so that we can skip the useless time for about 80 minutes without anything going on You
