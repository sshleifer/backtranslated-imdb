I hate to be one of the rain flocks. (Even though it's a small scene like this) but from the first scene, you can tell that this movie must be exact. It's really a shame because I quite like Martin Freeman and Danny dyer. I was intrigued by the way they combined in the movie together. But my fear they didn't have a scene together !! I think I have to do this thing again - two leading actors (Standing side by side on advertising posters and DVD covers) doesn't have the same scene !!!! They didn't talk and never appeared on the screen at the same time. Summarizing the bad excuses for this movie, false advertising. <br /> <br /> The conversation is painful. Every character in the movie is unrealistic and not human. The situation is far removed, the plot is ridiculous. The story of skinny Freeman tries too hard to be funny. (And playing as a poor gentleman, Tim from the office) No one is the favorite and the worst among some characters. It's annoying that it makes me almost close because I can't see or listen to them anymore. <br /> <br /> This small budget has a huge failure. Even Danny Dyer can't. Can insert humor and charm into this But greeting him to try <br /> <br /> How can everyone rate this movie because 'Ten Stars' is seriously out of me, ten stars? Come .... I won't give you ten great stars, because ten stars show that the movie is perfect. This movie is far from perfect, almost opposite, meaning that it is almost dire throughout <br /> <br /> Watch it if you like it. But if you have watched a lot of movies and watch a lot Great movies. Your review may be similar to mine. <br /> <br /> 1/10
