This film has evidence that is difficult to swallow even according to the standards of this type. We were asked to accept that not only But only the past records can make the dead back to life But the notes still have hidden messages that are specially intended for a child Of course, there is no way to know who will be the record. However, this movie has a lot of fun for a while. But in the end, ignorance and pointlessness are the most overwhelming. If they are trying to create a horror icon that is like a new Freddy, they will go out: The villain here has no personality, no motivation and no variety.
