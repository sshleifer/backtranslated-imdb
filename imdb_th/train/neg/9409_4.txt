I like this item! I think it's nothing wrong with it! Only Spidey does not penetrate anyone. But for that item, don't suck! Some people think that this list is not good because of that. The story is great and fun when other heroes appear like X-men, The Punisher, Daredevil and Iron Man! Reaching the bad sandman will not appear But I like it! The ultimate show, Spidey !! My favorite part is: 1. Turning Point 2. Spider Wars 3. The Hobgoblin 4. The Alien Costume 5. Mutant Agenda <br /> <br /> But there are some really bad episodes: Rocket Racer and The Point Embarrassing to watch and I don't like Morbius and Hydro Man. The first of Morbius sucking plasma instead of blood and I don't like vampires. And it makes me frustrated that he is almost the main villain in Season 2. Of course I have to mention Hydroman! He's terrible! I saw Sandman over! His last appearance was terrible and I didn't like Spidey as a Man-spider! <br /> <br /> But I guess everything is worse!
