In fact, this movie is another story that caused a big disappointment ... The movie called "masters of horror" is mostly horror in terms of sub-effects and laughable stories. .. Aside from Ron Perlman, everyone in this movie can't do anything to save their lives ...

The only expert is cigarettes, burns, Jennifer and maybe pals ... I don't know if these directors can sleep at the time. Night because they knew that they had destroyed the type that they really understood ..
