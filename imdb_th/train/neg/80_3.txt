I must say that I was really surprised at the high score for this film. I found it to be an absolutely silly story. Mother received "vision" when she touched something or people? And one thing that she touched twice made her vision continue ... It seemed very ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was terrible. I thought She is very annoying The girl who plays Lori works well and gets the most support for what they have to work with. <br /> <br /> I always love LMN and open my mind to movies. There seems to be a ridiculous plan and above the leading performances, and it's not for me.
