After watching "The Bodyguard" last night, I felt compelled to write a review. <br /> <br /> This may be a good movie if it's not a scary camera. It's so annoying. The angle is wrong, it is impossible to see anything, especially during the fight. <br /> <br /> The story of Sunny Chiba hires herself as a bodyguard for everyone who is willing to take him on the drug ring. He was approached by Judy Lee, who had never met Chiba. Lee's involvement in the drug ring is deeper than Chiba thinks, because Mob and another gang of thugs follow her. <br /> <br /> The story is good and despite the horrifying voice dub. With better directions and solutions, I'm sure this will be a traditional kung fu movie. As it is, it is more like the action movie of the 70s. <br /> <br /> Note: The opening sequence has a familiar word for the fans "Pulp Fiction" and continues from Karate School in Times Square Not affiliated with the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Score: 4 out of 10
