I found this film good to pass your time. But not by the opportunity to have any historical value. The depiction of Cleopatra reminds me of a cheap TV drama. <br /> <br /> The truth is ... funny! She gave birth while raising her children!?!? O favorite ... the queen of Egypt who is pregnant (Especially here) will not bother to go from one room to another room for that reason! They tried to make her a saint for God's sake! And the way they tried to prove that she killed her sister ... beyond words. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra is the greatest politician of that time. Her decisions are based on nothing but her feelings and morals. She does everything for just two reasons: power and self-care! She was born in a family that she struggled to survive, something she did very well. (Her brother and sister) or be tempted (Ceasar and Mark Anthony) <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Octavian has the power to kill and ... gay is tempted. So he is the end of her ...
