Depending on your state of mind when watching this, "Christmas Evil" may become an ambitious and innovative spirit thriller or one of the most disgusting and disgusting holiday theme slashers. I personally am tempted to choose for the latter because I am not interested in doing any research at all and expect to have 80s candy makers in the early 80s, along with the meatballs in the Santa suit. Actually, this movie is about a bloke named Harry Stadling; Who is obsessed with Christmas working in a garbage toy factory and thinks it is his responsibility to judge on Christmas Eve that deserves gifts and those who deserve punishment Harry's problems started when he saw Santa ?? Apparently his father in the dress? Caressing his mother's bare legs at a gentle young age. After that, he had just developed into an expulsion society, causing a nuisance to his brother, who was bound to one day (Holi). But is it really boring? There are many parts that are too long and seemingly endless of movies that nothing happens. I can forgive the misery and bloodshed. But this movie does not benefit from the unstable atmosphere or unexpected plot twists (Except for an incredible ending, I have to admit) In addition, I will use this concept more seriously if the mad supporters will focus themselves on punishing mischievous children! He did not kill adults who behaved inappropriately and especially How seriously should you shake the controversial Christmas and scrambled on Christmas when Santa didn't kill a miserable child? That will make "Christmas Evil" a classic at the moment. Now it's just a garbage that is memorable and miserable.
