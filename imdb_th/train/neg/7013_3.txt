Unfortunately, this movie 54 is a pathetic effort of the true story of 'Studio 54'. The only good thing about the picture is 'Mike Myers', who is happy to see 'Neve Cambpell', although her role is a bit disappointing. The bottom line is that this film lacks good performances from actors, except for one story and the real change is a great effort for the screenplay.
