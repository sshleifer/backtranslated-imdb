This movie begins with a promise. But still in the world of distance and alienation We were left hanging. But there is nothing more to help preserve the cruel face and the dull face of a boring man Of course, there is no rope up the wall to help us climb over. It is a shame because the concept is not moral liked it When uncomfortable beyond imagination The loss of this presence in the real world is quite clear and unnecessary than his son will join the army. Why isn't it a circus, so at least we can appreciate some colors? We were left with a feeling of loss. But sadly, there is no enlightenment that is confusing because this movie seems to be about some form of success that is not available for all of us
