This movie has a good point: hot people, dead people. <br /> <br /> The problem ... The hot barley is naked and you don't see many people die. And screaming even though there are two good kill scenes. <br /> <br /> For those of you who watch JENNA JAMESON, you are just a side assistant who has a small role. . Scripts and stories are good. But I won't complain about that .. just put it, want more nudity and a better kill scene because cuz face it, that's why> <br /> I won't lose money on it .. And if you have to wait until it is on the OLD shelves at your local video store
