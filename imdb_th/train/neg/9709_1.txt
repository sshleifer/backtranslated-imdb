30 seconds to open the credit, I have a feeling that this will be a bad movie. But I don't know how bad it is Then the actors playing with the evil Nazi scientists opened his mouth and my friends and I decided that for the survival of this film, we had to lower the volume to do our own conversations. But that didn't help About half way we closed it Now I've been with a bad movie before, with and without an assistant "Mystery Science Theater 3000" and "Svengoolie", but there are some things that I doubt even the bots can record The biggest part of the movie that caused me the most nuisance was those who were hypnotized because they believed that they were zombies that made the skin green. I guess they were hypnotized until death, then hypnotized to rot. Adhered to the true classic B movie cult, such as "Plan Nine From Outer Space"
