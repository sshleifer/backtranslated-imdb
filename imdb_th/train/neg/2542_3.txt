... Not all Disney movies are rubbish. <br /> <br /> However, I saw "Legend of Boggy Creek" first and loved this movie very much. When I heard that it had two sectors, I was happy. I finally found this and watched it one night. I do not see how they can create a sequel that has been rated G as a horror movie. The original is a movie / documentary about Fauke Monster and can make everyone fear "Return" for children and should not be viewed by anyone. I remember bad things well because it was quite a long time since I watched it and I wouldn't look again, but ... It's about these hunters who came to town. Three little children sneak out of the house to stop them. The large monsoon came through. The injured hunters were rescued by the children. Then they all hid in the boat with a large tarp on top and tried to wait for the storm. Suddenly, Bigfoot arrived and did something really sick. I do not want to destroy the ending of any medicine, but it's not scary ....
