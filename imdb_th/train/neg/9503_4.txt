Or known in different ways as "House of Exorcism", a small, messy movie. <br /> <br /> The film takes itself seriously to kill any entertainment. <Br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> >> The reserve plot involves European tourists, Elke Sommer, who has the opportunity. <br /> <br /> Working with Telly Savalas, which looks like a demon that she <br / > <br /> See in the square fresco of Sommer being driven to the house. <br /> <br /> In the country where Savus is a waiter, <br /> <br /> There she was mistaken for a long dead woman and the beginning of the drama. <Br <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The husband of a blind person has a relationship with a dead woman who is a fianc√©e of the fiancee's <br /> son. Sommer sat together. <br /> <br /> The woman gave the driver uh. "Sit behind the lesson. <br /> <br />" And the husband knows and doesn't care. Finally, <br /> <br /> Most actors are killed. Sommer is poisoned and raped, <br /> <br /> The escape and the audience will be led to the highest point in the space. <br /> <br /> The plane ... which must be similar to the empty cinema. What <br /> <br / > Play this thing <br /> <br /> The alternative version of this "House of Exorcism" has a scene. </ Br> <br /> Add related to the priest. <br /> <br /> VHS copy of This thing The Elite Entertainment <br /> <br /> There is a "special" after the credit ends; Remove the sex <br /> <br /> and the scene. <br /> <br /> The direction of Mario Bava is fast and furious. But his screenplay is terrible. <br /> <br /> There is a concept that is baked half, abandoned plotline and amazing comfort that doesn't do much more than drive this thing. <Br /> <br /> in the direction forward You live like a puppet for the funeral. <br /> <br /> The blind leader doesn't do everything the blind. <br /> <br /> And Savalas gives the same lollipop he has in "Kojak "(<br /> <br /> haunt you, baby?) <br /> <br /> The project looks like they have two stars names and write scripts. <br /> <br /> Quickly happen in Hwang. Hollywood, today <br /> <br /> happens every day. Savalas seem to be completely lost. Send his <br /> <br /> incessantly. Hope that his character won't die in "The Dirty <br /> <br /> Dozen" Sommer runs around and screams and gapes very much. <br /> <br /> Her character is empty. No, I use the word "character" loosely. <br /> <br /> The only thing we know about you is her name. <br /> <br /> This is a strange movie and your reaction continues. It may depend on how much <br /> <br /> you enter the Eurohorror and Kojak. I can't recommend <br /> <br /> "Lisa and the Devil" <br /> <br /> What This rating is not included and includes all the specialties at the end of the VHS. <br /> <br /> copy, physical violence, sexual violence, strong <br /> <br /> Blood, pictures Strong female nude, male nudity, sexual content, and situations <br /> <br /> adult
