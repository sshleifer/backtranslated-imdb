I went to watch this movie at the college theater thirty years ago because I like Bruce Dern in Silent Running and Family Plot to this day. (Sorry, Jack Nicholson) It's still the most boring movie I've ever seen. Without a point of observation - it just ended. The light came up and I saw everyone looking around With confusion Who predicted missed the reel? I never wanted to know All I remember about this film is that it's not a drama about annoying college basketball players and their coaches. The funniest part of this movie is watching viewers unaware afterwards. Fortunately, this is just an exception for Jack, Bruce and Karen Black.
