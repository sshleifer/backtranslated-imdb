I expect to have sci-fi and thriller movies this summer. But was very disappointed about this particular movie While some people walked out of the movie, I decided to continue to laugh with other moviegoers in the absence of suspicion. I found myself almost confused as the main character in the movie. The only thing that has the quality of the film's redemption is the soundtrack. This is one of the movie stars that they later regretted. Looking back, I won't even rent this one, let alone pay more than $ 5 to see.
