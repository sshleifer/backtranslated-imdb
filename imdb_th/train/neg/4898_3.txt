The Wayward Cloud is an interesting movie. It's incredibly amazing. It treats each match like an art. You will get the impression that the elements of each shot are designed and created with the level of exquisite care associated with passion. Shows how much the theater has progressed since the first film was created in the nineteenth century and mimics the construction of the camera here, almost not moving at all, right? In addition to the camp and colorful music The ambient noise will be kept to a minimum and almost no words. Curious device But this efficiency forced the audience to focus only on visual stimuli, so even when the story was carried out with a snail-like rhythm, we felt that she was obsessed with it. Unfortunately for me, at least this immersion began to unravel around the hour mark. I began to feel as though the movie was challenging me to continue to watch while more and more difficult as time passed so that watching alone became a battle of wills. <br /> <br /> If the content of the movie This matter is not Used to have sex as though it was no doubt that it would make the Western audience more confused As it is, there are many nudity of women and sexual abuses against women who are unconscious (or possibly dead) that hate a lot while talking about degradation that pornography about men and women (users ) And what is used). It has a lot of enthusiasm in the way it chooses to make the issue effective. Of course, the worst and most enthusiastic participant of the explosion in existing pornographic content will search for this movie for the wrong reasons and watch with the finger attached to the fast forward button of the remote <br /> <br /> For all the problems of this movie, it's definitely a guest story, and the more you think about it, the more certain aspects of it. only Ironically, for a small movie, the audience may be rewarded with a second or third look. For me, however, once is enough?
