God. This movie is terrible. I can't complain too much. I went to see it to make money. It's enough It's funny that the most disgusting part of the movie begins when a woman is forced to give birth to a terrible mutant. <br /> <br /> I think it's the most funny. The famous actor in this film is the military of Hispanic, which is a supporting actor on the next Friday. Everyone in the movie acts in a terrifying performance. It's the worst performance I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I also expect it to be more scary than the first time. It's not. To be less successful than previous generations, I expect it to be more scary because blood and violence often sell horror movies today (Grudge 2, Saw 3, Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2, Dead Silence). And it's not as scary as it is First Another disappointment. <br /> <br /> The first mutation is a nuisance. But the creators tried hard in this matter to make them creepy until they were absolutely hilarious. <br /> <br /> The whole concept of showing the clips of the female soldiers on her camera phone says "I love my mum" four times. It's very stupid to show it at first because they just try to make us feel bad for the mother who is weaker than the other soldiers and it's even more stupid to try to make us feel. Bad with her acting. It's three times without reason. This movie is a joke.
