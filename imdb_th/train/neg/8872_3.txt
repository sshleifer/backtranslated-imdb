Major Payne is not that good. Even though it's a joke here and there, the story is ridiculous and the performance is bad. The sound and mood of Major Payne is particularly annoying. The idea is ridiculous and the things that children have to do in that movie are even more ridiculous. I will not recommend this movie to anyone.
