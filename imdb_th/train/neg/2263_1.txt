Okay, let me say that I didn't expect the movie starring Jerry Springer to be the gold in the cinema. All I ask is that it's going to be a movie ... and it's not like that. It looks like someone's bad house movie Acting poorly, the script and full of innocence of the most beautiful people I have ever seen Will go to Jerry Farrelly Show "to talk about various matters between mother, daughter, stepfather and daughter's fiance From then on, the movie will disappear and develop into a unique experience: pornography, white trash. Have sex, redneck, interacial sex, even sex between Jerry and his wife? (Yuk!) This movie encouraged me to run out of the theater and circumcised the second time. At least it was short-hearted. Disgusting and downgrading African-American and American working class should be offended. (Howard Stern should be satisfied But he didn't waste his effort to be a movie star, clever and fun. <br /> <br /> My score: F + (hot daughter)
