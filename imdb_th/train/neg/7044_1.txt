It's so sad that Tina Louise is beautiful and has a reduced ability to make a terrible excuse for the movie. Tina is still strong and charming. But for some reason that truly frightened I can understand her fear. Due to the fear that this third ranking will be made public In addition, I am a fan of Adam West who is satisfied. Again, just like Tina, Adam looks good and looks good for his age guy. His performances here are acceptable. But the script is so bad that it is difficult to listen to the dialogue. <br /> <br /> This film is a very popular movie in The Wild One, an outlaw biker gang outside the control of a small town. Cycling here looks like a Motley group and I'm sure that they won't want them to date my sister. The show is hard and woody, and the story is old like sand. Hellriders are hell to watch!
