I enjoy watching western movies. But this movie requires biscuits The conversation and the conversation are laughing. The performances are terrible. Where did they come from? Music is ok. I have to say that Luckily I didn't buy or rent movies. But now it was eliminated. <br /> <br /> I started to focus on strangers (shadow Martin) began to tell his story. I must admit that I enjoyed the encounter between Hopalong and Tex at Hopalong, shooting Tex's finger and telling him to practice for 40 years to reach his league. But that is where the pear was dressed up after that I have to watch all the movies in the hope that it will improve. Never do.
