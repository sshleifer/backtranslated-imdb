First of all, there is a Gujarat theater and there are Bollywood. Both have strengths and fans following the director Vipul Shah should look elsewhere instead of Gujarati Theater when producing Bollywood. The first time he made Aankhen (adapted from Gujarat) - which has a unique plot But cannot be regarded as a Hindi movie He now adjusts to play Gujarat again and names it Waqt - competing against time. The plot development is not for Hindi movies. For example, the role play between father and son is best for Gujarat theater - don't bring in Hindi movies. Even funny songs are still the best for Gujarati stage. All performances are moderate - nothing spectacular about - except for the wonderful Shefali Chhaya Shah.
