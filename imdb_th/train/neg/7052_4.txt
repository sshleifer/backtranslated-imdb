God, this movie is very boring, in addition to the music that I really love, I mean what makes this movie a reality. Everyone who reads this review doesn't watch this movie. It's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Emraan can show But really poor in this movie, I feel ashamed to be one of his fans, especially in this movie. It's really terrible. <br /> <br /> Celina is another pretty face. She can't perform at all, and there is no point where she will be in this movie for other Radha girls. She's ok. I guess. But should do better. <br /> <br /> waste time Please buy great music and don't watch this movie.
