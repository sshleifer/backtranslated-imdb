My friends and I rent this stuff for "Bad Movie Night" with high hopes, but The Brain is diminishing. The brain looks stupid. But mostly on a small platform, who thinks it's cool that the brain is grazing three people, all 94 minutes drawn? This film has many things to happen at the beginning, including the leading actors. Estevez-knockoff In addition, there are some great lines, followers who are out of shape and hilarious that are just about everywhere and yes, some chick are naked. However, the director wants to study in the art of pacing. In the second half of things that are just beginning to drag on and on at least 3 or 4, there is no point. The boring chase scenes make up the middle third of the plot. The scenes within the PRI complex are terrible at least 15 minutes Of this film is that people run up and down the same stairs I can edit the screenplay in half an hour - with more cheese, more blood, more nudity, more brain action. If you are going to create a horror movie that is not good, at least let me have something cool to watch while my superhero is shut down. Perhaps the director really tried to bring the audience into his movie - I started to feel like one of the people who were destroyed at the end of this crapfest.
