Talk about your empty money .. I'm just wondering why Michael has starred in Turkish movies .. Michael is a great actor, especially in the movies he is performing as a man who is dying of cancer. It was wonderful as he tape the son to see when he grew up .. Michael is a talented actor .. So what makes him do this ??? I watched it and thought it was really stupid .. I thought once in their career they had a crappy movie .. especially "squeezing" I didn't understand first and I felt the best performance. His character is "Pacific Heights". His character crawled me out .. and I like "multiplicity". That is very hilarious !!! And he is perfect for the role of "Batman" .. and I like "Night Shift" and I like "Johnny Dangerous" too .. Too bad some people end up doing Flea movie .. like this ...
