One scene shows the idea of ​​"Terminator Woman" quite well: Karen Sheperd and another woman are trying to escape from the villain camp. Karen ran over armed guards who pointed her gun at her.

Then again, when the movie was directed by martial arts artists and written / produced by other members of his family, you know that you shouldn't expect too much. Karen Sheperd and Jerry Trimble make the players more fun and this movie might be Looks better if it focuses on relationships that hate more love. But after about 20 minutes, they were separated, and the movie slowly became slow, and even the occasional fighting scene to make it lively was no longer exciting.

But the fight was interrupted by a way that reduced their flow In the positive sense, the glory of the idea for the Karen to have the opportunity to show the amazing divisions throughout the movie!
