After watching this, I lost a little respect for Christopher Lee. (This story has passed for a long time) This film is the most junk. First of all, they tried to create an end from the first "Howling" with incredibly bad makeup. Then they try to turn it into a sad excuse for the werewolf porn! The plot is terrible and all the movies are great !!!! The werewolf victim of the first movie (From the look of it being supported as Dee Wallace) collaborated with Lee and another woman to destroy the werewolf group led by Sybil Danning, who seemed to be naked all the time This is not worth the rental. (Unless you want to waste time and money on watching nude pictures) Try to catch it with a cable instead. It may be chopped up. In fact, it may be reasonable.
