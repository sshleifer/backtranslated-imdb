With Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers in the movie, you think this thing won't go wrong. But what can i say This is a terrible misunderstanding. This film is about Peter Sellers as an older gentleman who finds himself in a relationship with a strange child and doesn't talk about the hippies that are interesting in Goldie Hawn. This film is incredibly inconsistent and I don't Understand anything. Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn are very funny people, but this movie can't prove <br /> <br /> The song about ?? arabella Cinderella 'is really cool, but that it I recommend this movie to people who like to watch exotic movies. This is the definition of this movie. I guess this movie is more than anything else, it is a sign of time in terms of empirical and ambiguous experiments. The problem is quality, being completely shot and writing, not talking about that direction. <br /> <br /> In particular, the seller of Peter Sellers, he must go from Dr. Strangelove and stay there throughout his career to make dumb movies like this and Magic Christian, which is similar to this. Context and style But the movie had a little funny time This one is unconscious and I regret that there are wonderful people like Peter Sellers in this movie. Not recommended for everyone.
