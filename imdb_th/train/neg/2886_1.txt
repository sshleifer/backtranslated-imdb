Scary, scary, scary. Don't waste money on renting this movie. It's a low budget for Canadian movies on TV. It's the worst movie I've ever seen and there are many things there. This film is not worth the time to put it on a DVD or VCR: ~ (Is it possible to write ten lines? The show was horrible. No shedding. I saw the creation of a TV movie about BTK killer and it was much better. (Compared to this film) I'm not sure what they will do in the production of this movie. But if it educates us or tells a story about BTK killer, they miss a mile. It appears to be an infomercial for animal rights.
