I gave this 4 stars because it has many interesting themes here already mentioned. From domestic violence to sexuality and many taboos I will not call this horror as much as I read science fiction. <br /> <br /> It's cold, depressed and hopeless. While I'm not interested in the less cheerful ending, I'm really bored with the "human mind" that is at the center of every movie. I know that you cannot receive a liberal arts degree today without having to give up on your own hatred as a member of the human race. But what is the competition as a writer / director? Notice that the aliens killed the evil human race! Now if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die, just go out to find the lake and swim until your arm is tired. In this way, you will not be close to directing the next movie or writing the next book that tells me that I deserve to die because I am alive. It's stupid, not thinking and boring.
