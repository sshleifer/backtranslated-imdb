Seeing beautiful women sneaking around, playing cops and robbers is one of the most delightful pleasures that the central film helped me enjoy. House on Carroll Street didn't have to waste time, even though the story was planned and The screenplay is not boring and quite annoying. <br /> <br /> There are many different Hitchcock images. McGillis in the role of an actor She is dressed like Grace Kelly and she is not far from the mark. Not at all. But her character is unbelievable. The way she got to know the audience, she should be a person with political confidence and a purpose in life. After all the movies relate to clearly defined moments, real events and specific problems. But the story deteriorated within the first few minutes of the crime story filled with regret, unbelievable coincidence, high predictions and a set of two-dimensional characters. This is more regrettable, because the actors' performances are good as well as photography and the design of the scene. <br /> <br /> The final scene of the drama in Central New York is amazing. It starts in the underground part and then moves up to the roof. Movies can be praised to take advantage of the architecture well.
