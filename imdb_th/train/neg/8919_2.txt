I saw this for the first time when it was chosen as a recommendation from my TiVo system. I like Danny Elfman and think it's interesting. Moreover, I am a fan of Max Fleischer and this started with the look and feel of his 30s cartoon. I think it's interesting. I'm wrong. Just a few minutes, then I pressed the fast-forward button. Fast face I ran through it for about 15 minutes and thought it was that. <br /> <br /> After that I read other reviews here and thought I didn't give enough opportunities. I recorded it again and watched through. There were 75 minutes in my life. I didn't get back. <br /> <br /> I can't believe that there are no bad comments anymore. Personally, I think it is because it's hard to get a minimum of 10 comments. How many ways to tell if this is a waste of time? <br /> <br /> This film happens as if some junior high school children. People are ready to destroy the world and think they can do it with breasts and jokes. Flat characters, parody of "Swinging the letter" is a lame matter. Essentially, the sound will be adjusted via A-E by pressing the "rude" button that is clearly rude and doesn't know where to go. Traveling through the intestine to the expected landing results for the first time. <br /> <br /> All across the film board is what you expect from people trying to. "Out of South Park", Stone and Parker, without being able to determine what it is and not a joke This may be fun if you're high. Otherwise it will not
