This is a disappointment - there is no difference in the original. It seems that Brits will be able to create a truly unstable movie without the best of the American version. The original series combines both a creepy story and a subtlety of performance with great attention to light and settings. I have watched the series many times and are still attracted. <br /> <br /> There is a bad adjustment along the line of "Cracker" with BBC America or BBC Canada and see the happiness like Waking. the Dead, Spooks, Silent Witness and Judge John Deed. Watch Touching the Evil Evil. Then look for "Wire in the Blood" to see the elegant and beautiful performance of Robson Green. Hollywood must watch this actor!
