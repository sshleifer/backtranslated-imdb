I want to like this movie a lot. But this story is ridiculous I do not want to damage this movie - don't worry. At first, you know that something bad happens - but this is an example of how this movie is sloppy. Cowboy and "Twig" ride on the ridge The cowboy has a mustache, grabbing the cowboys and "Twig" to shoot and race along the half-way ridge. The cowboy was clean and clean throughout the rest of the movie. Sometimes during a gun battle and sitting down on a mountain, cowboys have time to shave in the dark on horseback. <br /> <br /> For justice, the performances by the four main characters are stable.
