This film poses in the episode of the Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think MST3K is the best when they rip this movie. <br /> <br /> Great performance. I give it 2 <br /> <br /> Villains difficult to understand because of makeup The assistant said, 'Not you' that sounds like NACHOO !! (Think sneezing) It's just a bad speech. Long eyebrows are hilarious with one character. <br /> <br /> I don't know what 'The Projected Man' means in terms of the plot. I missed the starting point. <br /> <br /> What is the minimum line of 10 posts?
