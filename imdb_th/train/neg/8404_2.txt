I have three comments about this film, which I have discovered to live a long life in the ground floor at Blockbuster. First of all, it is interesting to see how the filmmakers used to try to shoot. Make a movie There are some people that Kubrick used with "Lolita" to get the original composers to write the original screenplay. Of course that can't happen here; Kraft-Ebing died a long time ago. Some people use the original work place as a starting point to move in a new direction that is irrelevant (adjusting "Tristram Shandy" here to know). You can make it dumb - the movie. "Slaughterhouse Five" is an example of my thoughts. Or you can use the original style and try to show it in vignettes. That movie will be the story of Woody Allen. "Everything you want to know about sex" and this movie Once considered, it may be the only thing that can be done with academic work such as "Psychopathia Sexualis" The potential loss is that anything that accumulates in the beginning of the job is obscured or destroyed. So it is here. <br /> <br /> The second point is the movie style. Some people call it "Paying respect" to Murnau, Pabst, Carl Dreyer, etc. But I think it's more rude. It's too heavy to be comfortable and too nervous to be effective for a long time. Finally it is annoying. <br /> <br /> The third point may be less intellectual observation. How can people responsible for this create movies about sexual deviations and incredibly boring sexual distortions? I found that this movie was impossible to pay attention to and everyone who was not automatically attracted to show sexual deviations would find it too. I do not want to not speak completely ridiculous and say that this film is pointless. But I must say that any point that the filmmakers are obscured by the nature of the movie-style copying data revealed (Probably because of fear of being accused of being false) <br /> <br /> This movie is a suspicious exercise from the beginning and doesn't really work for me.
