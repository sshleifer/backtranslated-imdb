This film was released on local TV here in South Africa recently, and I think I will warn even those who enjoy watching bad B grade movies (which I do) that are not amusing. The plot involves a couple visiting a home in the country. Some strangers appear and .... The problem is that most movies were filmed in the early seventies, consisting of the widest picture of people walking in real time and very slowly from A to B. This thing Make the movie boring Eventually and the expected blood and stabbing returns never occurred. I really want to know - how many people are watching this from beginning to end?
