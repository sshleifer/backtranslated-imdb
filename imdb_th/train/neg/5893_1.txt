This movie is a great movie as well as scary as hell. And I mean it surprised me as much as pulses and IT and other omen, but with a great movie coming to an end, right? right! The ending of this movie is pathetic. I mean, the ghost turned his back in the chicks' house and thought that now I had done that meant I could call her and it would be the right time because she thought it was right? Wrong. My ass! I don't care that the ghost is Satan. It doesn't happen. Is a movie, yes But it is the most evil movie or such praised movie has a reasonable meaning But not so It shows us what I just said and what people don't think. Someone, please tell me why you didn't notice the pathetic part. The movie for me ends in the hospital and that's all. Check number 3, it kicks more ass
