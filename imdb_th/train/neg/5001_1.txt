I don't know why I show this stupid reality. I have watched some episodes of the program. (Marathon cable program when they broadcast 5 consecutive episodes or something, I don't see the whole story. Like the third episode) because I am pregnant nine months and are going to work every day, maybe I'm just bored today :-) <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for Britney. I really do it for you. Money and fame. She seems to have very little respect, or she is the center of her own. She is married to Nitwit Federline (anyone who can make mistakes) and before that, she "performed" the show. Scary about her daily life too He, where she pushed the video camera wherever she felt it, whether in front of someone or showering while Federline stood there She babbled about her sex life without leaving anything to your imagination. I was not interested in my part. But I couldn't help but wondering how she felt about this when she was divorced and yes because of her. But I shouldn't be. She seems to have a life that is quite empty and shallow. But I don't want to exchange life with you even if I can. TV Road Kill if you like
