'Say Yes' is one of the movies that you expect to improve. But never did it as an 'inspiring psycho, decided to intimidate an innocent couple' in order to be loved by the filmmakers of the video directly. <br /> <br /> The conversation is boring and in many ways That is poorly translated The performance is not as good, especially from the villain played by Joong-Hoon Park. He seems to think that not blinking and trying to speak with a heavy voice, he is making his character look dangerous when everything. It makes him look easier. <br /> <br /> The plot deserves a special mention. It is too stupid to believe. 'Heroes' don't think it's too strange that people waving their cars threatening to kill them. The heroine' twice enough to miss to see the villain when he is no more than one. Feet from her The villain has passed the police checkpoint. (While wearing a coat of blood and a band of blood-stained cloth) by showing the police to see the body that was burnt in the passenger seat of the car he was driving The villain is punched by a shovel and attached to a pitchfork. But does not seem to be prevented from serious injuries And don't let me start with the horrible 'twist'. Sheesh <br /> <br /> The point of interest in this movie for me is that Sang Mi Chu is a very beautiful person. But actually no more than ordinary actors. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie came out like a bad writing. But it fails every time due to lack of ability in everyone involved
