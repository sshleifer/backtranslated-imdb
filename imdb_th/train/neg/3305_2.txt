I didn't see funny things in this movie. Humor seems to be set for the body. It's slow. This story is too easy to be true. The character is not very sympathetic. Nothing surprising happened. What does the author of this chapter think? "Oooo funny! Make the old woman high in the pot! Make them .... giggling! Make them ... behave like small children !! Oooo Yes, it's great and original! "<br /> br> This movie makes me the most angry from all the movies I've seen in five years. Ago
