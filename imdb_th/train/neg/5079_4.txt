It's a great actor who has a horrible story ... <br /> <br /> The film and its production are quite good, even if it's in London. Never mind seeing one of the cathedrals you've seen. All of them <br /> <br /> The story, however ... is about a man born with the power to release death and destruction to anyone and whatever wishes. There is only a reference. To the real-life instances of telekinesis to describe an image of a man in the wrong way and was convicted as a teenager and eventually as a man; In fact, he really wants revenge. Over time, he concluded that the whole world was heading in the wrong direction. Just thinking about it. <br /> <br /> The problem with storytelling is trying to gather genuine scientific information about strange psychic powers and integrate with claptrap as a religion to create a hodge. Theory about it all Mixing truth and imagination in this way doesn't work well? And I'm afraid that Richard Burton will have to show too many gestures at times when trying to believe However, his best scene was when he let her wife and lover put the words as they left his house: the sharp, witty and deadly dialogue delivered only by Burton. <Br /> <br /> A good actor, although helping to make things look better, but starting from Lino Ventura, which I saw last in Garde A Vu (1981) as Brunel's inspector; Harry Andrews as an assistant command; Lee Remick, who has a much lower rating as Dr Zonfeld; Derek Jacobi as Towney's publisher and a few other well-known actors. <br /> <br /> I like how to present the story as a flashback. Back on the back story to fill the story backward Of trying to kill Morlar (Richard Burton), a writer with a habit of killing Until that point, it was Brunel's good detective work and his close friend. Even so, it was very predictable because it was clear that I was a murderer who wanted quickly. <br /> <br /> Then they went and destroyed it in the last fifteen minutes. If you need a clue about that, think Samson and Delilah (1949) from the famous Cecil B. DeMille and how Samson eventually gets the bad guy. And the last scene is just an idiot. Why? Because there are at least a hundred ways in which the rampage of Morlar may stop. Of course, the real shame because this may be a much better story and movie I think Burton needs real money. <br /> <br /> If you are a Burton fan, you should take the time to see the scene I mentioned above. Otherwise, don't worry.
