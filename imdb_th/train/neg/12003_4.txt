Six different pairs Six different love stories Six different angles of love Eighty viewers in the theater Look at the different parts of the eighty silver screen. <br /> <br /> I'm sitting somewhere between them. Look at the center of the screen to find out what happened in the movie. The whole story has no reciprocal links. But there are places where Nikhil Advani tries to show the relationship between them. I tried to find a few lines that I could write as a review. But at the end of 3 hours and 15 minutes, I couldn't find anything to write. This movie is a cute Hollywood blockbuster movie. True love. <br /> <br /> My advice. Don't watch movies if you want to watch really good movies.
