The opening movie of David Mamet has been praised by many people as a movie of a true thinker, a movie that makes you question everyone and everything. I saw it for the first time recently and didn't understand what should be good about it. <br /> <br /> This film is about a female psychologist named Margaret, a writer who sells. best Margaret didn't care about her career and she couldn't really help anyone. She tried to fix this by helping to pay off her patient's gambling debt with a shark named Mike (played by Joe Mantegna, which is the only reason to watch this movie). Confident in her career when she was almost a victim of fraud Intrigued, she came back to meet him and asked him to show her how the impostor worked. (She plans to use this as the subject of a new psychology book). Then she falls in love with him and goes with him in the long term that he and his colleagues set. <br /> <br /> I don't. Feel like going into details But at the end of this movie is revealed The whole film event was controlled by Mike and his followers to cheat Margaret from $ 80,000. <br /> <br /> First of all, the big twist to the end is very predictable. That the impostors were performing very clearly by performing on stage and in strange ways. Not only that, but the audience (and the main characters) knew that they were dealing with a male prisoner, so it was a huge surprise. When We know that Margaret was deceived? In addition, Margaret is a wise psychologist who is an expert in reading people. But she allows herself to be trapped too easily - and remember, she knows that Mike is an anti-artist. <br /> <br /> Second, we are led to believe that Margaret was detained. From the beginning But in order for the resistance to work in the end, she had to do many things that men could not predict that she would do. First of all, she had to decide to help pay off the patient's debt, allowing her to meet the male prisoner first If you don't do this, all resistance will fail. I just have to say that it is not reasonable to think that a psychologist will take it to pay off the gambling debt of the patient himself. Not only that But the chance that the men's conditioner will be in the right spot on the night she decides to appear? They performed at that bar every night, hoping that she would meet them or not? Another thing that has to happen that is unpredictable is that Margaret must return to meet Mike again and ask him to teach his trade trick. What is the odds of this happening? And yet, all the conventions depend on this evidence. <br /> <br /> Another problem I have is the ending. Margaret learns that she is imprisoned and decides to take revenge on Mike. At first, Mettet convinced us that she was about to enter the competition. But it passed so the best ending was that she shot the mic down at the airport luggage area Anyway, it feels like a clumsy and unsuitable way to end the movie about the artist against their trade. Not only that But she didn't use the money he stole from her. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie makes you feel empty and ineffective. And if you, like me, predict in advance that Margaret will be imprisoned, you will find that this revelation is not satisfactory.
