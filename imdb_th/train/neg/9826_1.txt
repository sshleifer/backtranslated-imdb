I guess this will be a great movie for true believers in Christian Dogma that are organized. But for anyone with an open mind that believes in free will, rational thinking, separation of the Church and State and good science fiction. Br /> <br /> There are some actors who do not want work or want Share your personal beliefs with the rest of us, all of us. <br /> <br /> I have been entertained by this. The movie in the same way that I have been entertained by "Reefer Madness". The film tries to teach drugs using fear-like tactics as this film tries to teach "Christian" principles with threats from hell and Suffering for good people who don't share our worldly interpretation. <br /> <br /> It makes me laugh great and at the same time makes me afraid to realize how many people. Believe that our society should go back to the good old age of the 19th century!
