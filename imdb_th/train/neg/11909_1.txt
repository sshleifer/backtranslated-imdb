I think I met the movie about the most hatred of all time: Darklight <br /> <br /> The most important part of this movie - Lilith is Adam's first wife and she is seen as not. Complete and exiled from Eden Equal and refused to succumb to him Look, I took those words straight from the script. Then the film continues and even though she is the movie's heroine But the only time she became acceptable was when she did what the man ordered her to do! She finished the movie under the control of The Faith - all the boys! <br /> <br /> In addition to the predictable script, and the FX is terrible, apart from the obvious hatred of women who are often more subtle in modern movies, nothing is original about Darklight
