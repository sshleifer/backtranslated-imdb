I found that this movie was boring, boring and not interesting at the end. "Energetic" and "superficial" which is not a true story for the overall story Following these characters on the weekend of horrific events, hostile attitudes and bad news is not my opinion for movies that look interesting and I'm very bored with the topic "One Note" and can't wait To end - in fact I almost stopped about half way Both movies seem pointless and lost, and most of the characters look depressed and unpleasant, even though the performance is good. Small movie with small ambitions and a little appeal - sorry, but it did not make to me and I love a good little movie! This one is not a gel, although I look at it, hoping and trusting it. I was disappointed, especially after two local inspectors put it in the list. "The best 10 years of the year" I highly recommend watching "The House of Sand" instead - now has a good little movie!
