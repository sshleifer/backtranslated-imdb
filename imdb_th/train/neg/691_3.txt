This may not fit the end of a typical Slasher movie, but it is a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> The Holiday premise makes it interesting. But after the first scene, the movie shows that it's terrible. Production value and stupid plot I mean, the subcategory is now all about crazy teenagers who can't see without clear reason. But this one takes too long There is no definite connection in the event or nothing. <br /> <br /> The clich√®s are more boring, boring, less bloody and mysterious. <br /> <br /> This is a fairly moderate slasher that doesn't Should be hyped even if the label is nastie. <br /> <br /> I'm really disappointed by this overrated trash piece.
