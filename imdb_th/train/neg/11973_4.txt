This may be one of the worst French movies I've ever seen in more than 100 French movies I've seen. Great screenplay and unprofessional performances make the director lack power. With no matter what the beautiful western French scene and fancy music can add to the story I don't care what happens to them. <br /> <br /> Did it surprise me that this film won the jury award in Cannes? I love almost all award-winning movies in Cannon city But not this movie Big disappointment for me
