Two types of movies that we like are (1) Western and (2) Movies from 30 or 40 years ago. We should like men called Slade; But ..... <br /> <br /> But ... this image is not annoying and silly. From beginning to end Because nobody in the story (Good or bad) to warm up, so no one will stimulate the suspicion necessary to keep the audience interested There is no intimacy between those who try to steal gold and there is no friendship among those who try to protect it. Slade has a beautiful girl friend. But there is no reason why she suffocated from a man or why she wanted to be in the same room as a pig that does not have an account And scary music scores and writing and terrible directions Groups .
