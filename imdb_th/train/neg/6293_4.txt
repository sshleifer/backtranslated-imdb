I'm happy to watch this movie early and I have to say that I think it's boring and wondering how they will improve the undergraduate degree in 1984 starring Tom Hanks, which I think. Quite good ... I was right ... In all honesty I thought it would be better ... Of course there were some funny moments. But it doesn't seem to mark me ... The performance is ok, and the story is quite good according to the original, but I think it's a lot better ... this movie I will say for teenagers and Children with good minds Full of female body, alcohol and sex ... It's a typical movie of a party mill that is repeated 4/10. My score is for this.
