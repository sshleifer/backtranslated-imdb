If this movie is a character, the movie can stand on its own and make a neutral decision. Unfortunately for the audience, this movie is based on "The facts" that unfairly shed Reuben Carter Many small facts are ignored. (Carter is not the number one contender in the time of the murder. There is no evidence that he helped a friend from a young child abuse child). Was robbed by Joey Giardello's decision because the "racist" judges forgive us for seeing the fight on tape and completely disrespect Giardello. Why does Hollywood feel the need to create heroes from some good people Most have problems and have more problems than any normal person should be. (Arrested multiple times because of beating women) is strange to me. Ruben Carter never saw his actions in the 60s and now when he refuses to speak to his son, people who can see it all People know that Jewison can be directed and Washington can act. But why do they choose this as their vehicle is beyond me? Hollywood wants a black hero that they want to bend the truth in all their biological images so that they believe it or not? (This is a suggestion, then how will Denzel play a movie about himself? Now it is an inspiration.) From all inaccuracies in the movie, I recommend sending this story.
