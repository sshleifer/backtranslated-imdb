Liongate has not proven itself. All movies from Lionsgate are superb. I tried and tried to give them more opportunities, and they slapped me over and over again, and Cabin Fever was no exception. <br /> <br /> I can't even care about this movie, most of that. It's frustrating and bad. <br /> <br /> This is the storyline. Men cut dead dogs for some reason. Received a virus randomly sent to the children at the camp. Children began to get infected and died. The city knew this and instead helped them kill them. Then the water will become infected and everyone will die. Finally <br /> <br /> Seriously, that is the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Every character is completely cluttered. And one child should be stuck With boys found the world Me and my friends found that talking about how one of our classmates is fat and how fat is more fun than paying attention to this film. We tried to end it while screaming for $ @ t because this movie will make you do that. <br /> <br /> And I'm still confused with the random karate's slow movement. One random child and clearly everyone in that country has complete intelligence and pride. And why does this dog hurt the girl? Why does the boy Hicks try to kill, sit on a chair, wait for them to kill him? That's part of their two plans. Wow. The best plan. I can't believe that this movie has a drama. I can't stomach the DVD at all, having to sit in a theater that isn't moving for an hour and a half. It's not scary or funny or cool or whatever. It's just a 90 minute waste that you can use ... I don't know how to grow trees or something. It is more effective than this waste. Performing special effects and scripts is a joke. Never picked it up. <br /> <br /> The cabin fever will get a nasty leg shave scene once from 10.
