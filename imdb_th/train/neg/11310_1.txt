First of all, yes, animals are emotional. If you don't know that, I believe you are a mentally retarded person. But suppose we don't have mental retardation We all know that animals have emotions, and now we want to see whether these emotions appear in the right nature. <br /> <br /> What we get instead of a boring and simple documentary which Trying to show how animals are "human". The filmmakers search for images of animals with high and low human behavior. And when they happen, they say "That monkey is almost human!" (That is a direct word) <br /> <br /> Everything is in human condition. They wasted time in setting the theory about what makes dogs "smiling", but they don't talk about what it means to wag the tail. The arrogance of these researchers is disgusting. They also show chimpanzees in human clothing and wear a cowboy hat. <br /> <br /> I expect to see a documentary about animals in their own sense. I want to learn how animals emit sounds in their own language. But the researchers came back to observe and observed about humans and humans. Add awesome soundtrack and pictures of chimpanzees. "Celebrate Christmas" and this is enough to make my stomach. <br /> <br /> But it doesn't end there. Half of this documentary was not filmed in the forest. But in the laboratory and experimental place Images from all chimpanzees through steel bars and we see how these monkeys gather in a sterile concrete cage. The moment of consciousness that occurred near the beginning (Even if you have to observe quickly), the captive monkey speaks in sign language that "Want to go out a bit soon" <br /> <br /> There are clear references. Stress Testing "And psychological experiments that I shake to imagine The baby monkey was separated from their mother when they were first born and received a doll to prove that the baby monkey was "the mother". To get a great conclusion: The monkey has emotions. <br /> <br /> A chimpanzee named "Washoe" has been in a concrete cage since 1966 and to this day she still remains. We had a brief glimpse (again through the bar) of her against a concrete wall with a rather lackluster expression. Personally, I don't need to see any additional experimental data. Washoe, I'm sorry for all of our species.
