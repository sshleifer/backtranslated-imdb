Five minutes in this movie, you know you've seen it before. It is a boiler room. It is a company and it is what gives support. And there is no new element here except Bill Gates-allegory All clear Conspiracy is always good for making movies. But why is it so extreme? The boiler room is a good movie because at least it looks realistic. In antitrust everything is wrong. How realistic is it that your boss pays a fraud to be your girlfriend to make you work harder? I'll give it 1 but the soundtrack is OK.
