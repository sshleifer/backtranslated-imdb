This is one of the most boring horror movies I've ever seen. College kids have an outbreak of nightmares related to the soul roaming at Alcatraz trying to deliver "Nightmare on Elm Street" and the standard vampire fare in the form of a bad 80s music video. With bad performances and slow moving stories thoroughly Although it is often a bad movie and laughing. (Digging those mallets and scary conversations) but it's a good thing to be a fictitious episode of the Mystery Science 3000 episode. Don't be fooled by the movie's mention. Winning the Silver Scroll Award in 1987 by the Academy of Sicence Fiction, Fanatasy and Horror or Devo contributed to the soundtrack or Tony Basil participating in this film. It's a big disaster. But one thing that has a small cult following (see other IMDB comments for this film)
