This movie is one of the worst movies of the year. The main character does not have chemistry and the performance is terrible. Paul Rudd is the only person who has the talent and the only one that is not annoying. But in this film she is scary As if she didn't know anything about acting All of her characters were groaned throughout the story, and she couldn't pull herself out as a person and still have fun. And another girl, Lake Bell, showing a little emotion, and it's like you are watching a cue card while you read. <br /> <br /> For the story, it's a cookie cutter. It changed from point A to B with a little surprise. There may be a lot more to use with Kate as a ghost. The plot should have more circulation around her and what she does as a spirit. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: It's not worth it look
