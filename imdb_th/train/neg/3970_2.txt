Been watching - I've seen LOTS already and I mean many of these movies. Did you know that DVD covers are just that good-looking and scary that you can't wait to watch? I got the GOT again and I got bored with it. But I digress It's quite easy. It sucks. (I know that it's quite young and youthful) But it did. AndI agrees with other posters that if we have to sit and watch the boring stuff, why? And the scowl she used to convey the pain / grief that was not resolved about the death of her daughter did not help anything I mean Jesus .. Oh, but the thing that crawled on her back, the demon was quite neat ...
