Even though I enjoy Bing Crosby in other movies, I find that this movie is particularly disgusting. Probably because I came from different eras and different countries. But I found that Crosby's continued reference to Good Old USA was satisfactory at first. Don't understand me wrong - I'm not an anti-American person - but it seems that English is not correct and / or needs this courage. Oh, a wise American visitor must show them. It's a story "Fish out of the water" but unlike most movies of this type, this time is a "fish" that has superior ability. To be fair, both myself and the movie, I watched it a few times over the past few years and received the same impression every time. <br /> <br /> (I watched the movie Crosby again. Last night - The Emperor's Waltz - and that created the same reaction in me and surprised me even my wife - for what it was worth American - found the attitude "in front of you" of American Crosby at Will irritate Is one too many references to Teddy Roosevelt as she put it) <br /> <br /> For the evidence of the movie, it is special today and the supporting actors are very good. The scenery and music are as good as the great costumes - although I agree with previous critics that Vic on William Bendix looks scary (Moe's The Three Stooges) <br /> <br /> All in all For me, this will be a more enjoyable picture without Bing Crosby's attitude, but because he is in almost every shot, it is quite difficult to watch this movie.
