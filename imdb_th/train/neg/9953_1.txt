I have to watch a good movie soon because it seems like every item is something I hate. However, my history says I must not lie. Bobby Deerfield and everything about it, sucking a large green banana peel I never thought of seeing a thunderous movie like it had been. Al Pacino did not act in this film: he posed with many scenes in his character, a race car driver, just staring at camera He is completely scary. Marthe Keller is terrible. These two people should be in love and nothing chemistry. Did Sydney Pollack direct this movie? There is no trace of the genius behind Tootsie. This is the only man I cheer on Eyes Wide Shut? I hardly believe it. Help yourself with an awesome movie experience. Run, don't walk away from Bobby Deerfield.
