When this comedy has an amazing soundtrack on the back cover, you'll know you're not involved in a famous movie. I rented this movie with friends who expected to get laughed. But overall, most of us laugh together, making the movie fun. We didn't choose a movie that was worse. <br /> <br /> The movie might be fine if there is a slight change. First of all, the comedy is painful. Physical pulp is poorly executed and laid out. The fat boy in this movie makes us want to commit suicide, giving him blessings for trying out scenes and scenes. But he is like a puppy asking for love If he was pulled out of the movie, everything could be acceptable. There are some funny jokes. I believe there was a time when a group of boys stole a pornographic movie of a parent and became a gay porn movie. But to summarize the best jokes, I will tell the gag for fat children He wore a puffy coat and talked about things that he didn't know what to do. <br /> <br /> When finished, the editor of this movie can save the director's life. School scenes and endings that are longer than thirty seconds of random quarrels His jokes are not to be missed or appreciated. Other rewarding elements in this film are the beautiful Ali Ali Landry. Her character is ignored by most movies that are ashamed. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time even renting this movie It didn't attract me and I was part of the target group (18 men)
