Previously, I had never known that in the early 1990s Devry University (or ITT Tech?) Had added a movie to a program of excellent technical degrees. This movie must be the work of the department in the class. My friend and I rented the original Boogeyman in 1980 on my Netflix and this movie is on the flip side of the DVD. Don't waste time on this movie. Scary, scary. <br /> <br /> The creator has added 2 main characters, namely, women and her therapists. The woman had a dream about Boogeyman and his victims from the first movie. Over 50% of the movie came from the original movie. The rest of the film is the main character who has a bad dream while her therapists mumble with the narrator. These scenes were shot through filters to make the characters glow. They will make Angela Lansbury look 25 years old. So to summarize, great. Don't watch this movie.
