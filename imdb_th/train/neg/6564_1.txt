The rest of humanity, the pain of watching this movie It has great actors, so you keep watching, so it's good. I mean, Sean Astin "Andrew" (playing his part perfectly, doing very well. Very bad in this movie. ), Kyra Sedgwick "Bevan" Ron Livingston "Chad", Ren√©e Zellweger "Poet" (They put her name on the cover. She has a total of 1 line and less than 4 seconds in the entire movie ... <br /> <br /> If the actor has any dignity, they will go out and buy all copies of the movie. This and burn them, along with writer / director George Hickenlooper and Writer John Enbom.
