I just rented Creep and wasn't impressed. I don't feel anything in this movie. I felt uncomfortable because only one blood was shocked. <br /> <br /> I walked out of the living room many times with the hope that what would happen to this movie. Have we never seen this before? I don't like any characters that cause men to fall into the drain pipe. I feel bad for him But then again, I can't think of why he was alive and not being killed by Creep? Needing to answer many questions, so <br /> <br /> Some people refer to references to Silent Hill and I can see the similarities clearly. <br /> <br /> Not a bad movie Judge for yourself
