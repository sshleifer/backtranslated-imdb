As Goethe had said, there is no point in trying to pass on the negative judgment which desires to have a purpose "The Greatest Effect" "La Maman and La Putain" has passed into history, of course, influencing what happened in France and elsewhere in the last thirty years and no one is interested in history. Of course the movie should be forbidden to watch. However, in purely personal comments, I feel compelled to disagree with other reviews posted here and say to others: "Don't look. It's a waste of hours that will make you feel less. Comfortable and angry. "And without that I mean "Sick and angry" about "human condition" or anything that is so general and profound, because that is what most critics accept to praise the film - "pain" to see the separation of ruthlessness of Cowardice and our emotional cruelty "and others - and if it can deal with messages that are internationally relevant or even broadly, this director There will be good reasons to be satisfied with yourself. However, in pessimism, his conclusion may be My beef and the film are quite that I do not see the record of the use of emptiness and treachery for many hours to demonstrate the legitimacy or excuse from any general related message. The three main characters are profoundly unscrupulous: Alexandre certainly reached the greatest level because we saw him the most and because he barely stopped for more than thirty seconds. Marie may be the least because we see her the least. Alexander, who is affected and pretentious, has entertainment, of course.
