In the past year, Uwe Boll has shown little development as a filmmaker who brings talent. "In the name of the king" (cloning "Lord of the Rings") and arrogant, rude to post 9/11. "But then" seed "and the counter is reset to zero, causing his bid to be correct. Law and respect which is beyond reach And I am a big fan of this film that he has a unique and boring vision. <br /> <br /> Born from his frustration in the first movie he received "Seed". Which is a huge misunderstanding of the social criticism and the frenzied extremism of creating a strong hit legend (Boll often seems to take the face of Rob Zombie's successful "Halloween" reboot). Maxwell seeds (Wilderson), a ferocious quiet who killed 666 people and sat on the death row waiting for execution; After the killing of an evil creature was unsuccessful, he got up from the grave for revenge on those who had made him there ... and started free-of-charge physical attacks. <br /> <br /> Try to create Lash in the new millennium. The veins of Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees, Max Seed are not boring and too boring to leave the impression of the most similar to professional wrestlers who wash their mouths by doing "The Toolbox Murders". As Of boring victims Moreover, Seed's character and Boll's "message" are contrary to others: the death penalty is definitely wrong. But do we expect to be sympathetic to Anatta's killer who left two hundred hundred bodies in his wake? I don't think. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Michael Pare acted as a long-lost brother of James Remar's character in "Dexter": The police sat at his desk. Watching the scene stop the pointless movement of animals and people trapped in Seed's cave by the time he and the police cardboard of the storm. The hidden seed of the sequence has been pulled out badly. (Light is virtually non-existent) and not exciting. (Despite having a healthy blood supply) until almost causing me to sleep. <br /> <br /> Making a movie that is not just limited to that scene: "Seed" seems to be filmed by the filmmakers. Drunk movies because of the bobs and weaves are not limited to more techniques. The stomach changes over the blood. These protracted little things only attracted attention to the winding storytelling that almost never existed in 90 minutes. The film was adapted enough to be considered a form of torture that could be The intention of Boll has always been <br /> <br /> Pure genius ... I guess it's funny to me.
