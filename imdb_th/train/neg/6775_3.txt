I am very happy to see this movie in the local video library - Carrie Grant in the comedy movie director Stanley Donnen. Until now, what didn't you like? It's the type of movie that makes me wonder two things - when everyone is involved. (Including well-known names) realizing that they have turkeys in their hands and the worst thing about it in various aspects Still pondering first But my vote goes to the story that is winding ahead of the script, sometimes insolent, insolent speech, uncertain sound, lack of consistent style and good development and lack of harmony between characters You have to add uneven performances to criticism. But it is understandable that the actors are struggling with this and besides, it seems to be rehearsed. Often they can separate the line quickly enough. Nucleus Grant tries to show his charming and gentle personality. But sometimes it seems uneasy I must say that I was relieved when the initial instructions of his character were twinned with Jayne Mansfield, which was rudely unsettling with the appearance of Suzy Parker. What is something like this movie? - For me, most of the beauty of Parker, which acts as a restraint and noble honor as Grace Kelly Generally speaking, this is a good thing to watch. The characters in the navy are very smart in their uniforms - however, you have to truly doubt about the Fu Manchu robes that they wear in their luxury hotel suits. Even Grant didn't look beautiful in him. Back to the credit, Ray Walston worked with praiseworthiness with his character and for me interested in hearing Heroes Werner Klemperer pre-Hogan of Heroes. Speaking without emphasizing the German accent!
