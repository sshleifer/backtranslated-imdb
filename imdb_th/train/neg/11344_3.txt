I am very impressed with Cinderella 2 and Jungle Book 2. But this may be worse than both names. First of all, I don't like many cartoon animations on Saturday morning. But worse than in some scenes I like some characters, such as Thunderbolt and Patch, but other characters like Cruella seem normal. Cruella is truly insidious at first. But she lost quality in the sequel What she said was nothing to write about at home and her animation was ugly. Lars, her artist's friend, is a joke to be honest with you and Roger seems to quit smoking overnight. The sound ability is very good, although especially Barry Bostwick as a Thunderbolt except Jodi Benson accents that destroy it for me. Have a good time But the whole plot seemed bloated for me and highly recommended from the extended TV episode. In summary, it is a very disappointing sequel for the most memorable 60s Disney movies along with the Jungle Book. Sorry, I only gave this 3/10, not just my cup of tea. Bethany Cox
