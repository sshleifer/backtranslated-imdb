My name is Puerto Ricans and this is one of the worst documentaries I've ever seen. You can see that the people on it are unclean. They don't know much about Puerto Rico and its culture. They claim to be Puerto Rican people because they come from Puerto Ricans. But they may know less than others You can see while they are saying that they conflict with themselves. If you want to see the real thing and I mean the genuine documentary from Puerto Rico, you have to see "Mi Puerto Rico" that is a serious and serious documentary Unlike this garbage Rosie Perez uses this documentary to himself. I think it's probably about Puerto Ricans. They repeat. I don't know. That's the only thing they get in what is called a documentary. I hate to see this garbage that uses the island name. It causes the standard to decrease.
