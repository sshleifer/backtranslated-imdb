In theory, the director's description should be effective. Rob Bryden, who has a role as Peter DeLane, a former television director, tells his experiences behind the camera. Among the programs he was accused of were 'Bonanza', 'Flambards', 'The Duchess Of Duke Street' and 'The Bounder'. /> <br /> But in practice, it is a frustrating failure. It's a funny program, and jokes aren't particularly funny. The script lacks complete intelligence and Bryden fails to convince the old man. Whenever stuck with something fun to say, which is like every five seconds, he laughs and laughs. Instead of having fun from DeLane, you want to shoot him. If Chatchara strikes you with hilarity, this is a good thing for you. <br /> <br /> It doesn't help anything that the parody has exceptions. 'Mr & Mrs' and 'Crossroads' are quite good. For jokes that will work, they need to be really scary, like 'Charlie's Angels', 'OTT', 'Telly Addicts', 'Neighbors' and 'New Faces'. <br /> <br /> Great performances. Time, so we are fortunate to receive the horrors of future generations. It won't be ridiculous if 'Director's opinion' One day, it's a matter of deception?
