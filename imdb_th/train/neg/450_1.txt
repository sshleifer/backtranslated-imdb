This show is painful to see ... <br /> <br /> Clearly, the creator has no clue what to do with this program from the ever-changing "work". It seems that they want to show Amanda Bynes in something ... but don't know what and what happens to this crappy performance. They threw her as a teenager, surrounded by twenty-thirty things and put her in a situation where most adults who tried to joke repeatedly failed. Soon they realized that she wanted "priests" and made people in their late 20s try to pass as teenagers. <br /> <br /> How did this show survive for 4 seasons In what way, ABC now decided that it was a "family" program and threw it into the ABC family lineup.
