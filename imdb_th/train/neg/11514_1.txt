There is no doubt that when Madonna and Guy Ritchie got married, that was because they both thought it would help them film their career. If you pass the "Swept Away" test, you will know that at that level it is a competition that takes place in hell after nearly 20 years of trying to become a famous actress (or "octress" because she may pronounce in "The next best thing") She still can't leave herself long enough to change the performance that everyone has. The taste can be called good. And that is what makes people dislike her very much on the screen: Gut feels that her ego is too high to make her unable to release her hands and connect with her audience. If there is justice in this universe, she just explodes her last chance.
