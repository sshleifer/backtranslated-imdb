Oh ... Bad clothes, worse and worst music: David Hasselhoff, 80s, came back with a vengeance in Witchery, co-producer between American and Italian, assisted by Joe 'D. 'Amato in production and short director (Thanks to Heaven for a small miracle), director Fabrizio Laurenti is the sequel to Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series in Italy. (Which has been dubbed "La Casa" in there), Witchery sends groceries, a little grocery and bad performances. <br /> <br /> A mix of ghost stories This film reflects the innocence from one scene to another, without letting the actors of the wood seriously, including hilarious day and night combinations, slowing down. unforeseen (I like your face ...) Surprisingly, Laurenti managed to gather the suspense and the air of malice in a few scenes - very little -; Unfortunately for them, a little twinkling of the movie magic is gentle and fast. <br /> <br /> Positive side experiences when blood hits fans. This department is quite effective and provides entertainment in the classic latex and red style of the 80's Italo-gore when everything is 100% handmade and shocking and lively according to a modest budget. I can watch with joy and sadistic, laughing very little, every way that the characters are nasty (and the actors) are disgusting and misuse one by one. I just felt sorry for Linda Blair, who was clearly not allowed to try other functions beyond the role of a good girl who had been in his career or it seems that when reviewing the work. His movies <br /> <br /> Well, not many people will tell and even a little to tell about the house. Don't expect too much when you spend the afternoon with this rain and maybe you get a little fun. It also helps if your little heart is rotten in the rhythm of the Euro 80 horror and heart speech - all movies that David Hasselhoff has received from the attention of large metal objects and blood. Flowing out hard around the room and the corridor must have it in the right place. <br /> <br /> This is my truth to be yours?
