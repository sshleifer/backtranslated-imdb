The full name of the movie is "Waqt: Race Against Time". That is a competition that no one can win. But you can reduce your loss rate without losing your precious "waqt" in this bakvaas. This film is clumsy and distorted in a way that makes the K3G look honest. It makes me too bewildered. It is foolish in its story and deserves to be mocked for it. <br /> <br /> It's not quite as bad as Baghban or the stupid black stupid with OTT performance, ridiculously by Amitji "plot". The middle is another disgusting example of the cruel, vulgar propaganda that bothered the BW movie in the family. If my father fed me and the people I loved deeply, treated me like Big B. I will shoot him myself. There is nothing to say about terminal illness.
