It's a ghost story It's about eating the same meat. It's a revenge story. It is a movie that is not very good and has a lot of violence. I think it will follow correctly along the lines of the movie slasher. Everything you have seen. It has a lonely place as usual. The cocky camp heads to the wilderness. Received. There are some scenes that are quite intense. It's so boring. Bad fixes and all works There is a ghost child who sounds like talking to a waste basket. I'm not really sure what the rules of ghosts and bugs with seed caps are playing with. There is also a wonderful scene in which a man eats meat which is left from his wife. My friend used to ask me why there is a need to show violence that is worthless. I am afraid that it is just another step in our evolution. Third, there is no intelligence. Here, there is no cheek tongue, just wasting time, sadness, a lot of blood.
