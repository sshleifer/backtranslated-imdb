How does this happen? I always like science fiction F / Bigfoot, no matter what the movie is. But I still expect them to write without much cheese like this. Sad effects, late being sad, avoiding all costs. I ended up renting because it was wrong in the case. (I'm looking for a Sasquatch movie with Lance Henrikson in it - haven't seen it yet. The idea of ​​this movie is really good. There is a lot of potential to make a little movie here. I just don't understand how this has become. Talk to students who are interested in movies / arts / English in high school and you will find people who can write better.
