This film is made for TV, so when considering this, I will not tear it as hard as the documentary. The script is a subset. But succeeded in being a gentle, gentle person, whether or not Most performances are beyond reality. But it is true for movies that are priced lower. <br /> <br /> The aspect of this movie that I really hate is 90-95%. But in a random place, there will be 5-10 seconds to shoot a video You can tell that because there is less contrast, the color is less vivid and the image is clear, 30 frames per second instead of 24 frames per second of the movie. I'm not sure that I might have to shoot these scenes later, and at that time they didn't have the money to film on the film. (I think this is the cause) but it's more confusing to see. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I've watched movies that are worse. But I don't want to say that I enjoy this movie and I can't recommend anyone to see it.
