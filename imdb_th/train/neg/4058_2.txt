From the beginning, you know how this movie will end. It's full of ancient ideas. Your general club members will not like this movie. I gave 2 out of 10 just because of William Benton's performance. I can't believe that people voted for 6+ for this movie. It has a lot of prejudice to 'The exact view' (once a thief ...) People are not born well. They were not born well. They were born with a clean slate. It is a parent society and education that makes them who they are. And if they turn wrong somewhere in the row, of course, it will not be the punishment system for the Americans that keeps them coming back! However, avoid this movie like a plague. I bet that you have something better to do with your time than lose it with this shit.
