Wow. Just scary. I am a big fan of the original movie and sat proudly reading. Episode 2, 3 and being updated 4,5 and Freddy's Dead are quite bad. But nothing is as bad as Freddy Freddy's nightmare acting as the host of Rod Serlingesq in this poetry series. <br /> <br /> I can accept that Freddy became one person later But at least in the movie Freddy's appeal that brought the movie Do not do well. They look like high school productions of horror series. Poor actors, if you want to call yourself after doing this, of course what they paid for I am almost certain that this is a stop for two types of actors. People just starting at the brand new Hollywood ladder are willing to participate to slow down the pornography they offered last week or the actors who have experienced traveling down the Hollywood stairs. Wood They have to get a pornographic job last week. <br /> <br /> I expect Dana Plato to be half as a guest star. But she died at the time of production. <br /> <br /> In order to paraphrase Nancy's original Elm St episode "What you never tried to fall asleep to see this"
