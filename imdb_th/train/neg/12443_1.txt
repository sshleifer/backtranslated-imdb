- Let me start by saying that I understand that Invasion of the Star Creatures intends to mock sci-fi movies in the 1950s. I understand that there is nothing that must be taken seriously. The problem I have is that it doesn't work. The parody should be funny and this is not possible. Not once during all the time, I can smile. In general, I'm an easy entertainer, but I can't find entertainment anywhere in the world. <br /> <br /> - I know I have problems from the first two stars. Up on the screen with one of the most funny gags possible - the water pipes that they can't control make them both wet. These two came out while the madman scrambled. Why would anyone want to show the drama and the role of Bowery Boys is above me? After the less-than-famous start, the film continues to show continuous images of humorous chases, Indian dances, vegetables, decoding rings and many more. It's just a waste of time. > <br /> - I bought two DVDs with Invasion of the Bee Girls. This movie is what won the Academy Award when compared to Invasion of the Star Creatures.
