This is a very boring movie. If you grew up in Vietnam when it was like that, you will see and hear all the movies and arguments here hundreds of times. But what makes this movie really boring is the description of director Carlton Sherwood. Most of the movies were filmed by Sherwood, who talked directly to the camera about his comments about this conflicting period in history. <br /> <br /> If you are old enough to remember Vietnam Not found anything new here. There is no new evidence to accuse John Kerry or new evidence worthy of other documentary films in Vietnam. The younger audience with an interest in watching George Butler! Stolen Honor's great movie is clearly John Kerry's hatchet, but it failed to achieve that miserably.
