This film is just one of the worst movies ever created and is a terrible allegation. But in the British film industry only This film is not only But only received mainstream releases But there are also good British actors as well I don't know, and just I don't care enough to participate in the discussion because this movie is so bad that I don't think. Be warned and stay away from these garbage. But obviously I have to write ten lines of text in this app, so I may have plot details The nobleman of a man was badly beaten by his friend and a colleague from the company. His father led to a confrontation with the Russian mafia and a dumb accent. I should ask for a refund. But may be shocked by the experience If you want a good crime movie, watch the usual suspects or godfather things about locking stocks .... That is the highest point of contemporary British crime movies .....
