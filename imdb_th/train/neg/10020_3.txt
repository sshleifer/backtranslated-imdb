Vijay Krishna Acharya 'Tashan' is a product that has an excessive pungent odor. Of course, it is one of the most stylish movies. But when it comes to content, even the masses will reject this matter. Why? The movie script is an amateur as well as a 2 year old baby. The script is a king. There is no good script. Even the greatest director of all time can't do anything. Tashan is produced by Yash Raj Films who are successful. The most and the Mega Star that appears in the ad But there is nothing in the world that can help you if your script is not interesting. Thumbs down! <br /> <br /> Performances: Anil Kapoor is an experienced actor. But how can he be okay with this role? Akshay Kumar is an excellent actor. In fact, he is a grace. Kareena Kapoor has never been so hot before. She looks amazing and makes you all stand up. Saif Ali Khan didn't get him here. Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Phawa and Yashpal Sharma wasted. <br /> <br /> 'Tashan' is a boring movie. The failure of the movie at the box office, you should avoid.
