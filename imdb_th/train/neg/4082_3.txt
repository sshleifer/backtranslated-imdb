This movie is a painful story to watch ... not in an amazing way that makes you cringe with emotions for characters that develop well in amazing situations. (Yes, I am very beautiful that makes the last sentence up when I go) but in just Absolutely boring way for more than two hours. Now, you may all think that I am just a critic who doesn't know about Shakespeare or "creating an art movie" ... Well, you are both wrong. I love the work of Shakespeare, especially the tragedies of Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth and Hamlet. And I watched many "arthouse" movies such as Eraserhead and Fellini's 8 1/2. Great. But this is just two hours. Shakespeare is gone for too long, too many nude pictures. (I can understand the artistic nudity in some scenes ... but not in every movie, every match !!! It is POINTLESS and the service has nothing for this !!!) And basically, creating movies that are exaggerated. I have high expectations for this film that it is "art" and an adaptation of Shakespeare's The Tempest ... but this is just a serious decline. I only gave this movie three stories because of the performance of Sir John Giggud. (Which is superior to all the titles in this movie) and the combination between design / movie because the scenes look like animated drawings ... However, this movie, many things would be better because just a drawing with scrolling text On the bottom True disappointment ... Maybe if Zeffirelli received the director's chair then this would be much better. But this is the opinion of the members, many other viewers may be more fun. If you can't find it from a nearby video store (not on DVD), don't try to go too far to find it ... it's not worth it.
