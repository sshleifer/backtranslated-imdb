Considering the potential that exists, the truth is disappointing. Although it is always good to see Jennifer Aniston in the movie, even though it cannot be turned back. Most actions can be predicted. Gentle jokes go meekly. And the characters are not very interesting I want to like this movie But it never happened Ben Stiller, hilarious in "There is something about Mary." Here, he seems to be moving through. If they have to raise scores from "friends", they should know that something is wrong. The bathroom should have a sense of humor in the closet. :-) <br /> <br /> See "First 50 days" instead.
