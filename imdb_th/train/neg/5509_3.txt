When I was a child in the 50s and 60s, things that connected with Disney were by definition. What happened? They can get actors and actors that they want the best time. However, Disney can make things out, despite having many resources. <br /> <br /> Disney can provide the best writers, producers and best directors. This movie shit The sad thing is that I wonder if Disney in their arrogance didn't even know when this movie was good or bad. <br /> <br /> It's because of the talent of the actors I can give to 3. From 10
