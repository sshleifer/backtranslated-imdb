I drew into this film, wanting to know how they adapted Hubert Shelby's cruel novel. I think that literature that has such depth with rich curtains, characters, gruesome situations and social criticism is not. Can be translated into a bad movie. I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie experience, not for content. But is a form Director Ulrich Eid, executed in my sincere opinion, which is a terrible governance that is unfair to the original book. It is not surprising that Edel is a television director. This movie looks like a flick. "Made for TV" that is not good. My opinion about this bomb (** Advance spoiler **): <br /> <br /> - Lack of creativity directed. The scene slowly felt slow, shot badly, and almost never shifted from the anchor position. The only freedom they have is in the movie area with dark tones. In addition, the film also has the same technical creativity as the TV series - <br /> <br /> - All actors do a great job to portray these miserable characters. The problem is adaptation, not fixing the basic elements in plot development: motivation. These characters move like robots without clear motivation in action. It seems that they do things from the blue, like robots without reason. Edel misses every opportunity to develop characters without exploring the character's motivation and avoiding the development of the character of each character. /> <br /> The lack of development of this character is clear in Tralala. Jennifer Jason Leight works well in playing this worthless prostitute. But her alcoholic decision to abuse her crew didn't explain. It looks very stupid when we see this character doing this thing out of the blue. This is a clear example of poor character development. <br /> <br /> The movie has many secondary characters, tokens that do nothing, don't feel anything, and don't add anything to the plot. The I would love to learn more about the wife of Harry and the interaction between the two. That is another missed opportunity to /> <br /> A. Del him <br character development close to Harry and editing his gay lover of his, only to end up at the end. The gangsters are a joke when they lack development. <br /> <br /> - The soundtrack is one of the worst things I've ever seen. A terrible job by Mark Knopfler. I seriously expect from the former boss. Of Dire Straits, but his work in this movie is serious. At times, such as in the fight between union employees and police, the music seems to be completely disconnected from the movie. It also gives a bad and completely unusual feeling. I can swear that all soundtracks are made with Casio's toy keyboard. It distracted from the action. <br /> <br /> - The book adapted by Desmond Nagano is a character that eliminates the story. Feeling as though they were trying hard to maintain the action story by acting in the book, they forgot to develop the character and explain their actions and inspiration again. <br /> <br /> I seriously can't recommend this movie even to Shelby fans because they can destroy the original book. It was a very unexpected attempt to adapt the novel and show very little creativity.
