Wow ... I can't believe how bad ZOMBIE DOOM is. I heard rumors, read reviews - but have to make myself feel better. Let me tell ya - it's a blast !!! The worst show of all films that have been made to be done while everyone involved is completely wasteful, inaccurate, and laughable. FX doesn't have a visible plot. That my grandmother shot it with a camcorder No jokes - made of tin foil - the list continues and continues ... <br /> <br /> Three people are stuck on an island with strange groups running around with plastic swords and tin foil. Two prisoners were released along with the insane rebel groups and received the start of the day before they were hunted by the remaining "tribe" groups ... That was quite ... <br /> <br >> Honestly - This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The budget must be around $ 200 and be used with the gore FX (which may actually not be a bad idea ...). Nothing will happen to ZOMBIE DOOM. In addition to the laughing scenes that look ridiculous at Laughing with HORRIBLY that has a dialogue dubbed This movie makes it possible to go out on a trip that doesn't have other budgets like PreMoto: Lord of the LIVING DEAD. It looks like TITANIC. Some people may rank ZD in the category "Very bad - good" - and I guess if Are you really drunk or high and watching with a few MST3K-style friends - I think it's like that? But not by me I hate everything about it. If ZOMBIE DOOM or ZOMBIE 90 (which is equally shocking and included in the "Bonus" in the ZD release of the Shock-O-Rama of ZD) represents other works of Andreas Schnaas - He should be banned from doing anything. By creating a movie again under the death penalty There are amusing kung fu fights in the second half of the movie and a lot of blood - so I will give you a lot of opportunities. 3/10 Generous - make yourself and cross this thing.
