I think this is probably a good movie and some parts of it are ok ... but overall it's a movie B, as well as a piece plot is ok. But there are many holes and strange things that do not increase Most of the performances are ok. I also see this worse as well :) <br /> <br /> The starting point is determined by cars driving in the desert, making "cool" but jumping over small dunes without Necessary, no need at all. (In slow motion! Sand before ... It will be a little better from there, but not so much. <br /> <br /> If you are renting here, buy another one and use this as a heater. Keep expectations low and may work for you.
