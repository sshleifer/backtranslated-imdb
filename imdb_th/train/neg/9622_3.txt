When I saw that the film was being shown on TV, I was looking forward. I grew up in the 1980s and like everyone else who grew up in that era, I saw teen movies and summer camps every 80s, so I couldn't be patient to watch this movie that completely fooled that type of movie. Really disappointing !! This movie has nothing but many jokes and jokes that have no plot and no content. And the filmmakers tried to make the humor completely dark The only good thing about this movie is the wardrobe, music and performance. It's a good thing to travel with nostalgia and see all summer style clothes in the 80s and similarly to music. And the performance was excellent all the time: almost all of Hollywood's best comedians appeared Unfortunately they don't have better content to work with
