The killing in this movie is not bad. But of course this movie It's even worse than that. It is not worth the wear and tear that may occur when you slide it into your DVD player. <br /> <br /> Not even the wear and tear that happens on your shoulders from the DVD store. And the time you spend on renting and watching it scary. <br /> <br /> It's too much to understand that everyone can say something positive about this movie. It's just a trend towards my naked masters that prevented me from stopping and increasing the pressure from my watch group. <br /> <br /> The manuscript is terrible. The director is even worse. <br /> <br /> I hope you do not see this as a way to destroy your fun. I want to see a fair warning: Don't waste your time watching this garbage!
