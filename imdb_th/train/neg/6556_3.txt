I bought this DVD for my brother, who is a big fan of Michelle Pfeiffer. I decided to watch it myself early last week. <br /> <br /> It's a sensible entertainment with two stories. Completely separate, with Michelle Pfeiffer more interesting in these two stories. She plays the Hollywood actor with a short relationship that is not successful. She slammed into Brian Kirvin. (A man who marries regularly with children) after driving her car into his back After becoming an enemy, he offered to drive home because she was not comfortable driving anymore. Finally, the development of love leads to tragedy when his wife discovers What happened at the end I was not ready. But the slow pacing and the daily TV direction will bring the drama out of the plot. <br /> <br /> The other part relates to the old studio leader played by Darren McGavin. Perform better with Kenneth McMillan, Lois Chiles, Steven Bauer and Stella Stevens. They all want something from the studio head. But finally when he was asked to resign, they all realized that their career would be nowhere. <br /> <br /> It passed the time, but not all that was interesting and I was glad that I didn't buy it. me I am not a fan of Michelle Pffeifer, but she is recognized as the only actor who is worth watching in this film, and even in 1983 she was a good actor. Overall, even if you are your boyfriend, avoid it because it is a daily routine.
