We all have seen the endless epic in our era. But this one really peaks at all! This movie is very long and slow, just to make things in view. I feel much older when I leave the cinema than I come in. At almost 4 hours, it may have been made into a remote movie. <br /> <br /> Things that started as a comedian tend to slowly move. Nikhil advani weaves 6 stories. Love and he cannot create justice for any one of them ... There is no connection between them to begin with and the links shown in the last 20 minutes seem to be forced to The story continues. <br /> <br /> The situation worsened by Silly's dialogue (mostly repeated in Hindi movies over the years) and stupid movies. <br /> <br /> Priyanka doesn't know if she really wants to play her. The role is more than looking on the screen. ... Beauty waste without having the skills to show. <br /> <br /> Then there was a loud voice - funny, govinda & my face twisted - well Than - Jim-Carrey Akachay Kanna, who voiced his voice on the lungs to make the weary audience weary. <br /> <br /> The only good part in this movie is love Of John & Wittaya and good performances / comedy by Soho But they did well in their role that only two of these could justify the movie without having to get involved with other characters. Their intelligence disappeared in the midst of a low plot. <br /> <br /> I guess - the director made two films separately. (Maybe more!) And some inexperienced assistants blend all records over the point Sort them out, so the director has no choice but to show it as a single movie ... <br /> <br /> Watch it only when you want to test your patience !!!
