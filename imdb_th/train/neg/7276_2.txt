You can call this flop and that is also very big! The quality is not related to the word "National Lampoon", but at least the Vacation and Animal House programs are fun, but this proposal must be the most unconscious feature on the day I watch. The map made the Hollywood movie overwhelming, which became a ridiculous and ridiculous ashes. <br /> <br /> "Grow by yourself." To quit his job and split with his wife so that they can grow up and do what they want to do. That is life like Jason sees it, and he takes care of the kids, but his decision to follow this path may not be the right thing. <br /> <br /> Talk about the leader, boring and hard. blunt What is truly interesting is the cute small show of Diane Lane. The satirical element here seems to point out something more than actually just sending it. Stupid humor makes it stressful, flat and unconscious. In particular, Peter Riegert gives the role of leadership and bubbles. Teresa Ganzel with her role <br / > <br /> "Success Wanters" - After finishing the cover art, Dominique Corsair got a job as a dancer by the chairman of the dairy company. For the payback, she became interested in the margarine industry and found a way to 'the best. Elite '<b r /> <br /> Probably one of the three best. But the competition is not too good Want to go deeper with the tone that has sex power and power But still felt that tacky and forced thoughts had something that was likely and creative to build Do anything that likes humor, try But often it doesn't come out even though the glamorous Ann Dusenberry's hunger is quite cold and embezzled all the time. (After painful pain) and likes to express gracefully A bit even a stingy stripper dress seems to be getting a full workout in the first half of the story popping up in an amusing little pendant from Dick Millar, Mary Woronov, Olympia Dukakis, Fred Willard, Robert Culp <br /> <br /> "Municipalians" - the killer serial that left a copy of his driver's license behind each murder after being pursued by an innocent, ruthless policeman and a couple. Gray his old self However, the young policeman knows that the stubbornness is the only way to go when both face one situation after that. <br /> <br /> Stupid! Yes. Sure, if you're going to spoof something that is beyond reality, make sure that the laughter will flow out. Obviously they forgot that! Even in a 30-minute run, the boy is still dragging! Robbie Benson scoffed at the show, quite spoiled with Richard Widmark, who was exhausted and very little as his partner. Christopher Lloyd shows the role of a serial killer. But his acting and his sympathetic performance were creepy Eli Chaokun, Jr., Rhea Perlman and Harry Reems appear when the comedy comes. They feel incompatible and get quite repetitive with the fun of these policemen. <br /> <br /> Overall, the material The idiot that fell out of the game was left and Unbearable scripts are unreasonable and ridiculous. Just one or two few gags make each part, but really there are very cheap or plain stinkers that are stuck in your head. This is because it has become something that is trying to stimulate fun and this shows in general each subject. It is a waste of sight. The show ranges from hot to cold. But those who cannot deny the shame that can be felt from most faces The first taste of director Bob Giraldi was ridiculous for "Growing Yourself" but "Success Wanters" showed little performance. Henry Jaglom worked tirelessly with "Municipalians" The rude paintings of Rick Meyerowitz, which was released in the film, were elaborately designed and continued to define the style and mood. <br /> <br /> This low-eyebrows comedy will flip it. By showing the main interest Familiar pendant But in fact, is it worth it to go through the impeccable weakness? It's up to you
