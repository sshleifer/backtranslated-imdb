Istanbul is another film that Errol Flynn created in the last decade of his life, trying to support his family and avoiding problems with IRS. It was a remake of Fred MacMurray-Ava Gardner, Singapore ten years ago. Then <br /> <br /> Istanbul has the advantage of an excellent location in the eyes of Golden Horn, but Errol Flynn, who is doubly in front of the camera in every movie Too far to be able to play these action / adventure scenes, his scenes with Cornell Borchers are really unbelievable. <br /> <br /> For Cornell, she plays Is Errol's beloved past, who has been injured by fire from his memory now. Both of you don't remember Errol and now marry Torin Thatcher. <br /> <br /> But Errol has some nasty people led by Martin Benson and Werner Klemperer, who are behind some of the diamonds that came into possession. <br /> <br /> The best reason to see Istanbul is to hear Nat King Cole singing and playing the piano. Most people today do not know that Cole is a successful jazz pianist. They think he is the only singer. In fact, he was the first pianist. Singing later, <br /> <br /> Istanbul is an action / adventure action movie for people who are fans of that type.
