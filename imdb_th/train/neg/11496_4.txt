Documentary about the darkest places in Guatemala Shows fun, safety ... but the sad place, there is a group of sex workers playing on the football team gathered in what seems less than a week! The main focus of the documentary is to prove that the society relegated "workers" like this, even if they could not find a solution to these poor women, except that those who recorded this story made the "star" sort of said). In exchange for being exploited in making this documentary a reality However, there is a fact that is a document of its own ... but sadly, there is no connection to the main story. I will not accept to see it again; But I will recommend it for general cultural purposes only
