The performance is awesome and the screenplay It was badly collected and made you almost want to laugh with many horrifying murders. The ending is even worse. Everyone is dying In any way, the ending makes it seem like everything is perfectly fine! They do not provide sufficient history about the passion that teachers have, etc. The movie needs more time to develop better stories. The only reason I gave this 3/10 is that I feel bad for the young actor. They need better training. They can make this movie a reality. But the screenplay and performance failed miserably
