I noticed that most people who thought that this movie was not true before the moon landed (1969-1972) or not enough to admire them. I think it's easier to ask historical events if you're not alive. <br /> <br /> I'm a child in Apollo's time, but I'm old enough to understand what happened. The whole world follows the moon down. Our family gathered around the TV to see the launch. Headlines from newspapers screaming the latest behavior each day from the start to landing from Moonwalk to the moon on the way to the splashing of languages ​​in schools. Some classes are canceled so we can watch. Main activities on TV During Apollo 13, the world prayed and held breath together while the limper returned home to an unstable fate. You can't go anywhere without someone asking what the latest is. This world is truly a single community. <br /> <br /> Now, with a buffer of 30 years after the truth, it is easy to claim fraud because of the enthusiasm and interest around the world. We are left with our history books and anyone can claim that history is wrong and try to "prove" it by lying and creating facts without ignoring the evidence that shows otherwise. Live in the spirit and memory of those who lived in these magical and magical moments
