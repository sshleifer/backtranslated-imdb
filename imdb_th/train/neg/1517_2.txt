In my name I wrote that this story is laughable. Below I will explain carefully and tell you why in my humble opinion, the ruins of this movie <br /> <br /> Gere and Danes are working on theirs and while it's not a good job. the best Even though the actors that are in the works are really terrible Your heart, this is not all the fault of the actors. The problem is that Gere and Danes are the only ones that have characters that have even the smallest room in the movie to give true depth. All other characters have too little space in the movie to Creating any depth or character is an ancient idea that doesn't matter how hard the actor is trying. <br /> <br /> The director has a bit of complex Se7en, but when looking at In the statistics, I think he /> <br /> It works well as a story <br. This is a type of script that is not good in two ways. First of all, it's a bad movie script. The characters are shallow. (Except for the characters of Gere and Danes) The villain has an ancient idea and the character's actions are unbelievable. In addition, the author must have an agenda that they want to bring our opinions and ethics back for a hundred years. It is a type of film that says that some criminals are criminals, regardless of whether they pay the price that society has given. In addition, it is the type of film that is mentioned even though it is between the lines that all forms of sexual deviations should be punished without trial, judge or jury. And of course, according to all movies that do not have sex in the position of a missionary, the spouse is a sexual deviation. <br /> <br /> So if you're going to film school and want a sample of A bad script or if you are writing a script yourself and want to add an ego, watch it for others. I recommend another movie.
