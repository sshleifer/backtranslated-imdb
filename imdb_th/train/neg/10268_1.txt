No doubt that this is one of the worst movies I've ever paid! The plot is, uh, apologize to me if it has a plot? The most terrifying moment is when ... don't think of one! The best special effect that makes me hide under the bed cover is ... No, I can't think of any one. You know who is the right killer from the beginning. There is nothing scary about the whole movie. Actually, there are only two clearly interesting bits: when you see the sister of Misty's child in the shower and when you see Nurse Toppan take off, you should watch this movie to receive. How to think of not making horror movies !!!
