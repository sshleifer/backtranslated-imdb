I have high hopes for this movie. I think the evidence is interesting. Even though I met the show But Helena Bonham Carter couldn't do anything. I hope that the time spent will go away. But in the end I left. I wonder why they did this. Perhaps the version of George Orwell might have a message that should be known. If this movie can do anything successfully, it inspires me to read Orwell's classics. I find it hard to believe that his story may be disappointing like this adaptation. If the text of the filmmaker is "Life in the world is worth living." Then they succeeded. I would like to recommend this film with no one; 101 minutes of my life wasted
