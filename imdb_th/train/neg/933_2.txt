A story that is not developed / unbelievable (by the time I think it will happen, where I am not being cared for anymore). The casting is not good. (Come ... I've seen Tracey. Is Ullman working so badly?) (Should I take care of what happens to unethical characters, ignoring the role of John Ritter?) The script is bad ...) The only really good thing in that is Ten children are okay if the idea is Your less than ten lines? Compare with - Who are those rules? Why can't I say what I have to say in less than 10 lines ??? Isn't it like that? Why don't you have less than 10 comments?
