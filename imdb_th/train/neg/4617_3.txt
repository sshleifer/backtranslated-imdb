Nominations for eight institutions? It's beyond belief. I just thought it was a very bad year - even according to Hollywood standards, with Huston as the director and Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner as leaders. I might swallow the victim and watch this story. But the Oscar nomination really sold to me and I felt cheated clearly. <br /> <br /> So it's a black joke. What is it? Who can tell me where the humor is in Prizzi's honor? Of course, there is no taste. (Filming in the head of the police wife is another joke in the Mafia life) but with a joke about 'Your favorite Mexican cigar' (which I think is an old joke for The Americans were officially banned from buying Cuba in the last 50 years.) I failed to see what was a cartoon - and I tried a lot of ancient mafia. But the old idea is not a joke in my book. <br /> <br /> Is it a romantic comedy? Never the characters and their relationships are incredible and shallow with Ben Afleck and Jennifer Lopez on Gigli. <br /> <br /> Is it a funny story about a mafia? Not in a million years The plot is ridiculous, ridiculous, instead of ridiculous, humorous, and it often gives the feeling of a terrible (and cheap) mafia movie. br /> With a one-dimensional character and a little humor written for them, the actors were left to make a dumb accent and not enough to pull the face, even when the face was pulled. Head of an expression of comic Jack Nicholson. (I appreciate the bloated lips ... Now that means the parody of the brand's jowls in The Godfather? ... Oh! Pine? ... All I know is that it's not a joke. <br /> <br /> Throw in slow and slow directions. (This movie takes about 2 hours) The crazy and boring dialogue, such as; "Can you remember the Camora? We are much bigger. We will follow you wherever you go." From being "Masterpiece" of Huston and quite a terrible final work It is a work in the principles of an excellent director who should receive a concrete coat and throw it into the Hudson River.
