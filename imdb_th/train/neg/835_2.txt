When watching both Lion King and Lion King II and enjoying both thoroughly, I think Lion King 1.5 may be worth watching. Really disappointing! Disney will have to earn a desperate income. <br /> <br /> Especially now, they have lost their agreement with Pixar. <br /> <br /> In general, they just took some footage. The rest are on the floor editor (or trash) and glued together to create speed. <br /> <br /> Unlike LK I & II, both have strong stories. <br /> <br / > This movie has almost no story. While the characters and animations always enjoy watching, there is not enough content for the movie. Some bits may be the second disc filler that is good for the original proposal. <br /> <br /> Disney - shame you for leaving this garbage to make money. Quick! <br /> <br /> Next time, spend time and effort and make our work sustainable.
