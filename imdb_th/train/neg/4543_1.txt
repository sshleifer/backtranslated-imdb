I read books and interesting books. <br /> <br /> This movie, the direction of the creation of the script and the acting, is not entirely possible. I think there is no screenplay that can not follow a novel with a simple and courageous action to show the horror of the true story. <br /> <br /> I can see. Why is this movie not publicized in most cities? Will not recommend this movie to anyone I know. <br /> <br /> Just one of the worst alterations I have ever seen is a plot of less than heaven. br /> <br /> Filming is the only highlight. But how could it fail when filming in a beautiful country like Peru? <br /> <br /> For prospective audiences, don't waste time or energy on this failure.
