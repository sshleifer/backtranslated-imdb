This film serves as a warning at the right time for everyone who thinks they can write and direct their own movies. Confront it. You can't. Due to the way that no one can tell you when you hack a large hole in your plot, there is a meaningless, irreverent and boring change and manage to change Korean myths that are cool enough to become celluloid> I want this movie to be a worthless popcorn movie. I really do. I like many crappy movies. But when I was forced to ask myself, what happened and why did I learn God? More than a few times, I can't get it anymore. <br /> <br /> In addition, how do I love someone to explain that LA became a mordor for the final scene?
