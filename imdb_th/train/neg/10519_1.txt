I've watched many movies and rarely voted for the movie "1", but this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> The performance is terrible. The plot is ridiculous. The result is unrealistic and Annoying character Usually when I watch a horrible movie, I think it is a murmur when the characters hear loud voices in the house / forest / school / etc. and then shout. "Hello, is there anyone?" - But at least they can believe when they do .. This movie can't be done right. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will create a horror movie. Others, such as Venom and The Fog, seem to be an award-winning academic masterpiece. <br /> <br /> I always have an open heart while watching movies and I can say that this movie. It's a waste of time. Compete Watching this movie will think again. It's great!
