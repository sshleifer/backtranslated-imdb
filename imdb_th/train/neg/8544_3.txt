I am not sure where this will happen. These people seem to be interested in what is happening on the mountain. They check, there is a narrow escape way, go out, come back, leave each other in danger, sleepwalking, being attacked by the witch with the corresponding wardrobe, etc., etc. The guy seemed to like a woman. Came back and left her again You get points It seems that I will sacrifice something. But I'm not sure or turning people into witches But I'm not sure It's boring and endless and not worth the time. There are some atmosphere scenes But printing was so bad that there was a time when darkness for twenty seconds was not unusual. This is caused by the age or use of night filters too.
