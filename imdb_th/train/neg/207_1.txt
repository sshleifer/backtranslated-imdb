This movie is a 90-minute Ramones concert that has a short time of stupidity and boredom. What kind of high school is this? <br /> <br /> If you are not an important Ramones fan, don't do it and I repeat. This thing cannot be fully examined from beginning to end. This movie should be called Ramone Fever. Everyone seems to like them in this movie. No plot to be found in this flick. As long as the young comedies start, you are scraping the bottom of the tank with this one.
