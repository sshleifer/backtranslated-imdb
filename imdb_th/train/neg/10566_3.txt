While I count myself as a big fan of the TV series Babylon 5, the original movie that presented this story started weak. Although many elements that will grow later and become more interesting in the series, there is a slow rhythm of assembly, makeup is not enough and confusing plans Worse than that, the characters in the premiere scene are bad. Although the rating chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems. But I remember that The Gathering almost closed me soon.
