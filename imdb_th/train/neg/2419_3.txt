I just give these three things because it complements what my friends and I hope it will: Entertainment <br /> <br /> I'm not stupid enough to rent it. Think of it as a zombie movie. There, along with Romero or Fulci who likes it, but what I rent is laughter. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for movies for entertainment or movies that will shook your head with disgrace. This is perfect for junior - "Mystery Science Theater" fans, but the only downside is that it is terrible. It makes fun of myself. <br /> <br /> I personally think that it is The shame associated with other Hollywood names that we may know, because when this movie is like that, it has its own genre.
