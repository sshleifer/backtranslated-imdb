I guess I will be late to the party. I just saw the 1995 version of Bye Bye Birdy on Sky TV. I don't know if it really exists and ready to watch the movie version of 1963 when I activate. <br /> <br /> I played Albert a long time arrived Because I remember that it was so much fun to do I'm not impressed with this new version. It's not enough fun. It's not colorful. It lacks the abundance of youth. The light is bad. It seems that no one is talking about this fact. This is not a frustrating musical drama. But with a bright rhythm The decision about lighting is a bad choice. <br /> <br /> Goodbye, Birdy is funny with errors. I do not understand this model The light is terrible and it makes the overall performance worse. Dance numbers seem to be anemic as well. Today we have music videos. At least dance numbers should measure the best number or from the best number of Broadway. The choreographer slept with the wheel that looked like <br /> <br /> Although all the actors were extremely talented Vanessa Williams is not a Latin and has a lot of talented Latino actors out there that will not be more accurate if acting in Rosie's role. Vanessa is a cute and talented African American. Jason Alexander's efforts are surprising. He always works smartly. But he is not Albert He is a strange person and I think it's clear for most people who see this model. <br /> <br /> Movie media is not a medium. Must be translated from one media to another The abundance and lighting of the musical stage must be transformed into a movie. Boon was not faithful to the stage play when it was filmed. Must bring the spirit, the essence of production out For me, the 1963 film production of Bye Bye Birdy is bright and lively, while the production of 1995 was gloomy like light and lack of clarity like dance numbers. Became a waste of effort for the really talented people
