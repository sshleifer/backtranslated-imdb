Usually when I watch local Hollywood videos, I head to the B-Horror movie. For me, the basic principle behind the B-Horror movie is the value of Heavy Gore. Nudity that doesn't have much necessity and Special techniques that everyone can put together with corn syrup and latex. I rented the Cradle of Fear strictly because I am a big fan of the band since they released them as a demo. Cluttered in 1995, this film begins with an interesting note, and when I see Dani Filth crunching the rubber mask that is extremely clear, I laugh when I see lesbian sex scenes for the sake of lesbian sex scenes. I spent a lot of time in this film, laughing and when I didn't laugh, I was shaking my head, thinking that millions of rock stars wanted to create a movie that seemed to be in the budget of hundreds of dollars. This movie for me seems to attract attention. "The hard-core German children who think that death, destruction, sex, blood and Satan are great things. The biggest thing that has been invented since the Lava lamp. Actually, for me, the things that happened in this movie just happened to be Satanic. This movie has a lot of potential and seems to be a really good movie. This "movie" is just the Cradle of Filth Video.
