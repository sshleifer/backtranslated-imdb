I love munna bhai MBBS but "Lagge raho ..." SUX is really SUX. I have never seen a boring movie all my life. And these high ratings really surprised me with the tastes of Indian movie viewers. <br /> <br /> ** May be a spoiler ** <br /> > Women with education need advice from Bhai. People are talking about personal problems. On the phone come with people who are part of the world? I agree that movies should be a lie. But these things can't really be digested. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 (2 stars takes a good start, 15 minutes)
