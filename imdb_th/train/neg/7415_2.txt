You call a horror story that doesn't have a horror story and anything It is a different thing to know, give advice to the audience and do not reveal it completely. But here you get the feeling that the screenwriter doesn't know the characters in the movie, and the audience sees that no one knows! (Remember "Cube", even the movie knows more about yourself.) <br /> <br /> I use horror / blood in the 80s and this movie has deep roots in those movies. that But many important things are missing We don't really know anything about the characters. They repeat the blank lines over and over again. The story is not really developed - never going anywhere. Acting B is ok in this horror movie. But nothing to do in the script We don't care about characters. Nothing to remember about them There is no magical humor, even unnecessary sex. And the most important thing is - no excitement, no chills. <br /> <br /> You will only get the most commonly used elements of horror movies. They performed the Lordi monsters one by one, but their characters didn't help anything. <br /> <br /> I believe in this story and character development can be done by the number of crew The least and the equipment. Oh, yes. The filmmakers used to do that - and a lot more than 20 years ago! I felt the shame of the audience that shared when the movie ended really bad.
