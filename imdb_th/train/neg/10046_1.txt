I was not very impressed with Dante's 1st season presentation in the homecoming. But it is not a horror story. The situation of Screwfly is the story of a virus that was released in the world that caused the sexual desire of men instead of the murder trend for women Beginning correctly with a short film that explains how scientists kill flies. Then there was a short scene in which the man was arrested when he found the body of a woman in his house. I consider this to show the beginning of the outbreak. But it is not clear because this thing has never been visited At the moment, the character blah blah blah seems to be cool and mysterious. But now the stars are getting worse as they move forward until they are sad. Worst episode Except chocolate
