I didn't enjoy this movie at all. Joshua. Maybe it was because I saw another similar movie about the orphan 2 days ago, but perhaps because this movie is not that good. I'm going with the stairs Of course, the plot of the evil child is not traditional. But that does not mean that this movie cannot be successful. It's suspicious and fun and cold. But instead of building a slow, boring, no event and causing me to think nothing more than 'Not very good' when it ends. <br /> <br /> At the end, Joshua's inspiration is revealed. I will not surrender But the truth is that he really did not achieve his goal because, despite being a Vera Farmiga as Abby, his mother disappeared about 3 out of 4 from the movie. All the arrows point to her house shortly. She is determined to be a mental institution because she lost her mind. But then Joshua's father / her husband was accused of interfering with her drug use, which told the audience that the institution realized that she was not mentally ill. But being used for drugs .. so she shouldn't go home soon? Will Joshua fail? His mother will not be with him and his sister and may be his father soon? I asked my father because his future was left open. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day I didn't care about the characters. The evil demon boy Joshua is not really scary. The story moves slowly and when picked up it is still boring. Suspense, agreed, flat every time When I passed, I couldn't believe that I had watched the whole story. <br /> <br /> 4/10 Just because the performance is good from parents, especially Vera Farmiga as a mother. But if you want to watch movies about With the 'child' demon to see the orphan Now it's a movie that uses traditional concepts and creates great movies.
