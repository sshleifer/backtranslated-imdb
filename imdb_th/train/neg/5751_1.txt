This movie must be filmed in one day. There is a scene where you can see the reflection from the camera and the red pointer, even the green light of the scenery that blends with the actors !!! The plot and the lines are really bad, without even the slightest inspiration (at least it is a thrilling movie). Everything related to Pau in the movie is superficial and looks like a child. This movie is full of clise. And not exciting if you want to watch a funny movie for A relaxing evening with friends, then go with you to enjoy it. (As I do) but there is no way to take this movie seriously!
