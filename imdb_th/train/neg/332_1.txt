I will start by saying that I can't get through it. I picked it up on a rainy day from WalMart as well as the rest of the reviewers on this website. I think there is no way I will regret my purchase. Am I wrong? Now anyone who approves this project seriously They need to be forced to watch this movie over and over again until the end of eternity. That is the only proper punishment I can think of releasing something that is not good. The filming reminded me of the movies that I had done for the project, studying on a large VHS cam. The performance was no better than this. I think the only difference is that there are a few interesting pendants. Whoever ... ... Shake Moscow Moskow is not happy and the comedian, the ship, is a bigger loser. That's about the plot I understand. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. I own a DVD and give it to many colleagues. Each person came back and laughed and said "Wow, I don't think I will ever say I shut the Adam Sandler movie for 15 minutes ...." <br /> <br /> My answer is "You can do it. <br /> <br />
