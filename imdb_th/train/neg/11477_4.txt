Sorry, my neighbor in Nevada City <br /> <br /> Brian must have too much Botox because he has very little facial expression throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Alice looks like you. There is a board attached to the back. She was stiff throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> I searched for both Alice and Brian and was surprised to see the extensive work. I can guess that they are the first year students. <br /> <br /> Ed Asner and Peter Jason hold this movie straightforwardly and conveniently with every line. Ed certainly didn't lose his special ability. I hope I will take the time to meet him while he is here. <br /> <br /> I love the snow scene and the scenes of shops and churches because I've been there. I made Nevada City my home and was waiting for the premiere. I feel sad. <br /> <br /> Sorry.
