I grew up watching and loving TNG. I just finished watching all the ST Voyager series on DVD, which may make me feel disgusted now because of the differences in style and the way between the two shows. possible This idea may well be used as an opportunity to expand the role of Riker, which is the way it may be treated on VOY. They may have outstanding memories that will be "new" to the audience rather than just Showing old clips, changing in and out between "memories" and "present", now starting as a clich√© at first, and quickly becoming too much, while tired patterns are worn and on bars m - the worst ever.
