Over the years I have seen Segal movies straight to the video and everyone has the same level of entertainment. Entertainment level is low. Of course, the action scenes are fun. But quite a lot, Seagal was really important to him when he made a movie that he liked under Siege, Under Siege 2 and Executive Decision (at least in the action standpoint). Segal celebrities do not pass the qualification past. <br /> <br /> The more positive aspects, movies take advantage of time, such as action scenes and intellectual use. When the movie seems to be dragged to the scene, the cool action brought up from the trough. I honestly believe that Segal's movie is better if he is not the only one that fans can remember in the movie. Supporting actors and actors is very important, and if his current film has actors and actors supporting this subject, perhaps this movie may be more popular.
