Amelia and Michael are married couples who are unfaithful. Amelia is a lover for a long time in the hospital and Michael hired a prostitute who was not satisfied with him. Both are uncertain. But managed to connect to each other in the end. <br /> <br /> There's nothing short of this. That direction is straightforward and amazing, which is a good thing. The show is sincere. But the story came out a bit Why are we interested in these two people? It is a little difficult to see how this story is different from other unfaithful stories. In addition, it looks worse and doesn't look for meaning there. (It's a pleasant change if anything) <br /> <br /> I don't know. It's possible that I won't connect with these stories because I've never experienced it before. But I have noticed that the blocking of these narratives is often the same as the couple talking while avoiding eye contact by pretending to be obsessed with magazines, etc. The good thing about short films is that they have space Increase For trying different things and I want to see different things. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
