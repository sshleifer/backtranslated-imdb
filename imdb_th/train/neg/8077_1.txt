I saw this movie for a long time ... Fortunately, it's free. I must be one of the twenty people who saw this movie in the cinema. I don't remember being a group. But I remember that I was bored unbelievably. The plot was not reasonable and when I left the cinema, the only thing I could say was at least. Incredibly annoying: if they can make the temperature as they approach the sun low enough for humans to survive, why can't they turn it into temperatures? Comfortable instead of being hot and sweaty? How do they think we are stupid?
