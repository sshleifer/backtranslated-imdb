I will be short and to the point. This movie is an insult to people with IQ at room temperature. Sorry, liberal women and other women will not have a stamp. They can forget about the body or stay in the fight as well. Will not happen You see that it is difficult to understand or accept different men and women, regardless of the facts. In 2007, reality cannot change things so people avoid pain. Men cannot give birth to babies or breastfeeding (Oh - I forgot about San Francisco). <br /> <br /> Women lack physical strength that is comparable to men in combat or situations. In other physical challenges, how many women are playing in the NFL or NHL? Finally, I can't squeeze the blood in hell if what I just wrote makes you frustrated. Think about it. I do not write one thing that is not true. This movie does not mean anything more than jokes and bad things.
