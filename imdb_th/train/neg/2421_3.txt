With the efforts of the ABC family of hit movies, "Cheaper Than the Dozen" comes from the dreadful dialogue that is frightening. The plot is superficial with about two good actors. Very disappointing It's a Hollywood-wannabe, as well as the already bad plot. Then, because they need a lot of actors, that means they may be more gentle. So the show is not five stars. The plot is quite fast and twists badly and has a bad rhythm. Junction of characters and "The relationship ended" was too sweet and lamenting for me. Reserve yourself and rent something better.
