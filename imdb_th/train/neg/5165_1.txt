I am looking forward to sitting in this car and feeling very disappointed. <br /> <br /> And I am very happy with the roller coaster ride and theme park. <br /> <br /> The roller coaster is okay - and that Is all about 30 seconds from the 90-second ride. <br /> <br /> It's boring and bad looking. <br /> <br /> It's trying to be like Indiana Jones and Space Mountain rides and Disneyland. The superiority and failure of everything. <br /> <br /> It's not exciting or exciting. at least
