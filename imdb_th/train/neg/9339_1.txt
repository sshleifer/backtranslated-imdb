I think they should call this movie "Whites" instead of "Heights". Godawful ... movies that make people hate New Yorkers. People who are obsessed with themselves and think that their lives are very important ... Lilly's white character, Glenn Close, is the minority character in the film, crying out to somebody. People really come in and steal it ... and they suggest to take this character out of the actors (I think he is albino at first) that should be Welsh! I'm still trying to decipher that accent! Wisdom is not honest ... This movie is a type of movie that can fool a lot of people to think that it is valuable because it has more challenges. Better to fill the cinema with MI5-10 than with this pretentious shit ... must play better because you can't fall from the floor.
