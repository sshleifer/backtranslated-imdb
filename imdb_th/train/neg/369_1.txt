I almost called HBO and demanded a refund for the month just because they aired this movie. I can watch movies that the executives are sitting around. "Okay, we have to find something like Home Alone. We will add cash to the children. Hire actors with lower rates and yes. We will make it less funny! "<br /> <br /> Okay, maybe not the last part. But that is what you have come here Not worth seeing that someone else has rented it. And it's a movie for kids. Forget it. I'm not going to let my children see this. But because I don't want them to say "What do you think that makes us see the junk, dad!?!"
