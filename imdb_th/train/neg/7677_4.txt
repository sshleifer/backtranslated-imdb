I stopped watching the loss now because I thought Ana-Lucia and Libby's death was not really necessary and depressing. Then I found that they kept Libby in order to die in the next episode! Gah! I can't cope. <br /> <br /> I like this show for the first season. In the second season, I found Jack's religious feud and annoying little locks. The death of the character in Rodriguez & Watros is the last thing. <br /> <br /> Now I give 4/10 for the end of my previous look. A wonderful set created by Alias ​​legend. JJ Abraham, I hope his future series will improve.
