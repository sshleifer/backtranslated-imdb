Another British movie theater shake. Real garbage is provided here again. I can not understand (And I am a British person) Why does this matter cause nationalism nonsense? Eight years mark you from when the Second World War actually ended! Other reviewers here have discussed the editing and use of video archives clearly. This is a very bad observation. There are many archived videos. Simulated planes swing from the wires in 'Action scenes' like many kids kites in the wind The map room sequence will normally be a movie to allow us to enter all Malta events. Guinness must have his worst performance ever. The shocking dog fight scene came to laugh. Hawkins makes us all die in the map room area. Aink created many great movies. Obviously this is not one of them. They should stay away from this unbelievable rotten!
