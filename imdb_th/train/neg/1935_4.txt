Chinese Ghost Story III is a wonderful sequel to two fantastic fantasy movies. The movie offers a spelling effect that anyone can expect, but it cannot be painful in every angle. Every actor plays a very stupid caricature. You must be in the diaper to find the humor of the slap even from a distance. The plot is predictable and development is sometimes unstable and slow. At the end, the movie began to resemble an old Godzilla movie, including special effects that were bigger, shabby and ghosts (which were good, but another story) with Godzilla heads. Maybe I would have a smile if I expect the camp /> <br /> It is surprising to see that the trash fans imagine what to endure - in this case, because some people think they can squeeze a little extra money. The formula is successful. They can't do it. Again: The cash cow is now dead like a dodo.
