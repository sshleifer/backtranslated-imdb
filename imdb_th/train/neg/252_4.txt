The direction that is not popular makes a good actor to be in a handsome adaptation. But gentle, which the dialogue seems to be reciting more than the heart and the presence of spirits bound by ghosts, unable to feel the fear of Edward Woodward as Ghost of Christmas Present staggering around on the pole and seems to be impressed with Bernard Cribbins in As a Scrooge, George C. Scott was too distressed and it seemed that he truly didn't believe that. The scenes that he showed in his past had a great impact as if he were dancing in his family album. There seems to be no one trying to wear except Frank Finlay, who has acted too much.
