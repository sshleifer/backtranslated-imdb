This movie is ridiculous. There are a few funny parts. It's in the trash of the movie in my memory that I think "Hmm ..... That movie has some funny parts. But overall it is ridiculous. /> I think it looks like Ben is trying too hard to be a funny person. And I do not understand that he was a millionaire and still an idiot However, I like Ben Affleck. He made nonsense. But hey i can forgive him I mean I like Jersey Girl. I don't think Gigli is all his fault. I like him overall. I think he is a person who likes children that you feel sorry because he can't get it right. <br /> <br /> My advice is to avoid this flick It doesn't really develop into a functional plot, and Catherine O'hara and Jimmy G. aren't used as they should be. They deserve better Overall, this movie is not home alone, it is not a Christmas story, not a Christmas holiday or any other classic that is forever memorable.
