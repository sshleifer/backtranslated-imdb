Ivan Reitman is the savior The most tired plan (Ghostbusters, Evolution) comes to life in his skilled hands. Even his occasional failures (Six Days, Seven Nights) show the life and humor that makes him look valuable. So I was disappointed that Wright was not able to do the original plot. (The man leaves the superhero, the superhero gets revenge from the great power) and makes it fun. "Girlfriend" is a pointless exercise. A tricky plot that has a length in the teeth. After the first 20 minutes, this movie cannot decide whether it is a romantic movie or a superhero. The result is a film of flip-flops between the two without any good aspects Tired quickly What's more frustrating is that in some scenes (For example, when Umar opened his head through the wall through the wall), you felt Reitman's acoustic melody that screamed out. But a few seconds later, the magic disappeared quickly like a superhero that the movie was disappointed in almost all aspects.
