This is a hybrid creature born at the heart of Carl Macek with the second-generation Robotech (Robotech Masters) and Megazone 23, a miserable movie that is unreasonable! The story is terrible and you can't forgive Megazone's actions when there's nothing to do with Robotech. If the film ranks very well for the TV series and not for yourself !! I said that the name can't be saved!
