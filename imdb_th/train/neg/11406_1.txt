But i get more than that For me, it seems that even the author of this book is fond of Caroline. I felt very sorry for the character Louis and she was constantly being compared to the evil Esau. I just felt that the comparison was quite severe. Although this movie is actually not good I won't really see it until you are ready for the big release.
