I know that no one is interested, but I made this movie with historical value for one reason. It is the unity of two heroes from the brilliant seventies sci-fi movie. One of those is great and one is quite bad. The greatness is truly wonderful. In fact, it's the best. The bad thing is really bad. Actually, it's the worst. Of course, I mean "Star Wars" that is great and is the actor Mark Hamil, also known as "Star Wars". "Luke Sky Walker", the hero of this film about a boy who received his Vette. After many adventures all night (Because he repaired the car, I think you called him "Lube Skywalker") on the way -Fi seventies "Laserblast" which is as I have said earlier The worst sci-fi movie ever created Milford accepted the role of a nobleman, which Hamill had to steal his car back. I know that nobody cares about this meeting of the two great heroes in the sci-fi industry, but I can do it. And I must say that this is one of the best / worst movies of all time Mark Hamil's performance requires strength. The plot requires extensive Jedi training and the characteristics of the prostitutes that Annie Potts plays, probably the most annoying character of all time in the movie Every story I've seen But it's a fun movie that can be watched on weekends or nights, weekdays, late at night or very late. It is one of those films that look crooked for something. But did not find it very much, and at the same time it had all the objectives, like free jazz that would exist And it is like that And things that are not that good But you can't say it's not fun because for an hour and a half, you may feel torn. But you won't feel cheated So, close your mind, relax and enjoy the intoxicating gems without expectation and may always be with you.
