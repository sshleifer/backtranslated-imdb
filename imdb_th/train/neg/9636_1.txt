This miraculous loss of money is evidence that rich and famous people can be stupid and wasteful as politicians from the play (stupid) by Tennessee Williams and directed by (Dead Hand) by Joseph Lozi. And starring Taylor and Burton and Noel Craven - this project was filmed in an island mansion on a beautiful cliff in the Mediterranean. The winner when presented to Universal in 1967, the result was ridiculous and almost boring. Obviously, this film is beautiful. But that is the power of nature that is allowed to set and the fact that the house will actually replace the set Taylor's hilarious comedy, which screams asleep halfway through Burton's crazy dialogue, choir, cowardice, self-ridicule, ridiculous stories and equipment, planning and ridiculous thinking cause further annoyance audiences Boom is a shame, a waste of money and ability, and clear evidence that famous celebrities can be as idiots as others in the world. Waste of horror and madness alone
