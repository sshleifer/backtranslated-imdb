The script is very weak that doesn't have enough characters to make you interested in a bit of character or what happens to them. The script has too much talk and is not enough to be called slow or slow. The story comes to a point where you just want everyone to shut up and die as soon as possible, so you don't have to listen to them speak quiet conversations. In the technical record, mixing music is a high way and makes it difficult to understand what is often mentioned. Then again, this may be called a blessing. Overall, this same story should be told in a short film that has a screened time of less than 30 minutes, clearly "in front of you" showing respect to Sam Raimi and "Evil Dead". It's good if they're smarter. But here they seem to be bald. C'mon budget 35mm like this and this is the best thing you can do. Photography, lighting design and filming were very well done.
