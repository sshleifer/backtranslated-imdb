Timberlake's performance almost attacked the screen. I think the role of the journalist is wrong for him. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J plays the typical rap. The strongest and the worst. I don't think that the smiles, cracks in the whole movie, even offered to his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman made the whole movie. He has a funny scene which is the highest point of the movie. br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is not good or bad. He just "There." <br /> <br /> Overall, it's boring. Poor movie plot. Bad performances or inappropriate roles for actors
