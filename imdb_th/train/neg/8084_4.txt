I chose this name from a friend who let him sit in his complete DVD / Video / Laserdisc collection, so luckily I didn't have to pay myself. I have an idea that it will be a bad movie. But I know that a really bad movie is after watching something like a child should not play with dead things and strange creatures that stop and become zombies mixed up and now Nothing will disappoint me unless it is surprisingly bad. <br /> <br /> Solar Crisis is not good. But it is not the point of the extreme pain that some movies have. <br /> <br /> However, the general plot is that the sun is going to release the flames from the big sun to the world to destroy it. To counter the imminent threat, humans have collected spacecraft and crews who are responsible for shooting antimatter explosions. (This box is described as "The biggest explosion ever") to the sun The logic will cause the flame to fire in a different angle from the unharmed world. <br /> <br /> It's okay that what I just explained to you seems like a bad episode of Star Trek. The original, although there are all actors (Charlton Heston, Peter Boyle and Jack Palance) Solaris can handle ordinary people at that level because of the simple plot. But became more nonsense.>> The great success of this disrupted movie is to increase the villain character. (Played by Boyle) who confirms the sabotage of the mission With an unexplained approach, he sent an evil minion with an embarrassing hair to use some electronic mind control over the genetically engineered scientists of the space crew by Annabel Schofield, a female lead. Why did he sabotage the mission? Because with his mystical view, he believed that the flame would not happen and when it was not so he would become fabulously wealthy because he had dug his evil claws on the market You have the most stupid motive villain imaginable. <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie is complex and develops slowly at the time of using a character that has a vague or vague role. Benefit in a short time. Stories. I can sit here and explain precisely what happened to show the true incompetence of the screenwriter. To plot the click or interest you But I sit here, write this review in Microsoft Word and I know that there will be three pages and I will succeed in losing your attention only. But then again, you might get the same impact from watching movies. <br /> <br /> However, this movie is miserably jammed with terrible conversations. Imagine that everything that had happened in Star Trek Enterprise was a character talking about sci-fi jargon coming together. Yes, I know. They've done that. But imagine that that's all they do, and they use light words to speak in an ambiguous and nonsensical scene that doesn't create excitement, tension or interest in any viewer.> <br /> This is an example. The best when the characters in the Zero-G environment put the bolts back into the metal box before crying in pain for a few minutes before they explode. The previous script shows the characters that are at risk of explosion. But didn't care to give a clear answer as to why or how this happened or why he really couldn't escape Overall, you have to cross the apology between the weirdness and the laughter. <br /> <br /> Then we have many scenes where the dramatic collection leads to nothingness. Jack Palance's performance is broken. With a character who acts only driving the hero boy (without asking) around the desert before groaning and killing by a suit On his deathbed, Palance finally tells our male hero in his last name. (While wearing a makeup with a terrible bruise, it seems that someone put a balloon under his eyes) which he had quieted before. Colonel Travis J. Richards The boy repeated repeatedly after his death, causing the audience to feel that the name was important later in the movie. Perhaps the character of Charlton Heston's gray will recognize him and the plot will progress, so when his name is repeated Something else. <br /> <br /> Don't apologize. Any hope that you will receive at this time is another pathetic effort and failure to create a drama for a flat character. And the hacking that will be the career of the Palance forever. The rest of the actors are destroyed in the same way Ask Sun tried to ransom her fate while under the spell of villains. Which is an element of visual effects, images that do very well of this movie, even for the clearly elaborate care put into them, still able to manage to make this film look Is chintzy as it is The most tragic part of this film is the huge budget, apparently lost in the tragic role of scriptwriter and supporter behind Boyle, Heston and Palance, who managed to hammer the coffin with pure performances. br /> <br /> Grade: D-
