1 Good cheer. I really like BOOGEYMAN. Although it's not BOOGEYMAN that has been promoted on the DVD cover and we all know! It crawled me away But this movie is something else For directing by a long-time guy and directing many films, it seems that it was filmed on a VHS camcorder at the age of 10! The stories and performances are bad! David Hess, you disappointed me After playing one of the worst villains in film history Stories and performances may be forgiven. But if anyone takes the time to make the video look professional There are a lot of filming videos that are not the same, or at least not so clear that you are not interested in this movie. I can't say that it is the worst movie ever, because I can't do it all the time. But it's close
