I like Dafoe as an actor. But I died a couple of hours. Actually, I watched this movie. I still don't believe that I can watch it fully. In fact, there is one point in this film and the ending. I'm glad I never. Pay to see the pointless excuse of the movie! <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if I didn't find the facts, but Dafoe married or saw the best actress in this movie in real life. If so, is it an attempt to start her career? If I am afraid that it must fail .. <br /> <br /> I post this. In the hope that I will make someone watch this movie, although 1 person will listen to my opinion and decide that they will watch more drying colors. I will feel that I have done good things in this world if I Have the same advice ...
