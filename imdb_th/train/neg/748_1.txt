I love movies and I will watch every movie through just to give an opportunity. Finally I can say that I found a movie that I couldn't watch all the way. The show is very old and boring. CGI looks like the computer is doing it in his mother's basement with the minimum software and ..... The scene is just ... walking !!!! And this movie is three hours long !!! I didn't do it for 15 minutes until I quickly forwarded the DVD. The scene with aliens is very short. Umm instead of name "The War of the Worlds". "This War of Long Distance Walking" costs 5 million dollars. This will make! What they used to pay for the opening song. <br /> <br /> Oh, but in a positive light, the scene you have to watch is when the aliens start killing people. That is hilarious, not because people are dying. But because when they turn to the skeleton, they are still struggling for 20 seconds. After that, <br /> <br /> So .... as I said, if you're a boring fan Movies without action. This is a DVD collection movie for you. But I didn't write this for you. I wrote this for billions of people who would hate this movie. It's not worth your time or money. <br /> <br /> I know that this book has But the book isn't that long and I'm a complete bookworm? Just got the Steven Spielberg model. It's not all that good. But it's 10 times better !! <br /> <br /> I gave this big FAT ZERO from 10
