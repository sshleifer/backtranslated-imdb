This is just a trash that is really scary. Yes, we have naked women dancing and having beautiful sex. But at the moment may work in the mechanism of porn? May have been hit as a porn movie ?? This tried to conceal himself as a "movie" and things that would speak with emotion and real struggles. It was not. I'm sure all women (and men) in this movie may have a fair business in the porn business of the 1970s .. but not in the actual movie business. <br /> <br /> The show was hacked. And very bad. I mean, really bad. Writing is worse than ever. Can't I blame all these actors? They have nothing to work with. The broad structure or plot of the movie can be done and done well with talented writers and actors. The structure or plot is very wide, belonging to the psychopath who spent his time shooting people from a distance as a gunman. These fires are caused by men who do not respect enough women. If there is more writing - better writing, better writing - and free sex images, we may have something to work with. <br /> <br /> This movie should Being shot; It will make more money. It's already a hardcore porn movie, and it's the only non-porn movie that I saw that showed penis erection.
