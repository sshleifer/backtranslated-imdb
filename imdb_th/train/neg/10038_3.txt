The movie lacks style. I mean the traditional style. Everything that has been copied includes actions, first appearances in movies, music, deliveries, dialog boxes, etc. Yes, there are stupid, original, as in the beginning. Come It started falling from the hill with the number MH ****. That's one of many people who are crazy about movies. :) What's good in movies? Yes, for Kareena fans, if there is Kareena in bikini for akshay fans, his conversations and action scenes are just that. There's nothing else. So look at your own risk and don't blame the director or actor. Mad directors and actors already
