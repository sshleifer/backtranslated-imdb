I have read comments that you shouldn't watch this movie if you are looking for a dialogue of Shakespearian This is true. Unfortunately, due to the exciting dialogue, this great drama has been cut and replaced by music. I have read this drama and recently, lucky enough to watch the show, it is still one of the comedies. Shakespearian My favorite But this movie seems to bring everything I like about it. The princess, though without a doubt that doing what she has been told to do, does not have to bear any burden and every girl seems to lose the intelligence of their character - still being affected by Unscathed wounds But taking the comments out of context - it is a small matter that makes the princess hear the announcement; "I am a wise woman who will ridicule my lover like that!" When the mockery didn't happen at all The ratchet news throughout the movie had a disruptive effect and brought many wonderful scenes, since they displayed information on the scene after them and in modern words. In summary, great play is destroyed by strange concepts and unwise cuts. I always love what you do. What are you thinking
