I wonder if there is any feeling in this movie or not. It's a great joke .. It's fun .. You will see the most stupid plot that plays seriously in the form of movies .. I wonder how the audience of this movie has a goal. br /> <br /> Priety (professional)) plays as a mother representative for a happy couple. Salman / Rani who wants children but can't. I wonder what it would be like if this drama is true in life. Removing from the ditch's life Actually, <br /> <br /> Rani looks happy with other beautiful women in her house that have been brought to create a child for her & Salman. She takes care of goodness and tries to push Salman's husband into So they can have love When the audience is bored with Salman's Nagra, <br /> <br /> Even though he has passed the good times But this movie is not able to stand mad
