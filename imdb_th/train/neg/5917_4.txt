This film wants to elaborate that criminals are products of modern society. So the robbers who raped and murderers could (The killer in this film is Carl Panzram (James Woods). All three and worse) are fully responsible for their actions? Interesting concept But it is very difficult to bring to the screen in a way that is intellectually and emotionally satisfying And this is where the killer: the journal of murder is very short Although the film tries to make Panzram's behavior in perspective, with events going back to children with violence and unusual training, the audience never gets the idea that Panzram is a victim rather than a perpetrator. Of course, the system was damaged by a criminal who possessed the entire Leavenworth Bay, a sick place. (Which is where most movies occur) most prisoners are bullied sadistic But why the new security officer, Henry Leszer (Robert Sean Leonard) on this world so pity Panzram? Even after reading his horrible diary The film presented some explanations: fewer witnesses were taken to the sadistic security forces. (And stereotypical) and impressed with Panzram's cleverness (although it is unclear why Leszer thinks that this guy is smart) This story is likely to insult the crime and highlight his personality? To Lesser Panzram is quite loyal and the audience will get the impression that this Lesser is against all the cruelty that he has read in this Lesser Panzram notebook. There are very few friends that he cares about everyone who looks like. Friendly to him from a distance? Perhaps it is the Lesser that is the work of modern society, judging from the appearance rather than substance. <br /> <br /> I can give advice to the monster starring Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci as the movie that managed. With the same theme More accuracy and scope. <br /> <br /> BTW: The killer looks as if shooting with the TV (not good).
