The sun doesn't shine, it's too wet to play, so I went to see the movie on a cold, cold and cold day. <br /> <br /> "The cat in the hat" is the name of the movie. And when it ended my stomach was sick. <br /> <br /> Mike Myers played his humorous and weak humor, and the boy didn't want to see this. Humor wasn't tamed. <br /> This movie Is like drinking milk from a crazy cow, so it's fun to get fun But the filmmakers don't know. <br /> <br /> This short film is cruel. The show was not good. The plot was overly modified and the humor was very rude. <br /> <br /> It started with Conrad and Sally, who broke the rules and the sheriff in the future. When their mother had to go to work, she received her kwan to raise children. It may be a lonely joke in the film, when she is watching the Taiwan courtroom la la C-SPAN. She soon falls asleep and comes to the cat. <br /> <br /> This movie starts at Will spin out of control The cat came to try to make the kids fun. He got the 1st thing and the 2nd thing. Who started to attack the house He broke out on TV, Infomercial and accidentally tailed away. And when the cat went full, Carmen Miranda was not funny, probably the only disguise of his comedy could be a hippie activity And there is a fish that tries to warn children about cats. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he didn't warn us that this movie is fun like curd or cutting your tail. <br /> <br> soon This child outside is looking for a family dog ​​with a key to unlock the crate on his cover. If the crate is not locked soon, their home will be the home of Kat's universe. It's a little more interesting here. But not enough to help this movie. <br /> <br /> The overall performance is awesome. Mike Meyers brings humor to Austin Powers to give to the cat, saying "You dirty ho" and imagining yourself as a woman all his life after hitting the testicles while posing as a pinata. Spencer Breslin Great as Conrad that created the problem and Dakota Fanning was so cute, Sally, though they were not alone enough to help this terrible Aortic Dissection that was waiting to kill John Ritter Lawrence Lawrence. Is a shy person An exploration and Alec Baldwin had a disgusting attempt to woo the mother, played by Kelly Preston and Mr. Humberfloob boss Sean Hayes was the voice of Mom and fish. The latter three were not polite. <br /> <br /> Overall, if I were a parent, I wouldn't take my children with humor into the bathroom because there were so many. Save $ 7.00 and see something else. The great Dr. Seuss once said that <br /> <br /> It's fun to have fun. But you have to know how to actually stop it! Theodore turned back in his grave. <br /> <br /> Like my mother always said "Curious to kill the cat" - Cat in the hat * from *****
