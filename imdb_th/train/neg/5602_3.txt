"Pandemonium" is a horror movie that creates stupidity rather than funny. Believe me when i tell you i love comedies Especially jokes, parody "Airplane", "The Naked Gun" ending, "Blazing Saddles", "High Anorexia" and "Spaceballs" are my favorite comedies "Pandemonium" isn't there with those movies Most of the scenes in this movie made me sit there quietly because this movie was not a joke. There are a few movies about laughing. But when you watch a comedy, you expect to laugh more than a few times and that's all this movie did for it. Geez "Scream" laughs more than this movie and that's more horror. How strange is it? <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (from four)
