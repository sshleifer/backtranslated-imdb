I despise this movie. It's not funny ... and I think "Mulan" is unbelievable! However, my low expectations of Disney have become, I never thought that they would do something that the stereotypes were still out of. There is no respect here for true Chinese culture, just Hollywood's random battle tradition. <br /> <br /> I thank you for trying to make Wendy a normal teenage girl ... But fortunately, it's the most common thing for teenage girls - especially Asian teenage girls who are obsessed with life that is shallow. And from a cultural standpoint it is almost impossible Yes, there are women that are wrapped in popularity and fashion. But they are quite rare And even those who are still quite good scholars Maybe another pattern But may be true Because that's how the Chinese parents work That is how Chinese values ​​work. If they want to go to the right place, they will make Wendy a ridiculous woman with glasses and a hate-loving relationship with her family. <br /> <br /> This just adds to the frustration. My movie with american Asian culture is not about meditation and ambiguity. Phrases that emphasize nature, which sounds wise. We are not always smiling and we do not know some form of martial arts. We are people and I will be grateful if someone writes an Asian script that doesn't show us like a sad caricature.
