It seems that many people who have watched this movie will only watch at the beginning because it was filmed near where they lived. Is that how to certify ringtones? If this film was filmed close to where I was, I wouldn't talk about it in my review. It's scary! Many reviews indicate that this movie is a horror movie that is spoofed or cheeked. It is sad to see this film being criticized as a comedy that not only But make horror movies But also a funny movie I laugh even though this movie is so bad. <br /> <br /> This movie has 2 good things for it. The mask and the weapon selected. Half of the mask and weapons are placed on the table and then watch this garbage. The social opinion behind this film is a laughing story for children and fools. Don't pay attention to this movie. You waste time reading this review and don't waste time on this movie. Arrggghhh! It's a nuisance to movies like this. I expect the whole team to be credited with Alan Smithee, the name used when the person who is usually the director doesn't want to give credit to the movie because it's terrible. This film I spent $ 1.19 on rent and felt I was torn, avoiding 1 of 10.
