Some people have to play seriously when they make this movie. <br /> <br /> At first, it was absolutely impossible that the film was created in 1993. Fashion and music say that this is the 80s. Seriously, I guess this is sitting on the shelf while before the crazy dealers get it up and let it go to the unbelievable world. <br /> <br /> There is a story of a heretic. Strange. Meet tea. One man with a beard randomly told them that if they meditate while singing his favorite song, he will become the man he has chosen. At this point, I felt the need to point out that the lonely favorite song, London Bridge, was falling down. Why is this song his favorite song? Because he is an idiot We are only one minute in this film and the movie has reached a foolish level. <br /> <br /> The loneliness is an option. I can assume that there are two scenes in the movie that he saw, picking up his nose, clearing his name, deciding to turn into a woman so that he can get closer to other women and kill them more or less. <br /> <br /> The performance is shocking at the international level. Every performance in this movie is terrible. In fact, I would say that acting is a standard of porn movies. It was really scary. The nostril option will appear to the audience as a nostril option. The characters in the movie saw him while the woman he had become singing through London Bridge Is Falling Down. My guy felt like an idiot even though typing this thing. However, it's strange to see strange, middle-aged people going out with girls in school and not a good way. Despite the extended editing that the nostril option is at the school, along with the girls and the songs played on top It may be the worst song ever recorded. I won't even explain You will know when you hear And you will agree with me. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes of violence And pursuing the style of Benny Hill related to transgender people Despite the endless dialogue that may have been taken away from Shakespeare or John Milton, the nasal speaker said to the prostitute that 'I have cash. If you have a notch.' Cute. I'm sure you will agree. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous.
