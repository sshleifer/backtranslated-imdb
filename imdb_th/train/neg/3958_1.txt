I won't waste much time on this because as far as I'm concerned, it's not a movie that starts with just a movie borrowed from negligence and a new video created for The purpose of putting all the regulations together and calling it a sequel, "Boogeyman". Indeed, 80% of the movie was stolen from the movie "The Boogeyman", a movie that the writer of junk does not seem like. Bothered to watch because they could not get the name of the original character of Suzanna Love (Lacy) right. And to add insult to the killer injury, not seen in the original video and appeared in the video It seems like they think their audience is stupid like they are 0 out of 10 and I hope the IMDb rating system is very low, which is the most flashy and blatant attempt to snatch the money of my people. Have seen you have been warned!
