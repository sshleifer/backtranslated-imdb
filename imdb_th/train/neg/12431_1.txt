I want to say that curiosity has been my best. If only I saw the trailer, I would tell you what the whole story of this movie is. I can save myself the most pointless in one hour, forty minutes throughout my life and about twenty dollars. This movie is a disaster that is waiting to happen and is a shameful thing for Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This film shows real ignorance. This travels throughout the neighborhood and into this house. It was covered with clothes. Is it reasonable to believe that the remote can no longer send signals under those circumstances? Hollywood doesn't believe that. General logic and the concept of any electronic device that determines the opposite; I wonder if the race car might reach the road or not. The house is on the opposite side. Another unrealistic aspect is the lack of intelligence that criminals have. Why in every movie, these criminals are rocket scientists until they are eight years old? Children intend to be the smartest in the movie instead of being a professional terrorist? Please be more realistic in The Matrix. In addition, the chief puts his true pistol and "accidentally" picks up a plastic pistol. Apparently he couldn't tell the difference. Even if wearing gloves, do so. Just because they look like each other doesn't mean anything. Have other senses and see The trap is also unrealistic. If one of them actually works, the criminal must die. But Hollywood intended us to "laugh" with the "funny" result of the trap. I didn't laugh. I sighed and rolled my eyes. <br /> <br /> But I recommend this movie to everyone who thinks they have seen a really bad movie. The movies they see seem to be Citizen Kane compared to this movie. Otherwise, skip this thing for your pride. Home Alone 3 also raises questions. We all know Alex D. Linz is a star in this movie. But he wrote it as well?
