First of all, I love Henry Fool, which makes me in the audience. Parker Posey is one of the best actresses on the screen today. But this movie is a full imitation Watching Hartley and the actors talk about this film in a special sense - full of pride and pointless comparison with Star Wars is to turn the belly. This is an advertisement that is too much for the manufacturer (HDNET) to realize. The true example of the emperor and his new clothes Most of the time I feel that Hal has destroyed HENRY FOOL forever. I don't think I can see it again in the place where it is pure and innocent. <br /> <br /> Remember that Hal, you can fool some people in Sometimes ... etc. Today, if everything he does is spun meaningless waste. Sadly, it is a true example of the lessons taught in the movie ADAPTATION. The story must be exciting and energetic, or the hope of its box office is dim. Never mind a good story For actors, it's like trying to perform in the jacket strait. <br /> <br /> Score. I believe Hartleys has no taste. By beating the drum that walks around the dialog box There is one scrambled apple soundtrack that I remember making me smile. <br /> <br /> When I saw the example, I thought, oh, they just tried to attract new audiences. But it is really ridiculous ride I'm happy to destroy this movie for you. But it was finished. It's rotten. The FOOL franchise is dead. Henry is stupid for a long time.
