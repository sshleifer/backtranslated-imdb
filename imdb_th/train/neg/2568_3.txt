To me ... Peter Sellers is one of the most talented actors ever. But his movie selection, speaking after 1964, is a very unfortunate matter. It seems that he doesn't know how to use his talents. He would be better off working with Kubricks of the film world than the one he did. In his next film, "The Optimists of Nine Elms" and "Being There" only impressed me with what I saw. <br /> <br /> That said, Boultings and the seller created the movie. A few stories earlier Sounds not so good - I still don't see "Carlton Browne" and "Heavens Above!" - At least in terms of using the seller very well, but "A girl in my soup" is actually a movie that Not good and is a terrible choice in the part of the seller in terms of characters In his movie between 1955-64, you often expect at least creativity and confidence in his role. Here you have Peter's seller who is trying to show the general romance. It's almost a seller who plays CAD Niven without fun. Of course, he's not persuasive, trying as much as possible or creating interesting characters. He should leave that part with a gentle boss, such as Cary Grant and focus on the interesting plays and cartoons that he is famous for. <br /> <br /> Hawn and the seller do not create real chemistry. This is not an easy, romantic, kind of perfect love by William Powell and Myrna Loy. It looks like an invention all the way - I know it's part of Denver's character that he gave birth to a dry girl. But he didn't change from that in a persuasive manner Sellers have a way to play horrible "charms" as well ... This character has no depth and does not receive sympathy or interest. The seller must face the movement in the way that one would think is impossible when remembering the beauty of his outstanding performance in "Lolita". <br /> <br /> There's nothing to say about the plot. Direction or character They left little or no impression. This is one of the most diabolical and boring anemic movies I've ever seen. The insignificance of "vehicles" for vendors without problems. <br /> <br /> Points: - * 1/2 / *****
