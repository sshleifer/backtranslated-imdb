I've seen (too much) flicks from this company - this is about the middle of the envelope. On the good side, it has style and control better than their costs - less humor and consistency in sticking to the story. (For what is worthwhile) Many of their names, such as Sexy Sixth Sense, are buried by Baarad performances and feelings of expertise. On the other side, I found that the simulated sex scenes were not as hot as their other flicks (such as Vampire Vixens, Gladiator Eroticus, Spiderbabe or Mistress Frankenstein). <br /> <br /> Misty Mundae is always 10, Peter M. Like Darian Ken, I found that Barbara Joyce was so hot at school and Ruby LaRocca was a hot sexy girl. <br /> <br /> Watch this with your remote control (free) at night. When you want to take a break from pornography, don't waste time checking About the title - you have better things to do with your life. It's not a movie. It's a pure T&A, but it's not as bad as that standard.
