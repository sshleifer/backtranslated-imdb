Before watching this movie, I would say that I love everything Kathy Bates can do. Now it's all a negative one. James Woods is pathetic ... not his character. His performance. Someone should tell him that "bad" does not have the same meaning as dirt, dirt or stupidity. Same for the Randy Quaid pattern. The only redemption feature is Henry Thomas, who is not a strong enough actor to do nonsense. If you enjoy the country, you will enjoy the scenery. That's the best thing I can give. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of both independent movies and quirky stories.
