Disgraceful in Yash Raj's film and Aditya Chopra, which seems to have lost intelligence over the years and presented a continuous rag in this film that is not worth the You Tube standard. I started tapping my teeth throughout the flick. From the beginning to the end with an unprecedented schizophrenic plot, and in the last scene I just felt ashamed in my country. The stigma in the actors who took this job and even commenting is one piece that they can own. Saif Ali Khan - Disappointed with the movie of your choice. Kareen shows enough skin for weak puberty and Akshay appears Grew up as an intellectual Groaned again with the passion of the English language His cousin is admirable in their performances and with strange films scattered in the past 15 minutes, it is enough to appear the blood vessels. Do not destroy your brain cells, energy or money to see this thing - go see / rent AMU - and Konkana Sensharma instead - one of the beautiful independent films that came out of India, clever and a great story To touch everyone with intelligent actors and give me hope that everything will not be lost in the making of Indian movies
