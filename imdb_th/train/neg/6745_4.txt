This is an economical "Scream" style movie. "Maddy" is a new worker in an unnamed office that she has found and started a relationship with "Chris", her colleague. During the hot party, Chris and his friends convince Maddy to be a member of "Murder Club" where everyone kills people to kick. When Maddy loses and kills someone for real, Hijang will follow. <br /> <br /> This film looks better and has more than what is needed for this type and budget level. After the credit runs out, you will ask yourself why you spent 80 minutes in your life watching it.
