I saw last week after buying a cheap DVD. I want to see it for many years, find a very interesting draft plot. So my disappointment was so great. I think the lead actor is very flat. This part has to be performed like Johny Depp in The Ninth Gate (which is almost perfect), but I think TV budgets tend not to stretch this type of performance. <br /> <br /> I also think that the direction That was confusing and boring, just to remind me that Carpenter didn't make a good movie since In the Mouth of Madness for the story - I was disappointed too! There is no way that it will meet my expectations. I guess. But I think the rewards and explanations are not good and eventually he has the least anti-climax movies. <br /> <br /> Written by one of the AICN's main contributors and you can tell That he loves his movies But I would like better results from a good start. <br /> <br /> I took the DVD back to the store the same day!
