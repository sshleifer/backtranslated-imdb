"The Truth" story of a deceased monster that appears when American factories start to pollute water. A fun monster movie, though not very good. But there are many people trying to get the monster and find out what happened. But not in a completely relevant way Give points for the giant monsters that we created clearly to adjust the size for some scenes. But spending time with it seems that the puppy is not dangerous. The movie is an amusing exploitation that is stupid in the right mind. (One of my complaints is that the printing used in Elvira's launch was so bad that it seemed like a copy of the videotape that had been worn well past 20 years)
