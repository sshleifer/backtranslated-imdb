Marilyn Miller created only three movies before she died premature - SALLY (1929), an amazing, comedy movie named MAJESTY LOVE (1931) and a little story - SUNNY ( It was quite poor, both as an early speaker and as a musical effort - even though she had four dance numbers, she sang two songs (WHO? And ONE MAN ALONE) The rest of the score, including the fine-tuning of the title, was thrown out, even though we heard the latter in scoring behind. Miller looks overweight and skillful here - no star quality at all. Even her dance looks boring. This film was written very badly, filled with funny stories filled with funny and not funny stories and stupid situations. If you're interested in Miller as an actor, take a look here. But for general entertainment
