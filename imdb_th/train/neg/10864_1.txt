The reason I intend to give this movie a chance to spend 2 hours in my life (actually it's only 35 minutes) is my desire to try to understand and hope to thank Indian movies. All I've seen is the old movie of S.Ray. <br /> <br /> Watching through IMDb. I found this story and after seeing the 8.7 rating, I concluded that this must be a movie that will open the door of not know And bringing artistic entertainment Oh, I was wrong, I was! The only logical explanation for this 8.7 rating is those who voted 970. Most of them are Indians and their only investment outside of production. Bolliwood is the movie Adam Sandler. <br /> <br /> This movie is rated in IMDb, a list of 250 popular movies over Citizen Cane Goodfellas of Psycho! I am not in the mood to check and criticize because there is nothing I think is worth remembering from this painful experience. My only hope is that there are many Hindus that like me find that this film is - plain stupid with plenty of kitsch and magic songs.
