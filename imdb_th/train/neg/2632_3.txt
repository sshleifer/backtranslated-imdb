It makes me sad to rate movies with actors who like a lot of places and genres, like Douglas Sutherland, Washington DC and political thriller, but 'The Sentinel' is very low. It seems like they have a good idea in front of signing the right actors and having a great city shot and then spend the holidays for the remaining crew. And I hope I can blame it from the impressive performances from Basinger (not only did I feel that she was one of the worst actors in Hollywood) But I still steamed over a decade later that she was alone. Just a bad actor in the movie in order to receive an Academy Award for 'LA Confidential'), but she is not the only problem that Sutherland I love as Jack Bauer in the drama '24'. Jack, I thought of 'A Time to Kill' or his old 'A Few Good Men'. Douglas spent his free time acting and calling this person. Synopsis: Some of the secret traitors of the Secret Service want the president to die and Douglas is eliminated. Will anyone believe him? In fact, there is no spoiler here: as soon as they come with a half-way sub-plan, it ends before you know. And why some people want the president to die Will it be revealed in the sequel? Too many plot holes, opening too many doors and never closing and anticipating too much. 'The Sentinel' is if you see a single movie once a year, you may not know who the mole is. But anyone who is familiar with this type of movie or even has seen the episode 'Law and Order' The only episode that you will know in the first frame is terrible? Not really. The movie was good, and even if Sutherland would play Jack again, he still received.
