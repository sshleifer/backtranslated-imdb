It's a terrible and terrible movie. <br /> <br /> For real people, real movies are good. For me it is not Life can be bad predictions, bad, nasty, sometimes ridiculous. Maybe that is the reason why people say that this movie is true. <br /> <br /> Too general place: You are a black person. You are a criminal. Ended with a shot or shot by someone; Don't let children play with weapons. It can be dangerous. And then there are people who go to church. They are very good ... <br /> <br /> Previously, I had never seen a bad movie. That may be the reason that I have never noticed that self-portraits are important in movies. In this scene, every scene taken during the daytime, outdoors, is clearly blue and annoying. They are not interested in correcting the color balance. Oh! I used to "rate" more than 300 movies in this database and this (3/10) is my lowest.
