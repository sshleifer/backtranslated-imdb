As a horror movie fan, we all know that renting a blind person is nonsense. Sometimes we find real gems. But many times, we find that the movies that we have just spent the hard earned money are nothing more than perishable steamboats by unreasonable reviews and awards at the film festival. Specified in the box This is the case with Five Across the Eyes (the name I am sure is the two participants referring to the film budget and forcing anyone who looks at it, may have to use all five fingers to stare at the eye. <br /> <br /> The story or at least what the writer * Ahem thinks will pass is focused on a teenage girl who decided to play in the rainforest late at night after leaving the football game. A crazy woman who plays a cat with a mouse with them is a punishment for what she thinks the girl found in her car after the driver, the driver, goes to the gas station parking lot. <br /> <br /> In justice It's an interesting concept. Some of the best horror movies have simple stories. It is in the operation of Five Across the Eyes that this idea has decreased. This film tries to cross between The Blair Witch Project with the work of a shaky camera and massacre at Texas Chainsaw in the form of bare bones of the object. But without success What we get is the scene of the chase of torture, liberation. The chase of torture, released in 94 minutes respectively, with a mockery, groaning and long-lasting travel that served as an inner space between the chase sequence. <br /> <br /> The look of Movies are grainy and The darkness in the movies that do better may increase tension and realism. This is annoying. The character has not been developed and the audience is difficult to find things that sympathize with them. One character stopped to receive a first aid kit and tended to scrape on her face while the gunshot was heard in the background indicating that her friend might have been killed. Another girl muttered as funny as "Don't go out there. She will pick you up. If she makes you, you will kill you. And if you kill you, you're dead." <br /> <br /> It was won by Fangoria and Dreadcentral.com. Stated in the box which forced me to check this Talk about fake orgasm! Maybe my expectations would be as given in a funny topic. I'm all for low price indie horror. But this one takes the cake crap to give five Across the Eyes (or FATE; Get it?) Through <br /> <br /> RazorFriendly gives FATE 1 slash from five /
