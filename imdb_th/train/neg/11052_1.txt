The Deadly Wake is the perfect movie for film students ... to learn how to not make movies. <br /> <br /> Let's see ... What did the team do in this flick? Worst mixed music, worst-worst script editing, all the time, the worst, doing the worst choreography, the worst movie shooting, the worst scene, the worst scene, the worst scene setting. Etc. ... It will still be scary in every dark scene (the light user calls it "black"). Often, the music score is caught up with the winding dialogue which is ok because nobody ever Saying the two sentences without stopping to speak for a long time. The "evil" robot is funny, hilarious ... what is that? Jazz dance? Oh ... I think it should be a tactic or something. I'm sure it caused fear in the heart ... from poor editors. And how do you edit junk videos? impossible. Garbage is garbage, no matter how you get together. How do everyone get this through dailys? <br /> <br /> The bottom line is - I can't stand watching the group for more than 15 minutes. Just to see if it has a good part in it or not. NOPE! none! <br /> <br /> A perfect example of how not to flick ... must see for every serious movie student !!!
