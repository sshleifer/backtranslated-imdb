I saw this "hot" movie when it was screened in 1986. It had an X rating for a short scene about oral sex. But playing in mainstream movies (It is a movie "Art"). Suppose it was the first film to show the famous actress in a clear sex scene. <br /> <br /> What I saw was a boring story about the boy High school (Federico Pitzalis) dear (understand) with older women (Detus Maruschka), as mentioned earlier, Detmers say very beautiful and good body But she gave a very good performance. Pitzalis is a rather bad person. It is not surprising that he never created another movie. Even though there is an embarrassing sex scene (which is clear but rather short), the tedious story moves slowly, which makes me stupid. Good performances by Detmers help in one point only. Most of the time I watched at my watch, waiting patiently until the end. If it doesn't have that sequence, this movie will be forgotten for a long time. Boring and slow You can skip this one.
