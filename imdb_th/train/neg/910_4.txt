The story is straightforward and easy to follow, and there are many uncomplicated comedy to the point that it's boring. Some viewers seem to be funny. But I like the sense of humor. <br /> <br /> There are many Swedish actors who know each other in this movie. Lena Endre always looks good. <br /> <br /> I can't remember original movies Whether it's better or worse, <br /> <br /> If you like watching movies like SÃ¤llskapsresan This movie may be worth watching.
