I just saw the movie premiere on MTV. I have to say that this is very common. Conversations cannot explain the story very well and I feel like there are many intrigue holes. There are no favorite characters in this adaptation because of poor performances. I just found that every character has too much ownership when talking about the people they love. In addition, Kate and Heath's love seems to be a very good incest. They look more like brothers and sisters than lovers. I do not understand why my father accepted this under his roof. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie because there were a few actors that I respected and enjoyed watching movies earlier. But as I said It is very difficult to like any character. The performance of Katherine Heigl is horrible, which is very shocking. She was so bad that she was Edward's sister and it wasn't enough for me to criticize her performance. Johnny Whitworth did well and it was great to see him in some things just recently. And even though his character doesn't look good, he is the only one that I sympathize for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel. They should be our heroines. But came out with greed and lamentation. <br /> <br /> I just didn't enjoy this movie or the songs in it. There was a short appearance of a Christian punk band called MxPx, but that small appearance didn't make me watch this movie again. MTV did an excellent job of making me believe this was a non-movie. I just imagined something completely different.
