Where to start, what's wrong and very scary about this movie? I'm not sure where to start. Ocarina writer who played this type of dice Joseph Green and Rex Carlton. First of all, they can't call their names. I guess they are different, that is why the main name is the brain that is not dead. But the last screen says that the head that is not dead No one knows anything about the medical profession. After every doctor vowed to "No harm" killing women for transplantation of the head is considered "dangerous". In addition, little things called blood and tissue matching Rejection will cause Jan to die in the pan. Including those who take care of the monsters that are working What medical school is Bill graduated from the University of FRANKENSTIEN FU, an old scientist or a mad scientist? That monster has no name. It makes me get out of the hell. In addition, Dr. Bill Cortner, a brilliant surgeon, doesn't know how to treat patients. All and it's a disastrous movie. It's incredibly stupid and can't be seen except in MST3K. I give turkey. Thank you.
