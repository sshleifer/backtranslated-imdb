"A Damsel in Distress" is not one of Fred Astaire's great musicals, but Astaire's bad movies still have a good time. <br /> <br /> "Damsel" Astaire is Jerry Halliday, an American musician who lives in London from a private tour. He met Lady Alice Marsh Morton (19-year-old Joan Fontaine), a beautiful English heir who jumped into the back of a taxi that he was fleeing from his favorite crowd. > <br /> Jerry believes Alice Being forced to marry by her rich aunt He tried to save her life from the family mansion of her family. But soon found that the house staff were betting that Alice's girlfriend would marry Keggs (Reginald Gardiner), butler and conspirator butler Albert. (Harry Watson) Home for Boys sly turns annihilated together the romance of Lady Alice and Jerry, to make sure they win <br /> <br /> musicals have many problems. The first story is based on the novel by P.G Wodehouse (who wrote the screenplay). The story is slow, painful and frightening. When Fred doesn't dance, we have to endure the endless annoying scenes of (a) Fred romancing Joan Fontaine or (b) Keggs and Albert talk to them and each other. <br /> <br /> Butler and house boy Especially irritating They are a villainous character in one-dimensional stock, which is the type of person you want to pierce your mouth. You hope that they will leave the screen and let Fred dance. <br /> <br /> Astaire experiences a lack of Ginger Rogers, who is his regular partner. Joan Fontaine is a lacking actress. Brightness in this movie She is a clever person besides a cute face and a beautiful smile. <br /> <br /> George Burns and Gracie Allen are ready to drive while Jerry is His awesome publicist and secretary But she is very annoying sometimes. <br /> <br /> The direction of the movie by George Stevens is not good. Sometimes movies are scary and don't focus. There are many outdoor scenes that are located on a very foggy road to try to convince the audience that we are in London, not Hollywood (they have to use a lot of dry ice in this movie). Great and became a standard of classical music. And of course the dance in the movie is excellent, thanks to Astaire and his choreographer Hermes Pan. <br /> <br /> But the numbers, music and dance are useless and bad. Sometimes the actors seem to start singing and dancing because it's time for them to start singing and dancing. It seems that music numbers have been inserted into the plot that is hovering around. (At one point, the butler walked out of the mansion and broke into a single drama without any apparent reason.) Figures included:  "I'm dancing and I can't be disturbed now" - Fred dances well on. Foggy streets in London He did something great with "cane-spirals" with a roll of umbrella - but that number ended too quickly when Fred jumped on the previous two-story bus. (In the Broadway musical "Crazy For You" Harry Groener made this number much better with the group of singers) <br /> <br />  "Put Me To The Test" - Fred, George and Gracie tapping three people in the English hut. George and Gracie pair Fred step for the step. But the numbers do not end well for everyone who kicks without reason. <br /> <br />  "The Stiff Upper Lip" (The Fun House Number) - At home, Fred, George and Gracie enjoy dancing. On the floor, rotating cylinder, rotating and fun house mirror It's the best movie. But it is a little repetitive. <br /> <br />  "Things that are being searched" - Fred and Joann von Hornet made their dance numbers together in this film. The back forest of the country mansion Fortunately, it is a very easy dance figure because Joann is not a great dancer. <br /> <br />  "Foggy day in London" - Fred walks around the fog at night. When he first met Joan in London Sometimes he looks as if he is not sure how he will be in the fog - like a musical number himself. <br /> <br />  "Good work if you can." - Great song that Was misused in the movie During the social activities in which Fred's mansion was pulled into the chorus of the singer who faced the singer who sang this song haphazardly. Every time Fred joins the other singers look at him as if they want him to leave. (Again, Harry Grove Manor dance number, the better the music in "Crazy For You")  "Drum Dance Number" - as Fred and Joan are fleeing Fred had to stop and do the numbers. Dance the last tap while hitting the drum group as usual. It's a great amount of dance. But there is no need to use it, of course, except for the time stretching for the movie. <br /> <br /> The most planned moment in this film happens when Fred decides to jump out of the high stone terrace. Rural real estate to prove his love for Joan Fontaine. When he jumped out of the balcony, he found that the trapeze was placed conveniently - right. * Trapeze * - hanging from a tree near Kochi Fred (or more as a stuntman in Fred's clothes) grabbed the trapeze and flung from the floor. <br /> <br /> This movie is worthy of owning a DVD for just dancing numbers. only one But you feel debt to men Who invented the fast forward button on your remote button? >> FF allows you to skip other boring scenes in movies to dance numbers.
