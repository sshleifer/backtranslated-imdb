I am a big fan of Michael Chabon, a novelist / screenwriter. His novel "Wonder Boys" became a great film by Curtis Hanson, his brilliant novel "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay" winning the Pulitzer Prize. A few years ago and he had the hand in the role of "Spider Man 2", which is the greatest comic book movie of all time. <br /> <br /> Director Rawson Marshall Terry directed. Best funny movie "Dodgeball" and the short animated series "Terry Tate: Office Linebacker" and with actors including Peter Saarsgard, Sienna Miller, Nick Nolte and Mena Suvari. This doesn't seem easy. <br /> <br / > It's true. <br /> <br /> Jon Foster plays the art of Bechstein, the son of a gangster (Nolte) who has just graduated with an economics degree. Jon is in a state of being developed: he works the minimum wage that the Book Barn has in relation to his girlfriend / leader Phlox (Suvari), which is less than the number of sexes without any other plans except <br /> <br /> One night at a party, former roommate introduced Jon to Jane (Miller), a clever and intelligent violinist. After that night, they went out to find a paddle and she asked Jon, a question that began to shake him from his inexhaustible existence. "I want you to tell something that you never told the soul alone if You do it will Make this night irresistible. "Then Jon told her about his recurring dreams that he walked around the city, looking at the faces of strangers passing him. But no one looked at him in the eyes. "I thought it would be a dead feeling." <br /> <br /> <br /> The next day, Cleveland Cleveland's (Sardard) boyfriend kidnapped Jon from Working and taking him to an abandoned steel mill Jon Cleveland and Jane are spending time together in the wake of punk rock concerts, making drugs and drinking lots of alcohol. This is not suitable for Phlox that pushed Jon to have a more personal relationship, that is, letting her meet new friends and his father. Then the film tried to take us on Jon's journey while his father unlocked the Phlox handcuffs and the work that had to die when he found freedom and expressed his relationship with Cleveland and Jane. > <br /> There is a problem. Let us follow Jon throughout the story: he's not completely interesting. He has no ambition, passion or goal. He passed through life as an invisible spirit. He explained to Jane the night they met. When first started, there was no problem. But he never cares about anything anymore He is a complete character. He just followed Bohemian, Cleveland and Jane. But he never gave anything to us about what he was interested in or wanted to do with himself. <br /> <br /> So the movie and the supporting characters are nowhere. Where to go and a little more to do apart from sex parties and get an argument In other words, much concern about anything What we have here is the superficial skin of a good movie with nothing inside. Film filming swept the voice with the characters staring at a large number of sex scenes, both straight and gay. The big growth, the sex that was very angry, the chase scenes and the tragic death ... but Doesn't seem to matter At one point, Jane was confused by Jon's pointless actions. "What happened to Jon? What is this about?" Yeah, Jon can tell. We in the audience are also dying. <br /> <br /> The name "The Mysteries of Pittsburgh" must refer to the character itself, because that's what they are. They are all in the building, standing one dimension for real people. The movie never made us come in. We never knew what made them tick. We see them doing many things. But we do not know why and without "why" is one of the worst things that a movie can have
