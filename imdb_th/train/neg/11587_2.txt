This is like the movie No. 6, this movie is really bad. There is nothing in the death department. One fleet is not good and it is something that shouldn't be in the NOES film Freddy. As a happy child in the movie, Lisa Wilcox remains the only thing that makes this worth while. Very underdeveloped characters All that is better than episode 6, but still one of the worst movies in the series. My score is 2/10.
