Elephants Dream should be an important project of the open source community. And while it is a very interesting idea in the concept But in reality it has failed miserably. <br /> <br /> This film has a beautiful performance which may be the only factor in the exchange. However, the big problem that arose with them was the flow of too much light. It was scary, but I thought it would help make this movie a dreamy quality. <br /> <br /> One thing to know is the sound Horrifying While Proog's voice actors, at least semi-powerful, the voice actors of Emo are HORRIBLE. I guess when you have a zero budget, you generally can't hire a voice actor. For me, it seems that they hired an animator to make his voice. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie didn't go anywhere. For me, it looks like it's more "See what we can do" type movies instead of real movies. The storyline is nowhere and failed to show any interesting points. The whole film feels like an excuse to make the area look interesting. <br /> <br /> Overall, it might be worth it Quick download from the official website
