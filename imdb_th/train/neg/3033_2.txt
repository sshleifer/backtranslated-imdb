I am a big fan of Jenna Jameson. But this movie is very scary At that time, Jenna Jameson married Brad Armstrong and he was the director of this film and Jenna was the hottest porn star ever. Of course, Brad tried to make as much money as he could by creating a big porn movie. Now I know why they don't make porn movies for a longer price. In the fantasy world where porn stars can be shown But this is the real world and they cannot be shown That's why there is a porn star. If Jenna is the most beautiful woman that can perform, she will try to watch mainstream movies instead of porn. Just because your beauty doesn't make you a movie star A good example of this is Traci Lords. When she was a teenager until her 20s, she was one of the most beautiful and sexiest women in the world. She made her move to mainstream movies with a low budget and could not be shown. Where is she now? I give 2 points instead of scoring 1 just because Jenna is hot. But with movies that are better than you do at that time In addition, Jenna will have more fans and more money in your bank account if you do anal on film.
