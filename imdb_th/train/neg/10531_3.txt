This is the type of genre which means you like musicals in the 1950s or not. If you do, you will love this thing. Personally, I like the 1930s and most of the 40s musicals that have the dances of Astaire and Rogers and Eleanor Powell, Bill Robinson, Ruby Keeler, James Cagney, Shirley Temple and others. 50 that slows down the numbers, the dance and melodies of that decade make me exhausted. <br /> <br /> This film is a straightforward issue. The first song is ok. But the other three songs were not made for me At that time, the story didn't attract anything as well. Deborah Kerr's appearance is negative again. I do not think I have seen the movies that you perform in the way I like, including this film, which two English teachers are good at. She wears a drama, spending half of the movie threatening to leave Siam. (I am you!) <br /> <br /> However, divorce from myself, like and dislike, no denial of Rogers and Hammerstein production has attracted many people, especially those who like "The Sound Of Music "in the next decade. There is a similarity in R&H's musical drama, so if you like the flick of Julie Andrews, you should like this too. <br /> <br /> This is a Lavish production with the right capital. "L." This is a big musical drama that you rarely see after the release. day You can also get a dubbed singer like today that the actor can't sing. Marnie Nixon then helps Kerr as she did with Natalie Wood in "West Side Story" and Audrey Hepburn in "My Fair Lady". br /> <br /> Yul Brynner is "Raja Monk" and is a stereotypical traditionalist. A kind filmmaker always expresses negative feelings. He doesn't "progress" like a left wing like words. But education teacher (Kerr, while "Anna Leonovens") will make him straight The current global progress makes teachers much higher than those who try to cure cancer! However, Yul excels in this chapter and still uses some jokes with the characters that bark over the bite. Fairly, he is the big star of this film. Brynner has magnetism even in "The Magnificent Seven". Yul is a cowboy that attracts viewers. <br /> <br /> In summary, it's a good movie for the day and who Millions of people enjoy it. I will leave it
