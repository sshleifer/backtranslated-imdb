I can't say that this is the worst movie ever created. But personally I thought it was like that because when it was released in the cinema (1), the first murmur was positive enough that my girlfriend would really confirm STOOD IN LINE to receive the ticket and ( 2) It is still the only "serious" movie that I remember that the audience began to kick in at some point. When we arrived at the infamous snake fight scene (And endlessly) I think everyone is willing to give up. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can accept is a lush shot. Oh and with Bo's breasts, although her performance is a bare wood and doesn't give more points than the image of Playboy. <br /> <br /> "Amazing tension" in this movie is between Bo. Terrible performances and terrible directions of her husband The fight with snakes must be one of the most incompetent "action" scenes ever shot. However, this is one of those movies that are not good enough. It may be worthwhile to look at the level of humor that is not intended. The worst movie I've ever seen.
