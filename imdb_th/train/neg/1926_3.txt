When my child was forced to look at least 10 times for the second Christmas, I felt that I had enough qualifications to pass on the classic tale of Dr. This version of Seuss and ... It's not that good. First of all, tracking classic shows like Chuck Jones's special TV animation will be difficult for everyone. But this interpretation is hard and has a good feeling. I will accept that there are a number of inspired gags. But overall, this movie came out in the form of cash that was calculated at the same time as anticipated that it would be a Christmas trade. But in conflict with Grinch's character, as Boris Carloff wrote, he was a slow burn. Orderly and ambiguous There is no way to make Carrie's madness, and that's the most obvious mistake. The talented actors like Jeffrey Tambor and Christine Baran Skiing have completely lost here. Why is it universal? Why do I mean I understand what Tony Hopkins will take on? Offered (like Michael Ken, his country), but this must be filed under "A movie that shouldn't be done". This is not a good omen for cats that are in the hat, even the thinner books that Universal prepared for this Christmas. I feel that I will follow the same advice as I do with it: skip it and read a book or watch TV specially. This is 2 hours that you have no way back.
