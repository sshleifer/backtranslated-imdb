Dolph Lundgren, and shaking his way through this disjointed mystery and excitement that is not as cool as a box. In fact, he's quite good here. But the story is a mess of cliches B-movie (detective revenge on the prostitute S&M prostitute) that looks like it's done when they walk away. This film picked up a bit in the second half. But for Lundgren for better, rent RED SCORPION instead.
