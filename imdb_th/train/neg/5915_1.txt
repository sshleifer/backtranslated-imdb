I have seen many movies from China - and Hong Kong. This is the worst thing. No, the worst thing is 'Unknown happiness' I watched 'platform' yesterday evening and thought that the two films of Jia Zhang Ke had to be better. This evening I was disappointed again. I wouldn't watch 'Xiao Wu' tomorrow evening because I just put all three movies into the trash! Anyone who gives this movie 'platform' ten in ten must watch more movies! Photography is not good: it is very difficult to distinguish between some characters because of lack of close-up work. The story was so separate that I quickly passed it to frustration. I will not recommend this movie to anyone. Let me Zhang Yimou or Chen Kage every day This is the true master of Chinese movies, not a fraud!
