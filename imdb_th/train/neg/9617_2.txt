Three years ago, Rachel (Therese Freetwell) is partying at the lake with her friend when her brother falls from the boat and drowns. Rachel's friends think it's time for her to stop dancing and blame herself for something she can't control. So pick up liquor and things to chew and head back to the same lake that is in Rachel's constant nightmare. As expected, bloodshed began when two friends splashed before going to a party. This flick has the feeling of playing in high school that everyone forgot their lines and 'winged it' ... terrible! Margaret Gabriel, a writer for his role as Leo, Rachel's boyfriend outside of Fretwell and Gabriel, has a lame performance and a few characters that you want to choke out before them. Will be 'offed' to pay attention to a few other players with the nerve to appear: Erin Gallagher, Andrew Williams, Jasmine Trice and Derek Nieves. This is one day of memories that you will never forget.
