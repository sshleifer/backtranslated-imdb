For God's love, please do not watch this movie! It's a waste of time. The plot of this story can be predicted as well as the romantic scene. Trying to create too much with very little. This film and predictable villains from evil are just lame. The characters have not been developed and most of the movies are full of images of Rome, which is more interesting than real movies. Moreover, the show is embarrassing. I know that everyone is trying to find their niche. But this is a real disaster. I can't believe that there are millions of pounds actually paid to put this movie on the screen. Don't waste money or time in this movie. Go see Grandma or something worth instead.
