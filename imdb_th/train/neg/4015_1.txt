A friend told me it's classic like "Debbie doing Dallas" is nowhere near I think my main complaint about the most beautiful actors in the porn industry. Even more frightening is that she is on the screen most of the time. But I read somewhere that back in those days, pornography must have value "art" I couldn't find it Look only if you are primarily interested in the history of pornography development or can appreciate the art in porn movies. I know i don't But the director of this film seems to be a talented person. He also tried to give Simon & Garfunkel the right to use his music. Of course they refused.
