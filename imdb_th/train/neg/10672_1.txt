It has an ancient idea of ​​this type of film and without substance. The plot goes where and at the end of the movie I feel like sucking to see it. Production is good However, the script and performances are of B-movie quality. The casting is poor because there are good actors mixed with actors, crumby, good actors, not holding their own or lifting them. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth the more words. But I will say more to meet the ten-line minimum requirements. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr. play their own caricature in other movies. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for entertainment without The reason I still do not recommend this movie
