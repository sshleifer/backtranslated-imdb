This film has two of my favorite actors in Kilmer and Downey. In addition, Larry Miller has always enjoyed the small part. Despite this, I found it almost impossible to keep an eye on it. Michelle Monaghan might look beautiful. But she is almost without charm and the reason for Downey's character's fascination with her character is incomprehensible in terms of the information presented in the movie or the way it shows. The ending seems to be pretentious, and although the intention is like that, the audience should join, nod and send this film without being able to take us to the side of the protagonist's story, making us unwilling or not. Can do it. <br /> <br> Fans of this movie say that people who disagree are "don't understand". I don't think that will be like that. The story is not complicated or beyond understanding. It is just moving and clumsy and clearly produced. I understand". I don't like it. Paddy Breathnach's "I Went Down" and Guy Ritchie's "Snatch" and "Lock, Stock and Two Barrel Barrels" are better examples for filmmakers whose director Shane Black failed. > <br /> I used birthdays together with Shane Black, but watching his credit (Most of the screenwriters) made me want to separate myself from other connections.
