I will admit that I didn't give this movie a lot of opportunities. I decided from the beginning that this is not my movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, it looks great in terms of movies. The scene in the early 70s of Manhattan looked very good, like the leading actors. It is a very sharp black and white which almost makes the movie feel dated and fresh. However, other techniques that filmmakers use to shoot are expected to go to hell. A separate revision in the late 60s had a period between surrealism and the new wave. The story also feels like it comes from a specific time between fantasy, freedom, and artistic experiments. <br /> <br /> The film follows the girl around town as she looks for the man she Have an anonymous phone Sex with When she meets other strange characters, she reveals her strange habits and reveals them. It seems that this movie is meant to be an out of comedy. But it feels avant-garde I expect that if you like the movie Andy Warhol, you will be very excited to discover The Telephone Book. <br /> <br /> Some problems I have: near the end of the movie. Over twelve minutes - cruel to sit through In addition, there is a very clear animation sequence that I met with the aggregates and children who acted as the pinnacle of the movie. I laughed out loud four or five times and I liked the ending. (Deleting the disgusting flat animation) and when the movie changes color to the last of the phone booths at night, I like the way it looks better. Eventually it was one of the experiences that I felt like I would like it a lot if it was a little different. But this is what the creator gave us It is not clear the art and the way the rest of the dial. But there is no reason to introduce it by yourself I didn't find it to be as unique or as creative as being forced and pretentious.
