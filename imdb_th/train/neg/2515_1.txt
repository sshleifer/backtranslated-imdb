This movie is a nasty thing and the creation of this movie is considered a major crime. <br /> <br /> One of the greatest mysteries of filmmaking is why no one ever created a faithful movie about it. With this amazing mystery It is a story of a fascinating, romantic, old-fashioned and barren English humor. Why did the producer have to change Richard Gordon from the Scotland Yard police as an amateur detective, introducing a stupid role and a parody image of a British servant, changing the main story about murder charges and Gordon's fight situation to help the accused, etc. These producers and directors who think they can create better stories than those in the book should write the original script by themselves and Not rape each other's products.
