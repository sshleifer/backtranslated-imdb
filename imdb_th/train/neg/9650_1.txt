Maaan I will start with this horror movie, God, where is this bad story, bad and bad? I don't know what the director is thinking when he makes this movie. Namaste London is a very fun movie to be honest .. Well, but here .. I'm good .. For a movie that should be a musical drama .. The song is terrible. AR Rahman should be the music director. <br /> <br /> To the two great actors. The director should do A much better Although the first half absorbs the last 30 minutes of movies, it's okay. The performances from Salman and Ajay save lives from all disasters. <br /> <br /> See if you have nothing to do better. The last good movie from Bollywood that I watched (And I watch this) Dev Dev and Wake Up Sid
