I entered the theater that was intended to pass through an enjoyable 90-minute period, if not receiving light. I am not entertained or enlightened at all. This film cannot decide what it will be and ends with nothing much. There are a couple of funny lines and an incredibly pretentious movie reference (The 400 Blows - for this character? While none of the characters were treated with much respect, more than thirty gay men received the worst thing: fat obese hunters, sad, all slogan. If you're in the mood to deal with gay relationships, try Parting Glances, Longtime, Trick, All Over the Guy, Red Dirt, Maurice, Philadelphia. Instead, you'll thank me. <br /> <br />
