I've seen many movies in my life. But not much It's a movie that makes fun for fat people. There is no real story. There are bad actors, no jokes and many more. Is this a movie you want to watch? I guess not! <br /> <br /> I guess the filmmakers try to be original and creative. But it seems that it was created by a 12-year-old boy who doesn't have the skills to film at all. The funny part is called as funny as ping through people's faces or wind. From the source, if it is the humor you like, then this is the movie for you !! <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money on this movie!
