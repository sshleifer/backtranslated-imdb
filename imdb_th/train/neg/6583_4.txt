Ideas and interesting stories that are not effective. <br /> <br /> When you watch a movie, you may feel dissatisfied with the ending I do. I do not know whether to take root in any movie, Taye Diggs looks boring as the detective, the rest of the character looks one-dimensional and unpleasant ) Is a more cute girl. In fact, we may enjoy seeing the plot unfold and the perpetrator is brought to justice The problem is that she is a bitch like other girls, turning from a sweet girl into an opportunistic ringleader. I do not understand the moral message of this movie and as a detective and thriller it doesn't work.
