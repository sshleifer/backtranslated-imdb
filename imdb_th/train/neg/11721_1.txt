This movie is scary. The script is completely unrealistic. But it was written for use in the real world. Editing and lighting effects were worse than the first project in most film schools. <br /> <br /> Who do I not recommend this movie: A ) Know the details about the world of police or secret operations. B) Know the details about making a movie or admire. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to the average person or below my average idea Think That it would be fun if I was a fool If you have to watch this movie in full, I would suggest one kind of intoxication. <br /> <br /> It's a total waste of little production.
