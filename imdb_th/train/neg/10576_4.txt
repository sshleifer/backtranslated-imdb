I was very excited when the film premiered in 2005. The place is easy and interesting: each episode is a one hour mini movie directed by famous and famous horror film director. Then, when I finally watched them, it was a bit of a decline. Some good episodes come from the first season. But all of them are mixed bags I think it's a learning session and think that Season 2 will be much better. <br /> <br /> My boy is a shocking person. At least the first season, there are a few good stories here and there. Season 2 (except "Black Cat" starring Jeffrey Combs, which is excellent) is my total loss at "Sounds Like". It may be the worst thing I have watched on TV in the last 10 years and most other episodes are not very good. I hope Season 3 will change to the next year. But I didn't hold my breath
