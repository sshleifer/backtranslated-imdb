My first comment about this movie is terrible. I expect to have awesome performances, crappy, bad entertainment, horrifying special effects movies. It is quite interesting and the script is quite good and satisfying. The performance is not bad and overall I enjoy watching this movie. But it is still not a good movie But it is not worth it as you think And I am pleased to know that this film can impress me even if it's not good. Overall, it's a movie that should be avoided. But for me, it's not as bad as I expected.
