I accept the problem with the very famous Ealing movie I've seen before. For my tastes, whether black and funny or having a light tone that is not as satisfying as an actor or story That's an important way to say I want to like. "Man in a white suit" but found himself struggling to sit for a short time. <br /> <br /> Sidney Stratton textile worker (Alec Guinness) may be polite. But he was determined to make progress in the form of his efforts to invent fabric fibers that could not be broken or dirty Using the factory lab for his latest experiments, he faced with both material and human constraints - the latter was the mill master who didn't understand what he was doing. Then, thought out and had a determination to stop. He <br /> <br /> "It is a little thought like yours that stands in the way forward," Sydney complains, training in the mirror what he struggles to say to men. <br /> <br /> Single issue G "Man in the White Suit. "This is the vision of Sydney's progress. There are a few small ideas as well. So more than the boss or the workers who are not satisfied with his work. My problem is more important: for jokes "White Suit" is not a joke. It's a fairly serious script that often tries to dig a sensitive effort with humor from spitting, spending two times, using three times and dizzy. <br /> <br /> The best joke is the sound of the machine. Sidney toils who are going to "Bleep-Blop-Bleep-Bop" endlessly and pull out strange looks from every visitor until Sidney either extracts from his miracles from it or blows it up trying. Like the humor that strayed in this movie <br /> <br /> I have never seen Guinness have less impact on the film, even though he looks young and is not really possible in his mid-30s. ) It seems that he is more bloodless than the one who faces the wax that he plays in "Zhivago Doctor". He is the same cold fish, no matter how he overlooked the sad feelings of the mill girl that affects life savings. His Highness He was unemployed at the (Facing Vida Hoppa as Bertha) or Daphne Birnley (Joan Greenwood), the young woman who is his true partner in the fight against "Dirt and dirt" as she said Only Greenwood can do it. <br /> <br /> The players that support the "White Suit" work as well as the famous Ernest Thesinger, "Bride Of Frankenstein", act as an offensive captain in the industry. Which looks like Nosferatu and makes it laugh like a death call Howard Marion Crawford, as the other factory chief, has memories here as he plays as a medical officer who blinks in "Lawrence Of Arabia". Then there is an undeniable charm. Gained Mandy Miller as a small girl who stole her short moments on camera from other people. <br /> <br /> But most of the scenes are played outright. Work with comedies before (His previous collection of "Whiskey Galore" was not the opposite. That kind of impression) Roger MacDougall's play gave rise to scientific thought as a potential catastrophe. But failing to present the boring Sidney in anything other than the most pleasant light. <br /> <br /> Ealing's comedies, nevertheless, the Ealings I saw never seem to do this work. Can only be when they play with our sympathy seriously "Kind Hearts And Coronets" and "The Ladykillers" (Mackendrick again goes into the picture) is the classic game "White Suit". Pointless walks that are separated from When it should cooperate like a bad luck set
