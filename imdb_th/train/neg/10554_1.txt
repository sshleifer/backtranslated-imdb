Avent-garde nightmarish "movie", the price is very low, with the illusion of greatness, sitting hard. I received a message that child abuse was wrong. Wow revealed big I don't know if it's wrong before watching this. Yes, it's a word. Don't look at this "movie" if you are not happy with the nudity of a male or female. Do not watch it if you are the least nauseous. Don't watch if you're interested in acting. In the second thought, just didn't look at the period. <br /> <br /> My grades: D- <br /> <br /> Special DVDs: Make a premiere movie, interview with Kristie Bowersock, deleted scenes. Movies, director descriptions, 2 teaser samples, music videos by The Azoic, & classroom video tests
