I've seen a lot of shit in my day, but the goodness of Hot Rod used the cake last night. I saw free screenings in New York. I hope they will show a funny version to customers who pay only. The big laughter is sparse, the plot is not interesting and the character is the best dimension. One of the highlights is the hilarious dance scene with Adam Samberg. It has no value and is the only scene that I truly laughed at. In addition, I only remember random and dead air. SNL and Samberg fans may be disappointed. I know I expect more. But it's short. I would not recommend joining a free or paid screening to watch this movie.
