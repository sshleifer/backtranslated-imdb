God ... Where to start? I can only stomach for the first 10 minutes before closing it with disgust. Apart from the actors who played Robin Hood, the rest was terrible. And I can only extend the time of unbelief until now. <br /> <br /> From the debut of the first episode, I lost a lot of mistakes, holes, holes and terrifying costumes. Began with a poor farmer trying to hunt deer to feed his family Everything is fine and good However, those who are not good must be mostly deaf because a number of soldiers are filled with armor on the horseback, able to sneak into him within 10 feet. <br /> <br /> When he runs away from him He had 10 feet behind him until the shock that you couldn't see them, followed by them immediately, about 20 feet behind him again. Then he ran into the bushes and was immediately managed by two soldiers ... that had just happened a few seconds before being rode behind dozens of feet. <br /> <br /> "Armor" on saw. It was clear that the soldiers were a very painful fabric, which they tried to make it look like mail and failed miserably. Not to mention the "armor" of military leaders is too large for the poor. Seriously, he looks like he is a small boy, wearing his father's big armor! In the end, Robin was able to shoot about 5 shots, completely firing in one soldier's hand for a period of about 2 seconds from what appeared to be a recurve bow. No man can create those images in a short time with a rifle that has less curving edges. <br /> <br /> After that, they flee the soldiers and stop to help them dress well. Amazing And cleaning "farmers" by digging ditches ... what the nobles all are willing to do all the time, right? I'm sorry that this series has a second season beyond me. Production cost (At least for what I see) must rise to ten dollars. (Or the euro) ... <br /> <br /> Seriously - I think high school drama classes may make a better meaning. This is terrible. Even Robin Robin's terrifying version of Robin Hood is better. <br /> <br /> I suggest you to cross this strange thing for rent or buy the "Robin of Sherwood" series of mid-80s. Better to act, queue and produce well. <br /> <br /> For BBC shame ... for shame ...
