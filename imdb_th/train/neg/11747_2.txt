Although it received good media after playing at the Toronto International Airport The film festival has many reasons to not expect more than this. One - is a very low cost two Canadian movies - it's written, directed and starring the same person. (It is often a bad signal, except that it is Woody Allen, George Clooney or one or two respected filmmakers) But even though I watched with lower expectations But it turned out to be a much bigger disappointment than I had imagined. <br /> <br /> In conclusion - the script is not good. Don't waste your time or money with this turkey. It claims to be a joke. But I laughed twice In addition, there are songs that rattle around. This method gets any attention that I never knew.
