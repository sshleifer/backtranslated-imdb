A man found that his parents were part of a nuclear experiment in the 50s and now he has the power to ... flare! <br /> <br /> I really focus on this movie. What is the story that is directed by Toby Hooper, the great and staring Brad. Unfortunately, it is not higher than the movie with powerful power. Spontaneous combustion has interesting evidence behind Unfortunately, it has never lived up to its potential and extends its lifespan too much. Special effects are not bad and help bring the movie to the final. <br /> <br /> The actor Dourif is not stealing the show. <br /> <br /> Not a classic, but Not the worst of that kind. <br /> <br /> ** From ****
