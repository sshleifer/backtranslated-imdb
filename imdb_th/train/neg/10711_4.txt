The minion is about ... Okay, minion, Satan's servant, and the goal is to get the key to unlock the door that his boss is trapped. He is a demon of some kind with humans, and when the body dies, there will be another. Everyone who happens to be overwhelmed will go angry and reckless. Dolph Lundgen plays Lucas, a member of Templar's secret forces, who has been assigned to keep the keys away from the minions. This film started a thousand years ago in the Middle East where Templar, two knights fleeing from the minions. Then jumped forward to 1999, with some major winds blowing in New York. Archaeologists were assigned to study / dig the place where the keys were found. Minion is behind the keys and the movie becomes a long chase scene between Minion and Lucas and archaeologists. <br /> <br /> That movie is just a low-budget B-movie flick. Energy and just trampling You will track the chase. But you won't feel involved in stories that deliberately bring ideas from previous movies (Especially the movie The Terminator) The battle scenes with the minions are difficult in that you will not feel the goodness or badness of this demon warrior. It's "good" to become a man's army when fighting a group of temples Lar But suck when it comes to face to face And it should be a long time All this shows that any sense of logic just throw down the drain for convenience. All ideas about Templar's secret orders, doors to hell and keys are not well explained. We just accept that it exists. It seems that this movie will be created with a feeling of not much potential with the story. But enough to make a few bucks. Dolph Lundgren is sure that he looks like he wants him somewhere else. <br /> <br /> Verdict: 2 out of 5 stars
