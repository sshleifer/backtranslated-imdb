This is not what I want to see. I bought it from a DVD and under the movie I found myself frustrated and closed the movie for a moment. <br /> <br /> This is what I don't like: <br /> <br /> 1 They are shooting <br /> <br /> The two tribes are really annoying. <br /> <br /> 3 Dinosaurs (mostly) look annoyed. <br /> <br /> 4 Bad scientists are annoying. <br /> <br /> 5 The quality of the DVD image is terrible. <br /> <br /> My favorite thing: <br /> <br /> 1 Jerry Goldsmith's song. This song is really great. I have an illegal soundtrack from this movie. Sadly, the sound quality is poor. But it was okay for the time. <br /> <br /> 2 The first time we saw the dinosaurs that they inspired for fear. <br /> <br /> 3 The cute darling when he was in Water and playing <br /> <br /> 4 funny scenes that are with the tents. <br /> <br /> 5 Children who see this movie hope to learn that evil will disappear.
