I read the back of the DVD of this movie in Best Buy about a year ago and said to myself, "Look funny and have Michael Clarke Duncan. How can I lose?" I proceeded to pay $ 15.99 plus taxes. I brought it to my friend's house and both of us were shocked when I saw that it was written and poorly executed. Many wooden displays All performances "hilarious" and "outstanding" never arrived. After 90 minutes, I hung my head with shame, knowing that I couldn't get 90 minutes or $ 15.99 back. I almost cried as well because if that's what That can be considered "funny" I don't want to believe in movies anymore My friends and I told our friends about our horror movies all the time to the point that they wanted to see it in order to understand how bad it was. During the holiday season this year, I watched with him because he didn't want to watch it alone. This is my next terrible mistake because when I watched, I became angry. I started shouting to watch movies and I wasn't the only one to talk to the movie era. Everyone that I know has glimpse this movie has the worst deal they've ever seen. My humor is sick and twisted and often causes my friends to be offended. But that was not able to record this movie The fact that this movie is not on the list of the top 100 in IMDb is surprising. The fact that scoring (at the time of this writing) is 3.6 is a crime against humanity.
