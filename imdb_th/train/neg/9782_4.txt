This movie has such a promise !! It's a great idea. The underdog paintball team struggles for personal recognition and dignity, only losing speed due to bad conversations, bad editing and half-written stories. The characters in the beginning are interesting, just losing half the steam to become the only dimension that makes people weary. <br /> <br /> Maybe if they spend more time on the subject and conversation. Used to be a great movie instead of trying almost later
