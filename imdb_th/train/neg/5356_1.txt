I'm sorry to say that this movie is definitely not good. It reminds me of a grade C porn movie that has one important difference: no porn movies. <br /> <br /> Stories and conversations require a complete overhaul. Maybe a bad performance will not be noticed. At the very least, walking should be picked up. <br /> <br /> While I accept that this has a low budget and the director is doing very well because of low resources. Time in the story or better for others to write Many action scenes, pointless stories. <br /> <br /> It makes me waste time.
