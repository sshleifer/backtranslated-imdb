I saw this movie only once and that was enough for me. This movie has very little, if any, story, and it seems to be nothing but the sequel of mental violence and sadistic and others. The second story "Night of The Demons;" and I want to see you play as a normal person. Unfortunately, the Tobe Hooper script has just begun and is almost nowhere when Robert Englund dominates movies and chews the scenery and plot. Zoe, I know where you are now; Hide from this movie!
