scary Movie About the primitive painter who was with a boring girl, Tatum O'Neill had to go through her movements and have some of the most verticals in film history. Richard Burton looked close to death in this film and we should Believe that he looks "Good for sixty" The performance is not as good as you think. The characters are scary, like the story. It's hard to feel anyone in this movie except Larry Ewashen, who plays the guy in the porn theater that visits Tatum. He's a funny person. This movie is really a waste of time. If you are a Tatum fan like me - which is the reason I rent it from the beginning - please don't watch this movie. She is really bad and you will wonder if maybe MOON PAPER is a coincidence. Not because Bams, Banks, Banks and Darlin are known to have done well. Still, don't rent this movie. And if you are a Burton fan, rent something when he looks good and not fossil
