This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I was tricked into thinking that it might be good because there are two of my favorite actors. Now I want to punch Jason Schwartzman in the face to get this role. I'm physically sick after watching this movie. Sometimes I don't understand Hollywood. There are many people who try to destroy that I'm sure you can skip out and get the best. This makes the worst movie you create is equivalent to Ferris Beullar instead of sediment. Funny jokes like dolls, hair and tearing ads, blatant jeans help to add humor to the movie. Glad I avoided this movie and watched on TV. This proves that you should avoid leaving January every time.
