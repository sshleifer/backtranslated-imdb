Please don't hate me But I have to be honest to watch this movie. I am very fun. <br /> <br /> It's a movie with Stupid Cast and Stupid Songs !!! <br /> <br /> Unnecessary songs !!! Mehbooba .. . Insult includes the original one, Holi .... well .. it is ok! Since every movie tradition must have one !! Chad Raha Hai Nakha, whatever ... very stupid. Song jee Le ... Listen to it like Playboy Song Stupid Song ... <br /> <br /> Other than music This movie is ok. This is the adaptation of Ram Gopal Verma ... If you think you will like this movie, <br /> <br /> This movie depends on the audience and his decision. Did he / she think about this? This movie is Copy. He / she wants to hit her head on Cinema Seat. Or if he / she thinks of being a director himself, he / she will relax and watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Continue Go, I see both ways that I will congratulate and Abuse Ram Gopal for this disaster that he has done ... <br /> <br /> Many other things that disturb the CAST are incredibly terrible. > Amitabh Bachchan As Babban / Gabbar (Amitabh in his movie, funny remake, what the director thought) Aja y Devgan As Heero / Veeru (Bobby Deol should be better) Prashant Raj As Raj / Jai (Abhishek is meant for this role The appearance of Mehbooba) Sushmita Sen As Radha Very cute .... Oh, sorry. Hehehe, he's okay. I don't think there is anyone. <br /> <br /> This movie will be perfect. No matter what the actor is okay. <br /> <br /> I'm not excited. This movie is ok for watching. <br /> <br /> Overall score. <br /> <br /> Direction ... 8/10 I He has been credited with the script ... 9/10 ... 3/10 BAD Scripting Songs ... 5/10 unnecessary in the film would be better, easy on the ear. In order to play on PCs and iPods and Stuff Cast ... 1/10 <br /> <br /> Total ... 3/10 <br /> <br /> Syed Shabbir Aly Naqvi from Pakistan
