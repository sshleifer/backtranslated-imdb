This movie makes me really angry because every main character or character has a southern accent. I live in Iowa for 29 years and I know people don't have a Southern accent here. This movie is about men who make potions and I don't know the real story or what this movie is probably. With the use of drugs, beautiful graphics and really insulting them to be used to cook like sugar I lost my brother to cook medicine and this movie made me feel sick because of the temptation of drugs. The movie makes it look cool when using drugs. But I was happy at the end when the guy almost made it across the state. I also know that most women who experience painful rape do not want love for their boyfriend or husband the next day. This movie is wrong in all directions. I would recommend "The Basketball Diaries" if I would recommend movies about drugs.
