I just saw this at the 2009 Palm Springs International Film. This is the first release of the top Dutch actress Monique van de Ven. And from my observations, it should be her last. I hate unbelievable movies that you will separate from every scene. This film makes you scratch your head immediately. When it started, the young photographer and his girlfriend working for the international aid organization were driving through the Taliban mountains in Afghanistan with a discussion about their love when the rocket stopped the truck. In front of them They left their vehicles to watch the battle of Talliban with rocket launchers, machine guns, rifles, pistols and bombs. The five men in the truck, Bob (Waldemarren Strauss) began Photographed all of this when he saw a insurgent assassinated by a hand that killed his girlfriend Since they were in the hand throwing range, they could not stay beyond 50 yards. His girlfriend was blown up and he photographed the time of the explosion that killed her and won the prize as the photographer of the year for photos. Every scene and every situation in this movie is ridiculous as it was launched. In the following year, Bob found himself assigned to National Geographic on the Dutch island, where he met Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and infiltrated the brutal world of drug traffickers. Avoid this film. I'll give 4.0 out of 10.
