Some people owe Ang Lee's apology. In fact, many people do And i will start I have never been interested in Ang Lee's Hulk film because of a near-unanimous bad review. Even premium cable channels seem to be rarely shown. Finally, I decided to watch it yesterday in the US network and wow .... <br /> <br /> Spoilers for Ang Lee's remains and amazing remains <br / > <br /> It's boring! I almost did not do it through Ang Lee's Hulk. Eric Bana lacks the feeling. Noltee is awesome. Sam Elliott is different. (And not fun, he is often a cool character) In fact, I think they chose Eric Bana because his non-explanatory face is the easiest to imitate with computer graphics - and it is clear that Ang Lee Hulk is intended to be similar to Bruce Banner in a manner that is not angry with him. When Hulk fights a mutant poodle, I am ready to accept the Hulk as the worst superhero movie ever. > <br /> But then there is something about 3/4 of the way in this boring movie. There are truly exciting scenes and - I dare to say - the action scenes that start with Hulk broke out of the quarantine base in the military base, fighting the M1 and Comanche in a desert helicopter, then riding the F22 Raptor to the Stratosphere to occupy the streets of San Francisco only. This is one of the best action scenes ever created for superhero movies. And I must say that CGI is quite good Does not mean that the Hulk is completely reliable But it does not want to suppress the belief more than necessary in many non-superhero action movies And that is a success. <br /> <br /> Of course, the ending is very stupid with Bruce Banner's father, becoming a villain that has changed shape. But the previous action scenes have embarrassed the hero of Iron Man. And overall, apart from the moving mutant dog, it looks like the CGI in Hulk tries hard to convince you that he is real and has Really interacting with his surroundings Of course, it's better than I expected. <br /> <br /> Ok, but then, The Incredible Hulk? Guess ... it's boring too! It appeared only a few times by the Hulk and this is what - CGI in this horrible movie. Perhaps the Ang Lee's Hulk version may look fake sometimes and watch as a cartoon. But there are also reliable moments. The Incredible Hulk looks ridiculous in a positive way. It has skin tones and muscles that do not look like living things. But only some parts created from the computer It's really unusual The lighting, environment, and face effects didn't look more than 5 years old. In Lee's basin, they look older than 10 years and there is no excuse for that. We live in an era where computer programmers can destroy movies thoroughly, just like the directors, actors or movie actors who have ever done. <br /> <br /> Worse, writers and directors of this film don't seem to learn. Know nothing Ang Lee's "failure" made all the same mistakes. Bruce Banner had no emotion. The generals were not too reluctant. There was only one dimension that seemed to be forged than Hulk. Love, interest, unreliability. (I have to give Liv Tyler credit for being more emotional than Jennifer Connelly, although both are quite easy to see). Tim Blake Nelson acted almost as though Nick was in This movie is only a few minutes. The Hulk didn't do much in this movie, of course, no more than the version of Ang Lee. The Incredible Hulk is slightly faster. But since nothing really happened, that was not worth it. Oh yes, the villain looks disguised as a Hulk. In fact, he's more interesting than a human than a monster. <br /> <br /> This is how I can clearly say that Ang Lee's version is better: if I have The opportunity to see Ang Lee's version again. May I sit and watch to see a good action sequence? Others try to appreciate the conversation more (There is a greater chance that I will go ahead quickly in the good part) but there is no single scene in The Incredible Hulk that should be worth watching only once. It is at the bottom of many superhero movies. CGI. The cartoon insults the audience - at least in the version of Ang Lee. It seems that they are trying to make it realistic. (Except for the giant poodle, of course) <br /> <br /> It is definitely an idea - believe that the filmmakers intend to remove the bad feelings associated with Ang Lee's Hulk by creating the same movie. Almost everything <br /> <br /> It is the reliability of Edward Norton that he seems to be distant from this movie.
