There are no spoilers in this review. There's nothing to lose. <br /> <br /> No plot, nothing. Most clips show at least trying to tie the clip into the story by stretching slim. But didn't do that The three-line clip that will lead to a monotonous sequential sequence of boring clips ... OK, so maybe they are short in production time But they are better than skipping all now Wasted time. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how this happened. In general, exfoliation is better than tropical cutting. But this way ... <br /> <br /> Thank you to the heaven that they came back to form in the next episode.
