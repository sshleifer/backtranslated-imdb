This movie, based on John Fante's novel, has helped people tell me why. I see that there is no reason why this good book should be adapted in this way. If you want to create a romantic romantic film with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek, how do you link up with the Ask The Dust? - and if you want to make this a movie, why would you want to make it into a romantic Hollywood movie with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek? I do not understand. <br /> <br /> The story adaptation is not good and if you read the book and like it, I'm almost sure that you don't like what Towne does with it. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, you may find that the casting of strange actors, poor performances and movie shooting are too small. But you hope for the best I really hope during this movie. Actually, I want it to be good. But it's getting worse and it's as simple: whether you read fantasy novels or not, it's not a good movie. Another romantic story like Hollywood, created with poor performances, lack of structure and of course there are many shoots from Colin Farells' bare buttocks. <br /> <br /> I can complain more about movies. This time story. I've seen it. Alright, I have to watch it because I like the book a lot and are curious. And I'm very disappointed. <br /> <br /> 1/10 For Colin's small mustache at the end of this movie, cute ... If he wears it all the time, I'll give it 2/10.
