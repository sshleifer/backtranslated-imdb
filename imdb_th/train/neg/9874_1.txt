Fiction book about foxes and his family doing what foxes do Stolen from the farm and killed the victim Until three farmers decided that they had enough of this fox and tried different ways to solve the "fix" problem. "Bring the fox out" every time it opens A very loose semester is a great god pastiche of American robbery movies, especially ocean movies. They also have George Clooney as Mr. Fox to add insult and manage to miss the point of the story quite completely. So appreciate them, they will make a lot of money and destroy the classic book Roald Dahl.
