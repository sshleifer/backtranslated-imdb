It is a parody of Tomb Raider and Indiana Jones. Humor, humor and performances as well. But after that, it is a soft, central film that is expected and not important because what you want is sex. Which makes me get the biggest problem of all. There is hardly any of it which makes you feel that you are watching TV at 3 am and the independent movies are playing and this film is made by some college kids who don't In that industry You have a lot of time to wait for the actual sex scene. Many times you think something is going to happen. Then let one hang (maybe two or one with two parts). Where actually goes? Somewhere is very pleasing. I can't recommend this thing unless you find it in one or two dollars. If you're lucky in a movie that has a plot and a good performance, you don't want this. If you are looking for a good soft lesbian movie, you don't want this.
