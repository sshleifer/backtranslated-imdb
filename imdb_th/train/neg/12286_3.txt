The summary information from my cable TV guide makes it sound more interesting than it actually is. "Slaughterhouse Rock" is the worst horror movie I've ever seen. The title that was previously directed by "Urban Legends: Final Cut" from its opening scene, I can say that it is really bad. I can not care less This film has a ridiculous performance, especially those who torture in his dreams, incredibly incredible in unreliable plans and the worst songs I have ever heard. Nsync occupies the air waves. The biggest problem of "Slaughterhouse Rock" is not funny at all. One movie will be boring and boring and not scary as this will try to make things look better with a pair of clowns here and there, but not we have Tormented Guy's selfish friends trying to be funny. But it turns out to be annoying instead (spoiler) and please tell me who in this crazy world is conscious and despicable enough to visit a creepy prison at night? No one! If you're going to create a horror movie, at least make it believable. This is anything.
