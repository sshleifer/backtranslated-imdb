Everything in this movie is not good. The story shows the effects. But it's funny, funny, funny !!! Scott Valentine and the military uniform that is over ten years old are terrible with a permanent effort on his fears. Special ops group leaders are hilarious! '' Terrorists '' scary and realistic, like '' Raptors ''. This is forged and terrible in everything you try to laugh. So go up to the bottom and you'll see a metal pole popping up at its head, the perfect end if you go into a bad movie. This is a mona lisa gold pot of bb-bad !!!
