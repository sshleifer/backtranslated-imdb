Thomas Clay has been mixed with the wrong type. That is a problem with young people today. They don't respect. <br /> Seriously, this movie should avoid all costs. The action of the film's main content is slow and quite steady and obsessed with ending drugs as if it were a director. There is no better place than this. We were introduced to the main character who is an outsider. We saw him at school and at home. Not suitable for himself. Feeling embarrassed in himself like many teenagers do. Robert falls in with a bad boy and begins to lack lessons and drugs, and before you know that he is a rapist The link between violence and violent acts. Clay seems to think that one crazy young man is doing evil by the war scenes on our TV. But he filmed the most disgusting scenes of simulated violence Is this guy real? <br /> <br /> If Clay doesn't see YouTube, maybe he is innocent and unaware of the brutal climax scene from his movie? Everyone wants to see the most terrifying scene from the end of this movie and I'm sure that it's what people stick to. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie is no point for action Violence against the film, not just clay But causing damage to young people who are involved in the prevention of war only But he still condemned himself as an offender For better reasons than his personal celebrity status. <br /> <br /> It's a shame for everyone involved.
