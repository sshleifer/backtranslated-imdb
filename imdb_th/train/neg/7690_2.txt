Anyone who gives this movie a good review must be involved in the creation. This movie is very painful. The performances are strong, general soundtrack that is ridiculous, the most polite and strange direction. The teacher is not really interesting The creativity behind this waste bin should be dispersed and spread to prevent intense violence. I am confident that some children in Africa may spend this money on this project. Hell, money will see more clear objectives that cause addiction. At least some people will be entertained by it. The only reason it didn't make me sick is fever. I will give this movie two stories.
