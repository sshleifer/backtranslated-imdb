I can't relate to this movie. It failed to attract me, either intellectually, emotionally or aesthetically. The conversation is very tight and not involved. I can't connect with, so it's interested about any character and I find it hard to find a lot of positive things to say about it. <br /> <br /> I have read to understand it like Correct one requirement To be familiar with some of the more obscure aspects of Catholic theology I will admit that as a non-God, I may not be familiar with the subtleties of Catholicism. But I have seen many films related to religious issues that have touched me because their themes are universal to the human condition. Do not rely on specific knowledge or beliefs.
