I shouldn't start this movie and stop watching after my 3/4 missed the ending. This movie is disappointing because it is much better. It has a good atmosphere, top performers and directors. But the subject line baaaaaad bad script I pay attention to Kenneth Branagh's southern accent. It's better than the plot. The plot is stupid - driven by characters that are shown in a form that is not true. No one behaves like this outside the Hollywood script.
