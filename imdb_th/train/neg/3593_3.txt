This is a German movie from 1974, which is about some women who came to the castle and, moreover, I can't tell your purpose or even the purpose of the movie. I can tell you that there are many women who have moonlight as a servant in this castle that stripped of the body color and Jaires to Bongos as if they were at Goth Kit-Kat Klub. this story Yes, there seems to be something about demons and vampires, and there are some women in things that women, etc. But the main focus is probably the baby painted, painted, gyrating into the basement. I rather like the eyes of one of the housekeepers / big devils that give respect to the prosecution and make her look even more ugly. Is that Wanda the Evil Lesbian (being charged on credit)? It doesn't matter if you are not too picky about the devil-worshiping lesbian movies. You may like this, otherwise it's boring and I can't finish it. I feel bored 3 of 10
