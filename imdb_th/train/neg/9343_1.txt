How do I begin to examine films that will be recognized as the worst movies of all time by the worst director of all time? Movies that can develop the following doctrine because it is a terrible story. <br /> <br /> How to criticize a movie seems to be pointless and part of a band wagon syndrome - try to beat without Worried about the backlash Because every human being on this planet is doing and people who like this movie for the shortcomings we refer to <br /> <br /> universal low quality movies don't say anything - 'sixteen years Of alcohol 'There is no competition for the title of the worst movie, so it must sink to get the title and hold it. But I believe that this movie will go a long way. IMDb does not allow enough words to mention the failure of the entire movie, and it is much easier to place the elements that 'Sixteen years of alcohol' is right. Unfortunately, these glorious moments are buried under the shadow of the film's vulgarity, a mission that is not worth finding. <br /> <br / > My impression? I thought I knew what I was doing. I was reminded to drink several cups of coffee before sitting down to see this. (Hopefully that suggestion will be a vodka cup) despite my low expectations, but the 'sixteen years of alcohol' can't entertain me even at the level, not only bad, but terribly bad. Disgusted as if Jobson tried to make this movie a poem. But turned out to be overkill and pushed the poem into our necks, making it not profound but funny .. and assuming Jobson tried to make a good movie sincerely? Even after watching promotional literature 'Sixteen years of alcohol' I have trouble believing Jobson's sincerity, pointless and frightening end with a smiling / chilling moment (all I'm sure has no intention), making this movie lively and elemental. Some things make me unable to close the DVD. It's terrible. No, it's enough. 'I can't believe that this was a violent moment in the movie' to prevent me from closing and nothing more. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie to watch along with the bad group - those who like it. Like a movie Show your own running comments. That will improve my experience significantly. Terrible that Mike Myers commented on his Scottish accent as it ran to change all this sludge into a joke. "Okay, brave men come through me with the joy of whiskey whiskey"
