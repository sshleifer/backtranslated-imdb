This is one of the most annoying and ridiculous movies I've ever seen. Every time it starts to look like it is getting better, the sepia light will follow again, followed by an idiot that is paranoid and suspicious. The main character is Maddox, a conspirator who is shocked to live in the mansion. It seems that there is no ruler or any responsibility. But never developed We never really understood the role of John Stanton, who was expected to influence Maddox for rebellion. At one point I thought "Ah! Maddox is just a nut and is doing all those communications from Stanton's psychotic patient who escapes! But of course it's not like that, and the whole movie becomes nonsense, from the point of view of Maddox and the audience. Ferris Bueller is where we want him.
