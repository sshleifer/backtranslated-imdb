This is an interesting little movie that scary the phrase "low price" for the name. Our physics teacher, who has about nine children, creates a strange serum that causes "molecular restructuring". Students are despondently killed by the coincidence of fake underwater sandwiches and flight learning materials. Sounds like the resurrection of classic B movies from the 50s, right? Nope! It is not an example of a high level of fun, which is the way WAY closes the mark. The glamorous breasts and buttocks show our desire for satisfaction, objecting to the horror that should be more than 99.44%. At first, the best entertainment from the bottom has been rescued from pale blood and student bodies Such brutal movies will make GURU THE MAD MONK (1970) a disaster. Eventually, the work of a genius who graduated with a master's degree in film production is "F" automatically. So rest easy!
