I know that there are other things besides what I am talking about and in fact I think it has some merits; For example, after the fact that we received a lot of negative comments from Jin from seeing the events of Sun in "House of the Rising Sun", we will see things of Jin and understand the life of He is more balanced. <br /> <br /> But there are elements in this story that make me feel deeply upset that I enjoy the whole story. Previously, in the scene where Jin appeared with blood on his hands and shirt, it implies that Son's father is rich in illegal and shady ways. I think maybe he is even the leader of the group. Gangsters work in Korea like most other countries in the world, so it's possible to have a reason. However, now we have learned that Son's father is the boss of the Korean automotive company and what Jin has done is to attack the official of his name. <br /> <br /> I may feel baffled by Only about this because I work in the automotive industry. But I would like to say that it is an intrusive and incredibly offensive to suggest that this happened in Korea; Large and serious companies like Hyundai or Kia (which must be a model for this legendary car company because they are the only company that actually exists in the real world). Operate in a way like a mafia instead of a craft company. Western general, it is unbelievable for me that the author will have good water to write something like that in the story and never have chaos in Korea. It feels like outside. "Buy American!" Propaganda, portraying foreign car companies as criminals, untrustworthy, the third set of the world.
