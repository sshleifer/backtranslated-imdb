The character is lamenting and predictable to everyone, whether it is pure white snow or all evil. The show is too boastful to be bad in an amusing and wonderful way. It's twice as frustrating if you are a Betty Davis fan because your character is not a fun type of Betty Davis. <br /> <br /> Overall, my wife and I didn't find this movie interesting, moving or fun.
