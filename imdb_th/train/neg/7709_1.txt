I've never watched this movie. <br /> <br /> It's trying to spoof a scifi movie / thriller of the 1950s and 1960s, but all that is successful is to make you really bad desire. /> <br /> It's very weak, implying that there must be some quality aspects that are higher than it. This movie doesn't have any aspects. <br /> <br /> Help yourself. It's too late for me. But ... don't watch.
