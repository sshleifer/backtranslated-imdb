If you can imagine that Mickey Mouse is a pimp in the streets of New York or John Wayne is a communist spy, you may believe that Pat Boone is a boy and a youth who committed a crime on his uncle's farm in Kentucky Mikey and you will enjoy this movie. Br >> This movie is so stupid that it is not a short love story in the mid-1950s and the problem is that Hollywood made a big deal about it. Pat Boone refused to kiss a woman not his wife on a screen before the audience knew that he would not kiss Shirley Jones, so you can not create expectations. Of their love It's like watching the West, where the cowboy doesn't have a gun. <br /> <br /> A pointless story. Even the title song sings enthusiastically. <br /> <br /> April Love is in the trash, the worst bargain, along with Ishtar and plan 9 from the outside world.
