If you go to watch this movie, you will regret the cinema, the director, the producer, the actor and the person who told you to watch it! Sarah Michelle Geller is embarrassing that you put the name and face the bad excuse of this movie. It might be scary if Japanese actors speak in Japanese instead of trying to 'show' in English. I want to shout when the movie ends ... The real disappointment after all TV commercials and commercials that promoted this money maker failed. Sarah Michel doesn't have to do anything to create this movie ... She just trained her frowned skills. Don't waste your time or money on this movie.
