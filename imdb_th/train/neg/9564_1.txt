Some people think that this is the worst movie they have ever seen and I understand where they came from. But I really saw worse. <br /> <br /> The movie that I remember (That's what I didn't block). That's worse. It's so bad that they're all painfully related to watching movies. The worse movie than the war game 2 is a movie that makes you want to gouge out your eyes or pierce sharp objects in your ears to protect yourself from being torn by another piece of horror. <br /> <br /> War game: The Dead Code is not bad, but it comes close. Yes, I'm a fan of the original. But no, I didn't expect miracles from this one. We see that the original version is not a great movie. At first, it was just the love of a teenage 80's full of passionate love. <br /> <br /> That's all I hope. For something bad But that may make me lack Is it too much to ask? It is impossible to do better than the original War game, even if it is a version that matches the video. Obviously it's too much to ask. Stay away from this movie At first it was not as good as "Oh yes, this is bad. But I enjoy it. Maybe the end may be traditional. "And then it's getting worse and more. At the end, trust me, you hope you won't watch this movie.
