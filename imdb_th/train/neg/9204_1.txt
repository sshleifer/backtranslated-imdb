I've watched this movie many times (And recently, reading books on movies is fundamental) and every time I see it, I just hit the four people. The fact that they do not adhere to the fact that Tom Hanks' character is rushing into his D & D (oops M&M) :) person ("Oh, he just plays as a character") outside. Gaming session That and the fact that after three months of therapy, we will destroy them and feed them! This type of person is a bad name for RPGs. <br /> <br /> In addition, the 'love ballad' is monotonous and the songs made by 'cat on a piano' and 'stop us if we are too annoying' almost enough That will your teeth on the edge!
