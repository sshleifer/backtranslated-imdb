In most cases, On Demand sends scary horror movies and offers only other horror movies that everyone has seen and already commented on. It may be like this or Invinicible (I like the movie Mark Wahlberg) which I haven't seen. And actually I'm in the mood to watch movies that don't happen often because I watch all the movies I own already Millions of times, and that's a lot of movies and I'm not interested in new movies and boys. This movie makes me sad. I will not put any spoilers. I will just tell you that there are only a handful of actors in this movie. I think the main woman, the deceased who killed everyone, looks very annoying. But reliable I will take you to find psycho bitch every day, so she is good for you even if it's weak. The blood is not good, only a few people kill or I might say "Wounding" is normal But you don't see much and there is no part of the body in the movie that will make the injury look more reliable. At the end of this movie, I asked my girlfriend to close it and as a band member, the 'recording' was not interesting as well, although what actually happened would happen when recording. I'm done if you want to see this.
