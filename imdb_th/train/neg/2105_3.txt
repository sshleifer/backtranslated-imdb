Bela Lugosi is an insane scientist who uses orchids to find a bride to steal the life essence of an old wife. The dwarves in this movie are hilarious !! A lot of mania includes many fillings and no plot that makes watching this movie a nightmare. I like that the pieces come together in the end, in the typical Hollywood style. The story has never been interesting and you feel helpless while you watch. <br /> <br /> Usually, I will score this low.
