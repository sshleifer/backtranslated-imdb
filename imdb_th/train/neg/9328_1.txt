I'm lucky! I reached the peak of the horrible 'horror' flick that flicked from Artisan Entertainment. One week before it reached the shelves of the video and let me tell you ... I don't laugh so hard in my life as I watch this cruel megabomb fly out of the tracks and steal the name. 'The worst killer comedy movie ever made' from the incredible Full Moon Full Moon Foolish Failure. KILLJOY (I'm sure many horror fans we were shot in DV and it Did not 'see' bad quality things for digital But the boys do it miserably fail in every area where it counts! <br /> <br /> The story (a little bit and the words that are boring) is as follows ... The executive (Ken Hebert, who wrote the script and co-produced with the director) had to suspect Tracy (Amanda Watson) and colleagues. His and Mark's work, Susan (Hank Fields and Chris Buck) follow the weekend getaway to a quiet (yawning) hut `12 miles' from the nearest town. On the way, they get bitchy / slutty hitchhiker (Melissa Bale) in the bar and end up at their destination at the campfire in the night about the clowns that kill the same forest area will actually happen when each one. Rude - yackin, a pot friend, disappearing one by one, with only one destroyed doll left behind to tell the story of their fate. <br /> <br /> The killer clown wasn't shown in the movie. Until near the end and it doesn't look like the devil that appears on the video box (In addition to obesity) generally takes one hour to walk in the forest, cut wood and sing lullabies. I could not say enough bad things about the actors, especially the two men and chick who waved cars that sent their interesting conversations with minimum enthusiasm or naked at the most inappropriate time. Does not really help that the script is complete and free of doubt, originality, intelligence, general links or jokes I can go for many days that this movie is useless, there are a number of errors that continue and are proficient in all production. But I would nod off by pointing out that the whole package was quite a riot in the boy - this - a little bad. <br /> <br /> Notice that this movie was released in America like SICK, the killer. Funny Series Cereals. Currently, the classification is under (original name) of GRIM WEEKEND. <br /> <br /> Score: 1 out of 10
