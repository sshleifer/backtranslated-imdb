This film is about a group of northern black gay men who eliminate women in the world to create a gay universe. <br /> <br /> I watched it with the intention of seeing how bad it was. Even so, I was shocked that it was bad. It looks like a movie that was created 50 years ago. The show, if any, would be terrible. Scenes and props are ridiculously funny, which makes any movie in the college look big. And that special effect is ridiculously easy. The jaw fell as others commented, but the jaw was very embarrassing. <br /> <br /> One must have severe poison. If I came from Denmark, I would be ashamed and embarrassed that my fellow countrymen made horrible bad movies.
