Jack Stranger (Matthew Lillard) arrives in the studio of the old collector, Vincent D'Onofrio, and tells his ambitious partner and expert in the poison Jamie (Valeria Golino) that he is. Jack's brother Jamie didn't buy his story, dominated Jack and tied him to the chair. When Max arrives, Jack offers $ 100,000 for each person to protect him in the negotiation of antiquities. "Spanish judge" with wealthy and dangerous collectors Max invites his best friend Piece (Mark Boone Junior), who comes with a defective girlfriend who believes she is from Mars to dress up the reserve team. However, Jack twice crossed the collector, and then he was interested in Jack Jamie and the piece. <br /> <br /> The low budget "Spanish Judges" is a movie with a screenplay that is reasonably beautiful. miraculous But when combined with a good actor like Vincent D'Onofrio, they can't record foolish stories. In addition, the scene should be funny, unfortunately not working and actually they are stupid and not funny. My score is three. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Tudo Por Dinheiro" ("All For For Money")
