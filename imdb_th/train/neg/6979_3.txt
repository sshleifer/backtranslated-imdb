I watched this movie too and it did very well. I found it to be heartbreaking and would not recommend this to a woman with small children .. The fear on the face of her mother when she saw her child was going to be right. Dominated by The train is truly heartbreaking. And the sad thing is - she dies inside. She eventually returns to the Appalachian mountains. All the money in the world she produced from making dolls didn't conceal the sadness she had. I remembered her desperate face as she pulled money out of her clothes to try to save her children. I was surprised that this movie happened in Detroit because when I watched it, I thought that people came to Cincinnati, Ohio. This is the path for the poor from the mountains.
