Teamo Supremo is a three-person boy with their leader, Captain Crandall, Rope Girl and Skate Lad. All have their own battles (buza! Chika! Woopa!) And dresses and moves. They worked for Governor Kevin and were recruited after thinking of being a hero and playing in that game. They live the same normal life and have family and school duties. But most of the actions are caused by fighting with the villains in the school. Every villain is unique and quite strange, like Mr. Vague and his people who never knew what their plans were. From the evil robots to the evil barons, the three must confront them and stop their wickedness, and often strange, plan to gain power, revenge, etc. <br /> <br /> The animation is quite good. And smooth, but the style seems easy on purpose The background has overlapping colors and the building looks into the future. The song is quite good and the performance is not bad too, although this style is not my favorite. <br /> <br /> The plan is ridiculous and ridiculous almost every time. But after all this is a cartoon and No one can blame them. However, this will not be the same as Fillmore! Or Pepper Ann
