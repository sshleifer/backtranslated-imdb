OK .... I only have 3 words - magic, magic and cheese! The only feature redeemed for this film is Dean Cain. In addition to that - it's CHEESEBALL SUPREME !!!! <br /> <br /> This film has a promise in the concept - the underground lab creates a dragon to breathe fire - Basically, we will meet "Jurassic Park" more "Reign of Fire" ..... There is a great possibility. But they didn't follow .... The special technique is good - even if you know that the dragon is CGI, but it doesn't look scary like CGI .... <br /> <br /> I won't blame. With Dean Cain (although he was one of the producers) but I blame Phillip Roth for more - director and writer It was his duty to create this movie .... and unfortunately he failed.
