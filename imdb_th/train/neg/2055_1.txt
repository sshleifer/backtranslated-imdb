There is no reason to waste time with this "movie". The manuscript says it all and still holds. Read a book or do research about the story and you will know that this remake is ridiculous. Eric Roberts is Perry Smith or not. His sister can work better! Used to go to Holcomb and Edgerton, Kansas, where the story takes place. Scenes and places do not look like Kansas The original is sensational from the filming location to the actual use of the participants, weapons and victims. A memorable performance by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake. The soundtrack by Quincy Jones and movie filming by Conrad Hall ... The original is available on DVD in wide-screen format now. Let this turkey die quickly
