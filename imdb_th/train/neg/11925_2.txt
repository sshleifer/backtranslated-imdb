This is a very strange movie ... I'm not really sure what there is about some people in London's low level. Find the dumb children in the forest that they believe are some kind of oracle and make them all in the way. themselves Change something about their lives that often ends in disaster. This film ended after about 90 minutes, causing me to feel quite upset, almost annoyed with the absurdity of almost all of it. I don't care about any characters - they don't have the chance to love themselves for the audience. <br /> <br /> What is the message? Am I dim? It's too weird What happened to runners? Why did Emilio shoot the child? ... It has no meaningless purpose. Who can help me understand the chaos of this movie?
