I hate the way Mrs. Perez portrayed Puerto Ricans! We are not all slums - and we speak Spanish - not Puerto Rican! I can't speak to people who don't have the education you meet. But our language is still our island, it is our pride. Puerto Rico is better in economics than any other Caribbean island! I'm glad we don't like Cuba, Dominican Republic or Haiti, free from America's influence? Free in real poverty, not the standard of poverty in the United States. We are not victims. We are humble, honest and resourceful. Our ancestors have the roots of Africa that are strong but not rooted. "Black" - I have nothing in common with 9 American blacks. <br /> <br /> Comparison between Pedro Albizu, Che Guevarra. And Martin L. King is no less than the sign. <br /> <br /> MLK is truly a great revolutionary hero - an honest man who saw one day when we were all free. <br /> <br /> Che Guevarra helped Castro build Cuba at present Why is a ship filled with Cubans risk their lives to come to America because Che create a better place for them? You have wonderful ideas, scary and bright. But you pay too much attention to politics We have many things to be proud of as people - do not bring shame to people by making us victims. I'm not a Nuyorican and that's probably why I can't share your opinion. I'm a Puerto Rican. I speak Spanish. I'm not a victim and I can achieve many goals in America. If there is a second part in the future - less politics, more history, more victories - there are many <br /> <br /> Damaris Maldonado
