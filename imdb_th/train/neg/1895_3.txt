MASTER of THE FLYING GUILLOTINE in 1975 is a great and interesting movie. This is not because the fight is specially inspired or because this movie has a reason. It is because this film is stupid and unbeatable until it is a classic camp - bad, but good fun. This movie is a blind star with a device resembling Frisbee Chain that cuts people's heads while He is throwing at his enemies expertly! Who is interested in whether physics is impossible or that this movie has stupid things like fighters with a 12-foot long paper arm or blind! It's just a ball that must be watched from beginning to end - and is one of my favorite "terrible" films that have been seen with friends. <br /> <br /> Because of this movie, I want to see. FATAL GUILLOTINE (1977) Unfortunately, it is not a sequel. But it is an amazing story - bringing many ideas from the original But not interested in making this film consistent or can be viewed Of course it's fun. But never approached MASTER of the FLYING GUILLOTINE with entertainment Like the original movie, there are strange flying equipment that cut the head, but it's very different - with a circular saw blade and almost as their own mind. In addition, there is no blind man. But turned out to be a group of baddies that were not really deep and the audience didn't understand what had happened in the English version that was dubbed because the plot was completely elusive. However, at the same time, some martial arts are very good. Although not the highest standard of the movie Bruce Lee or Sonny Chiba But the action is worth it, despite the laughing and confusing plans in general. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a movie that martial arts fans might like. It has many many flaws), but it is another story that others may turn off or laugh like crazy instead of enjoying the action because this movie is laughable. But the most important thing is that it has never been close to comedy or looks like a master of flying guillotine.
