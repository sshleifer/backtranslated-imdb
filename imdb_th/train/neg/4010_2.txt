When I watched the program for the first time, the first episode looked bright. Bill Compton introduced himself as a "mysterious" vampire. The stereotype and Sookie presented themselves as independent women. However, the show started to fall from here and the characters that were interesting again were fun like cardboard boxes. <br /> <br /> When the story continues, the main character loses the original character in episode 5, the eyebrows Bill's frown was so low that his face consisted of Sookie's forehead or actor rather than death than her vampire lover. All this tragic events are around you and you. But responding to the fun she lost Personally, I think they make the main characters sleep together too quickly in the performance. The way they pretend to each other is what makes me stick and can play a little easier. As soon as Suki lost, she walked around like a whole voice, just thinking about the libido of the bill and the size of his organs. Bill lost a bad attitude and he was foolish. His actions were not truly explained, unless he did it for Sookie. Why? Love with each other will not be separated if there is love. Until now, it seems that sex is the core of their relationship. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes. Vampires often have equal sex, but occur every five seconds. I see something that happens. up It's not surprising because HBO is trying to send soft porn as a good TV program. The bill emerged from the dirt and just went with Sookie without any reason. I laughed so hard that I almost showed myself. <br /> <br /> The story is just a stream of consciousness. The characters never have details about anything. All events that occur are often unexplained. The only thing that remains constant is sex. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say that I like is a secondary character. Tara and her drunk mother are more interesting than the main characters. The only reason I still watch the next program is to develop a secondary character. <br /> <br /> Remove the sex and the main character shown is worth more.
