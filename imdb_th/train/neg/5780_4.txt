I want to like this movie and watch it all the way, thinking it must be better. Don't understand me wrong, it's not the worst flick. But never lived with its potential The location is good, excellent actors. (I was pumped especially to witness David Naughton's return) and God loves you. You can tell everyone to try their best. It's getting shorter. "Brutal Massacre" should act as a reminder for filmmakers to know that only Christopher Guest can make a Christopher Guest movie and even if he makes it easy to see. But you may forget trying to do the same. Naughton and Brian O'Halloran are great and they should be seen more often ... They are the reason I get 4 stars from me if you're going to have "Spinal Tap "Horror. I wonder if you might want a guy who made" Spinal Tap "to help it ... Just think out loud.
