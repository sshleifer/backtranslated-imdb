The word "1st" in the name has an ominous meaning for the audience of this movie rather than the crime victim. At least they don't have to hang around and watch this unending movie. <br /> <br /> Episode 1 should refer to: Figure 1 of the script; The number one is used in each performance in the final movie. First amendment in post production; etcetera, etcetera <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't show too much, it's just everything about this movie, worse than the third rate from stupid scripts to wooden shows. And while suffering from this gravel movie together in 2 hours that you want to eliminate your misery at 160 minutes, it is obvious that it should be fixed for less than 2 hours. <Br /> <br /> Go to see details about the crippled script and the performance, with a little purpose, even at least equally terrifying in Lake Placid. Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda performances are made from a script that is very good. He also received enough improvements to make you laugh in the movie on Day 1, Die. One sorrowful one time wasted waiting to see what happened after the opening scene of the preparation. The suicide of a female lead actor <br /> <br /> One of the bad fixes For one of the main characters that I think (Never told) is DA. She just appeared in one scene during the conversation. Obviously, the scene in which she was introduced to the audience was dropped on the editorial floor. And no one knows that the characters that appear from there are unusual tricks of the movie. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time on this matter. My wife and i hope we will not But at least we make our own difference by commenting on places in movies such as the Mystery Science Theater "at the same time in Cleveland ..." !!!!
