I am a fan of Columbo, especially on a rainy Saturday, and it's fun to see Oskar Werner after Fahrenheit 451, but this time is very lacking. The plot and plot of the original story is clear and predictable in advance, even many years before modern detectives are shown today. But it was amusing to see crazy sofa styles and "modern" electronics, and of course, suburban humor forced fun in modern art for sale. High-tech houses are Jetson or Disney's Tometsland model and enjoy the writer's thinking that invented "gizmos in the way". <br /> <br /> If the sun goes out to play because it is much better than Colombo We have to thank the cable TV that these episodes are broadcasting.
