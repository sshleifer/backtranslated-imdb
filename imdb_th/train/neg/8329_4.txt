I asked about the importance of Queer Cinema because it seems to be a confrontation with homosexual behavior rather than violence than talking about homosexuality and violence. <br /> <br /> Three stories that are thousands. Together in a rather sloppy manner I found myself trying to solve the clutter in the first 15 minutes that alone didn't sit with me. A weak plot score over and over again is endless, as if we didn't get 10 first. <br /> <br /> There is a feeling of conversation filled with cushions throughout the story. Like shorter than Boy's Brief 45 minutes instead of full movie It has some erotic flair, male nudity and sex appeal. <br /> <br /> Part 1: The Boxer / Stalker storyline is the strongest person, pulling some Bob to follow Tim for four years now and he is now. Confront him or not? I feel as though their Pussycat game hasn't developed enough to make a conclusion. We need more information about them and the parking / locker scene with relentless Tim says. "What do you want?" <br /> <br /> Part 2: Danny wants his friend Tony to beat him while jacking off. Tony doesn't seem to care. But he was not interested to explore the meaning of his homo erotic hobbies - even after they made it in the nude This story has no major changes from all "I am a little boy slapping my friends for fun" is "I think I might be gay and hit him because I want to spread his ass and do him S / M style." Very important thing to <br /> <br /> Obviously, each of these stories can pass their scores in half time, part 3 with men and women slapping each other, increasing their thoughts. Moreover, it is not necessary and does not add anything to the movie. Yes, actors do well under the circumstances and the four leading actors are very sexy. However, makeup (Bruises and wounds) is a story that shows the ability of the school. Grammar <br /> <br /> There is not enough content to affect gay politics. This film does not have a statement of time being smelted and without participation or value for prudent investment. Its serious flaw is an unskilled method that makes it impossible to be serious.
