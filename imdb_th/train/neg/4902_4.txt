Almost in the same league as the Color Blossoms of Yonfan, Spider Lillies. Drive home where you can create a modern cinema without borders or cut paths. It's a Taiwanese movie, which in this era became a shocking novelty. But more than that delicacy, we can find very little in a memorable way here. <br /> <br /> You should know that Spider Lillies are clearly a lesbian story, but in all This side has nothing but plastic tricks to trick, seduce and seduce easily. In many ways, we have here repeatedly. Friends of Taiwan past released an eternal summer. From then on, it was gay that has been treated for shortcuts. Now we have the same thing as women. Zero Chou presents an unlikely story for your edification, a story that is likely to cause blackouts of no more than fifteen. year They manage the position of some art houses. But in the end, this result is the most unreasonable attack, just an interesting attack. <br /> <br /> Hong Kong's corner comes in the form of Isabella Leung (Bug Me Not, Isabella, Diary), here. Watching her most watched sports Although quite satisfying in her previous work, Isabella in Spider Lillies is unimaginable and lacking in most departments. Whether her heart is not there or the lesbian theater does not attract her feelings <br /> <br /> She is a tattoo artist in Taipei who is shy, reclusive and responsible for the younger brother. Mental problems Played by John Shane, who expressed appreciation for the film, which is a unique feature in the redemption of Isabella's character, named Takeko. Strange, but probably coming from Hong Kong. Soon they will approach the Jade Jade (Rainie Yang from the Meteor Garden that restored with love), the latter lived with her grandmother and had a whole list of grief due to being left behind by her parents and general life. Of course, the elements of Grandma are good and impressive. But otherwise, Jade, as a supporter, doesn't move like her partner Takako. <br /> <br /> Two women share a lot of past stories. Is a webcam girl, while Takeko preserves her father's legacy to live with the unique tattoo of Lily Lilly that adorns her arms. Jade also wants to receive this wonderful design which leads to Takeko explores the inner feelings of the problem through the events and relatively little discourse with the brave Jade. <br /> <br /> Well, if there is a little discourse, at least having sex. Cold memorable? In a word without them kissing and pretending to be a nasty thing near the end, but when the Eternal Summer reminds us recently, there is a gap in the past year between showing sexual content and causing ticket buyers to think. That they are going to see sexual content> <br /> Creating this kind of expectation is to seal Spider Lillies' fate with a weak story, showing Ho-hum and the total elemental loss. It takes you out of the theater with you what makes this flower color block Blossom think it looks great. At least we have a little breastfeeding of Teresa Cheung. Not Spider Lillies is not an AV masterpiece and should be affected by the play of the ordinary and shy GLB film festival. <br /> <br /> Surprising. For indie release, not fooling even music and movies Of inspiration That's just because it makes passing on Spider Lillies much easier. Believe you, avoid it and you won't miss out on the good stuff. <br /> <br /> Score: * *
