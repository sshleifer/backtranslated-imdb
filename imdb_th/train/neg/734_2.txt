This movie is crap with the capital "C." The opening scene shows promise, but the word "contract" is not long after the audience learns that the plot happened. <br /> <br /> And the Morty wood statue Which is quite creepy in the original movie, seems like a fool in this story Obviously it's just men in cheap plastic sets. (And by the way, who thinks "Morty" is one of the most terrifying names in the planet, it ranks there with "Jimmy" or "Fred" when it comes to horror or why Not just the name of the Henry-freakin'-Kissinger statue "Run it is Dr. Kissinger!" That is as scary as "Morty.) <br /> <br /> There is also a scene in which" Hero "hits the grave of his father. You might guess - "Two to Four" Someone may not risk. He is angry, beating his father's grave with a twig --- a branch of freakin, but worse than that when the character. Walk away from the real grave and mysterious bleeding brother Oh! <br /> <br /> There are also Native American people living with the grandparents of the main characters. But apparently nothing except Morty's maintenance. He is immortal. The creepy Morty legend reminds those who mock and fix Morty's arms when it is damaged during a childish prank, but for the respect and tenderness of Morty Morty. Fluffy, behind me? No, <br /> <br /> The movie will be dragged away and many people eventually die in a way that is consistent with the worst fear (in order). This movie is a real yawning. Don't rent it.
