Expected to be a combination of sci-fi and retro movies about Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, computer history, etc. I was disappointed with this film about the absurd imitation and the mix of real and fiction history. It gives the impression that the author (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) does not have a true understanding of mathematics, technology or history that is made up of movies. But work instead of their vague artistic impression This caused me a lot of pain because I was frustrated with the tendency of art to use scientific terminology and misguided ideas to the point of confusion, such as: Emmy Coer: "The wave of information is half-life", Ada: "I don't. Sure, the half-life is better than life. "<br /> <br /> This movie is worse than failing to create entertainment - it's wrong. The only redemption that I can imagine is that it may attract audiences to learn about things that are distorted. I think it is more feasible to promote the superstition of science and technology in every level of progression that is inseparable from magic.
