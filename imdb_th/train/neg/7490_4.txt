This movie is disappointing. It's not perfect and boring. While Alex Baldwin tries to show himself to be a perfect job and is just a prosecutor. (Not to mention the producer) This film has never been shown to prevent or try to challenge the audience. <br /> <br /> Of course, nobody wants to protect the Nazi view. But that's the focus of the Nuremberg route! Four hours just bashing with the Nazis .... c'mon! Done. <br /> <br /> I think Alex Baldwin should really be Kim Bassinger's husband. <br /> <br /> Immediately after the movie ends. This story is much better.
