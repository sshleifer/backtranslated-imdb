I do not want to believe that many special abilities are wasted in one movie! The gingerbread man begins with the right foot and manages to create great expectations for the end. But at one point, the movie became one of the worst stories I've ever wasted. How incredible is it that the charming Mallory Doss draws Kenneth Branagh's personality towards his nose. The focus of the film is not as interesting and flat as beer, which has been left in the sun for too long. A star that is capable of capturing movies Don't waste time here!
