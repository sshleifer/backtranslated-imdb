I didn't know anything about this movie before I was convinced to see by a friend who had heard that it was "An epic battle scene that doesn't stop from beginning to end" that doesn't get more from the truth. This is one of the most boring movies, badly written, directed like an amateur and frightening that I've encountered with bad luck. I will rank there with movies that I think are the worst movies of all time ... Battlefield Earth. Basically, there is no story. It's hard to believe that the creator of this movie thinks the shit of this drama will be. Must be taken seriously as if it were historical There are also the worst conversations I have ever heard ... like this little gem ... Men tell women that "You smell like the moon," the girl said. "How does the moon smell?" Oh God! you have to be kidding me! The scene in which men were attracted and received good feedback from the audience because it looked cheap and the FX sounds of men ripped off reminded me of those who made fart sounds with their mouths. If this is playing at the theater near you, avoid all costs. This movie was so bad that I had to make a real decision about 45 minutes without me having to sleep ... and I was horrible.
