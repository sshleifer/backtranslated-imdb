The "math" aspect for this is just a mechanism to try to set up this TV program, in addition to millions of police programs. The only thing that must be exchanged for this performance is Rob Morrow. Although his career has to be received. (Unreasonably) falling after Northern Exposure. If he registered to receive this role, <br /> <br /> The weakness of the "math" aspect of the show was wrapped in one episode, co-starred by Lou Diamond Phil. Lumileds (Which recently confirmed that this show is the last refuge for the victims) to capture refugees "Mathematicians" use some theories about So he gave a long explanation that if we see suspects in places A, B and C, then we can use "bubble theory" to calculate where he is. He did all this on the board or there might be a stick in the ground. (I don't remember) <br /> <br /> However, when you look at the finished product, he usually has three points and selects the point. In the middle and said "Okay, mathematically, this is where we often find refugees." At one point, another character pointed out that "Oh, that point happened to the cabin where men had lived." What is mathematics? It's not connected -f-k ** g ** point !!! This list reminds me of the mathematics I have worked with in a bank that has mathematical analysis that he can do to "support" scores that everyone has agreed through less complex analysis or basic common sense> <br / > It's just going to show - when you are a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I can't wait. They will stick to the NUMB3RS team on OSAMA ... They will use calculus. Call the airstrike in the middle of the mountain and attack Osama and not destroy the five children he used as a human shield ... because it's all about. Numbers <br /> <br /> The TV show that is completely ridiculous.
