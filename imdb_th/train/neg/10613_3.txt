Dancing can be something that can be viewed only about this movie - and even it is disappointing compared to other movies for me. <br /> <br /> For me, this is the worst movie type - One story that is considered as a work of art because it has many things like in movies. Yes, it is beautiful. But in the end, there was no depth and tension of the dance around which the film should surround itself. Tango was a hot tease. It had a brave drama.
