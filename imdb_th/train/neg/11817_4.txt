The average sci-fi movie is quite good. The plot is more or less clear from the start. Although the performance is fairly good But the writing is very lamenting with the ideas taken from many movies. <br /> <br /> Basic storyline: Scientists working on deep space research platforms help fighters from colliding with red dwarfs. They are orbiting On the machine, they found that there was a stasis pod which was accidentally mistaken at that time. After 2 or 3 minutes of men waking up, you know that he is crazy. Something that was released from the 3 crew of the research ship ... <br /> <br /> After that, it became a movie related to the psychotic madman that made innocent victims innocent by fear. Overall, I think Speed ​​2 is a better survey. Which I don't think will be a good movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie, so let the aliens go out again. <br /> <br />
