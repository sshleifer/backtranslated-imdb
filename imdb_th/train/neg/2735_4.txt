I think it's not the best episode I've seen every time. (Although my viewing partner sent me a tissue to wait for the moment Brendan Fraser ... * sigh *) It is good to see Cox besides "Coxism State" brittle Some incessantly, he was in this period, if only for a moment I also enjoy trying to arrange various episodes according to the length of the character's hair. (Or high in the case of JD) and youthfulness of the first part I can still see that Zach is good for the journey of Chevy Chase or Matthew Perry. Chemical slide induces prat-fall (accepted in Conan already). Note the minor side of the song. (Now stuck in my head) from editing the dance caused by the janitor is "Diner" by Martin Sexton
