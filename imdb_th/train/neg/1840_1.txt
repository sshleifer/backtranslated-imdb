This must be the most merciless "joke" I have ever seen in my life. Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Christopher Walken are crazy homeless people. I can't make me laugh. There is something wrong with this picture. This is the only movie I feel like going out for a walk. I use a free pass and still feel like I need a refund. I can say that the only movie I have ever seen worse than this movie is HOUSE OF THE DEAD. Only worse, the movie. I laughed a bit in a cheerful scene, and that took 2 hours. Should make you laugh more than once? I don't know. I guess the filmmakers think "self-conscious" is a funny word or something like that. And another interesting joke is to hit the dead horse - literally
