There is something else you can say about this movie, except that it's scary. Tina, Louise and Adam West are the reasons why they have to watch this, but that is their ability. In this garbage I think they use Some of Adam's scenes were like when he ran because you couldn't see his face. If Adam embarrassed to be in the Zombie Nightmare, just think how he felt about the appearance of this story ??? If it was before or after, I'm not sure. However, Zombie Nightmare is a classic game (check the first and last version of Mystery Science Theater 3000) compared to this. The gang is very annoying. Of course, the actors tore off The Wild One, starring Marlon Brando. Of course, Tina looks amazing. I hope you and Adam will receive a good salary !! Past!
