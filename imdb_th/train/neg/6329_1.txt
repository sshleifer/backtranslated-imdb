I saw the evil of this movie in the dollar theater with friends in 1979 (back when selling tickets for $ 1). This is the only movie I ever walked out. (With my friend, while the stupidity that was sketched "Laser Bra 2000" appeared on the screen). Obviously my reaction to my friend and this movie is common. Not that I found the offensive movie (Whether at the age of 18 years or now) This is the real reason that NBC refused to broadcast instead of failing to understand Mike's "vision" (unless of course his vision was to push the movie sponsors into bankruptcy). <br /> <br /> I'm still surprised to this day that this movie doesn't seem to be producing the "10 Worst Movies of All Time". You have been warned
