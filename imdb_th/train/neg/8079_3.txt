Another movie with interesting evidence and some amazing special effects that fall into the trash. <br /> <br /> Boring direction and performance (except the lovely Annabel Schofield which is more lovely Brown and should be deserved Better material and the most serious Charlton Heston) has been rated with a really bad smell. <br /> <br /> It's great to see Heston doing the normal work and acting. That this movie is just bad He also plays in a sub plot that makes me interested just to see how it's linked to the main movie line. The way they ended up editing was that they didn't. It's just the end. <br /> <br /> Really don't waste time on this.
