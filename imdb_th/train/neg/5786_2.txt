When you look at this and hear all the languages ​​here, it's wonderful to be rated "PG", but that is the 1970 ranking system. For Peter Falk, the name of the Lord was blown out six times in ten minutes. First in this movie! But there are few people who think that it is disgusting and not a scam that makes movies or people who "rate". <br /> <br /> The actors are clues as to how this film is insulting: Falk, Peter Boyle, Allen Garfield, Warren Oates, Gena Rowlands and Paul Sorvino are not the actors you won't find in "The Sound Of Music". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I like movies, robberies and film directors. lots of William Friedkin But this script does not send and it has a feeling "Sleazy '70s" too much visible and heard For those who like Falk on the TV "Columbo", it must be shocking to hear that he uses the same rudeness as in movies. This is far from a single case.
