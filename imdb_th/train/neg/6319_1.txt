This film reminds me of how students use the methods of fighting against the Vietnam War. As if hearing that some children were doing without cheeseburgers in the Cow Dung Collehe, the president would have to change all US foreign policies immediately. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that while the policy concept is dangerous Depending on whether the Soviet Union and the United States entered the war, it could mean the end of the working world. The United States and the Soviet Union have never fought. <br /> <br /> If we have only ordinary weapons, the concept of war, another "win" war in Europe and Asia, can not be imagined. <br /> <br /> Not That I think they should get rid of this movie Film students should look at it as a wonderful example of "How not to make a movie" <br /> <br /> It should be 0 stars or maybe a black hole ...
