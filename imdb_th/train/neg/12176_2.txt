Trancers were originally not meant to be great movies, but in any way, they had a large vulnerability and had very little internal logic. However, it is fun to do better than most B-low movies and may be surprisingly witty. Unfortunately, Trancers II is not these things. <br /> <br /> Trancers II experienced many of the same problems in the flop sequels. The story is thin enough to look through and the writing is not interesting. It seems that the people behind the film felt that bringing the familiar face of the first movie back was enough and didn't care about other things. Even B-level actors like Tim Thomerson and Jeffery Combs were able to drag this movie out of the mud. <br /> <br /> A brief overview: Jack Deth (Thomerson) is a cop from the future that is sent to Year 1985 to help the ancestors of the members of his government. Trancers II occurred six years after the events of the first Trancers. Jack Deth married Lena (Helen Hunt), a woman he met in the first film and the couple lived with Hap Ashby. Sent into good to protect Found that Whistler's brother (The bad guy from the first movie) travels back in time to create a transformation army. People become unconscious killing zombies to kill Ashby. The mission that caused Jack to confuse is the fact that his first wife, who died long before Jack traveled to the past, was sent back to stop Whistler's brother and now Jack. Find yourself working with you. <br /> <br /> Two real problems of this movie. One is how to create Trancers in this movie, completely different from the methods used in the first movie. The thing that makes it annoying is in the rather poor example of Soviet Revisionism. They act like tricks. <br /> <br /> Another thing that makes me annoyed is the love triangle between Deth, Lena and Alice Stil. Vail (Jack's first wife) received very little screen time. This makes me annoyed, especially because it's more interesting than the real plot of the movie. It feels like it's just something that has been thrown into the movie. Alice's character, in particular, doesn't seem to be very interested in the fact that she has reunited with her husband just to find that he is remarried, causing her to be either shallow or terrible. <br /> < br /> The only reason I can think of For watching this movie is if you are interested in watching all the Trancer series (currently there are six movies). Otherwise, even if you are a big fan of traditional dancers, stay away from the sequel.
