Before technical reviews The script is very slow. It is a real 25 minute story that is blown up 1 hour and 40 minutes. The conversation is truly smooth and one dimension. From the stupid board in the "all issues" section of the story, namely "The war is not good" (Oh, it's shocking!) Not really. Without leaving the scene "Let it be shocked and get a great release." The scene where no one will talk about this movie. It's terrible. Actually, it makes me annoyed to think how the money used to make this thing better. Believe me that I've seen the movie "The Emperor's New Clothes" But one thing I can say for them is that at least they can shoot well and do well while the camera shakes in these two scenes. Read all other reviews - Avoid all costs and don't talk about it.
