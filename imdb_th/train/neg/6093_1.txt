This must be the worst movie I've ever seen. I bought a DVD and it didn't work well. The DVD works well. It's just not a movie. In fact, it's so bad that I think it's not an actor who has worked since. (Or before judging from the show) no real plot to speak of and no real horror The production value is rubbish, even the cheap movies that have some outside scenes are difficult to hear because of the wind blowing through the microphone. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's very bad that the movie that the audience thought was Will become porn if they don't know anything better (Which is an improvement) There are only two lines in the comedy film, both of which revolve around homo prostitutes. (Although they rarely make merit, see all 76 minutes) <br /> <br /> For the DVD market, I feel cheating thoroughly. I mean, reading on the back that I expect it to be bad: <br /> <br /> He chose his weapon. He chose his victim. He picked up his nose. He became a GIRL! <br /> <br /> But I think it might be funny. In addition, in the case of claiming that it has digital expertise, I like to see it before printing so it is a small grain that you can use as sandpaper. This case also says that it is a disgusting movie that is absolutely disgusting in the production. The show <br /> <br /> The film came out there. Welcome in the first five minutes. (If you are considering buying, I will say that buying `bad taste 'instead is a much better movie and a joke, and it has Peter Jackson, the director of LOTR in that) <br /> <br /> By chance, if anyone knows anything about the actor (or the director Patrick J. Mathews) and what they have done since then, please post here because I like to know that there is a movie. Worse or if anyone in this movie is interested Marine learn to do.
