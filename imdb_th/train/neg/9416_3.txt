Steve McQueen certainly has many loyal fans. Of course, he is a charming friend who is one of the most charming movie screens ever known. But McQueen was unable to record the turkey of the film, filmed with a brownie camera in a real location in St. Louis. <br /> <br /> McQueen is a new boy without a criminal record. Of the banks robbed by one of the other gangs, there is a broad hint that a gay relationship occurred between Steve and David Clarke. He doesn't like the members robbing others because most of them don't have a personal history. <br /> <br /> Steve also has a female friend in Molly McCarthy and she suspects something is moving by. Especially when he began to hang with Crahan Denton and James Dukas as well as Clarke. That will definitely make me wonder. <br /> <br /> The great people of St. Louis robbed the bank. There were two directors, Charles Guggenheim and John Stix. Guggenheim made a lot of documentaries and stacks. Much One of the two gangsters decided that Steve's performance was the best by imitating Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> This movie could go down as bad as Steve McQueen did. Bet that Dick Powell and Four Star Productions had signed him for Wanted Dead or Alive because I couldn't believe they would have if they saw this thing. <br /> <br /> Or they will. Saw something People will overlook, except for the dress for this turkey.
