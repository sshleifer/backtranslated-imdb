I see that there are a few people who are involved in this destruction. Write reviews to share their stories and I think what they write is useful in understanding. The fact that they generally excuse - rewriting, limiting budget, production patterns, etc. - just underlines how bad this movie is. And my criticism of panning it is not personally directed But it is only a warning that this does not make the cut. <br /> <br /> It can be viewed. But hardly so There are channels that have plot in every corner, ridiculous dialogue and the ending that sends a telegram one mile away. The humbling interesting feature of the hologram that interacts with the Recon team drowned in a stupid dialogue, as if anyone was cooking among things that should be confronted with an unknown enemy. Will medicine help us overtake Hamburger Helper Sally between us with automatic carpet sweepers? Obviously, this elite team has installed the latest gizmos and surprisingly red plastic armor, unable to access the MREs. When they enter the final room, they treat the place as a four-star hotel rather than a serious confrontation zone. <br /> <br /> The reason for facing the fear of Rook is that it cannot be killed alone. But there is only one scene in the past. The hero who made this case was abandoned. Silvestri was to do that, huh? Vivian Woo is an attractive person and sends the best characters in the movie. But that didn't say much
