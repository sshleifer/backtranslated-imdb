I always try to create a reasonably debated movie review. But I can't believe that this thing has passed the script. Scary conversations, performances, dodging sounds, terrifying accents and the direction and pacing are the best Joseph Fine is as cute as he used to be, probably killing his career as soon as it starts. <br /> <br /> Doctor Morro is no worse than this garbage.
