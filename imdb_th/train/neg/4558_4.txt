Honestly, I am disappointed in the "expiration date" wise name and location of interest. But i don't think it will deliver what is it about? The desire of the main character to connect with his original roots? Or it is possible that he wants to overcome his fear of death But he was not classified as a person who lives with fear - it seems that his life will improve But due to the doomsday approaching, he should start worrying I didn't buy it At the same time, the characters that support the movie seem to have no need to blend in with the stories covered. All of them are doing things running parallel to the main characters. In addition, what is considered a "curse" seems to be a coincidence. Who cursed the family? why? When? Finally, why didn't he just plan to stay in his apartment all day on his birthday? These are my reviews. But I like the pictures of Seattle's beautiful movies. The performance is good when it's not outstanding.
