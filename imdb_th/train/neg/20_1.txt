This movie is terrible. At first I just read the synopsis, and it was okay. So I watched it. The performance was TERRIBLE. It's like an almost shy actor. Everything seems fake I feel bad with Edward Furlong. Terminal 2 is my favorite last few years .. I've seen at least 20 times .... <br /> <br /> Plot OT also shit too Writers may be deprived when they come to music. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, it's a good movie. The person you watch just to see how bad it is, so later you can tell others that you don't believe how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> I think everyone should See this So that we can better admire others
