This is not really a zombie movie if we define zombies when the dead go. Here, the protagonist, Armand Louque (played by Dean Jackker, an incredibly young boy), gets control of the way in which zombies are created, although in reality his method is to think of his mind and control. This is an interesting concept for movies and made by Fritz Lang in the series' Dr. Mabuse's movies, including 'Dr. Mabuse the Gambler' (1922) and 'Dr. Mabuse's covenant'. (1933) Here it is the second story of Seeing the love of his fiancee's past, Claire Duvall (played by Anne Heche looks the same as the bad hairstyle Dorothy Stone), which is really the main theme. <br /> <br /> This film has an amazing starting point. Interested while Louque was sent to a military survey to Cambodia to end the zombie cult from there. At some compounds (Which we got a great set of 30s and clothes). He announced his engagement to Claire and then five minutes later she gave his ring back to declare her love for Clifford Greyson (Robert Noland). The jokes that they talked inadvertently This will be a great movie for the 'Mystery Science Theater 3000'. If they don't roast it, <br /> <br /> It never shows that Louque learned the secrets of 'zombification', but he actually uses it To kill his enemies, build a large rifle army that carried soldiers and lifeguard We will not see this commitment until John Agar in 'The Brain From Planet Arous' (1957) <br /> <br /> Finally, Claire agrees to marry him if he will let Greyson live and Returning to America, Louque agreed, but actually made him become one of his hypnotic slaves. On their wedding night, he realized that Claire would start to love him only when he gave up his 'power' to get his love. He did that, causing the 'riots' of the name. All his slaves woke up and attacked his compound and killed him. Greyson embraced Claire and it seemed that we were at the end of the parable: "The gods will destroy them, the first to sin." > <br /> So true And then it's not that bad for a movie, even though there is a low IMD rating at the moment. To watch repeatedly (?), We can see the artwork in a well-formed script! Dean Jagger has not developed into a good actor and hardly remembered in his childhood - that is his hair, or do we remember him more for the bald old man role in 'White Christmas' (1954), 'X The Unknown' (1956) and 'King Creole' (1958). The story borrowed many basic themes from the Halperin brothers who improved the previous movie 'White Zombie' (1932) that Robert Frazier was unlucky ( Charles Beaumont) Use 'zombification' to win the love of Madge Bellamy (Madeline Parker). <br /> <br /> If you have to The real zombie movie (Which has hundreds!) I'll start with 'White Zombie' (1932), 'King of the Zombies' (1941), 'I Walked with a Zombie' (1943), 'Night of the Dead Dead' (1968 ), 'The Last Man on Earth' (1964) and two remakes in the modern era of classic movies, with 'Horror Express' (1972),' The Serpent and the Rainbow '(1988), '28 Days Later' (2002 ) And its sequels, as well as many others, talking a lot. <br /> <br /> This is not a zombie movie. Judging this movie in terms of its own, it is more semi-gothic. So it was ranked lower than the horror movie B that was charged by Universal in the late 30s and early 40s. So I'll give 5
