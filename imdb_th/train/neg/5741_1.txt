<br /> <br /> I'm a big fan / sci-fi, regardless of budget. But after watching countless horror movies late at night on cable and video, this story will be the worst in every movie. With a bloody effect (Something that looks like roasting in fake blood or tomato sauce that has been shown over and over again) and people running around screaming from left to right and back again It should be at the beginning of the convenience store and stop there and take 15 minutes but will be dragged out for a very long time. It is a very low budget. X5 Many scenes are way too long. The narrator sounded very skilled as a random person from junior high school was talking. This is the only movie that gave my rating lower than Manos, Red Zone Cuba, Benji and Godzilla vs. megalon. Even with a higher budget, it turned off the alarm 10 times. Avoid it as if you are a group of people who like to eat brains. The reason I have never seen this piece of zombie-Dung-Blues. The best thing of a movie that is doing badly, nasty, etc.. Infinitum -infinity / 10
