This is one of the worst movies I've seen recently. When a man said that he wanted him to have the magical power to be able to make himself happy, I thought that this movie would be in the fantasy kingdom under the age of 14 years. The time is closer to the biological function that is similar to gas transmission in public. From the first scene, every scene is debating how much they have sex. How long leg to get it when they get when having sex next to them. Moreover, the dialogue and acting were terrible and forced greatly, not feeling and they filled the content that lacked a lazy sex scene. This may be really funny because the concept is really interesting, but it's not good here. Please do not think that someone will be under 16 years of age if you have to go and see.
