When listening to and enjoying the description of Omen II of Harvey Bernhard, I was shocked to find that he was still in this garbage. It's like a terrible TV movie that you might have glimpse into during the day when you are flu and are too sick to get there. I think what Michael Lerner had to face with what I could explain was the high school actor Les Miserables. My mouth hung open in unbelief. And then my mouth was going up and down because I laughed a lot. Disastrous. I didn't know why I had to write at least ten lines. I made my point concisely.
