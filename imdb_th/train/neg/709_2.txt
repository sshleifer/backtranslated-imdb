This film is written, directed and behaved badly. Should be improved with better director and casting script The worst problem is acting. You have Jennifer Bells on the one hand that has been refined, professional and totally reliable, and on the other hand Ri'chard, a hypocrite Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine are just scary because the slave owns (and retains) the couple. Although both work well, actors (and directors) should not try to emphasize in any way - not consistent and unbelievable Much better to concentrate on good work in actual English. Handsome Why do the children of "African" merchants (therefore not wanting the society in the society of the De Coulter group) were actors with very pale skin while Marcel desires in society? As if the selection director was unable to read the script that they were selecting and choosing the right actor from a group of talented and diverse actors, it was strange! This may be a great movie and should be rebuilt. But with those who respect the content and can choose the right and skilled performer There are many good and fun actors to see Jennifer Bell, Daniel Sunjata and Gloria Reuben to do with the right actors, good chapters and the right direction.
