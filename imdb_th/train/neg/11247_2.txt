This movie is beyond expectations. Many viewers think this is "Amazing" will have to go into old school movies, making this movie a scene in the past. At first I thought that this movie had just shown something from the past, so I expect that the dream fades as the light on the characters that will pass. But it will continue Essentially, this is a movie that tries to blend the future with the past and the two don't blend well in this movie, even though there are special effects. You can see the blue screen that the actors work with. There are too many movies that do what this movie does, so there is no reason for critics to advertise this movie, saying that "It's the greatest movie ever made." It's just nonsense. It didn't help that the story would be very crappy. I do not understand why Hollywood agreed to create this movie and I do not understand how actors / actors in this movie are willing to perform in this movie. As if everyone had read the script and had forgotten to read, well typed ... "It must be done on the computer." I'm very upset about paying to see this. No matter what you do, don't waste time and money on this movie today or tomorrow.
