First of all, this movie is not bad. It's fun ... at least for me for all the wrong reasons. I've never seen the original, so I can't compare the two. <br /> <br /> This film reminds me of the Christopher Reef movie at Village of the Damned. Two movies have different plans. But there is a disgusting, creepy feeling and an unpleasant comedy that exists in both of them. <br /> <br /> Vickers should be a mystery / thriller / guy. Please don't be angry with women. I do not know that all heretics and sacrifices are a little. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage, his terrible identity, went to a quiet island called Summerisle when he received a letter in Calligraphy from his fiancé The person claiming that her daughter has been taken away by the islanders With anyone in the world of stupid truth. <br /> <br /> Everything seems strange when the big Amish Mormant woman who insults him and lied about Lost woman His fiancée does not help anyone seem to be hard to understand and tired all the time. Kage remained on the island when he learned that the girl who had disappeared was his daughter and that he was lucky to be tricked into this island as a sacrifice victim during the harvest festival of the island. <br /> <br /> in this movie Do not cook well Distorted performances of popular women? <br /> <br /> I found the movie to laugh all the time, especially when the cage broke some women and ran around in a bear costume. I think there are too many potholes in this movie. I found that the whole idea of ​​a woman who is angry with herself on the island without ignoring any gender, but the way it is shown in this movie is strange. While most women have injuries, spasms and anger, they are clearly a form of sexual discrimination. I will close the movie in disgust if the script is back. This movie is something to watch, maybe just once or twice. It is not a thriller that should be classified as just strange.
