'Mojo' is the story of the fifties in London, the world of rock stars, violence and forced homosexuality. 'Mojo' uses the 1950s photography technique that is often seen in films that emphasize differences Physical in our time But still showing the dialogue in a very exaggerated way I don't know if people really say this outside the movie. But there are no movies created in the present and in the present day, use language with style As if the arrogant discourse of the screenwriter in the 1950s acted as a shorthand in the past that seemed to be a truly distant country And therefore focused only on international matters than 'Mojo', with strong performances from Ian Hart and annoying stories from Aiden Gillan and Ivan Bremmer, who later continued to struggle to create a career post But feels like a time when new movies with structures that are difficult to understand in obsolete expressions Quite boring
