This movie is the line between satire and stupidity. While the bridge system without any rules may promote unity in marriage But it was not able to promote the winning bridge so the friction was not working for me But there are some items that I find fun, especially with the large bridge between Paul Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk near the end of the film. It has been treated like a boxing match, not just a stage for a competition held in a rectangular area like a boxing ring. But there is still a ruling between the contestants and radio broadcasts. Roscoe Karns gives an uninterrupted talk. At one point, he also stated that "one ... two ... three ... four ... four ..." as if the four-diamond auction was a fall event. And people are addicted to their radio for everything, which is a typical event for the championship boxing match The disguise is very good. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are only a few actors who show funny movies that are necessary for the innuendo. Paul Lucas does not have the ability to perform comedy and other people. Loretta Young, cute and Frank McHugh's usual cartoon, doesn't get a good line. Glenda Farrell has a cute cartoon character as a forgotten blonde girl at the beginning of the movie. But she disappeared after that It's a talent!
