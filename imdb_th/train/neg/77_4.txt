I saw the film debut at the weekend in Australia, expecting to have the best actors of Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush that Ned Kelly's clear story will debut in front of me. Unfortunately, despite Heath Ledger's outstanding performance in the lead role, the story is as thin as paper .... which did not inspire me to read "Our Sunshine". There are other positive points, especially support. From Edgerton especially confident the direction from Jordan (Confirming his ability to perform in the Buffalo military as well) and the production design that gives a real feeling Irish immigrants in the early 19th century had to see it. But I can't help but feel that there is another opportunity that doesn't tell the true story of an Australian hero (or he?) .... What I suspect is a concession for Hollywood and sell Images in the United States Oh, at least Jordan and the producers do not agree to lose the beard just to be universal ... <br /> <br /> Guess I'm going to be satisfied with myself with Peter Carey.
