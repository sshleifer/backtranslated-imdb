The disappointing movie <br /> <br /> The story builds on our protagonist, Chrissy, who is a 'young man' who is quite aggressive. But didn't do much. In fact, she made a small story to move the story with, so it was no surprise that I would see the focus of her relatives. Unfortunately, Chrissy looks like an interesting character. <br /> <br /> The story is predictable. So the question now is, when will we see Campions, Jacksons and Tamahori that have interesting stories and tell stories that will inspire instead of entertaining the audience for two hours? Disgusting
