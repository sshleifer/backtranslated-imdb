Even though it is an animated movie But it makes everyone at least 6 people bored. <br /> <br /> As an adult growing up in an area with wild horses and Native Americans, it feels like it's a combination of PCs. Fantasy movies created by people who have never lived in areas that they filmed too much. Talk to those who live on horseback, treat most of their animals, such as family members, regardless of the background. We deal with good and bad wild horses regardless of the background. I have to explain that this is a real life problem for us and filmmakers. Look at the kids who are surprised to see that the PC shows a world that is different from what they know. This dream is broken. Normal fare or DreamWorks of cute talking animals that are burning the screen is good from the perspective of the older audience. But if you live in an area that is similar to what appears, you may end up answering the question.
