This movie is disappointing. I am looking forward to watching a good movie. I am the type who started the movie and didn't close until the end. But I forced myself not to close. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn't close because I was a big Christian Slater fan and I wanted to see him perform. I can't really speak after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Thank you Christian Slater for putting humor. If you are not in this movie, I would be bored with my thoughts. <br /> <br /> I admit that Anthony Hopkins needs to show. By the time the film ended, I didn't get a synopsis. I'm both confused and annoyed.
