What is this shit? My little cousin chose this thing clearly for the DVD artwork and the title that was too much ... I decided to watch with her so that she would not get bored and I'm sure that was shocked at the poor quality. <br /> <br /> First of all, the performance is terrible. They look like amateur actors who read the queue cards. Sub-delivery and very specific formula The cut of the scene is terrible .. It seems that they take it out of the storyboard if there is a story. <br /> <br /> Secondly, jokes and stereotypes aren't traditional or play well at formulaic me Can not count the time that I can predict the next joke I received a chuckle from "subtle" sexual intelligence that blatantly The Cat, The Beaver Patch, Hung Wong? .. c'mon! Just .. away from this movie It's not cute. It's not funny. It's not a joke. It is just silly. It's like the movie of a PG child with unnecessary sexual innuendo, vulgarity and violence that will affect the MPAA ranking. <br /> <br /> "Do you want to ride my yacht?" <br /> <br /> "Is that what they call it now?" <br /> <br /> "You can ride what I do." <br /> <br /> "Oh my. Think I have blood on my bench! "<br /> <br /> Playing badly.
