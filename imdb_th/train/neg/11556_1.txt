Oh, those Italians! Suppose a movie about a nobleman with a strange amulet, a castle that sank in a gothic atmosphere and relatives who tried to stab the back to try to inherit that interest for everyone! If you have seen this type of movie, you see everyone (MST3K favorite "Screaming Skull" is suitable for mold as well) ... and "The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave" is a formula by-numbers and boring like hell. Even the sweetness of Erika Blanc was left here. <br /> <br /> Center / 10 <br /> <br />
