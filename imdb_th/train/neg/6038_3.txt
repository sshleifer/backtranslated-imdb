I do not expect anything except to be entertained for 90 minutes and that is what I am sure. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is definitely a camp, of course, some conversations are not perfect, of course, "special effects". It's a bit hokey. That is why I enjoy a lot of movies. It is the perfect size for this classic horror genre. <br /> <br /> The ability to start from where for the actors and teams and what better way to practice your skills? <br /> <br /> I'm waiting to see another movie from producer and director.
