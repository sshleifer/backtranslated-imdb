Enjoy great movies related to supernatural thoughts and deep thoughts of the spirit world. However, this film just closed, I went as far as production and its direction. There is nothing to say deeply about what this story has to say. All I can say is that it is a waste of time and a lot of effort to put it on the big screen. The actors are: Mark Addie, Thomas Garrett. His home country, England, and we saw him in the TV series "Standing Standing". Heath Ledger plays the true evil friend and we just watch him in "Brokeback Mountain", '05 has a great supporting role. Shannyn Sossaman (Mara Sinclair) The well is attracted to the priest of the church that is not recognized by any faith, do not waste time, you will be sorry!
