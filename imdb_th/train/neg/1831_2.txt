I always like comedy. I really enjoy them. But I don't get the point of "jealousy". I mean, it has boring content / topics and it's not really funny. <br /> <br /> Although the performance is generally good. But it is not enough for movies to receive at least interest Stiller and Black didn't show all of their talents in this movie. <br /> <br /> So if you're going to rent a comedy. Unless you are bored and I see that I am not the only one who has this opinion because even Jack Black is sorry (see Trivia)
