I feel all torn. There are people who want to refund the $ 4.95 that I spend at Blockbuster to rent a homemade mess. This is not music. It's completely time consuming and my evening. What I didn't get is the reason why this thing spread from the first ??? I've seen better movies coming out of the movie school and I've been to film schools so I can say it's true. The quality of this work looks terrible ... shot on the DV ??? Nuff said. Music is not a song. But it is just a play that sounds the same in all parts Want to see a good musical drama? Then don't rent this movie
