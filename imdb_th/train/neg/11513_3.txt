* There may be spoilers * <br /> <br /> I bend back to make justice for this movie. I know it's a Madonna star. I know it takes a whole week in the cinema. I know it has many bad reviews. I did not expect to receive a deep examination of culture and sexuality as we received from the original Italian. The benefit of the suspicion lasted ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Madonna plays Gorgon that is full of pride and flair that goes to rest with a henpecked husband and friends showing silly facial expressions. ) Adriano Giannini plays the first shipmate that Madonna's characters enjoyed in humiliation and treated the earth in every scene they were together. Why did you say this to him? Just because the plot must be used so that later, when both have been left on an abandoned Mediterranean island, the table will be opened and he will teach her a lesson. As unexplainable is the way they fall in love, even though nothing is the same and there are two-thirds of each other's attacks. <br /> <br /> "Swept Away" is a ridiculous, simple, superficial film from From the beginning to the end of Madonna, the performance is generally woody. There are many stupid scenes: Madonna sings and dances brutally according to Giannini's request. The fantasy scene with Madonna and the scene in which he slaps her and kicks her butt. Guy Ritchie performs his "stylish" editing which is ridiculous. here This movie has the worst dialogue I've ever heard in a major movie for many years. The ending is happy and unbelievable. It is basically "The Blue Lagoon" corresponding to "Overboard". Remove the nude pictures of the past and the feelings of the latter. <br /> <br /> Maybe the ego of Madonna is so big. She insists to prove herself as A talented actress, please give up Madge for our benefit and yours. This is not her worst movie. Such differences still belong to "Shanghai Surprise". She has not done anything more than that ...
