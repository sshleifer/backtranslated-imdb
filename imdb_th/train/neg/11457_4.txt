OK. I know the John Hughes movie in the 80s that wanted to be a flat screen, so the expectation of this movie is quite low. <br /> <br /> Still after sitting, this shit is important to me. Can 'not seem to get out of my head: <br /> <br /> I just sat in the 80s Rob Lowe movie that had no nudity and only sex advice in them. <br /> <br /> The performance is terrible. The characters are boring and flattened. The image of Oxford is insulting and the boating scene is not exciting, not boring and not accurate. <br /> <br /> If you don't have Ally Sheedy or Amanda , Rob Lowe) amulet has no reason to see this
