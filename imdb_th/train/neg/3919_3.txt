This movie is not as good as you think. The actors have a low level and the story is very funny. I respect the imagination But the Lord of the Rings is a fantasy ... Conan .. It's a fantasy ... This is just a normal story. HK-LOWPRICE-ENTERTAINMENT ... Why do they include this spatial language too? The only good thing is the movie and the work of the cutter.
