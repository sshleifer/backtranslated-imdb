After 30 seconds, you already know that there is no real budget for this cheap knock-off. The story is taken from great movies such as "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Hills have Eyes". I like that type of film, even if they play well (Wrong Turn, Timber Falls, Carver) <br /> <br /> But "Side Sho" is hard to see: Actors are not really good. The conversation is wonderful and the music is stupid and misplaced. You don't care what happens to the characters. The bad guy called not interesting and quite stereotypical. What about blood and blood? There is something even though it is quite cheap and that action is terrible. 2 points for blood and blood. But understood that it was not worth it even with the wound ...
