Many deaths occur in the forest. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure it out! But will it be the focus of a natural documentary? What is the passion of this gruesome death? Do we have to see an adult elephant torn in pieces with a hungry lion? Or cheetah, grab the antelope neck with no slow movement! I think this will be a natural film that is suitable for families! <br /> <br /> And why don't you have the courage to show terrible violence in the movie trailer? The filmmakers are afraid to lose money. <br /> <br /> Then, as a relief cartoon, we will see the beautiful birds of heaven, conducting ceremonial breeding to describe the most annoying and stupid people Can do It's great! As if the filmmakers believed that they would talk to first and second graders in school excursions! Wow! From the average to the heart's feelings. <br /> <br /> If there are future documentary filmmakers waiting to see the wings that read the movie reviews, why not pay attention to the origin? Spawn; shower; sleep; Clean each other society; Play; Showing other emotions besides fear and anger; Abnormal behavior such as oral oppression, migration; Problem solving skills; Culture (yes, many animals have things that humans call culture) ability to communicate; Parenting, healing ability, etc. In other words, stop using violence or diminishing beauty and why you are not so much rounded and focused on happiness and inspiration instead?
