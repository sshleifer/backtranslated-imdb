If I write a review about the movie, maybe it will stick to me ... but in general I expect that I will forget. I have seen this for only two weeks from now. Why pay attention Because again, I found myself watching movies with low ratings that were fun to watch. I didn't expect that I would be able to stay in the room while it was on. <br /> <br /> It's not good, but at least it can't stand ... it's not a funny joke. Which always makes me cringe It's a sweet fluffy ... and if you can't use it in the male locker room I agree with those who protect this film because it is sure to please its target audience and will not be boring for adults. <br /> <br /> There are a few good deals on the side split. Of course, it's stupid and a little entertaining. But at least not sucking (As many people say do) Maybe those people are afraid of their delicate side? <br /> <br /> I tend to rate the bell curve, so 4,5 or 6 is not a good score in my book. Giving 4 is reasonable and will support the ranking in At the time of this writing, scoring 1 or 10, as most people do, makes meaningless scores meaningless. I can't believe that people will feel either violently or otherwise about this memorable fluff. Did I miss something? <br /> <br /> However, it should be noted that Emma Roberts performs her duties as a Clairedycat. Relatively credible. Ariell Kebbel often writes the script. b * ch does not disappoint when her character makes her due. You may remember that Bruce Spence played Leonard, although his role would help. <br /> <br /> Of course, you might miss this story if you are an adult. But if there is a teenage girl in your life, rent this movie for you ... and be prepared to not hate it. (You may enjoy it)
