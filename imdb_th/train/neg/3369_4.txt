But deep I have faith Of course, with such talented actors as before ... De Bont and the company will not destroy the movie, which the original manuscript is an amazing and scary movie that understands the delicate art of delicate Well, where are you now? My fears are expressed ... movies that promise to go wrong Yes, the design of Eugenio Zannetti's production is jaw-dropping. And songwriter Jerry Goldsmith never made a mistake, but the script made the actors well in the test, asking them to send a haughty speech that was only spoken in the film. In the end, Lily Taylor is always the best, the only actor to escape with dignity ... and that is hardly But the crime of all crime shows our horror. We can no longer use our imagination to feel fear of unknown fears. No, we have a visual effect to show us what we are afraid of ... and you know what? As a miraculous knowledge, as if they ... the visual effects come out nonsensically. And Climax is a very scary thing ... but things have gone wrong for a long time before. <br /> <br /> Everything in The Haunting is gone. I am afraid that there will be no real excitement or creaking in the surprises of the old haunted house ... but lamenting the original review instead. <br /> <br />
