Tromaville High has become a moral loss due to the effects of waste from nearby nuclear facilities. <br /> <br /> The uncontrollable chaos is full of violence. Illogical and bad behavior Rather frightening, there is a clear purpose that is a mess of the film with the filmmakers cutting off the bridle, allowing the independent actors who are not trained to deal with it. Those who are intelligent in this matter The noble society is a person who has a job to paint creepy faces and strange sets. The German teacher who became a member through "kissing the poison" caused her face to fall on one side that made me feel the creepy, poisonous monster that sent an annoying cousin to the end. > Trash lovers in the movie will embrace you completely.
