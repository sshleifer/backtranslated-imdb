The script is poorly written and does not have satisfactory characters. For this is a joke, I forgot to laugh. It's about 2 arrogant friends who trick women into sleeping with them. (Without sex scenes) and another friend (Which is a semi-disgusting person) who sometimes is deceiving But most are considered good people Three friends separated and fell in love with the same woman (Amanda Peet). Anyway, do this without being really romantic The trio stopped being friends when they separated her for dating. She deceives them out of friendship because they deceive women - bad movies.
