There is an interesting conversation in this movie. Being a virtuous person, good enough, or you want more. <br /> <br /> A film that does not contain the guidance of God. Being a good person with morality is not enough. There is a first line in the movie. "You and I can see people who have good morals. But the couple knew he was going to hell. <br /> <br /> While I'm not a Christian The discussion about this throughout the film course is interesting. But not in the manner that the movie intended I left the movie with a strong sense of morality * good enough * The debate and discussion presented had a very hard bias until they crushed the weight of their own ignorance. Manicism can be a powerful thing, especially when deducing the mind of a fool and without education. While George Carlin's character in Dogma said: "Hook em while they were young." <br /> <br /> Basic evidence is also very interesting. Scriptural scholars from the 1890s are trying to publish books that say morality without God is valid as long as morality is meaningful. You just tell the child that don't steal? Or you told him not to steal because God told you not to? (Do not disturb bringing up to say that the child will not steal because of how good he will feel if it is a stolen marble?) <br /> <br /> Author Carlisle needs the advice of his school to Help sell books (To spread around the world) However, it requires unanimous consent and one of the scholars oppose it. In a very interesting discussion at the beginning of the film about morality for the benefit of morals and arguments of God In order to prove his point, he created a time machine. (Put in a movie to create a plot that I am satisfied with) and send Carlisle to 2002 to see where moral teaching without God will lead us. <br /> Clearly, he Had his opinions and changed according to what he saw and returned himself when he returned (Because he came back, that's not really a spoiler. This is the Bible. Movies after all) <br /> <br /> For this movie is a movie itself, it's quite slow and quite bad. What is not needed in this movie is that it produces two "bad guys" who want to think about who Carlisle is, even though he doesn't hurt anyone, do crime or whatever. There is nothing wrong with Carlisle's commentary film showing his views about "the world of sin" and coming back with a new perspective. <br /> <br /> There are also some points in The movie that confirms me that I'm happy, I'm not a Christian or at least someone who says "Is it God?" Third, near the end of the movie, rather bothering me .. first, when two "bad guys" at Carlisle corner before he jumped Carlisle to do * * that was nasty. Indeed * he disguised himself like his coming jump. Jesus and made it a "bad man" (also a Christian <br /> <br /> Secondly, after Carlisle came back, he found that there was a boy whom he scolded at the beginning of the movie, not stealing. (But did not mention God, the children collected marble and ran away) and told him this The time that the theft was wrong because God commanded Just as Carl refers to above, making children afraid that religion is the etiquette of my book. <br /> <br /> And the last part is the epilogue. Another shocking tactic Carlisle asked the inventor how far their future would go, and he said he didn't know .. The epilogue shows that he tried to twist the Bible in the distant future (beginning at 2100) and It failed .. 10 years ago and try again and by fading him to be like 2030 or more throughout the movie. Carlise said he felt the end of the world that is about to come because the world is full of sin and Lose The name of God .. The shocking tactics have been used for thousands of years. The church will also know. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I watched this movie. While I'm pretty sure that moral goodness is enough, now I know that it's true. Worth to see that you are not a Christian to confirm that you are not as happy as a fool in this movie.
