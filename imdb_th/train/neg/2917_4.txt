As it is often, impressive Asian movie trailers and explosions are included in boring stories, similar to Unleashed (which is great). Dog Bite Dog tells the story that humans were raised as fierce fierce dogs that follow words Order the boss The main character, a killer that has no emotional development that is paired with an unstable police officer, is often far from the hero and the typical villain we see In fact, at the end, you will lose track of whether you should be sympathetic. Who doesn't feel even a little emotion for both? ?? Whether the director's failure or the underlined message that he is trying to tell is up to you to decide. <br /> <br /> Although the beginning of the film is full of planning. And unpredictable Point out that it makes the story of survival and revenge become boring. The apparent suspicion at first disappeared due to inconsistent music scores that led to effective story telling. And finally, you feel that the detailed background information and introspection of the main character is not absolutely necessary. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the change of story from one point to another is Quite unusual compared to US movies So those who are not familiar with Asian movies and bored with Hollywood's predictions should try. <br /> <br /> The white balance looks like the whole movie. It is like looking at images taken from fluorescent lamps when it is set on tungsten. Maybe I am the only one But it makes my eyes tense. <br /> <br /> Is this movie still fun to play with you? An interesting collection makes me hope for a story that moves slowly until it is diverted to a low budget. Low speed chase scenes And when you think you will get an indie without a narrative ending in the tragedy of Shakespearean You know it's not the end. But it was a change to the editing of strange country music about peace and peace.> <br /> Throw a gruesome background for a moment of unexpected redemption. To the brutality and return in another way, the Asian obsession with body fluids and scary music scores that do not match the movie And you will get an average Asian thriller. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why every fight scene is overlaid with a roaring lion clip? I think they should be a symbol of a dog? In the end, we were warned about the real killer who still lurks among us ?? Tetanus <br /> <br /> 4/10
