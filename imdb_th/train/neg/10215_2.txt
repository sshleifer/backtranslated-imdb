A frightening and terrible pointless movie than Stranger Than Fiction. There is nothing new to say about anything. There are no characters beyond the most imaginative map and relying on a central concept that isn't original and not <br /> <br /> Will Ferrell completely lost what he expected to receive the answer to Jim Carey Truman Show and replace the routine His normal (Very funny if you reduce Talledega Nights) very well, nothing <br /> <br /> Emma Thompson is not annoying (As some reviews that I read here are talking about the Academy Award nomination, it is ridiculous) while Maggie Gyllenhaal works well, nothing but creating her character as a former student. The law that resigned from Harvard to be a baker because she liked to make people happy, please. Her love for Ferrell's 'character' is utterly ridiculous. <br /> < br>> Mark Forster's time in making jazz music using computer graphics is used to emphasize the content he doesn't do.> <br /> I can choose to watch The Prestige for the third time or see things. this I hope I choose for The Prestige
