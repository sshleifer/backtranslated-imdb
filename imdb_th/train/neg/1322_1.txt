.... Because if I were, I might think I was crucified! I still try to identify the story of this movie - and I am "kind" with even the story. As mentioned earlier, it is the wrong name of the DVD cover that Richard Dreyfuss is a star. And if he is truly "disappointed" as the back cover states that he is possible, it may be because he said yes to the destruction of this movie and cannot go out! This film seems to be focused on Jared Martin and his role in this film should be, in addition to the close-up pictures that are not as mysterious as the actual role of Gene Barry - or not. "Big" ... Anyone who has a bright idea to wear Barry jeans in the Humpty Dumps costume, which truly shows his pants pulled up to the chin. I can continue to say how scary the movie is from the conversation that does not match the "actor "'s mouth (think of being a clutch product) to an uncertain jump from one scene to another. Scenes ") so that there is no plot .... However, if you enter the early 70s and if you are in a cottage in Michigan without anything other than this movie and the box of children and cats Suggest to drink a bottle of wine before you do this strange movie because you will be grateful that you can't remember it the next day!
