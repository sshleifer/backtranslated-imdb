Holy Sh * t This is a terrible god. I sat in the cinema for an hour and ten minutes and I thought I would dig my eyes a lot in the Oedipus Rex mansion. Dear God. This film does not deserve more credit than anything done by a high school buffalo movie. Please save your money. This movie has nothing for you. Unless you enjoy slideshows and sleep in theaters You know, take something interesting. You will be the only one who has continued. F @ ck This slide show <br /> <br /> Be warned. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend watching this thing. <br /> <br /> Hello <br /> <br /> How are you? /> <br /> I'm fine <br /> <br /> Enjoy today? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This comment is one hundred times long. More fun than pretending to watch movies today. It's sad.
