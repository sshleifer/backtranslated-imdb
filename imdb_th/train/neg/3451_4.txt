Frank Sinatra is still far from an ideal actor for Westerners. He is an excellent actor from here for eternity and The Man with the Golden arm is proof. But he doesn't have the body of a Western hero. You specify that he is a city person. But he tried to work well in Johnny Concho. The fact that this movie was a failure at the box office was not his fault. I blame two factors: a) The story is too unusual, especially in the fact that Sinatra behaves like a villain rather than a hero throughout the story. In the form that people expect to have some form of release from it, this movie must be very good. B) Unbelievable story It is difficult to believe that the whole city will allow Sinatra. Do everything he wants, just because they are afraid of his brother In addition, when a man shows a special holster that opens to the side so he doesn't have to draw a gun, you wonder if it will make him invincible, why does every gunman accept it? I think this movie should not be withdrawn because any movie that has Sinatra should be worth watching and despite the shortcomings. But still fun
