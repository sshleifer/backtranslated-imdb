Actually, I can't understand why this movie has a good rate and why Bakshi thinks it is his best movie. I am a big fan of Bakshi's previous work - especially 'Heavy Traffic' and 'Wizards' but 'Wizards' (1977). Frankly, it's a good movie, the last thing he did. After that, he turned to the mainstream, starting from 'Lord of the Rings' that is brutal and bowed down with swords and magic spells. Frank Frazetta for 'Fire and Ice' <br /> <br /> What can I say? The story is ridiculous, animated with quality on TV - I insist that it's much worse than the '70s - and while' The Wizard 'has a true imagination, quirky art, beautiful background and an adult feeling. 'Fire and Ice' is designed for a 14 year old boy and has the intellectual influence of Robinson Crusoe on Mars. <br /> <br /> Yes, if you like Gor books, you may like this. Although in my view, this is just a mocking of the slide after 'The Wizard', which Bakshi never recovered (although he recently did something good on TV recently) <br /> <br /> 4.5 From 10
