Here are some of the most obvious problems of this movie: 1) Clich√©s has a lot of terrible "twists" everywhere. <br /> <br /> 2) The story goes on time, which Should be good if done well, but not <br /> <br /> 3) weak character That doesn't develop as much as it can be fully fixed or drastically changed without good reason. <br /> <br /> 4) big: scary acts Above and beyond almost everyone. <br /> <br /> Here are the best points from the movie: 1) The leader is very good. <br /> <br /> As I see There are only two people who will participate in this movie: a) Those who can sit at 90 minutes of rags just because the actors are interesting. <br /> <br /> b) People who always think about themselves I like the Hollywood ship wrecks that are full of ancient ideas. But if I can watch in Korean ... "There are many good Korean movies. Why waste time with garbage?
