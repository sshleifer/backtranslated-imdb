"Creepshow 2" is much bigger than copying a little pale color of the original, which has been designed with little purpose other than using cash in the name of the movie first. It also extends the flaws of the previous generation, which are often predictable and heavy. Is still the first time that there is enough excitement to make it a periodic lullaby causing uneven attempts But overall fun The sequel has a worthwhile time, so the transparency of the story becomes more clear. Once in a while, it delivers. But most of it is just there. <br /> <br /> The whole story revolves around the theme of revenge and sweets. India made of wood comes to life, revenge for the killer of the owner. Teen eating monsters in the water The hitchhiker returned from death to drive the car negligently. There is no inherent place in itself. But they lack full inspiration There is little surprise and no fear. This is an example of a textbook for creating movies without stimulation. It didn't help anything that this cheap movie had to suffer from the style of the director flat, even if speaking frankly. At the end, the second story came out the best, but not much. <br /> <br /> Most of the performances are ok, the best. George Kennedy, as the owner of a general store that is unlucky, has enough work to do, if not specially inspired. On the other hand, Dorothy Lamour is quite good as a driver with a guilt that shows To sympathize with her condition despite the predictable material However, most of the characters are quite thin. <br /> <br /> One thought that "Creepshow 2" would be better than the original director George Romero returning to the screenplay based on Stephen's story. King Tom Savini, artist, make-up effects, works pretty well Why is the movie falling? I guess Romero doesn't want to create a second movie. But was forced to do so for financial reasons It was a decade of horror, cloning, cloning and other things, so this is inevitable. I imagined that the man was writing a script hastily, raising his salary and running out. I guess he has to do what is necessary to get his project financially supported. We can't blame him. <br /> <br /> Score: * 1/2 (from ****) <br /> <br /> Published by New World Pictures
