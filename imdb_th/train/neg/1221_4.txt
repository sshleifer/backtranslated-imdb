I remember the day that Kim Basinger was nothing more than a cute face that adorned the movie with the general character of Blondie, interesting, romantic or young woman in danger. But everything changed when she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Is a great movie LA Confidential, and I think I'm not the only one who is surprised by her strong performance. However, soon after, her career did not follow the ideal path, so the dignity she received from the movie That made her Participation in a movie with a moderate reputation (such as People I Know or The Door in the Floor), but we never saw her again in the story of many characters. The movie while She Out Out did nothing. That will make you fall in that situation and not only your character will not be too tasty But also this film that is really crappy. The screenplay from this film cannot be hollow and basic. However, Basinger brings confidence to her character. The movie that will win a few points, this film is full of old ideas and general villains. The work of director Susan Montford is truly disastrous for many reasons. But mostly because the movie has never received a good rhythm and tone Nonsense. I do not recommend while you are not at all. This film focuses on boring sin.
