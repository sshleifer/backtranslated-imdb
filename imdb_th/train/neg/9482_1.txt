Don't waste time, even one person pays the rent of this ship! What does it do to me (I don't know why there are at least 10 lines ... I conclude the story is worthless. The story is weak. The ending ... Eh! I think the movie is the only thing that doesn't suck at all ... Well, maybe the sound is a little ok. One good thing is that if they can make this movie, even making money with it, there may be hope for a screenwriter with a REAL concept. I guess it's true of the actors ... If these people get real money, you can do that too!
