Poster that calls this "Pointless and pointless" Use the words that I will use in my subject. The only thing I added was "no emotion" for movies created by spouses in real life and with a large number of graphic sex scenes. This film managed to make the situation sweltering, which should not be overlooked. Bored during the sex scene and the audience may use Valium and do it as well. Also, please, women in the audience can see how to use too many tampons during the time. And any man that is activated by seeing Willem Dafoe pulling tampons out of the vagina to his wife. <br /> I think the key to this movie (if any) is the restaurant scene Explaining to Dafoe to close his eyes as to what "jambalaya is fragmented" (all the ingredients of the food are still separate from each other rather than simmering together). All the elements are there: the haunted house, the dead spouse's house, the eerie violin in the score, the strange caretaker who comes and goes as he pleases the car accident, dies and near death. Have secrets in the past Basically, the excitement every time you think of But nothing came together Everything is located there and never inserted into the story that is linked or even the artistic mood at the restaurant. Dafoe passes "decambstructed jambalaya". The prospective tenant of this mess will do well to let the thriller. Morale without structure, placed on the shelves of video stores.
