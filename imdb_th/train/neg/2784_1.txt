My husband and I are parents of a small autistic boy who lives in the same city as the author of this film. We were very upset that JCC brought this film to the Jewish film festival because of the way in which Frankie's mentally disabled character was broadcast. We went to watch this movie at a local theater. When it came out, we asked for a refund. We want to encourage screenwriters to donate some money to JCC's Achad project. Frankie - A mentally disabled person and may be an autistic teenager - part of a joke in Which he left something to see the nanny's breasts. <br /> <br /> There's nothing pointing to Frankie's character except to say that "Hey, being a mentally disabled person is a joke." Frankie's challenge is serious. The family like me is truly suffering. <br /> <br /> The script writer must explain himself. Do you know families with children with disabilities? Do you see families with children with disabilities every week at the JCC?
