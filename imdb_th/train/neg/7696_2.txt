Yes, stupidity! I just watched it until the end, and still had a bad taste in the mouth, too much "unnecessary addons" for too many stupid characters (I think they want to be relaxed like a cartoon But I just want to cry) ... everything is too much Embarrassed to destroy this sacred story from "Arabian Nights" like this innocent, innocent (Both in a bad way) and there are many mistakes that destroy magic. I don't think this will make five children for more than ten minutes. Cute princess But should be a blonde girl, causing the actor to not know how to perform the role The rest of the actors are worse ... Our "bad guys" are really bad, embarrassed that "good people" aren't better. Of course, the light in this darkness, of course, David Carradine, who went down under his level with this But at least keeping the actor's skills / "fighters" on top. I'm still sorry to see him in this But glad that I had something to watch in all the puzzles, so thank you David For him only I gave this 2 stars to failure ... I'll give more for him. But that will increase the final score for all movies The rest is terrible. I might like to rate. But there is no 1st grade lover here and I think it will be too much.
