This may be created for its hell. But it may be the worst movie I've seen for many years. The best thing about all DVDs is the case !!! I am surprised that people spend a lot of time to make things that are rubbish and still spend money on it. I'm glad I only rent. I think the big fans of this movie must be sadistic and gothic people who are interested in it without using CGI or other effects. For that, I hope Alex Chandon learns about light and SFX to make movies better The future is if he is still working. <br /> <br /> Note for buyers. This is very disappointing. Don't buy it !!!!!
