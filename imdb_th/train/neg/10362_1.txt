Disney? What happened? I hope this movie will be set in the 60s as well as this book. And I can handle cheap special techniques to save budget for more precise adjustments ..... I'm glad that some people may influence reading books ..... but Man With Red Eyes is used interchangeably can you? And what happened to the chaos of the volcano Where is it in the book? Peter Jackson! Help us !!!! A long time ago (1978) I heard that there is a European version of this movie. I hope I can id it. I can imagine that it may be closer to the true story than this bad modification. This movie must be X'd.
