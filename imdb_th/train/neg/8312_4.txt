Thumb concept is not a winner in the second round. ThumbTanic is not as good as Thumb Wars for many reasons. Initially, I think Oedekerk is less involved in the delivery of Titanic documents. Unlike Star Wars, the Titanic movie has not become a cultural legend and has much less references to reflect on the audience <br /> <br /> on ThumbTanic. The hole is full. One joke that seems not related to anything. For example, the hero's confidence that the heroine is not clean during the scene "Jumping out of the boat" - It's not funny. You just think about yourself. "Do I miss something in the original movie?" There are too many jokes that don't have these types of information (cf. arachnid). <br /> <br /> On the other hand, sending a picture of a smarmy boat designer means And a joke Still very funny, is sending a bloke in a movie that wants to be "fast" like a madman who wants everything * to "speed up" including sinking the ship and himself being the first to die. This type of joke has some meaning in the context of the Titanic and has a humorous sense of meaning to Thumbtanic. <br /> <br /> Thumb "media" faces and sounds are still fun. Props and props and CG animation are worth admiring. Overall, although ThumbTanic will prove to be quirky alone. But this movie also helps you feel funny and laugh until the end.
