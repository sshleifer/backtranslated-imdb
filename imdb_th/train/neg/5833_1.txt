Obviously, 3lbs is just an indulgent program for Stanley Tucci to be a deep doctor / emotional creator. He does not have a personality that is completely different from home and is not the same as the gray anatomy. Brain surgery is not interesting. This program should be set up in the leading center for Neurlogical cases - but nothing interesting or exciting happens! There is not even a feud called 'Feud' between him and his opponent to add anything to the show and not make those hallucinations In the cockpit saw a glimpse of the life of a social leader as a father - nap! Tired and pointless <br /> <br /> This performance is a pair of pants, with ample medical drama right now and nothing to make it special.
