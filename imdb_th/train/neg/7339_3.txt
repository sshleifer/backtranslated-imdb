Maya is a woman without any interest. She just dreamed of her life and wondered why she didn't feel happy This may be an interesting topic. That must be a good story, a good setting and a good conversation. It doesn't have these things This film is completely boring. There is only a long time and there is no peak. The only important point is Shahrukh Khan. But even though I'm a big fan of him But I couldn't bear with this movie Although he cannot leave this movie This movie isn't as bad as "Uncle Raj" and if you're a fan art or slow, you might like It's not funny, not interesting. It's not tempting. My advice: Do not watch
