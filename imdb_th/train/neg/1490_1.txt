First of all, Jenna Jameson is the best actor in this movie and she is scary. This film has a terrifying creativity in imagination and plays poorly. Teen couple that has sex too should be funny (no). He has a cool jock chick. The creepy local guy Double parent type Virgins chicks who have never miraculously died in these movies The conversation was terrifying and delivered the depth of the pool. Almost like you want everyone to die faster I have seen this movie recently. In any way, this matter is getting worse. Of course, the most fun thing here is Ghoul, trying to eat Jameson's implants, but hardly thinking of renting even this dog Avoid all costs.
