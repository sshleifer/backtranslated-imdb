When I thought I would finish the whole year without scoring the movie "Bomb", a friend brought this famous chaos to my house last night. I am afraid of the worst of knowing fame and it is the horror of God as I expected. This is a mess that the Mexicans dubbed in English and produced by K. Gordon Murray. It has terrible scenes and effects and has a terrifying Santa that doesn't work at the North Pole. But instead of coming from the clouds in space and those who do not have a small elf help him create his toys Children from almost every country that has The opening sequence at St. Nick's giggled as he noticed the screen showing that these kittens worked hard while singing a terrifying holiday in a variety of languages. Tense and without a story Obviously, this Santa Claus does not follow the laws of child labor. <br /> <br /> Finally, we have a disgusting and suitable pupil for the devil's red color that travels from hell to the world just for the naughty little boy Change Santa's Christmas Eve into a nightmare. Watching this movie is a frightening and distorted experience, and it must bind to scary little kids and make them close Santa Claus and holidays forever. Strangely, the name of Jesus Christ is often mentioned in this Christmas movie, which sometimes makes the observer in the context of strange things that happen. This makes my personal list as "The worst movie I've ever seen." But I'm sure there's nothing special.
