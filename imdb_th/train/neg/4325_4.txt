The second set in the holiday series is the funniest game like Clark Griswold, winning a trip for the whole family to Europe. <br /> <br /> The tasteless person under the humor that works well for the first time. Does not exist here The fault is with director Hackerling, who obviously doesn't have any director as good as Harold Ramis and an interesting script that has only a few lines that are appropriate to spread around. <br /> <br /> Show, do what they can. Chevy Chase injects life forms into litigation. But it was not enough and Eric Idle, who was very funny, completely lost in a small role as an unfortunate Englishman. Some hilarious moments may not get full play potential. All European descriptions are one dimension and are not funny at the international level. (Eg English is a polite SOOO) <br /> <br /> In addition to a few scenes One of the complete pain But if you are a Chevy Chase fan (like yourself), this movie will be watched. But not more than that
