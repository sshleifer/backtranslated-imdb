Let's start well This is one of the worst movies I've paid to watch. I will not comment on this matter. It is a great classic. But here feels like a TV drama Beginning with the show except Eric Bana is the quality of the drama. I'm always a big fan of Brad Pitt. But here all the actors in The Bold and The Beautiful shame him. Camera action doesn't help as well. How did it reflect his feelings when he thought it would take me back to Brook Forrester's lab! Peter O'Toole has a really bad plastic surgery or he wants one. He looks like Linda Evans rather than Linda Evans! And to end my opinion, Diane Kruger is a cute girl But she is sure that there is no Helen of Troy Peterson should choose Saffron Burrows for the role because Elizabeth Taylor should be the referee now.
