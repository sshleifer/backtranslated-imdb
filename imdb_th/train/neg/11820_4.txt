I saw this on DVD. (It is known as CORRUPT in this format) and revealing the truth about how Frank Harvey Keitel looks like Frank is very much like he played BAD LIEUTENANT in this movie. Not talking about this movie is an old Italian movie. How old is Theo? When the character plays a song that he does not put on a CD player, he pulls out a large plastic pancake, placed on a rotating stove where the mechanical arm touches what causes hearing. Do you see my point about this story as an old movie? The DVD case does not give a reason that this is a movie that was created 20 years ago. It is also a low-value movie, such as other Italian films that are disguised as American movies. With the exception of Keitel, the actor was excellent, although Johnny Rotten's performance was more than terrifying. The movie was fixed with the quality of the picture and sound that felt that I was watching a fourth generation pirate copy. (I do not know It's a dodgy DVD, or if it's a terrible movie) and the worst is Ennio Morricone's score. It's impossible to believe in people who make annoying songs that are annoying for CORRUPT. Making music for Clint Eastwood in the West <br /> <br /> All of this is a shame. Because CORRUPT has a moment, it doesn't mean the greatest mental thriller ever. But it gave attention and Keitel showed good performance as a policeman with violent behavior Unfortunately, the rest of the movie does not meet his high standards.
