The biggest mistake in my opinion is the effort to make the operation stable in the realities of the early 1980s (the fundamental difference between this flick and the more ironic and timeless magic Time) The past story is an attempt that failed to glorify the SAS commandos. Ideas such as when the commando shouted down. "All good people do, and all the bad guys can't do it so they can blast the ad lib (with the conscience) that the main character is not obscured by gas. The masked commando, though wearing the same clothes and carrying weapons from their arsenal, seems unlikely and makes it difficult to perform the movie seriously and it happens that it is more than fun. At the bathroom, the mirror signal ... <br /> <br /> I do not mind criticizing the movement of Pacifist as a shield for the wicked and arguing between those who love peace and those who are peaceful. This movie But the political opinion is quite weak and doesn't get the attention. This is a sad story that makes this film a fast-acting Judy Davies. She plays the main fanatic and seems to be doing extensive study. In this regard However, her performance is superior to other things, and I feel that this movie disappointed her.
