The movie about the fox (Erica Gavin) with her husband Mountie ... but she loves sex as well! In this film, she received many men on the bed, including her husband and brother! There is also a lesbian sequence (tame). <br /> <br /> This film puts Russ Meyer on the map and (I believe) the first movie to be rated X with a reputation. It's a hit song when it comes out. Unfortunately it was not a good date. <br /> <br /> It's straightforward and Erica Gavin is great. (No matter what happens to her) and it is very colorful ... but according to today's standards, it is very tame. I am surprised that NC-17 has been rated at this time - no hardcore sex. And have But women who have no upper part and no male nudity at all. In addition, it (sad) is pretty boring and the increase in politics at the end causes confusion. It is worth it to catch, even though it looks like something that is very shocking in 1968. The original I saw the cut version (which has R rating), but I heard only a few seconds here and disappear. <br /> <br Meyer's next movie "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls" has improved a lot and has a good date.
