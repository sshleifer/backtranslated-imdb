No one but no one can chew the scenery like Divine One, Ruth Elizabeth Davis and "Elizabeth and Essex" are good examples of why. Although she played this part But watching her when she focussed on Raliegh, who wrote the lyrics to the song that the woman waiting for her was about to play: at one point she made us understand that Elizabeth could rule and rule completely! Sometimes she is made by the sobriety of the script. When Elizabeth had to be weak, she was weak and weak. This has an additional impact from undermining her power: when she strikes and threatens to get rid of justice, it is difficult to take her seriously. <br /> <br /> Flynn sends charm. Came out to make us see that Into the heart of Elizabeth, but he cannot fully convey the complexity and evil of man In addition, it has not helped Essex get poor distribution. Why is this impatient person who wants to overthrow his queen - even when he swears to be loyal to her - except for just that he has more blue blood, so "more valuable" rules? And why Raliegh betrayed Elizabeth by intercepting her letters and Essex? He has no risk of falling in love, and we know where Essex (and his head) is. Why does he risk his own head by accelerating it? <br /> <br /> What does Curtiz do? With all the $$$ he received He didn't have to try to hide the fact that his fight scenes were shot on the sound stage. He should end this story with Elizabeth for the first time at The Tower; Everything that follows (Especially the last scene between her and Essex) is not necessary Great costume And is me or Bette looks like Susan Sarandon?
