This film tries to do many things together, including political satire, Hollywood movies, romantic comedy, comedy about family promotion ... The list continues. It's a pitiful failure. All of them But there is enough interest to prevent me from closing it until the end. <br /> <br /> Although I appreciate the spirit behind WAR, INC. Is a clumsy effort, especially when it is right. Used by the goal to reflect the lack of existence of serious criticism rather than just writing bad directions and producing this movie. <br /> <br /> There are criticisms that will be made about Privatize Whether you're an enterprise of war Reap But mocking it in this way will reduce the true cruelty of what has happened Reminded me of the three KINGS, which caused little concern in the same way
