Hello, <br /> <br /> This is my first post on IMDb, although I have used it as a reference for a while. I want to greet you all The fact that I am a Greek will inevitably affect my decisions. I hope I won't bother you. <br /> <br /> I spent 2 years in my life. Not a homer as you see everywhere) touched by touch If I remember well, it was Iliada (Iliad) in Grade 8 and Odysseia (Odyssey). In Troy's grade 9, Troy was a big disappointment for me and my Greek friends around the campus. (I studied in the UK) <br /> <br /> Iliad epos is one of the best literature ever. It was composed by Omirus Greek poet, 400 years after the actual war. Historians use the Trojan War around 1,200 BC and the real reason for the war is not the beauty of Helen. But is an important position of Troy That said, one might understand that Ompos epos does not present real events. (Because it is not right in the past) but this has never been the purpose of this work Love, anger, hatred, courage, discipline, loyalty and others. The best and best education is a long talk between warriors before the fight. Although there is no disclosure of these things in 'Troy', <br /> <br /> Warner Troy is very cheap for my eyes and for people with English, Finnish and German knowledge. My It's a shame to spend millions of dollars in a bad situation. By the way, the perfect storm is a bad and stupid blockbuster. (Computer graphics work all) but it's the best work of Wolfgang Petersen. <br /> <br /> I can conclude that you should look at something else instead. I'll give Troy 2 out of 10. It's a really expensive B movie. < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Alex
