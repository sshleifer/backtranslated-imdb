I have nothing new to add But I feel like I have to comment on this sack. So go here: <br /> Wicked <br /> I use my DVD MST3K collection again and I just watched Hobgoblins for the 10th time. It's really painful. But it's on the list ... You can see that there is a small kernel of the actual movie buried under all the crap that is "Hobgoblins", but it can't go out. Everything about this movie is the rate of 4 stories, performances, effects, women, "action scenes", ... ahhhh forget it. I can see shit like "The Bloodwaters of Dr. Z "(also known as" Zaat ") over and over again with no adverse effects (I like it in reality btw it will be in TCM later this month - October 2009) but" Hobgoblins "is a Baltimore game that <br /> <br /> The worst part of it may be that it is about 12 hours later. From the movie ends, I sleep well Coffee and dry toast, my medicine and dance music, "New Wave" that Amy, red shorts and Newman Laren, popular in the living room, still continue in my head. This torture will last for days. <br /> <br /> Good luck, right?
