Another piece made from TV garbage! This is an insult to the war movie. (I use the word movie in a loose style!) I think Telly Savalas's career has hit the bottom when he makes a loud noise in a video. Visit Birmingham, shown on Tarrant on the TV in half. On a regular basis, but then I forgot that he was involved with this! I try to push it into my subconscious memory. But cable TV brought the memory that kicked and screamed out of me !! <br /> <br /> I like a little. (Laughing sarcastic!) In the movie that claims to be a scene from Liverpool in the forties. But it was the image of the Zagreb Cathedral in the late eighties. In addition, the commando steam train also has training on the display of the JZ logo (Jugoslavia Zeleznice or Yugoslav train) on the side of the locomotive clearly, even though the manufacturer tried to make them dark. Why not just show movies in the UK if it's where most movies are screened? <br /> <br /> Cheap garbage and celluloid is broken!
