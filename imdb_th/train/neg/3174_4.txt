Jeff Lowell has written and directed 'Over Her Dead Body'. Not good. The first thought of all is old, like my jokes and executions are just cherry on the cake. <br /> <br /> Minus Eva Longoria Parker rarely. What is interesting in this movie? Eva looks great, as always, and gives satisfactory performance. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd looks boring and the least interested. Lake Bell is a complete monster She looks like a man and gives a strict average performance. Jason Biggs wasted. Lindsay Sloane too. <br /> <br /> I expect more entertainment from this movie. Sadly, I'm not entertained.
