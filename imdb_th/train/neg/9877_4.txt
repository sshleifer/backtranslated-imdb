Fantastic Mr. Fox is a comedy created by Roald Dahl, the classic West Anderson, directed and directed a short book with the same name to be shown on a large screen with full screen While I respect what Anderson is an incredibly talented person, this movie seems to be lost in his own wise spirit. Anderson seems to leave the story behind, knowing that he is a talented person and if this happens to be a bad movie, it will be his first bad movie. Just like you went to school and had a terrible day. Today is Anderson's first bad day in making movies, so I'll let him go easily.

I'm sure West Anderson will come back with another amazing movie, and that he decides to create another movie. But for now I'm sorry, West Anderson, this movie of you
