I saw this feature as part of the Asian American Film Festival in New York and felt frightened by the child pornography I saw. The story line is hidden under the graphic sex scene too - and no one is in the slightest erotic - the sick is more feeling. The director seems to be more shocking than exploring the various levels of why these characters are like this. See if you can stomach it - I still have events.
