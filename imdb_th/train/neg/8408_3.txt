Wow, this is very strange in a single story: usually the first movie in the long sequel is the best in the group. People are surprised when the sequel is really better with Tarzan. I think this movie is the worst in the group, or at least the first six stories which include my Tarzan DVD collection package. I am happy to see the region many times. But I passed through this turkey. Thank you to many characters. <br /> <br /> Okay, let's start with the good news: <br /> <br /> THE GOOD - There are many actions that There are many wild animals shown even though they are just stock videos. You see the attacks of lions, crocodiles, hippos, panthers. You name it and you will see many different tribes including pygmies (called "dwarves" in the movie). Since this movie was created almost 75 years ago. I can't knock any truth because they don't have a movie in a long time ago. They do the best they can so that you can confront the actors who speak in front of the fake backgrounds. However, Weissmuller makes many action scenes and is in good condition. He and O'Sullivan created a handsome couple if they were in the Golden Theater last year. <br /> <br /> This film has historical value. (There are many ongoing scenes) showing that Tarzan received Jane and the beginning of learning English. <br /> <br /> The BAD - from the time when "Jane Parker" was led by Tarzan, almost every scene With her is Maureen O'Sullivan in the hysterics scene, screaming and screaming behind the scenes. It's enough to give you a headache and it destroys the film. Fortunately, she calmed down in the next scene. But not in this movie This film has not been supported by images. "The Great White Hunter" as C. Aubrey Smith plays the father of Jane and Neil Hamilton while "Harry Holt" guided safari takes every animal in sight, no matter how evil or not. These people killed, especially Smith, in another note, it's terrible too Nothing herein described. Tarzan came into the forest from the beginning. There is no history here or his image of growth. He was there when Jen and the group arrived at one point in Africa.
