This may not be the worst comedy ever. But close This film maker stole my life for one and a half hours and I wanted it back. <br /> <br /> Chris Kattan jokes about 10 minutes. His high pitches and crazy beatings are getting older. Realized that the rest of the movie was much worse He fell into a long line of former SNL-ers who had tried the movie. Some excellent people, some of them fail miserably. There is not much middle ground in this category. Although Chris Farley is great, it's okay. It's not funny and dead ... So I think he will find all the frequencies in one career. > Avoid this movie like Kan br /> <br /> c
