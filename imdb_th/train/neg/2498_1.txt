Forgive me for clear identification But some movies are good and some movies are not good. Of course, there are two types of extremes in the film, such as The Godfather, Saving Private Ryan and Star Wars. Comfortable in good categories. At the other end of the spectrum, there are those movies that are not properly mentioned by name. However, sometimes, some people actually create movies that are woeful. Movies that should be separated into examples that show how horrific movies are. The movie is even worse. The film is Maiden Voyage. <br /> <br /> In short, Maiden Voyage is a story about a luxury cruise ship hijacked by an evil criminal gang who wants to ransom from an evil ship owner. Of course, there are all American heroes on board, along with carved jaws and carved breasts that help save the day. <br /> <br /> This is a production that creates a new depth. Everything about it is not good. Showing the direction and plot that is called is very bad In short, it is an insult to the ingenuity of unfortunate viewers. Even the American audience will be frustrated by the flaws. <br /> <br /> Yeah, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> I'm going to resist the temptation to list things that make me angry. About this movie. However, the stupid conclusion should be a sufficient example of what I mean. <br /> <br /> Imagine your heart that you are an evil hijacker and you stand. On the open life boat in the pan In peace. You are a hero in a bomb tick the hero, throwing grenades at you and jump into the water. What are you going to do I do not know anything about you But I will throw the bomb as much as I can into the sea Not this man He watched while our hero swam in, he tried to disarm the bomb with unfortunate results (for him), saying enough. Death like this will be mentioned on the Darwin Awards website and may Is a summary that is suitable for the life of the production team
