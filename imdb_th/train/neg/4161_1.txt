Plot, stuttering, unattractive characters and sub-conversations (To say that at least) the disaster that produced this television program, which is almost uninteresting, even with a billion dollar production budget. <br /> <br /> Unbelievable characters. In motivation, action or profession that is acceptable The plot will read like a dungeon hack and a bad dragon. But with a plasma rifle and forced field There are serious continuity issues and pointless interaction levels between the characters. This author should at least win <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague. See the episode of Dark Angel and you will have Improved dialogue and plot display yuck
