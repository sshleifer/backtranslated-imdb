live! Yeah, but not kicking. <br /> <br /> True story: Recently, the Dutch television station announced that they will broadcast a new reality show. Quite a contest The main participants in this show will be women who are dying in some terrible things, and she will donate her kidneys to one lucky person with advanced kidney failure. <br /> <br /> Foreign countries and media have stories like flies and flies, saying it's scary, immoral, the world is about to come and dislike. In one way, I have to admit <br /> <br /> Last month, tensions have increased at a level that most governments have problems with whether they should let this program continue or not. Instead of running around the country, <br /> <br /> broadcast programs and up to the last moment they push forward And until the last moment that the armed nations, the Prime Minister, gave a speech to every newspaper written about this subject in every country that held their breath And the network pushing To a new border on television And they succeeded in doing so They pushed the envelope. <br /> <br /> The broadcast program and we all watched the last sick woman choose the right candidate to pick up her kidneys so that he or she would live while she died. After that, <br /> <br /> Then, at the last moment of the show, it was revealed that it was some deception. The woman was not sick. But there are all applicants No kidney auction All performances that are publicized and advertised and all the discussions created for the month to a great pinnacle are showing public relations capabilities that will focus attention on the critical shortage of organ donations. The man who founded this network died of kidney disease. <br /> <br /> Now this is television. Let everyone be behind by surprise. <br /> <br /> Don't let me act stupid and terrible about women trying to show Russian roulette on American TV. <br /> <br /> As if <br /> <br /> * spoiler * as if I would believe that they would get this through the FCC as if I would believe that this would be through the US Supreme Court based on expression independent As if I believed that the ridiculous end to which this woman pulled it out and had a conscience problem because some men shot themselves aired. <br /> <br /> It was done before watching Running Man and Arnold instead. A little, it has a good ending So she was shot in the end. That should make us feel better after we left the theater because of justice. Don't use my word But I will say this: leave this thing alone and see the test pattern instead, you will get more quality
