This is an attempt by both the author Edgar Rice Burroughs and the Arab filmmaker "Tarzan of the Apes" but this desert film does not show the greatness of Burroughs' wild adventures. The love between the British noble Jon Hall (as "El 'Lion" Chatham) and the exotic Arab beauty Kathleen Burke (as "Princess" Eulilah) with revenge arises with the desire to merge. The opening stated that despite being guilty of improper operation, the mother of a young boy still lives - but she never returned to the picture again. Unfortunately, "The Lion Man" deteriorates and seems like a lost image. <br /> <br /> The Lion Man (1936) John P. McCarthy ~ Jon Hall, Kathleen Burke, Ted Adams
