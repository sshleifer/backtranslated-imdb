The ending of this movie is a story that cannot be seen much and the date of the aesthetic in my movie laughs like crazy Now the rest of this movie is ok. There are a few unintended funny scenes. But with a good camera shot and editing. Alderich is a great director who makes FLIGHT Of The Phoenix and anything that happens to Baby Jane among others The problem is not with the direction of the show or anything technical. This movie has just been destroyed in the third scene. Why? Murders, twists, characters and characters revolve around NUCLEAR's material? What are the smoking writers heck when he comes up with that? The way it just came out of nowhere may be the largest Deus Ex Machina in history. For all complaints about Burton's Planet of the Apes, David Gale's life or the notorious I think this is the worst end ever. What disappointed
