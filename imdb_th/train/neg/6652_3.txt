This is a strange movie about low life in New York City and centered around the main characters. (A title played by Brad Pitt) who thought he was a musician, Ricky Nelson, except he had no talent. <br /> <br /> It was fun to watch until a woman with a disrespectful New York style. Snub with a terrifying accent into the picture and take over. It destroys the film. For me, it must be Catherine Keener, who usually plays as a woman with cleft lips and solid waste. <br /> <br /> The hairstyle at Pitt-Pompadour, which is exaggerated - looks great. I can imagine Johnny. Depp plays this role better. One recent record: It's strange to hear movies created in 1992 (other than Woody Allen) with mono sounds.
