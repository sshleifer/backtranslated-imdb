There is a high level of expectation when you sit down to watch a comedy featuring Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Ray Walston and Werner Klemperer. Those expectations will increase again when the movie is directed by Stanley Donnen, which the cartoon This has received a lot of attention such as DAMN YANKEES !, BEDAZZLED and CHARADE during the first five minutes or so. It seems that those expectations will be fulfilled and then ?? Nothing. Things that should be funny, lightly lead to a heavy and heavy melodrama. Shouldn't laugh. Suzy Parker is often criticized for her performance or lacking anything. In this movie But in movies that even Gary Grant often appeared flat and wood, the attack on Parker seemed unfair. Not even the bright light like Audrey Hepburn or Doris Day can change the fate of a dull, boring and pointless script that makes yourself look boring and dragging the attention and patience of the audience. <br /> <br /> The remaining actors, especially Ray Walston, try to breathe some life into the proceedings. But the script is too scary to save lives Unreasonable and unreasonable attempts to drag the half-hearted laughter from a dazed audience at the last moment of the movie serves only to add insult to injury. <br /> <br /> This film has nothing but Major disappointments at all levels
