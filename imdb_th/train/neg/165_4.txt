While it's quick to say how the series will evolve, I can say that the pilot is less than I thought. However, there is still potential for the series, however. Of course, when I saw the Voyager for the first time, I thought it had potential as well - but was very disappointed. My courage told me that Enterprise is not as bad as the Voyager. However, <br /> <br /> For the pilot's impression ... <br /> <br /> The pilots have good ideas and good themes. Like the introduction, the launch of the program is interesting, with the progress of the survey and the appropriate song. Scott Bakula is good at the role of the captain. <br /> <br /> That is short for me. "Feelings of setting in an adventure Great The story of that episode is a typical "Trek" with the content of "exploration" and "first step into space", which is just a subplot and subtitle. If you edit this reference to a deep space mission for the first time, the plot may be difficult to distinguish between the era of Enterprise, TOS or TNG. The central plot does not reflect or give justice to Granville. The core of the series <br /> <br /> The plot of the launch of the first mission will be big enough if there is no "action" instead of referring to the isolation of exploration. They may be stories. Get a little more nostalgia and philosophy. (Oh, for a TV program that will make us think again), we feel the excitement of "wind" and being on the "sea" instead of distracting us with many help and weapons. There are too many firing methods. <br /> <br /> We have more feelings than humans are "students" in established schools. New children in the block, compared to entering the unknown universe, the most sad that the Klingons landed on our doorstep instead of searching for them. The meeting seems to be more historical and sociological. How do the two different societies interact? <br /> <br /> I have to think more about it as `Trek with the Akward team and the limited technology 'which is different from the" brave first step to the unknown. " I want to see something new and fresh The series promises a new concept. But until now I have not seen this great new concept. <br /> <br /> I will conclude by emphasizing the confidence of the potential series. There are some interesting characters. Bakula is wonderful. Blalock has the potential to be the overall theme. It is the most interesting thing since we first saw Kirk in the world at Apollo 11. If only in the future, it can create justice for the great theme. And this wonderful, we will have a list to create a new legend. <br /> /> You shoot the arrow up to the sky ... Good luck Capt. Archer <br /> <br /> For manufacturers: Use More risk and make us * think *!: - )
