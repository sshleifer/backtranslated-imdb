This is tearing out the evidence Frankenstein, an old, famous scientist, was killed in a strange accident and his father, a brain surgeon who saved the brain. Then it was placed in the robot of his own design. His younger brother, who has an electrical talent, gives the 'giant' motivation to convey ideas into motion. The whole project is not good when the creation is berserk. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not developed. The script is lacking. And it is a joke that this thing is not scary. Little children will think that this is a good thing. If you wake up at three in the morning and this will happen on the night .... all night. <br /> <br /> The characters are led by Otto Kruger, John Barra And Ross Ed Wolff as 'Colossus'
