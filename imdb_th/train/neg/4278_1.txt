Just picked up this movie for flirting at National Wholesale Liquidators and after watching it, I felt like I was torn. <br /> <br /> I don't know if I've watched movies that are worse. The day wrote a negative review of the movie if I didn't respect that much. Stephen Foster and his music <br /> <br /> First of all, what is it? Is it a musical biography? Yes, a lot of songs by Foster then spread here and there are pseudo-Broadway type numbers - Jerome Kern that reek over Mississippi Delta. I mean, someone gets money to write this miracle? Second, the true story of Foster is an interesting story. Why not try closing it too? Thirdly, what do they have in Ray Middleton, the great person who will let him do this movie? Picture of him with a small boy ?? With communism? It's a great talent. <br /> <br /> So Foster's friends and the truth and good entertainment must be afraid ... Be very scared.
