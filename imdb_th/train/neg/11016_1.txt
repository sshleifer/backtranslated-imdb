Imagine the worst play from Saturday Night Live and Mad TV in the 90-minute movie. Now imagine that all the humor in those bad plays will be removed and replaced with folly Now, imagine something worse than 50 times. <br /> <br /> Is it ok? <br /> <br /> Ok, now go see the underground comedy The vision you just seem to be the most fun thing ever. UCM is the only worst movie I've ever seen. There are a few cheap prices to laugh ... very little but it is lame. Although the intention of the movie is weak But it was too weak to be funny. <br /> <br /> The only reason I was not angry that I wasted my time watching this movie was something I knew. He loses his money. Vince's proposal hasn't written or directed anything else, and it's no surprise why.
