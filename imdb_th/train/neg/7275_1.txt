"Lamphun National Movie" (1981) is the worst movie ever created, even the "Plan 9 from Space", which is ridiculous. Different actors The only general topic is the lack of total redemption They were beautiful in the first and second parts respectively. But their attractive performances are alright. It seems that the director has forgotten that T&A wants a credible story and no one sees. <br /> <br /> The third part starring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark is the most disgusting story of the three And the unfortunate choice as the story of this film Benson plays as an energetic young cop who reports his first day brightly, ready to eliminate the path of evil. He was paired with an old policeman who was played by Widmark, and when oil and water partners began their first patrol together, we felt the redemption of the previous failure of the film. Perhaps because of the insulting timing system being reformed by the strength and loyalty of his new partner Maybe everything will end happily after all. But alas, this movie is directed to the bathroom without any unhappy ransom. There are no linked stories. <br /> <br /> Before "National Lampoon, watch the movie" I thought I had seen it. The worst thing that Hollywood can do Unfortunately I didn't see half of it. <br /> <br />
