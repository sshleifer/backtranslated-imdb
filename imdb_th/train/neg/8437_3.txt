As a big fan of David Mamet's films and plays, especially the first film of House of Games, starring Joe Mantegna, I expect great things from this film. But I found myself frustrated because of superficiality and lack of credibility. Racism will be thrown away without any sense or meaning behind them in the hope of creating racial tensions that I had never seen before. Identities have been completely re-evaluated and men become "heroes" without clear reasons. Due to his vows as police officers, the protagonist refuses to do little things that will not harm anyone and may save his life and continue to perform violently and illegally But still denying minors. In addition, a highly unbelievable subplot involving the man who killed his family was only recommended to plot the plot at all. But advertising by writing screenplay Needless to say, after expecting a thrilling thriller from David Mamet, I was extremely disappointed to say the least. 3 out of 10
