I guess the spoiler <br /> <br /> completely absurd logic of the end scene makes the whole movie crumble. I can't beat it. And what's wrong with the characters of Mark Wahlberg? If suddenly I found myself crumbling - landing on a planet full of monkeys, talking to me would be like that "AAAAhhhhHHH !!! But he all likes "I'm talking about Eppo anyway?" That's a rather boring thing I said. He must meet strangers regularly. In addition, this event is also the best work of Rick Baker. This film is a testament to the fact that we have been in the field of monkey makeup 3/10.
