This movie is terrible. I rent it. I don't know what to expect. I watched 1 minute 5 and this movie and knew it was a blast. The show was terrible and there was no storyline. The mouth is not moving, so why are they having a doctor playing the xylophone to kill the monster just badly? Don't waste time. (1 out of 10)
