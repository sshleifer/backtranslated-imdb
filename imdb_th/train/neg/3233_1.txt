C'mon people, you can not seriously get another case of inappropriate advertising! This is not even scary from the distance and not scary or vicious - it's a terrifying amateur video made for the next party that will let the girls put on <br /> <br /> Bad blood. Incredibly - the scene is far from making me want to puke. But just made me want to use the camera and smash them over my head The girl is putting the rubber face, not moving at all. Would be more fun if using a real doll instead of <br /> <br /> one season "I'm a celebrity, take me out of here!" Very scary. Don't waste your time or money.
