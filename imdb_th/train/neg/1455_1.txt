I rarely get such nonsense in movies that should be based on people in history. The scary joke of the movie. I am constantly cringed, scary, trite, distorted and full of lies and frankness. Hitler must have been a consultant for this film. However, he found that the script was incorrect in the past and was ridiculous until he refused and demanded that they stop using his name as a source of information. (Causing him to be embarrassed to think that other people think he is involved) <br /> <br /> One scene shows that Hitler hit his dog. There is no source for this. Hitler loves animals over humans. He adopted the strictest animal welfare law in Europe, enacted laws prohibiting experiments and experiments with animals. He is also a vegetarian. <br /> <br /> This film makes him receive an iron cross, a joke that deals with bribery, lies > <br /> There is no historical document showing that Hitler had sex with his niece. <br /> <br /> In addition to these things, Hitler also shows the smoothness. Madly in /> <br /> flick waste if he was <br ignorant people mad and bold as he is. This nonsense movie in real life, you will not even know that he used to exist. It's okay to be the leader of Germany. <br /> <br /> Actually, this movie is the worst. <br /> <br /> Look at the devastation and make this post very wide.
