Jet Li is one of the best hands in fighting against the hands in the world. He has been for more than 20 years and makes other people in a shameful genre. While he is big in Asia, he hardly knows here in the United States. <br /> <br /> Black Mark should be a breakout movie for him. But it was horribly failed First, it was called While it may have a camp fee (Settings are not near and flat in tone). It seems that it is not suitable for general movie viewers. Second, the director in this movie is Daniel Lee, a horrible work. He quickly cut the scene, sometimes you don't know what happened. Sometimes the camera shakes and shakes. The fans watch Jet Li's movie for a great martial art. However, the director quickly corrects the scene until you don't even know who it is! Sometimes the scene is left hanging. (For example, Li began to drill holes on the floor of the jeep while the machine gun was armed with their guns two seconds later. Both Li and the interesting love were under the car. It is unlikely that they cross completely ridiculous points. (Killer CD-ROM? Just needing to throw a star !!!!) Li needs a director who is less likely to cut machine guns and more to create a movie scene per scene. The added rap / techno music is okay. Intrusive The story is possible, but all destroyed by the cartoon characters that bring about any credibility that this movie is committed to. And we really believe that interest in love doesn't know Simon because he has a half-face mask, right? The lower jaw hair or the sound of not giving up. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch the movie Jetley, try Iron Monkey or his classic Shaolin temple. This separate mess is a complete waste of time ..... 2/10
