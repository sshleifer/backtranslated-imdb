If you like "Blair and" you will like this one. It has a terrifying camera and soundtrack as well, and it has a plot that does not exist and a suspicious moment. <br /> <br /> It has Tom Savini. "Dead of Romero Tarantino and Rodriguez" "From Dusk Till Dawn" You are in the process of treatment. He is a great icon and actor as well. <br /> <br /> Not serious. This movie is the most nasty movie I've seen for a long time, and I've seen some movies. I can tell you that I found some horror movies that entertain in some way. But this is just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 is empty chicks. And the hottest action with sharp plastic teeth ... no, I'm just kidding I have to miss before I press "Send" on the vote. <br /> <br /> Stay away, even if there is a sexy girl with teeth on the cover!
