The investigator who liked this movie surprised me. Messy storyline The characters are wooden. Michael Bowen spends a lot of time spying on other characters and judging them all. No one has the quality of redemption or interest. This is not an annoying job. It's not fantasy It's not ironic. It's not smart. There's nothing straightforward about this boring job. Who missed the stage, was not surprised that "this network" aired, causing the place to diminish I would suggest changing the launch of the Smart Garden show on PBS again or providing good information if you encounter this mess in the late night TV If you find it on TV during the daytime, take a long walk. Even if you walk in the haze, you will feel better not to suffer with this chaos. Life is short. This movie is long.
