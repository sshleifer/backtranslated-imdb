I try to like this program. I really do. I also bought the pilot film for the first time on VHS and later on DVD. However, I can't get into this because the two main characters: "David" (Bruce Willis) and "Maddie" (Cybill Shepherd) seem to love themselves only. I admit that it is a wise conversation on the program which is an important part of the success of the TV program and I admire that dialogue. <br /> <br /> In general, this is almost like the old comedy of the 30s and 40s With men and women You have been arguing for many allegations of shouting and screaming. Obviously, a lot of people like that argument. But I hate it, so I never met the moonlight band. <br /> <br /> Allyce Beasley, the only person who is the victim of "Agnes", is terrible that she has very little airtime. Shepherd is good for eyes and I think women will say the same thing as Willis. But arguing between the two eventually closed me.
