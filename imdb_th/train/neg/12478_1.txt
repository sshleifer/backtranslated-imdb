I have to give this movie 1 story because it's terrible. But don't make this thing think I don't enjoy watching because I laugh and laugh and I have a few questions. Half of the time I laughed half the time I said "What happens in hell?" Or "Why do people do this?" Flapping wings in the wind when they ride horses And it has a crappy effect (They shouldn't be a real tree?) And I still don't understand this guy that they find in the cave. What is he in hell? My friend told me about these movies and I think I will try it and in general I like this movie like the general people like the Ed Wood movie. I am not really happy about how this movie is. In my own style, hilarious So don't let this bother you if you think this is a real action movie. I just like it because of other reasons. It's a lot worse than Evil Dead. (Which came into my mind a few times) I guess the best thing for most people is to have a little drink, have friends around and laugh with this movie. May be quite severe But I don't think so. Rent it. You will see Yo.
