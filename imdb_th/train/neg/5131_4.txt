I like it, but then I think I may be ironing at the same time. The reworked work of Cyrano de Bergerac / Roxanne is a very popular communication and is assisted by humiliation on the video when released by Janeane Garofalo. In a love trap when insecurity takes her through her best friend (Umherman) goes out to be himself when someone calls into her room. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting film in the interesting career of British actor Ben Chaplin. On average, he filmed this movie with Hollywood. He has no meaning and does not reveal his name in the studio work. It is not surprising on the basis of it, although he appeared in many movies, both in the movie Terence Malick later. Gather everything together fluently. OT phone number 4/10
