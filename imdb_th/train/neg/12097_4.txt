I didn't expect much when I saw this thing. After Mst3king the heck out of JasonX with some friends, I hope to have a similar experience here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie went on. Too seriously Am I interested in Jason's problem? I'm sorry. There is a legion of Ft13th legions. At the end of the day, he was a serial killer who didn't die. I just didn't sympathize. <br /> <br /> Freddie is the most interesting aspect of this film with hallucinations. Unfortunately, they are very small until the end of the film, it deteriorates in the bad episode of Death Match. The star ... is not funny. <br /> <br />
