I will give this movie zero in ten. But i will give it two One reason is that Shah Rukh Khan appears in the movie, which is not really the reason. Last Point is Rani, appearing in this film and making a kiss with Kamal I love Rani very much and have respect that she is a great actress. This is the reason I didn't enjoy her in this movie that kissed Kamal, but it wasn't a big deal. However, in the bedroom scene that makes this film very distinctive, talk about this movie. Is it good or bad? I think it's a junk movie that makes me yawn. I am a great critic. You can see 250+ other reviews. My review by clicking on my name has a very good taste. This movie does not provide entertainment as one thing and if it is difficult to hit a movie, why not have encouragement in this movie? It's a movie with bias, it's not real, and it stinks. Seeing Kamal kissing these actresses makes me sick. Man can't kiss properly.
