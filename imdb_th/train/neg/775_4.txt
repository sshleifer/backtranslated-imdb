John Candy, do we want to talk again? He is the main reason you should watch this movie. Most people do not know how he has talent as an actor. Witnessed the change from poor dirty people to jerks Just changing the face is simple (subtle) and we go out. There are many wonderful bits in this movie and it's a bit stupid. The best time for me is the KUNG FU U scene and the wonderful moment when John (in the trance) goes on stage and talks about how much he loves his girlfriend. I'm sure this reading, you might think that this sequence sounds really rude. It is, but it's very funny, mostly because it's John Candy. Doing this bit, the typical story is quite lame and Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty (both SCTV alumni. With Candy) has not been enough to show in the movie Levi had his time, especially the filming of the wedding at the end. (Think of Rod Zingling) and the wonderful scene when he talked to his mother on the phone Overall, it's a good movie if you have a hard day and have to make your brain stupid. I give this 4 out of 10.
