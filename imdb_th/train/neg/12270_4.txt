The ghost movie of Kiyoshi Kurosawa is quite fierce and it has at least one fear that makes me careful. But overall, this movie is incredibly stupid, with detectives trying to track down a suspected serial killer just to find that he may have committed a type of crime. Then he found himself haunted by a beautiful Asian ghost and didn't know why. (And both audiences) When a murder occurs, he becomes more confused when finding a murderer and this ghost still haunts him for some reason, not just a foolish plot. Especially when you fly across the city like the Wonder Woman and the ending is a little reasonable. In fact, this movie has a little reason and I can't recommend it at all. If it wasn't serious, I would think that it should be a black comedy, in addition to "bright future". This is the worst movie directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa that I've seen.
