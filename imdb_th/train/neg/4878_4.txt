If you want to make a movie like this, there are real threats. Do not surround your servants with the Bonzos group. There is no credibility here. The story is boring and unbelievable. The performance is worse than before. I think I'm watching Arthur Lake (Dagwood), one of the worst actors in history when I see the main character. At some point, he must face the music and fight like crazy. I don't care. You have all these long scenes that are set in this strict office. (Furniture made of cardboard or building materials) People talk and smoke and do nothing. Most actions occur in five minutes. After that, do not bother.
