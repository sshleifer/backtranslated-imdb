I think "Intensive Care" is quite bad and very funny without intention. But at least not as bad as I thought it might be Sometimes it's quite suspicious. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The fun is in vain moments. But the classic moments of all time are: Peter (Koen Wauters) stabbed and attacked by a murderer He shouted at the corner of the hall. Amy (Nada van Nie) knelt beside him and asked if "Poor Peter, can I ask for your help?" <br /> <br /> This film was filmed in Dutch and English. To reduce costs, all license plates are in the US and the background in the news studio is the Manhattan skyline. Very funny if you are Dutch and see the original version in Dutch.
