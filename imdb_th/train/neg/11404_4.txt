It is very interesting to me that many critics think this is a masterpiece. I am not as stupid as quality movies, and I will admit that from a technical shooting perspective, as well as many characters that show that this film is worthwhile But there is no reason (for me) of this movie actually going anywhere; I mean to take the audience everywhere. It's a series of emotional scenes. Maybe it's an amazing story. But I want more from movies I was looking for stories and movements and the arrival of the movie. I didn't find anything in this movie. Yes, it may be regarded as a poem on the film .. but there are many poems that I can't live with for the same reason: it draws without drawing. <br /> <br /> Another thing to say Next, it was a document in the early childhood of England in the mid-century. Need to have restrictions on internationalization I was shocked by what the British youth had to live at the time and place. When growing up in America ten years ago, I can honestly say that the difference is great. I can't help but wonder if this difference affects those who criticize this film. In other words, there is a tendency to judge this movie entirely in the story. 'Marvel movies' (which I agree to have) and do not care about the nature of the experience that was actually restored?
