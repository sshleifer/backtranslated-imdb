I picked it up at the video store because of Tarantino's advice ("If you don't like (here) go to f & ^% yourself!") In the box ... seems to have a ringtone certification. ... I expect something more like "Death Proof" ... not much real violence in points or plot of characters or conversations. <br /> <br /> See the poster. It's all there. Stunts and Rock It goes back and forth A week or more in the life of an LA band that shows a crappy magic at a level you might see in a casino that is less than a bar and a new Aussie stunt performer in town to find his feet ... They work for them. He meets the women they party. The end of the story <br /> <br /> Obviously, the band wants everything like that because they are in the second level, straightforward and playing the style that was dated in 1978. It has to be Said It is truly exciting - Aussie friends are something and the movie seems to have the most inspiration from love and respect for "art." I hung there to see what he had done. Go Just hope that he will find a better vehicle
