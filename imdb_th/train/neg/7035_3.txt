'Plot' that is very thin of Satan's ritual or some jumbo-jumbo, such a hokey excuse to thread a vast amount of sex scenes together. Direct vanilla sex, orgasm, lesbian, S&M, wildlife, incest and other sexual spread. Few people get their time in the spotlight here. The problem is that the story is boring until the rampant sexuality becomes boring. Who knows that movies with close encounters between goats and women can be tedious? Now I can. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Venessa Hidalgo shows all the Helga lines for T&A (both on the display quite often); Female viewers will receive occasional sexual organs. <br /> <br /> My grade: D + <br /> <br /> Region 1 Special DVD: Movie for "Pick Up", "Legend of Eight Samurai "," Don't answer the phone "," Prime Evil ", &" Sister Street Fighter "(as well as a DVD with the second movie" Evil Eye ")
