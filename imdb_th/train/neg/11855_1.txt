This film is one of the movies that appeared on the cable in the afternoon two to entertain the housewife who was bored while they ironed. The show is the second rate. It seems that the poor, Mathew Modine will sleepwalk in the whole movie. And God helps Gina Gershon. Her accent is too high. It sounds like an authentic English woman. It sounds insulting, forced and deceiving like her performance. She should stick to what she does best. A female character who plays in rock and roll bands and has drug problems. Other characters will not be better. It's two-dimensional. Empty, absurd and absurd How should we care about these people? At one point Christy Scott Cashman really lost his way in Central Park? It's not difficult to navigate Central Park, just follow any path. Not only do I not care about any characters, I hate them seriously. The only reason I am still with the wreck of the train. This is Fisher Stevens. Even his excellent humor could not save this dying fish. Each scene is a typical romantic joke and there is nothing left to surprise us. The script is very bad like acting. If you catch this fish, throw it back!
