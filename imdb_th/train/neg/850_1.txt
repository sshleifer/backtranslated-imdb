This is the most stupid movie I've ever seen. (Front spoiler)! First of all, the plot is stupid. Strange little boy and they moved to the hotel because his father was the caretaker. We found that children have gifts "shining". This gift has nothing to do with anything but to make children look cool. Then the movie became bored and boring until the man finally got mad. He goes on a rampage to kill the boy and his wife because ... he feels like it. Why does he have to do something else? Suddenly we saw a naked woman in the tub. The man kissed her and realized that he was kissing the dead body that was most disgusting. Somehow, a black man entered the hotel and was axed by an ax. Then the boy and the girl brought the black man's vehicle out of the deceased father within a few minutes. Most movies are not a waste of time. But it's about that category The song is a rubbish, a recurring character. (Except Jack Nicholson, a good actor) The plot is twisted and fits the description of vomiting. The ending is a very predictable story. The story is slow, boring and boring. This movie gave too many points. Avoid this movie at all costs. I was surprised that it received a very high score in IMDb.
