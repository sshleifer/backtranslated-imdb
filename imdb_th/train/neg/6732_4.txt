I discovered this film in the IFC and I think it's interesting. For the "tiny" love story, some stories were dragged into this movie. The fact that none of these women have names almost makes you wonder if actors are talking about their true sexual life, including Kathy Baker and Alicia Witt. I have to admit I want to start to see the romantic view of The first sexual encounter again, as in "Strike! (1998)" When the acquaintances of Odette Sinclair begin to ask about her for the first time Yo The latter will help to improve the film. I think it will make things worse. No need to be a hard porn movie to get attention. In any way, I expect more.
