A short review, but ... <br /> <br /> Avoid costly, totally 90 minutes. At the end of the movie, I don't have anybody as smart as it actually happened. It is full of pendants (Stephen Fry (3 minutes), Jack (30 seconds), "Philadelphia" girls) and people who can't remember. But not reasonable No matter what is missing in the editing process, I'm not right now, but jeez ... <br /> <br /> Put the DVD instead or go to bed and rest !!! <br /> <br /> 2 from 10 (for hijacking and chasing Morris Minor cars) <br /> <br />
