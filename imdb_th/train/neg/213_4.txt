Yes, of course. It's probably a good movie. Love biangle. (Sorry for the poet's license. But not a triangle!) Interesting story Sometimes the picture is strange, sometimes okay, the picture looks crowded and invisible. The sound needs more attention. (Usually in Romanian movies). Sometimes, light and color filters sometimes choose poorly. The soundtrack is short and doesn't help. About the show ... Sorry, but the best actress is the owner of other lands that are unending and cannot convince the audience That performance is a poem when it should be true and true when it should be a poem. It is an image for adults that children are disturbed only in the case that they are very curious.
