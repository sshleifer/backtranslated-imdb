Okay, now I know that there are millions of Americans who believe in joy: the moment that every new born person in Christ will be brought up to meet God and all the remaining humans will be left on earth. And the anguish of psoriasis while the group opposes God fighting Jesus (In a war mode that has never been before) and I know that the book is a bestseller. Believers in the group. And I don't mean to disrespect all things. <br /> <br /> But I have to say that they stuffed this movie into a sack and beat it with a staff. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the book. Much better. <br /> <br /> The plot doesn't want to be uploaded. If you have watched this movie, you will read the book. I may be one of the only people in the world who watch this thing just for a poor walking experience and I am not disappointed. In particular, not by Kirk Cameron gremlin "Growing Pains", an eerie little old age in that list, met with Christ and decided that SHOW should reflect Christian values. Kirk, your career has gone to find a dog. But now you are happy that you spread the word of God in a bad movie. They never let the drama run. That's not strictly true: I think this is the only movie ever made at DVD FIRST with a voucher for watching free movies when it's screened in a short movie theater! I still have a voucher! How many people do you think appear? I do not know anything about you But it never came to my city Of course, I live in New York, where the liberal, naive, sitting around, tearing away from the Bible and using them to roll joints, so you go. In fact, I'll bet on three million people on Manhattan, no one. It should be sad. <br /> <br /> Check out more information on the DVD, where you will learn the creepy details behind the scenes. Of these movies .. all actors and crew must have the same religious thoughts They didn't come out to say this. But listen closely to what the creator says It's like being a Pod group that came together to make a movie. Pod Creepazoid? Actually, this thing is told to converts, right? You can imagine anyone who has not subscribed to all revelations. Look at his forehead and slap in the face. "HOLY HOOVER DAM! I should get help quickly! "However, I'm addicted. I have to watch the rest of the failed Christian films, especially the movie Gary Busey, which I think is ridiculous. At least Busey has an excuse to join .. He cracks the head on the sidewalk when he hits his motorcycle. <br /> <br /> Oy. <br /> <br /> Oh and another What was the image of a poor, innocent dog who wailed their leash and dragged along the ground in vain because their owners were called to heaven? What happened to that We should feel bad for dogs and if we do, what must we do from God? Does the IRK have a space in heaven for human best friends? Foo <br /> <br /> This is another reason I didn't believe in God. Good night and good luck
