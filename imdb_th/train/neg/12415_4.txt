I can't remember that "Barnaby Jones" is nothing more than a standard detective acting, which follows the Quinn Martin program. My actions are murder. Act II is the main character in the murder trial. Act III is a twisted plot. (The character is killed again) The fourth scene is the resolution and the ending is Betty. (Lemur Wether) asked her father-in-law, Barnaby Jones. (Buddy Eben) At the end of the show, <br /> <br /> One of the things I remember was the wonderful song by Jerry Goldsmith, the composer of the opening credits that made me want to see acting and in seven. The season on the air I would agree that it was good to see Ebsen in a role other than Jed Clampett, although Ebsen would be a bad person. I just hope the program will provide more entertainment than when I first remembered. <br /> <br /> Update (1/11/2009): I watched an interview with songwriter Jerry Goldsmith on YouTube through Archive of American television stations Suppose I'm kinder than a goldsmith about "Barnaby Jones"
