Before watching this movie, I expect to have a fictional drama based on the concept from the book. But a book that was interrupted by various scenes that showed Different "illnesses" It didn't bother me much. But it hindered my enjoyment in the movie I think one story or two or three stories that are excerpted from books distributed through movies If you are going to make movies from psychological messages, you will need to find interesting messages. (And more accurate) than this film This film dragged on different parts, which is more than a video encyclopedia of sexual psychology in the 19th century and will not be tolerated if it is not sexual in nature (because "sex = interesting" for most of us, even me). Fortunately, there are many stories that have actually developed the characters that pulled us in. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Krafft-Ebing's sexual theory doesn't have any parts. I hope it will use the story to show that the imperfections of his views about ancient psychology that still exist today. <br /> <br /> So what are you in the end? Detailed catalogs of fetishes and orientations. Few stories with a little interesting story demonstrate the trials and difficulties of a few "sexual deviants" before they are healed. For most movies, the movie moves with the speed of crawling (and emotion) of the alarm, and as a film with a clearly low budget, movies and performances are not at the highest level. Although I am satisfied with music, costumes and interior design, <br /> <br /> I feel that the film's story is true and I still feel it is a movie that is below average. / 10; 4/10 If I feel very generous I can't imagine anyone enjoying this story if they are not interested in superstition.
