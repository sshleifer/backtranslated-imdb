Finally, after watching the film completely, I was completely amazed by the admiration that critics and online users alike received. Is it the worst thing in the Western world? No, I will not say that, but "The Great American West, the last one". The phrase that I see applies to it more than once? Not even near. <br /> <br /> Movies that try to tell stories like this require believable characters who speak credible conversations and dialogue in this movie, one of the most hacked and ancient movies that I have seen Movies can be measured in groaners per minute; As an actor or actor who is forced by a script to say something that no man will say in real life, how many times? There are many things that cause distractions. The magic line comes to you in the waves. Can be predicted and distorted often. <br /> <br /> If the bad conversation doesn't disturb you Only a few Westerners can show you that the fighting is completely unbelievable while trying to make you act seriously. It doesn't matter if there is a joke for gunfighting, such as in the Silverado, but in the Tombstone, the heavy and heavy choreography of the early guns is another reason for the film to leave the list of good Westerners. The final showdown was the redemption of the director in this score. But then I didn't care about movies that were too much to record. <br /> <br /> In addition to those shortcomings, I can say that the pictures are amazing - the shots of all the movies and settings look good. Performances can be reasonable, especially when considering what the actor is doing. However, if you are looking for the last great American, please do as you like - go rent Unforgiven instead. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
