I recently bought Bloodsuckers on eBay. I watched some parts and considered it too stupid to review again. Excessive blood volume of water at the beginning was only outdated, not to mention the wind "Whip around" my friend and I made a movie that had a very low budget and the effect remained beyond this shit festival. <br /> <br /> For a mistake in this movie I know an actor - believe it or not, he is my THEATER teacher. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: Don't worry about this "horror" flick. <br /> <br /> 3 stars (from possible 73)
