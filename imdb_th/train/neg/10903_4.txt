Rob Schneider is a comedian who is famous for his facial movements and performances. "Not a human being" This time he is an animal. Marvin is a loser who tries to be a hero, and one day no one receives a call from the attacking man, so Marvin must use this case and save the lives of the attackers. But on the way to the scene, he collided with his car and was really damaged. He can't remember what happened, and on weekdays his life was not the same when he found that he had animal instincts. Of course, we got our girls that our main characters tried to reach. But his efforts were useless. She was played by Collen Haskell without negative characters. The negative character is destiny if I can use this parable. Marvin should know how to be a normal human again. With his animal instincts helping him in certain situations Schneider's performance is fairly good. This movie is not true, which makes it silly at certain times. But it is one of the movies that are called fun, ridiculous as I have written above So watch it for Rob Schneider monkey style, but it's not one of the best comedies ever, or one of the best movies that Schneider appeared. He is a great comedian. But this is not his best movie
