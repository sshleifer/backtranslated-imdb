I can sit and watch this movie once. But I wonder if I can do it a second time The most mild entertainment for the physical appearance of Lindsay Lohan. The fun of Matt Dillon. (Thinking something about Mary) and the emergence of more serious performances. Micheal Keaton This is not fun in playing The Love Bug, but it can be viewed. One of my main interests from the film is the fact that Herbie has developed into the R2D2 comedy. For the most part, I was bored with the impact of the headlights on my eyes. He was used and the front fender bending caused the same reaction from me. Go see this with your baby, such as children, "one placeholder" and don't expect much from this movie. <br /> <br /> _X
