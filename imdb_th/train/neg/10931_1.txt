I went to watch this movie with a relatively low expectation, thinking that it would be a beautiful piece. Sadly, it's not like that. I can hardly sit and watch movies without having to walk out. I went with my two children (ages 10 and 13) and even though they continued to ask that After a long time until the end, I was just wondering who would approve this script. Even the reliable Fred Willard was not able to record repeated conversations, state jokes and repeated plot. this story (I use loosely words) should attend online screen writing or their local community colleges to study movies. At least there are many books on screen writing and film production that will teach them about structure, plot, dialogue and pacing.
