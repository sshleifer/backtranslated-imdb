This will be something to watch Hollywood if there is a good solution. It is based on a typical American thriller plot - "Who is more intelligent than anyone?" The performance is below average. But with the sparkling image of the detective who is the best actor in this movie, and most of them have to take responsibility if the tension in this film increases. The film was suffocated by empty video and audio, and most of it seemed to be a film material. In conclusion, if you don't mind watching a movie that looks like a student movie project, this is a movie that needs to be watched. I guess probably enough to say in this movie, everything else can destroy the tension that may be low enough.
