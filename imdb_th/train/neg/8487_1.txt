I haven't seen anything bad like this since I came out of the movie James Bond "Moonraker" twenty years ago. I managed to sit through this whole thing only because Tilda Swinton, but nothing she could do to help this beast. <br /> <br /> It's a cross between "Pi", "Orlando" and "Tron". This story failed miserably in every aspect of filmmaking. The character is cardboard and can not cause any sympathy. The plot is totally unbelievable. Performances except Swanton amateur Computer graphics are worse than in "Tron". Timothy Leary is very annoying. I can go on <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say about this movie is Tilda Swinton. There, I don't know why her talented actor agrees to appear in a dub. The But you should regret it now. <br /> <br /> Don't waste money or waste time on this lost person. There is nothing to see here.
