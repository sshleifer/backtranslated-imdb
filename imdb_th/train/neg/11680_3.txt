This film has a lot of potential - strong actors, reasonably strong ideas and a reasonable budget. I'm not sure where it went wrong. But those elements wasted The story is nowhere. The character is hollow, to say the least, and the result is boring, ridiculous and useless. I hate it, judging by other votes. Anyway, I think this movie is scary. I have high hopes But was very disappointed The most frustrating thing is Jodie Foster's character. A very insolent "service provider" makes it a good idea. Jody is confident and sexy. But the character didn't do anything and didn't go anywhere Denzel Washington plays the same character he always plays - fun, but nothing new.
