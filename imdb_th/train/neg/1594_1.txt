Wow. This movie is tired of the pants when I see it. Gentle, pointless and unchanging. <br /> <br /> Obviously Ash and the company can travel with time with the help of "The Spirit of the Forest" ('Princess Mononoke'?) There, they meet a sluggish boy named Sam and start a "plan" <br /> <br /> So Tom (Ash) and Huck (Sam) are High naturally became hippies and tried to release Celebi ("soul") from the monster hunter. I don't even know what's going on again. Everything went blurred. Ash's friends rarely get in that scene and every fight scene is boring. <br /> <br /> After recording the day, Ash and his embarrassing friends have to go back to their time. OO;) Then, after returning to time, Ash knew that his new friend was the competitor's grandfather. And i think it Moron, right? If you love your children, you will not disclose this (1 out of 10).
