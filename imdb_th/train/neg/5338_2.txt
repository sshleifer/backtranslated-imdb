Elvis Presley plays the role of "Native Indian" (American Indian), which must protect his reserve from a disgusting business. Everyone likes to drunk, fight and create children. Fighting wrestling and "punching" instead of stereotypical hand gestures "How"? <br /> <br /> Although he has to make up But it was clear that Elvis was healthier than he had appeared in previous films; It may be that he is preparing for his famous "comeback". It would be impossible because the script of this movie is exciting. Joan Blondell tried to convince Elvis and Burgess Meredith in "war paint". Should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> The song The best is "Stay Away" (in fact, "green arms" with various lyrics) The most embarrassing song is Elvis's love song and "Dominic" bull. There is a surreal scene. some But it was never enough to be successful in that category. Although "far away, Joe" may make you laugh if you are in the right "mood". <br /> <br /> Not like that. Far away <br /> <br /> ** Stay away, Joe (1968) Peter Tikbury ~ Elvis Presley, Burgess Meredith, Joan Blondell
