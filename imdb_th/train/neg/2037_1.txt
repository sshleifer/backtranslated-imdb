If I can be zero, I will change my mind and give -10 instead of the horrible movie that doesn't have a movie plot. Just plain boring Please don't waste money on this pleaseee !!! This film is very good if it describes the story of a true zodiac killer. But I didn't feel anything but looked nasty while watching. Make yourself a favorite and rent a classic movie instead. It would be better if you watch a movie you've seen 3-4 times more than watch this shit! I do not understand why people have to make movies like this when they know that it is not good. Zodiac killer should be called 'Boriac killer' instead !!!
