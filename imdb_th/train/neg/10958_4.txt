When I watched this after receiving a DVD for Christmas 2005, I came here to sweep - but after reading other comments I didn't mind. Obviously this is a movie that works very well for one year old children. Let me not be a complete grinch; May be usable for some children - if they are not saturated with too much media and are not too complicated, for example by watching all LOTR and Harry Potter, but if you are adults, miles away; You won't enjoy it. <br /> <br /> A bit good: Barbara Kellerman as a witch, especially in her first scene with Edmonds, creates a perfect combination between evil. Evil that has charm and uncontrollable madness (At the rock table, she went up slightly) Michael Aldridge in the role of Associate Professor and Jeffrey S. Perry, while Mr. Tumnus also has a refined and skilled performance that we expect from the BBC. The best drama and the Aslan series are very good. Amazingly considered. They have the right eye. <br /> <br /> A bit bad: almost everything else, especially two sides. One casting England is full of good actors and there are tens of thousands of British students. How will they end up with these four? They move like wooden soldiers and speak as well. Peter has no attraction or talent. (And is significantly shorter than younger brothers); Edmund is a cheat and Lucy ... Sophie Wilcox as Lucy is very obviously very wrong for this part, which I can't imagine that she will get a job. <br /> <br /> Two animal sets again, it seems that they work for some children. If the kids are still in the level that Big Bird and Elmo are exciting and convincing characters, they may join. In this movie But for a more sophisticated audience that was 12 years old, who had seen Prisoner Of Azkaban when Mr. Beaver came out from behind that tree, there would be a laughing and cruel laugh. Costumes don't work - I can't, and I think that there are no adults or modern teenagers unable to suppress unbelief when looking at Mr. Beaver. Animations drawn later (gryphons, etc.) work better, easier to use. <br /> So <br />: Ten stars for young and tender children. Everyone reads or reads the book and see the better movies that your imagination solves.
