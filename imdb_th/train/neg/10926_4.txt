While the idea is more original than most sci-fi movies, the operation is still lacking. While the practice of mummies in practice is not bad, and the "Gun Nut" character is superior to the top laughing, the only real draw is to see Morena Baccarin and Adam Baldwin back together New I wonder if that was a thought. They do the best they can with what they have, but the "must see" moment for me in the first 40 minutes or when Morena's character wears Tomb Raider style shorts. Not high But you can't deny the true beauty when you see it !!! And Adam Baldwin then ham it again as someone you like to hate If you just want to watch your favorite Firefly characters, have a good time with some sub-content. This may be yours. If you want good performances and character development, recommend to look elsewhere.
