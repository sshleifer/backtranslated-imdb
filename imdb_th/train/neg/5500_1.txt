This movie tries hard. But the lack of fun of the 1960s television series. Sure, I am sure that people can remember with passion. Although I am 17, I have watched the series on YouTube for a long time and have fun and fun. Sadly, this movie gives justice to the little series. <br /> <br /> The special effects are quite substandard. The script is boring and lacks a sense of humor and humor. Other movies with poor scripting are Home Alone 4, Cat in the Hat, Thomas and Magic Railroad and the Addams Family. <br /> <br /> Now I will say that I like the idea of ​​the story. But unfortunately it Was poorly executed and ran out of steam too quickly and I was not sure for this reason that it was something the family would enjoy And I was frustrated by the talk, although the sound came out of Wayne Knight. <br /> <br /> But the thing that made me the most angry about this movie was that it lost the ability of Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels and Daryl Hannah, a talented actor, all with Jeff Daniels pulling in a good performance But he seems to not know what he should do and the character of Elizabeth Hurley is sadly useless Daryl Hannah is a cute and often stupid actor and I like the idea that she is interesting. But sadly you see her very little (Not to mention the monster attacks should make Shawn children a certain government agency. Christopher Lloyd admits himself better and as an actor I like Lloyd very much. (He is in my two favorite films and who is Roger Rabbit, Rabbit and I love Back To The Future) but he gets a little work. <br /> <br /> Overall, I wanted to watch this movie as much as I wanted. Instead of being fun, it is nonsense and is a shame because it has many potential, talented actors and good ideas. 1/10 Bethany Cox
