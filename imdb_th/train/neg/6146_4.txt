How did this movie escape from the exasperation of MST3K? "Gymkata" is a ridiculous action movie full of (Or empty?) With a paper plot that some stupid characters and unusual situations If you enjoy watching poor movies But stupid, you will enjoy "Gymkata" very much. <br /> <br /> The acrobatic activity center that has been selected by government representatives. (At the very least) I think they are government agents) that will become a spy. You see that his father is a semi-government spy who disappeared from the competition in this game, so called "the game" thoroughly. So, the gymnast (played by Kurt Thomas) in the competition in this game and find out what happened to The lost father <br /> <br /> Sounds good, right? Ok, so it's not like that. But the bare bones that are the plot of syphilis do not begin to explain the happiness of this movie. They can be found in the strange details of the movie. Just like the mysterious Asian girlfriend of acrobats who didn't speak in the first half hour of the movie, then started talking immediately and didn't stop at all! Or the bad guy who wears a shirt that likes to make and break the rules of the game "The Game", no matter when he is satisfied And of course our hero is happy to run through the "Village of The Crazies" (apparently the real name of the place!) Is a good place to visit But I don't want to be there. <br /> <br /> But this movie shines as an action scene. Since our protagonist is a gymnast, the director thinks that the gymnastics equipment should be put into the back alleys and cities in the Middle East so our Gymkata boss can use his acrobatic skills to fight evil in parallel. Bar and horse punch Must believe that must be seen. <br /> <br /> One thing that is interesting to note So much I said about half the actors died from being shot with arrows. Interesting because the arrow is just an effect or action that can be believed in all movies. If these things are really affected, the important thing that I notice is that anyone who invented these very realistic arrow wounds More likely, this is the way the movie does not pay extra. However, "Gymkata" deserves to see if you can watch without having to pay and looking for folly that is an easy target for riffing. <br /> <br />
