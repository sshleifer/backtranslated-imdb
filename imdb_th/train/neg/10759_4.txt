Despite having a great future design, intelligent Asimov and Will Smith's great performance make this film unable to respond to expectations. Ancient groups come thick and fast. (Awakening from a nightmare that happened to be a loner, a loner cop with his badge revoked by a hardass lieutenant, so more items will lose it - you can see the end Miles out). You have traveled everywhere Things that should be a global disaster, never leaving the CGI Chicago clearly. The robot itself is good at close range, but the 'crowd' scene looks like a bad Disney - CGI is over and over again and again. And if you can destroy the robot by smashing them, why do they have to inject 'nanites'? You know it's a silly movie when such an idiotic question begins to bother you before reaching the climax. It might be great. But less than the sum of the parts, mainly due to the fully predictable plot that may come from action movies in the last forty years
