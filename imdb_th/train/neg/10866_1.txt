Let's see how to start ... bad performances I am not sure whether I will call it like that because it reads a chapter that doesn't require more effort. The actors don't seem to be in their parts and look lifeless and lifeless. Of course, there are one or two scenes with nudity. But that can't save this movie from a living character. <br /> <br /> In calling the main character, the rapper is an insult to those who really do. The lyrics do not have rhythm or flow and look at the lines of insulting unreasonable. <br /> <br /> Budget? Does this movie have a budget? It looks like they spend less money than I have ever seen in a YouTube video in the house. Bad light, props, poor sound production. Special effects are not good if you want to go as far as they call it. The story should be good if people seem to be interested in doing it. But without this flick of life I don't care who the director is. <br /> <br /> I've seen terrible flicks in the past year and this one is at the bottom. Don't waste your time, or you'll want to listen to this unbiased opinion. Check the score. You will see that 1 is overtaking the 10 pages. The fluffed fast with almost nothing in between. Hopefully I will look closer before wasting time. Really boring!
