Except Brady Variety Hour, this is the most interesting television I've seen for a while. Video production quality is not bad. But the overall picture and overall feeling were in the early 80s and Marie Osmond seems to be fighting with Avon Lady .. and wasting a lot of time. How to write eyeliner too. <br /> <br /> It's an embarrassing story to watch veterans Danny Kaye and Eric Severeid participate in this. More interesting is watching Alex Haley talking about the African Pavillion in the World Showcase that will open in about a year. '<br /> <br /> At the time of this writing, it was 17 years later and Not open yet (Unless you count the Disney animal kingdom). In summary, for all the shortcomings, this is also an interesting picture of Disney history.
