Almost 30 years ago and I hate everyone involved in this movie. It's still the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Before seeing this, I never thought of the river in one way or another. After watching this movie, I had an allergy when I accidentally saw her on television. <br /> <br /> I was dragged here - with my better judgment - by pressure from friends. However, coming out of the theater, those friends vowed not to overrule the movies I chose. Nearly thirty years later, we still have mental scars from this film. <br /> <br /> On my death, one of my regrets is when I hope this movie will improve. <br /> <br /> If you are chosen, you will like to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I registered to comment on IMDb. Hopefully, maybe I can warn others. Not to watch this movie If I could save only one person from watching this, my existence on this earth would be proved.
