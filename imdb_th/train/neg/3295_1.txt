... If so, you shouldn't watch this movie. They have completely destroyed the evidence of the show. In the movie, the duke boy is an idiot. Daisy is a homeless person. Roscoe is a vicious, talented boss. Uncle Jessie is a criminal ... only Cooter and Flash are the original characters. <br /> <br /> At one point they opened the door to General Lee-nuff. <br /> <br /> The original program may not be a great TV. But it is fun and the character makes sense This film is like Dumb & Dumber and meets Simple Life.
