I went to watch this movie with an audience that consists of a new "spirit" type, which is not the same as I like this movie - even though it is based on people who know the book too. (Obviously, there is a book that There is more nonsense.) This movie is not very good. Therefore, if you tend to think of yourself as a "soul", believe in, or at least, be able to tolerate things like "aura" and "star-like bodies" and don't mind using the word "energy" often. context Of physics or technology, you may like real movies and tend to enjoy any book that is based on it. <br /> <br /> However, if you are exposed to the physical universe, most Suppressing that unbelief can happen easily by the new generation of nonsense and the plans that are in it if you have a low tolerance for the magic light effect to show the occurrence of the soul and may expect Non-wood conversation This is my suggestion for you about this movie: Stay away. <br /> <br /> Don't even think about thinking. Tonight, this movie has moved Dungeons and Dragons into the worst movie I've ever seen in a movie theater. (I do not count movies that I watch with their expectations that are not good, such as Plan 9, etc.), while at the same time raising all the movies that I almost walked into two stories (D&D is another matter). Didn't go out for a walk in the movie, even this time But I should have when I saw the image of the aura for the first time because the New Age BS is still thicker and thicker. From that point, <br /> <br /> The story is about the people involved. Himself, along with the old prophecies of seeking spiritual enlightenment and aiming to lead humanity to the next step in its evolution Or something like that They talk about things that are spiritual. This is the next step in human evolution which should make anyone with the deepest idea of ​​what human evolution is. This movie is full of shock. Sometimes people turn to look at what they will certainly explain as "Another dimension" or perhaps "Another plane" just to be invisible to those around you who have not enlightened goodness. <br /> <br /> At the end, the director oversees the audience by "understanding" the painful predictions slowly. Presumably so that we can better remember them and leave the movie theater. <br /> <br /> What good things about movies? Very beautiful natural images and performances sponsored by Elizondo and de Almeida. <br /> <br /> I can tell that it affects my ability to make people serious if they think about the movie. This is interesting or acceptable. It is the most innocent spiritism, unless it is yours. You should do something else with your time and money.
