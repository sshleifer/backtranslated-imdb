I'm not saying that because the production cost is very low. But because it was very filmed The image of a girl who washes her hair in the creek? We need to sit there for filming too long and watch her do that for 5 minutes in the same spot? It's terrible. The light is not as good. You barely see anything, and when the characters speak, you can hardly hear what they say. Do I watch the whole movie? Of course, I didn't skip most, and I didn't want to hear anyone saying I had to watch everything before judging. This film is not good and can be done even in accordance with independent standards and low budget. But even then, it's not because the actors "joke" it is because of painfully poor production.
