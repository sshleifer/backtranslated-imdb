I'm really looking forward to this performance because of the quality of the actors and the fact that the Scottish brothers are involved. Unfortunately, my hope was dashed! Again, we were taken to believe that KGB is a group of incompetent mentally retarded people who have no clue what they are doing. At one point, there is a laughing scene in which 4 KGB agents are unable to manage one CIA agent. I'm tired of these bias images, one-sided and completely wrong of the Spy games that happened during the Cold War. I think it's ridiculous that the United States cannot create a film that has a purpose of being involved in WW2 and others, as well as the pathetic U-571, which we believe the United States has once again received a puzzle. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Credit of the company "Company" is very good. Locales are also well accepted. Alfred Molina put on the same great performance as Keaton. (The conflict between them is very good.) I want to like this performance and no doubt that I will finish watching the next two episodes, but I hope the US production will stop trying to show the spy, Servicemen and others as superman with intelligence. The planet is fast, old, and reduces credibility from what is likely to be 10/10. <br /> <br /> S
