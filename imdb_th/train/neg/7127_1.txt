This movie is bad to say the least !!! Many great cars have been exhibited in the LAME movie. It started with a competition from LA to Las Vegas, which will be completed in 1 hour 45 minutes ... in Ferrari F430. I did that in 1HR. 50 minutes in the Honda Accord, 4-cylinder, 140 horsepower, 1993. Seriously ... This film does not create justice for these cars. Obviously, these writers are just that and may drive under the speed limit with their hands @ 10 & 2 clock. I remember seeing the news that Eddie Griffin crashed Ferrari N. How about 1.5 million dollars to 30-40MPH? >>> youtube.com/watch?v=cNVrMZX2kms <br /> <br /> And ... director Andy Cheng is The biggest sale !!! He brought shame to his own race. I wonder how many people are willing to talk about Hollywood. He is involved in films that show negative and false Asian Americans. Asian women >> Asian money cheap prostitutes >> defeated gamblers and thugs who have overcome all the time What is the fear of all the Asians? Why needs to convey to them negative I was bored with the way Hollywood always portrayed Asian people, such as false and false pretenses.
