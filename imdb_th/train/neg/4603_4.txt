I was p *** ed when I didn't see this picture when screening a movie at the Philly Film Fest last year, so when I saw that it had to be in the cable tonight I warned it as soon as I got it. So worth the wait? Now try to trace it because I haven't given you a story. Angkor Dawley is a young man who doesn't know what his life path is. Enter Duke (George Wendt), who introduced him to his boss Ray (Danny Baldwin). One night, Ray hammered completely. Sean closes the guy they have Sean pursued. And it went from there Which led me back to the question posed Is it worth the wait? Yes and no, the collection is quite good and George Wendt stole my movie. He just picked up the ball and ran with it. But nowhere near as violent as I believe and there is somewhere in the movie that takes time to run, the ball doesn't just fall But still fumble and go in another direction I know where this is happening. But can't speak without breaking the movie But no need to say that it happened The ending didn't save the movie as well. Bad Stuart Gordon had nothing good like "Re-animator" or "Castle Freak" <br /> <br /> My grade: C <br /> <br /> I see: Showtime Extreme <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kari Wuhrer Show her ta-tas in a single fantasy and then in ta-tas next and it scrolls down
