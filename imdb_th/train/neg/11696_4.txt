I started watching this movie with low expectations. Actually, I noticed just because it was a SK adaptation. Novel (novel that I never read) <br /> <br /> I'm glad that my expectations are low because Movies are not close to good. But it makes you interested What makes this story worse is the work that the directors and actors do. This movie is too long. There are no "good" pictures and not scary. The conversation is stupid and disgusting special effects. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is good as I say it makes you interested (I think That the book must be good) without having to use many horror cliches. <br /> <br /> My vote 4/10
