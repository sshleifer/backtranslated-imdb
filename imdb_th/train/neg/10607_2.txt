Jean Claude Van Damme tried to save his life by creating a sequel to Universal Soldier, but could that movie help him? I think he went to hell after he died. <br /> <br /> In the first minute, we saw the inside of the place where you can see the bad guys of this film. But not as scary as the show. <br /> <br /> Then we will see Van Damme and the black woman. (Can't remember the name .... it's okay). Try to escape from the muscles. Of course they are Universal-Soldiers newer, more muscle, less brain (Just like the movie) After a while, Van Damme fought with Goldberg, but after that "mission" was canceled. It was just a test. (Is this movie a test for our nerves?) It turns out that Van Damme worked for the government in the new Universal Soldier project (those who had seen the first movie might think this was the most unofficial thing. But it is a sequel and "story" must happen. I forgot. He has a daughter. Very important for "story" <br /> <br /> Well, after about 20 minutes, a special computer will hear a conversation about shutting it down and quitting. Of course, the cube is angry and activates every soldier to kill everyone. Van Damme fled from the place. But the computer sent some soldiers to hunt him down (it wanted Van Damme as a soldier - because he was the best (really?) And guessing that Goldberg is one of the predators that are often ridiculous sentences for the audience before. Will he be assassinated funny? Yes, like the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> After some "story", Van Damme tries to help his daughter. (Of his wife-journalist in the first film) It was the last show that Van Damme fought with Bad Guy and you can see the most expensive scenes of all movies. (Please see for yourself, it's too funny to tell) <br /> <br /> You will see that this movie is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> So don't watch. But if you keep the Sixpack on you!
