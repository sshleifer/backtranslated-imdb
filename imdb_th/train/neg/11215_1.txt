Okay. At first, this movie looks quite good, although it moves quite fast and even if they have a budget of only $ 60,000, but it's good, but if you meet your sister, die on the lake and find out who will kill her. Chased him around and pulled a gun at him with only one bullet and made it lose and ended up running away from him all, retreating and killing himself, right? After you meet your sister dead on the lake and find clues and think who is the killer, why don't you give that clue to the police who think you killed her? And at the end of the movie, when she acted like her sister, who was a waitress and she was talking to a bad person, she should find him somewhere and save him that she had died and what happened to "evidence" of I don't know if I'm not happy with the ending. This movie should be better if it lasts longer and the performance is better and if the ending isn't that bad! Don't waste money on this movie because if you do, you will also write reviews here and will not be happy.
