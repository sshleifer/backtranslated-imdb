In the movie, I feel that it should be more than just a work of art. I think it should be more than a way to tell the story on this short screen from David Lynch. Tell the story, but not so much. But it's too strange to be a joke It's a good movie creation. But nothing else As I've said before, I'm a big fan of David Lynch. But I was disappointed with some of his work because I didn't see the need at all. This is my least favorite thing he has ever done. But I know that he still has many talents and I'm excited to see what he has prepared for us in the future. If you like Lynch, try it.
