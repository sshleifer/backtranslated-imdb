Where do I start? According to the title of this movie, I expect a certain degree of accuracy. In the end, I surrender severely. This is not the story of Lale Andersen or Lili Marlene, but it's a Hollywood story. (Or choose to be your movie production center) based on some real-life characters I should have a clue when I hear a heavy English accent that gives advice about movies in German. The blood-red message (artist name) should be a clue to the 2nd story being invented (Lale was not deceived by Switzerland's parents. Rolf Liebermann has no information that Liebermann helped the Jews smuggle from Germany. The original songs were recorded. Outside the control of the NS regime that is not in control Playing at the station was picked up in Vienna while the Royal Navy Lt. was out there, etc. etc.) poor and incorrect costumes for the time frame (Black uniform, SS used everywhere from border guards to staff positions Use every day when starting a war, etc. The character is stereo (SA bullying in the club when they lose power). Don't waste time.
