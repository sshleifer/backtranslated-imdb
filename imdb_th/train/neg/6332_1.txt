I hope to watch this movie when it comes out because I'm a big SNL fan. When my girlfriend and I went to watch it, the people who came out of the show started shouting. "Don't waste your money!" But of course we have to find ourselves. <br /> <br /> While there is a bit funny (Laser Bra 2000, Root Boy Slim), most feel that it can be severely resolved. 1 hour of fun performances. It's not good. <br /> <br /> When many opera singers got up and walked away This makes me laugh because I know that O'Donoghue has just hit people's buttons with the purpose of this film. Or else he is crazy - you don't have to waste time looking at it. It's terrible.
