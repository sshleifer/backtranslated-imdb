Genghis Cohn is a mildly entertaining British film about a German police official in the late 1950s who was haunted by a Jewish comedian, whom he had killed 15 years ago while serving under the Hitler in SS. The ghost came back and wanted his murderer to live as a Jew to pay for the murder he had done. <br /> <br /> German police Otto really knew the name of this ghost because the last thing he did. At the death In Yiddish, "kissing my butt", the police didn't speak Yiddish, so he asked around until he found the meaning 'kissing my butt', leaving such an impression that everyone involved in the killing Learned and remembered the name of the comedian, Genghis Cohn. <br /> <br /> There were many men killed in the jurisdiction of the police commander. And there is no useful clue The man was killed with a knife set that had disappeared from the local butcher. The butcher announced that his knife had disappeared while the commander was in the shop to receive liver and onion sandwiches. Therefore, the police commander was suspected. The first man was killed while making love with the wife of the butcher. But the butcher confirmed that he would be very busy if he killed all the men with his wife. All men were killed immediately after the peak of lovemaking. <br /> <br /> I thought I might be angry over the ghosts of Genghis Kohn if I was killed as he was. It seems that he is very hospitable as if he had had a minor car accident. I can only guess that it is because it is a British film and they are well known for being very polite. He uses some of his content from a stand-alone route, and I don't think it's very funny. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 4 because it was stupid. I think it should be a little more serious. This movie became a murder mystery. (Where did this story come from) and it seems that Genghis should have benefited more than him This movie makes me look a little Jewish culture. But only superficial Do all Jews like sandwiches, liver and onions? Do they all say the word shtoop and meshuganah in the daily vocabulary? Isn't there anything more important than we should know about culture? <br /> <br /> I've watched this movie at the Jewish Community Center in Berkeley, California and I was the only person in the room without me. Fully gray or white (I don't have gray hair or white) There are 18 of us and after this movie, they are about 20 minutes to talk about this. There are two main concerns listed: 1. This movie has too much thought and future generations may not understand the attraction of what happened and 2. When the survivors of genocide are dying I think this second concern is ridiculous and I told them that they do not need to worry because there are many literature there and there are people who like to watch movies like myself, killing 6,000,000 people by very bad people. Will not be forgotten I wrote this last paragraph because they accused me of telling others about my experience that day.
