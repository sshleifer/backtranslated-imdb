What happened to Peter Bogdanovich when the best director, evangelist ... now scrapping the bottom ... Is this the same person as the director "The Last Picture Show"? Here he takes an interesting place. (Even though it's a fartet) and turning it into a bubble gum that loses its flavor when you first bite ... Dunst isn't bad, but Izzard is busy with Chaplin. Was left with their "face" and not because it was suitable for this chapter. Very bad. I would rent "Paper Moon" again.
