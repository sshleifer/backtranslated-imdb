This is the most pointless movie I've ever seen because without the plot and the actors don't seem to care. 90% of this movie doesn't have any plot. I laughed until my rib began to ache. The bit that the old man caught when Robert Duvall was laughing at the level. The filmmaker Noir was not involved in the scene with rain and pointless closeup on the main character. This is a failed attempt to create a horror movie noir and make the audience alienate with the inconsistent scene. This view is based on 'original' by john Grisham. I do not count as one of his books to adapt movies because it does not show doubt and is involved in stories such as movies such as' company 'or' creator Rain'
