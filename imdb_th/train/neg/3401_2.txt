I rented this movie when I heard about an uneasy story about this, not being offered to the Oscars. But after watching it, it's easy to see why it's not. The film is incredibly slow, despite having virtually no plot. <br /> <br /> Plot about a young man trying to cope with his father's death. Mother in what might be Had an accident (This film was never clear about this story) and the way his grandfather used to tell stories about fairies The story has little interest in the story. But very short and there seems to be no point. <br /> <br /> The first fairy story, especially a boy trying to get a magical flower for a dying girlfriend to save her life. But the boy was delayed by tasting the flowers first to make sure there was no poison In a few seconds, he was too late to save his girlfriend-grandfather and declared that the moral was that the boy was too impatient. But it was not reasonable because it was negligence and slowness causing him to fail The perfect metaphor for this movie. <br /> <br /> Sky photography is beautiful. But then Stardus, who launched this year, is a movie about the story filmed in the sky and once again filmed a beautiful picture, and it is much better.
