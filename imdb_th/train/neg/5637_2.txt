I understand that I want to create a movie that is frustrating and different. I understand the opinions of previous investigators that this is a movie that should not be missed. My point is that as soon as this movie ends, my first comment is: "This is what happens when the wealthy princess wants to be a movie star and without talent." ..... She uses her father's money to create a movie that She writes, directs and pays ..... It is clear that close to the movie to know that there is no character development and no direction, such as the beginning, the middle and the end ..... The voyeur is good and frustrated. But what happened, I saw a woman going to the house, searching for pictures, screwing the caretaker, coming out on the side in a very cold night. (Unbelievable) to check the sound and run across her caretaker lover .... the movie ends ....... some one let my education arss unaware? I want to know what the issues are .... What is the director's vision? Why not develop a dead lover? Why is there no background on the moderator? What is the night vision point? What is a car lipstick? Why must be a dead administrator? Tell us about the mental patient / Tom secretly. Why is the urn? Oh, and the lamp is what it should mean. Who is this land? why? Why does the caregiver feel like his home? That side had never been pursued ...... for William Defoe ... I rented this movie because he was in there and was known for the frustrating characters ..... write back. And tell me what I have to learn .. .. I am just a mother in Central America who loves movies .... Chris ....
