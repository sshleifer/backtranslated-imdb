Oops, the sci-fi movie that is boring, painful! And that is especially sad because opening 15 minutes is full of action and full of potential! During the introduction, we followed the neurologist and hired a killer while they chased the doctor who had escaped from the mysterious laboratory with a briefcase filled with top secret files. While he was about to reveal a terrifying and inhumane event that occurred in the lab, he was executed. From that time on, the 'action' will switch between the two locations, the said laboratory and the damaged Senator's country mansion. (Or something) and it became clear that the experiment was completely contrary to interference More like dull, pointless and vague Scientists choose four random people who don't have relatives to live, and it's really important that they say the truth, even though the giant machine will read the contents of their hearts anyway. They all hide the dark secrets from the past and people have to suffer when revealed. But I failed to see that these tests could result in devices that are harmful to humanity. Maybe I miss something, but I doubt the interaction between the patient and the doctor is less interesting because no one has a personality.

Moving from the lab to the villa and vice versa will be specified every time by shooting the location for five seconds. Whether the manufacturer will want internal spaces or they just But assumed that every sci-fi audience was a person who could not notice the change of position by himself Gazing at the abandoned pool with a mansion for ten in just five minutes is quite annoying. The performance of James Best, as praised for his mind, is quite good. But a man cannot help this thing from time to time. Avoid!
