Discovery Channel / Animal Planet must be ashamed This fantasy is modeled after the "Walking with Dinosuars" series. Although this is 100% fantasy, it is presented in the same facts and archeology. Even mixing fantasy dragons with T-rexs and dinosaur extinction Add performances in educational channels instead of sci-fi. It gives genuine air to this list. <br /> <br /> In your own show about 7.5 / 10 times entertainment. But the presentation method that I have to give it 1/10. Don't understand me wrong. I have no problem with fantasy. But the way they bring this thing out is unusual I can see young and slow adults believing that they have found a dragon and this is true. <br /> <br /> I think this makes the series "Walk with Dinosuars" wonderful. With the idea that the fantasy in the mini-series is much cheaper
