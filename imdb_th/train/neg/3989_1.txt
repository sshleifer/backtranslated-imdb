Who in their right heart plays lyrical songs at the same time, do they show the emotional scene between two people? When Flipper confronted his wrong wife in the dressing room, the song with lyrical content was as loud as the conversation, so anyone could hear it. Annabella's scenes were beaten by her father by his fists, lamps and belts. All of these movies are bias cartoons that are rampant against white people. That's truly amazing. Debate by a black woman after Flipper's wife knew he had cheated a white woman as if it were a debate by Ford's debating team. Racism may be possible to endure. But the soundtrack and the sound mix between this 'movie' is too much. There is no understanding of the basic skills of making movies, audio tracks, editing and the great efforts of the great actors trying to make the film drift away. I was really upset with Anthony Quinn, wondering why he accepted the role in this movie - his presence was painful. This is the first movie I saw by this director and it will be my last story.
