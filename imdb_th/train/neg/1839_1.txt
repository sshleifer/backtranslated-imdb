I can't wait to bring this movie to my DVD player when I rent. Then after I started I couldn't wait to take it out of my DVD player. In fact, I watched all the movies. My wife and I wait and wait for funny things to happen. But nothing funny ever The box that is read is really funny. Proof of the movie sounds good. Ben Stiller is a joke. Jack Black is a joke. How can this movie be missed? Well .... it's a miss! This is the most funny "joke" I've ever seen. No one I spoke with thought that it was a little funny. It's just a really weak movie. Believe me. Avoid it .... Avoid it !!
