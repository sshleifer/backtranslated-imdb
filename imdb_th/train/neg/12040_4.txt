I know there is nothing in the Iliad so I can't comment on the authenticity of that story. However, as an independent film, I found it very boring. The fight scenes try to be big and exciting. But they clearly see the CGI <br /> <br /> The performance isn't good and there's no doubt that Brad Pitt was selected to attract women. But he didn't create a good warrior. I was afraid. <br /> <br /> The good point is the design. This film looks good with an impressive landscape and building / castle wall. I like movies that at least try to make the characters sound real. But this movie doesn't seem to care at all. What do we hear in American Scottish English? But what you might expect from a movie about ancient Eastern civilization <br /> <br /> All I do not recommend this movie for the family. It's too long and the child will feel bored. <br /> <br /> For adults, it's ok if you don't care about lack of realism.
