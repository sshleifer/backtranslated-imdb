Spoiler possible. <br /> <br /> Spy Who Shagged Me is a very overrated and over-hyped sequel. It's a lonely star that few people hear. But it is a remarkable traditional style, with a complex sense of humor and sufficient humor, kept in good taste and with great actors. The Spy Who Shagged Me is more advertising and commercial advertising. <br /> <br /> Okay, I'll admit, for the first time I saw this movie, I thought it was very funny. But after watching it twice Or three times you see all the flaws The performance is ok, but Heather Graham can't show. Her performance didn't look incredible, and she wasn't as good as Liz Hurley at first. Those characters that bloom at first (Scott Evil, Number 2, etc.) will be thrown into the background and do not receive many standalone scenes. This movie is full of hijackers. <br /> <br /> In particular, I hate the way they ignore certain scenes in IMOM. When they kill Vanessa at the beginning and have a basil to sit down, he knows. That she has always been a cheat What purpose They killed number 2 at first and now they bring him back without any explanation. This should be a spoof. I don't think any characters will hold a gun in the movie. It goes so far and far away from that point. <br /> <br /> The new character is not very pleasant. All Mini-Me makes my joke a joke. Fat Bastard is just a matter. Excuses for gross humor Overall, there are about two or three good jokes. The rest is tepid or obscured from IMOM. <br /> <br /> If this is the first movie of the series But the series begins with a note of a barren intellect So I can only see this movie if you haven't seen its ancestors because The Spy Who Shagged Me is the last disappointment.
