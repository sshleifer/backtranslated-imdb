Don't waste your time or money on this movie. My roommate rented it because she thought it was another movie called Descent (flicked about some tourists trapped in the cave), so we decided to keep watching it because I thought it wasn't bad. It was I couldn't believe that this movie was created and released to the public. It's so scary as if the accident scene you want to watch. But you can't do it yourself I felt a real emotional scar. It changed from being a semi-budgetary movie, where a college girl was attacked by a boy whom she dating with all the flick flicks. And not really good I started to hate the rape of a woman until I felt bad about him. Almost in conclusion, it is a horror movie that has been rated NC-17 for sure. Don't waste your money. And don't let your children watch
