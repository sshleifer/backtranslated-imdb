I think this is almost all I have to say. I feel the need to explain my actions. In general, I have never seen armor production and I mean in every sense of the word. Although he worked on physical camera But MIC's boom work and other technical aspects of this movie are ridiculous. But it's not the only thing. <br /> <br /> This is different from the classic independent movies recorded by the characters and the great plot. <br /> <br /> It is a crime that for every independent film that has been distributed, such as the Haiku Tunnel, there are 101 other indie films that have died quietly I don't know who the Kornbluth brothers are known to Sony, but that may be my only explanation of how this amateur family production is distributed. I am quite confused as to why they chose it. <br /> <br /> Part of this movie that is interesting is its name. However, the reason is even lower. I hope this review will help a few people who might get the attention of this movie. I've seen many movies in my time and I forgive when in the cinema. But it's too much I will never forget the 'tunnel' for marking an important point in my cinema's life experience. Shame. It's a low point.
