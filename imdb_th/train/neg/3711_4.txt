I never saw a movie trailer when I went to watch a movie. But I use my own judgment based on my friend's opinion. Now I like Chris Rock and his comedy. But this movie is placed on the face. <br /> <br /> During this movie, Rock sent a few jokes. It seems that the movie will combine laughter and love together and it is a failed attempt. The love story in the movie is straightforward (lucky) but it deviates from the movie too much by making the rock serious and gentle. In the end, this movie is the first and most important thing to be a comedian whose laughter should be the first concern. There is nothing in this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is not interesting. Some parts are not continuous. If the supporting actors are funny, then they will not perform well. The two angels from heaven tried to make the two stories dry and dull. The first partner of the rock band is also gentle. If there is one thing they do right, they make the rock look more fun when compared.
