I can't believe that I just spent an hour and a half to watch a weak movie. If there is only one movie that you have to miss, this is a story. <br /> <br /> Robert is a teenager whose father died recently, so he started to travel with anti-social teenagers and Use drugs These things make him more violent and eventually the subconscious blows up ... <br /> <br /> The first thing is that I don't think I will feel the feeling or trace of great joy. In this movie Any single character, if the director saw that what I saw in the last few minutes was a great delight. I must say that it's still not close. <br /> <br /> The use of the movie is Not mature as well Most of the time, I can't see facial expressions from actors and I don't feel that body language is enough to make an impact. Perhaps the team was so tired that he had to repair the camera there to include everything in the settings. Everyone is happy except the audience. <br /> <br /> The story is particularly weak. There are many unrelated scenes and discussions that may be related. But they are so random that you can't pull them all together unless you are the one who wrote it. <br /> <br /> In an hour and a half, you may find that the actual performance is less than 5 minutes and every The time that people walk and talk So I can't comment on the show here. <br /> <br /> Good music in the last few minutes. Maybe this is the only thing that is good. <br /> <br /> I have never screened this movie before. But this movie definitely deserves (At least you laugh when you watch horror movies.) This is a film about when the failed attempt to depict a teenager with a problem with a very disturbing audience. Hope you won't fall into the group.
