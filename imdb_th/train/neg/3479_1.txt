I went to watch this movie at the cinema and I was shocked when I entered the room. Only me and my girlfriend! I shouted that this movie is not good. <br /> <br /> No wonder that this movie is bad. Ben Affleck played as a person who bought the family during Christmas. It is a very predictable story when he falls in love with a girl who hates him. His performance is ok. But for the comedy of the movie, he is not very good. The plot is not good, and the comedian almost doesn't exist. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good points. For example, the family is broken and the mother is very funny. <br /> <br /> I hope this review will stop others from losing money I'm very shy when leaving the room !!!
