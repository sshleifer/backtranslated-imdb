When Rodney Dangerfield approached, he was hilarious in my 5 wives. He wasn't in the mood. The time of one ship is closed. But the best thing for movies The five women who play as wives do not include both actresses. The story is very weak. Even the evidence is still weak. There is a little joke about polygamy. But the situation is not related to other matters in the movie Most movies can be played in the same way, although Rodney's character has only one wife, so the evidence seems to be an old man's imagination rather than an important part of the comedy. Another old man's imagination: We should accept that Rodney's character is a sport. <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller seems to speak in his role only to be a favor to friends. And the rest of the name Actors have to despair of work. <br /> <br /> Strange nods to political correctness in this film do nothing for the movie. For those who like their movies, politically correct, non-PC humor still exists in the first place and apologize that it looks like it hasn't received a point. For those who hate watching movie caves in political correctness, the PC add-in is just an annoying pretense. <br /> <br /> It must be the lightest RS movie as I am. Have seen There is a lively joke and the bedroom scene should create a shocking TV 40 years ago, but it's about it. Maybe it was a man without participation (joking). <br /> <br /> The DVD has interviews that the cast members seem to find the depth and importance in this film and in their roles. I still wonder if they are serious or joking. They seem to be serious. But I always thought that "They have to be joking!" There is also a strange responsibility that points out that since the movie was never named Mormon or the Church of Latter-day Saints, it is not about them. It doesn't matter if this movie is a religion with many wives in Utah and according to Brigham Young <br /> <br /> In short, my wife is disappointing. I hope Rodney will be on the roll. But the best thing I can say for this film is that Rodney looks quite good for men who are pushing 80 times.
