After waking up at 3:30 am in the morning and unable to sleep, I decided that I might be entertained while I was suffering from sleep deprivation. This movie is about HBO and I decided to watch. It's a mistake! <br /> <br /> Here are the plot. (The most likely destroyer if you are interested): A man with a nervous breakdown (Josh Kornbluth) is working as a temporary company. Suddenly he gets the opportunity to "Pitch money" which seems to be a phrase. The favor of this film But with a stable job and a steady income in his hand, Josh decided for a stupid reason he didn't want to do. He hopes to do many small things and his laziness and ambition makes me insulting. His inability to send many "important" letters within the given time period should be hilarious. But it was just a fool. Josh found and tricked the woman, the lawyer, and they slept together on the bed. (Obviously Josh's imagination in real life, this thing will not happen) There are other things going on, but it's too boring to go in now. <br /> <br /> Although the movie This will be charged as a joke. But I only laughed twice The first is Josh Kornbluth's first shot (my initial reaction is one of the hindrances) and the second is when he is in bed with an attractive woman. (Yes) Josh Kornbluth may be the person. That looks as scary as I have seen in my life He is a bald, overweight and bald Jew who should believe that having sex with a beautiful woman. I disagree with Josh's character. He is lazy and uncontrollable and I don't appreciate the failed attempts of humor. Skip it even if your life depends on it.
