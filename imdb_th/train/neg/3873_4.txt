Alicia Silverstone (pre-"Clueless") plays a modern teenager who is obsessed with crime trying to solve the brutal murder of a local woman. Pat Verducci writes and directs this B-flick, which is not Made out especially well However, there is a surprisingly serious heart about the main character. Silverstone attracts attention and succeeds in cutting out attractive young women from here. Supporting actors (Including Kevin Dillon and Michael Bowen) was not bad, even though the violence in the last act ended Not a magic camp But there is nothing special to remember as well. * 1/2 from ****
