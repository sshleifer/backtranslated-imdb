In general, about rated movies with strong actors and intelligent conversations and Dean Martin songs. The problem is Nicholas Cage doesn't have a chemical reaction between him and Cher and they are important love stories. Cher almost did this with her reaction to the accent of the cage movement and uncontrollable body language. Cage never judged in his role. He tried everything he thought and came to be an actor rather than a real person and that is what he wanted in the love story. Cage had a problem with this same type of performance in other roles that had to use the character Jimmy Stewart more. Still still taking these roles, perhaps because he likes that genre. But his energy as an actor did not lend himself even though he had received it better with repeated efforts. He should let this type of role be a less interesting actor that would fully devote to the movie. And use his energy and special abilities in roles and movies that are superior to which he can be himself interesting
