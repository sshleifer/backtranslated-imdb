When this was published, I think this is one of the most vulgar movies ever created. However, thanks to Martin Scorcese and other filmmakers, for example, he made the movie worse than he used to be smarter than this .... but this is a brutal attack on the ears. Hey, I can get it a lot. But it's ridiculous During the first six minutes, I heard the name of the Lord, not half a dozen, and there were countless words. I wonder how many people came out of the theater to watch this thing in 1990? I'm not the only one. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, some actors include Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake. Since this film, Stephen Lang looks like Improving his image, at least playing the role of Jackson in the movie Gods and Generals. Lang's role here is the opposite: perhaps the most worthless person in the movie and the character that falls in love at the end of the movie. br /> <br /> Sad depression Obscene, offensive startup: This is just part of the adjectives that people use - even some liberal critics - to describe this novel, which is written in an even worse. Of course, some well-known critics, Libs, all admire this movie. However, they are the only ones. Most critics are disgusted as well as people who pay almost all of the money. Unbelievable that anyone can praise the dirt and garbage like this. <br /> <br /> Trust me in this story: There are no good and pleasing characters in this movie. This is a terrible and cruel movie: one of the worst things of "Modern era", that is, if you do not see child abuse, drugs, prostitution, teenagers and others - two hours that are nothing but violence and ordinary people that are evil. Nevermind Thank you.
