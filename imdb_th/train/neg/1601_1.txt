The stereotypical image of the slasher flick is too short as it should be. Gerrit Graham, Michael Lerner, Zane Busby The crippled people are very funny and every punch line is good. The silent torpedoes arrived quickly and almost everyone flattened like the squeezed grapes. The musical numbers contribute to the boredom that occurs throughout and throughout the movie. Another disadvantage is the totally awkward environment within the walls of abandoned secondary schools. Avoid this and find one of the truly funny movies of "Lamphun", such as "Golddiggers National Lamphun" - MERK.
