Many promises and nothing more. The actor is starring in Hong Kong standards. But man, oh man, a man with a bad smell, no matter? It doesn't matter. What action will be compensated like most HK action scenes? That action is terrible, repetitive and sparse? The opening of the Dragon Dynasty to this point is immense and wonderful, and is regarded as a classic movie in Asia. This is damage. They tried to quarrel with two actors from Infernal Affairs, but they couldn't make life a separate script. There are two or three lines of dialogue that are cut between each line and there is no continuity in what the characters say. Do you almost feel that they are the only person who is running and not interested in other characters? Is Michael Biehn made of real wood? Sammo Hung uses the double stun? No way. Yes, stay away.
