I'm watching on pink (Serbian television station) and I have to say that this is a nonsense. Shallow does not have any acting, too sloppy. I mean, who made this series? <br /> <br /> This is a stupid effort The studio agreed. This movie was excellent in 1994 when it came out. But in the series? <br /> <br /> Sometimes you can see how stupid lines are in the character's speech. I mean, are they paying people who write like that? Actually, there are people who are involved with the studio. This is not a scifi. <br /> <br /> This movie is a blow to the set.
