I must say that this is a terrible movie because of the fact that when you watch this movie in the guide, it will be identified as a documentary. As I watched it, I started laughing, thinking about myself. Is this guy really expecting me to believe that this is true? So I had to search for it and now see it as a movie. But now, since it's not a documentary, now it's a movie with bad performances. So no matter how, it is not good. Actually, I didn't make it to the end. I have to close it I am a New York police officer and feel that someone is trying to trick people into thinking that this is a documentary with the intention of making money from a bad day for me. So I spent a little personal time. Maybe I was blind and this wasn't as bad as I thought. Everyone has their own opinions.
