Sorry, but I will destroy both the plot and the end for you, hoping to avoid the failure of the holidays as I face. Father died and Mother asked Santa to write a letter to bring him back to the family on Christmas Day ... and Santa did it. Father is a cheerful, healthy person and doesn't realize that he is dead. Everything ends with sweet syrup. <br /> <br /> But as a parent who has just looked at my five years, losing his best dog friend, it's a horror flick. Now my son believes that what he has to do to bring his friends back is to ask Santa! Do not underestimate the child's intentions - there is not a lot of persuasion to convince him that it's just a movie and his dog won't come back on Christmas. It is difficult to watch the joy just to know that he will face a new loss on Christmas Eve. <br /> <br /> Make you shame in the name of every believer who lost. Lose the person you love recently. It's hard enough to deal with a single loss for a child. But there is a certain desire that we should not show the possibility
