Be warned This movie is a mess, it's a disaster. Don't waste time on this. I warn you. <br /> <br /> Acting, stories, conversations, music ... basically everything is superior. It's annoying and ridiculous. It makes me want to throw up (if the conversation / performance / story doesn't do it, everyone is shot). You will feel like watching a funny movie. The problem is that funny parts can't be funny. To show a movie story, you can feel that everything is just trying. WAAAAY is too difficult - but it has never been successful. Almost every shot will be awakened. But what! This movie feels like a student movie. It is not surprising that they filmed this in HD, because it would cost the filming of this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are funny or like a bad show Full editing Everything that is forced in your face. Oh and I talk about bad performances? (Actually it's not the fault of all actors - it's the director!) I guess you like this movie. <br /> <br /> I have to watch this story in class. I will close it immediately if possible. If you still can't tell now, I hate this movie. It makes me want to throw up and get my time back ... At least I don't have to pay for this garbage. <br /> <br /> Jeff Goldblum Do you know ... Men from Jurassic Park / Independence Day is in this movie But he is confident that he will be depressed since then - taking a role in the film, such as this disaster
