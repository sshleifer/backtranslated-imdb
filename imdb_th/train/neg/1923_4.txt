Ironically, the story of Dr. Seuss, which focuses on the Christmas trade, should be one of the most marketed and successful commercials during the holiday season. The general essence of Ron Howard's adaptation is the Grinch and Christmas disaster caused by early childhood events and the Whos themselves are in the materialism of the season. Help Cindy Lou who? This film caused the enthusiasm and ambition to capture the strangeness and confidence of the story of Seuss, but the result is a film that is ridiculed and never packed the emotions of Chuck Jones's animated film. Jim Carrey plays an important role in his performance as the Grinch Demon. But whether it is a conversation, a pause or a story that is not related to him at the beginning of the change from the terrible bitterness There are wonderful images and makeup is amazing. But apart from technical success, there is one or two missing elements. <br /> <br /> Complexity? <br /> <br /> Spirit? <br /> <br /> Or maybe Jones was able to start out well in his 25-minute cartoon that Howard fell in a movie that felt three hours long. Howard Carey and the team are all capable and talented. But what seems like a winning combination is weak and pondering in the final product. If you have to watch a long version, rent a video in Jones's animated version and you can see that the bigger and the glitzier isn't always better. I gave this film three cans of Who-Hash from five stories.
