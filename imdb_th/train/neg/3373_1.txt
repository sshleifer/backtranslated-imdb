I'm lucky enough to see A Chorus Line when it comes to my city .. I'm younger .. but it's a great play .. so someone will please tell me why in heaven named them Have to make a movie for it .. and why is Michael Douglas ??? He is not suitable for the script .. This movie sucks a really big time !!! <br /> <br /> My advice is not to rent this movie .. Save your money for better things like "Cats "....
