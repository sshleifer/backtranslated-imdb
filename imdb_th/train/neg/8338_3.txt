This movie is very important because I recommend that I consider this: Sometimes you may want to be sick ... Sometimes you want to have symptoms ... Sometimes you may want Goldfield Syndrome ... that is like that. Don't remember this boring movie ... and above all, you don't remember Adam "superfluos" Sandler ... Sometimes you can ... rent another movie ... <br /> <br /> My vote? 3 out of 10 my suggestions? If you're not a fan of boring romantic actors or Adam Sandler (... it's a joke that doesn't have Adam Sandler's boyfriend ... I want to hope. ) Help yourself ... Is there someone to help with? Drew Barrymore ... maybe
