I would like to say that unlike other people who do not like this movie and find it impossible to understand that I fully understand what it is .. the very unremitting efforts to Planning <br /> <br /> I don't like to throw this word around, but in this case it's very compatible. The first director presented the content in a very "arrogant" way and the worse the discrete It is inconsistent in presenting the content in a messy mess, causing us to think that the director is too drunk to remember which scene came first and is arrogant for 2 hours when they expect us of it. /> I respect the surreal movie for what it is. (The creation of stories around the world that are not bound to real life), but nothing beyond the truth about placing the story in the normal era and setting up the most important modern world is not able to attract audiences. But more than that, it's just a discontinuous event. The most precise way to describe this movie viewing experience is like watching a story. Maybe it's a very good story as it is in the book. But was discouraged by the fact that the camera didn't seem to capture the necessary moments and tied the way together. <br /> <br /> Let's compare. The quirky movie theater compares Gaspar Noe's "Seul contre tous" with this. He gives us a story that is very engaging and deeply engaging. This movie has no intellectual education, and while it is very stylistic in a separate presentation, the director has left the most important art of good storytelling and what we leave is an event that is almost unrelated. <br /> <br /> Yes, of course. It is possible to understand things .... to the point. But as I said before, the audience will go to the stage where they say "Who cares? "It played out like Simple story of a guy who went to the supermarket and buy groceries regulations. Despite the murder, it is not interesting. Too many people today will give a high score to what they can't understand or understand easily because they are afraid of being stupid and in every way, this movie tries to make the audience look stupid. <br /> <br /> If you have too much time in your hand, please watch this movie, taking into account what I am talking about. It is a story from a book that can be presented in a more effective form and that is my most important reason.
