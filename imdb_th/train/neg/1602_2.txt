Anyone who thinks that this movie is not appreciated by its comic genius will have to smoke with two stoneware in this movie. This film doesn't get too low ... it's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> There shouldn't be a comparison between this movie with The Naked Gun or Airplane. Good and funny Reunion levels are not those things. The sad thing is that it has this potential. (Good actor, good story) but good jokes are not great The scene that should be funny, more annoying than amusing, stoner, vampire, blind girl ... not funny <br /> National Lampoon has created a really good movie (Animal House, Vacation) but this is not one of them. I expect more from John Hughes.
