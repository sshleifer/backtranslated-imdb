I know I have added comments. But I just want to clarify something ... <br /> <br /> I'm not an old fog from the Baby Boom model that grew up glued to a b / w image at the flick of Phil Silvers, Jackie Gleason and others. <br /> <br /> Bilko is 20 years old before I was born. But I am happy to discover the courtesy of Bilko of Phil Silver in BBC2. I wonder if I will enjoy Steve Martin's imitation or not if I have not seen or heard about Phil Silvers - I don't know - Maybe I have <br /> <br /> other reviewers who think that this movie has the value of '10'. Accept that they didn't see the original. I wish you to spend 21 minutes of your life watching at one time. If after watching the original Ernie, Colonel Hall, Ritzig & Emma, ​​Duane Doberman, Henshaw, Dino, Flashman, Zimmerman, Mullin et al, you still think that Steve Martin's movie doesn't have anything above '2' - I'll give You see the pint ....
