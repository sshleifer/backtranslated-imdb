When I sat down to watch this movie, I actually expected it because this story was quite complicated. Using football to shoot discs for complexity is an interesting way. Yet, unfortunately, despite the courage to deal with the controversial issues, the cultural organization between Muslims and Western cultures increases conflict, generation and prejudice against gays / lesbians, allowing you to vote with Relieved quite easily. This film made me feel that the creators had too big a job for them to manage, trying to deepen. Then they organized. /> <br /> o to manage, however, this is not <br mean. This film is not good directly because it represents a convincing and amusing conflict. This film was successful in participating and having fun in this story. But as mentioned above, the author seems to spin himself a little too deep. This leads to the behavior of unrealistic characters at the end to confront the increasing conflict. By releasing the ball at the time the creator can demonstrate the ability to bring the movie to the next level of appreciation. <br /> <br /> Although the film doesn't really try to be a profound drama. The setting has a lot of potential in the plot. It becomes a disappointment when "the ball drops". This way, the movie moves from being a good comedy and reflecting the clich√© that became ridiculous at the end. Happy There is nothing left in Hollywood like the ending. Therefore, although the story is interesting and can be edited with many montages But can't help Personally, I'm close to shouting that "Completed !!" At the screen, <br /> <br /> Have a good performance in the movie and the two young women characters have a good time. So their parents and other characters. However, the handsome Irish coach is an embarrassing actor who makes this film quite realistic. He didn't look very satisfactory. But involved himself even though doing good, which caused the close conflict between the girls to look a little tense. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 4 because it was an interesting story and they searched A good perspective on accessing stories from Scripts and actors have very good characters that allow viewers to get to know themselves or others. If left unattractive, I will give this movie 7 or 8 easily. If you like this movie, I will recommend the movie "East is East" which I think is good, if not Better visibility of cultural conflicts as well as fun and participation.
