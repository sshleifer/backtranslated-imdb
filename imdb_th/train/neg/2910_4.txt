The highlight of this movie for me is Tom Hanks. As Mike Sullivan, he was screened out of the genre and showed that he was able to handle the informal (for him) role. Hank is a good person in the movie - someone you like, admire and take root. Sullivan is definitely not a good person. It is true that in the context of this film, he meets a nobleman - his purpose is to avenge the murder of his wife and the youngest son. Yet he became a gangster and murderer before those killings. So Hank has a role that I don't expect in him and he pulls it out well. <br /> <br /> The good work of Hank, though I can't call it. Is a fun movie After the best debut, I will explain it as a mystery. (It was not clear for me while it was going on) It became a very sad film about the complex relationships that Sullivan developed into a gang (Paul Newman), who was the mob leader. And tried to raise his own two sons and make them "clean" to speak alone from his business After the eldest son witnessed the murder, the gang tried to kill him so that he could silence his son (and his mother) and from Sullivan and his oldest son. (Mike Jr.) escaped. It became a bondage movie of a strange father / son. <br /> <br /> Although it ended with a rather hopeful note. (At least in the overall context of the story) It's really dark throughout that emotion. Many scenes shot in darkness and severe rain I have to confess that while I admire the performance of Hank, the movie overall didn't pull me in. 4/10
