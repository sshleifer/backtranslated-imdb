Watching the first 30 minutes of Sands of Oblivion gave me high hopes. Looks like I'm a cheaper model mummy. The setting was promising in Cecil B. DeMille in the 1920s, making the compositions of his ten commandments. It seems that in using real Egyptian artifacts for this film, they unleash an ancient and terrible evil. (They're not always?) Recognizing what DeMille received, the entire set was buried instead of the usual practice of tearing it down. Hope that evil will be buried with it all the time Then we changed to the present where the team tried to dig the site. (The first mistake of the movie But those modern costumes were expensive and this was a sci-fi movie.) The first sight we received from the Anubis monster was very good and it was a series that they used to try and not effect. A wonderful CG, then the body starts counting This is a movie that goes south for me. Reaction to the fact that people are dying in horrible and strange ways. When they realized that the evil of the ancient times was once again released and in a period of fun to kill humans and women who acted in the stock, what do? They stopped normally with "People who know the truth But never tell anyone "after receiving important information, they share with the companions who dig the site? No, they stopped at the hotel to freshen up and talk a little. In fact, I wasn't the most motivated person. But if I knew that the demons from ancient Egypt were in a loose state and killed everyone in the eyes and would follow after me After a pointless and pointless middle part, they travel to destroy the normal Anubis monster by racing in the sand dunes and shooting with a rocket launcher while standing beside the phosphorus bomb. For a sci-fi movie, it's superior to the normal shit that they bring out, which doesn't say much. What disappointed me is that this may be more if someone writes a good script for it.
