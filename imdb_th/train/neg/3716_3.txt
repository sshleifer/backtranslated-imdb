The main character, Lance Barton, was killed and ascended to heaven before time. When Heaven learns about mistakes, he will receive the dead body of the dead man, both old and white. <br /> <br /> The young black man in the white man's age still behaves like a black man. Young may be a joke. If you see it done by an old white actor In this movie, I remind myself many times: "Chris Rock is probably an old white man." <br /> <br /> Not all ideas were played as intended: "Illusion" was not passed. Well and Unbelievable love story The truth that you see is that Chris Rock is shown as a black man because all the old white people who see it should appear in a small scene only. "Suspend unbelief"
