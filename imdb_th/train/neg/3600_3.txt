Questions for every woman that you are there: If a man you have never met before will call you accidentally and still do so during the most unintended moments, you will be intrigued by him or shocked ? Yes, that's what I thought, so I couldn't swallow Marti Gerrard's thoughts at the attention of Connor Hill. <br /> <br /> ***** Spoiler ***** *** **> <br /> This is a very stupid story.

Marti Gerrard is a downhill skier.
