Who is Bettie Page? Of course, I didn't find it while watching this movie. From what I have gathered from other sources, Page has a great need during the post-World War II era as the "mischievous" image queen, and that's what this film shows. Although I never knew Betty But the woman Her childhood in Tennessee is a combination of Christian missionary training and a vile home life that is only a hint. This film selects her personal life and goes down to the purpose of this film, a "mischievous" image. The characters are recommended and abandoned within a few frames. But there are frames after Bettie's frame in her spiked bras. Bettie in her belt and stockings. Bettie is a slave ... etc. The film is screened in black and white in color every time Ms. Page visits Miami Beach. Then go back to the gray shades of life in New York where we go. Gretchen plays Bette as one of the weakest women you've ever met. When Betty told a friend that she missed being a high school student in her high school by getting A- instead of A, can only guess that there are two students in the senior class. The most interesting part of this movie is the photos that "Nasty" of Mrs. Page in 2007 is really sad that seeing a woman tied her hands like a pig on a spit. I'm not sure if this film is not well written or if there is a crazy editor. Cutting small pieces I would like to recommend it as a source for those who study the history of odd underwear.
