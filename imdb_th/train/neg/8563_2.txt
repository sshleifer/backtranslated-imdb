It's like what the name of this topic says. The only impression I received from this film is that Marlee Matlin's character is always angry, insulted, and pathetic. The first day of her character and the character of William Hurt, in which they dumb dance. Overall, I tried to finish watching the movie four times and I slept four times. I will watch that movie with the same intention ... to overcome my problems with insomnia because what I do is make me sleep a sweet dream.
