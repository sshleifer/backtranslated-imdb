I commented on this when I first debuted and gave a review. "The thumb in the middle" by observing that I will benefit more than the first question I have seen all six episodes until now in June 2006 and as a big fan of Batman for the rest of my life I can speak without hesitation: this program has the most crap. <br /> <br /> Everything is wrong, everything gets past, just animations and awesome designs. The stories are ridiculously confusing, and there is no clear character development or attention from this wreck writer. Any content to any stories /> <br /> For the purpose of <br god .. is it just me, or a joke in every episode? Gotham is the justice system in the revolving door? Or again, it is just a lack of complete interest in the writer to use any effort in other villains (see "No Character Development" above) <br /> <br /> and to make the story Worse, every tale porridge is the same 3 part recipe. <br /> <br /> 1) Joker gives confidence to the people. <br /> <br /> 2) Jokers head around the city. <br /> <br /> 3) Batman saves that day. <br /> <br /> Pfeh <br /> <br /> There was a time when I saw that it wasn't funny. The name escapes me, but the villain is the evil Cluemaster ... "Think Thank Thunk" episode by showing the question. That is the worst Batman story I've ever seen, heard or read. Yes, worse. "I have Batman in my basement." <br /> <br /> I can't say what I am. Feeling that this item is because it might conflict with ToS but start with "B" and Rhymes with "fastardization" Thank God for the existence of Timm / Dini / etc. Bat-Entertainment era Coming back from the era of Fox and Kids WB. The good thing and I should know this thing shouldn't last forever. Unfortunately.
