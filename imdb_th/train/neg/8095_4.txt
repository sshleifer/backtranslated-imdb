The beginning of Wolfe's original novel, which is the focus of the whole story, is that things happen because of the calculated advantage carefully. The goal is to survive in a specific life style. This novel is full of malice. The only relationship that caused a real emotional feeling was between Sherman and his daughter, Campbell, and that was just a touch. In addition, everyone went out in what he could do to spread money or to make himself insulting. <br /> <br /> Wolfe was criticized for affecting every character and every social part. Of New York City. His answer is denial. In the end, he lived in New York and was a neighborhood improvement committee and other admirable organizations. The qualifications needed in his personal history to deny that he didn't like New Yorkers. (Wolfe has a Ph.D. in American education from Yale and does not exist). The weakness that should be is what makes this novel memorable. No one is good. And Sherman McCoy broke up as a professional protester for social justice. This movie left the whole story and set the moral framework in the story that was not suitable. Wolfe does his homework. This novel has its roots in reality. Not all events are possible. But believe it thoroughly Wolfe may be a great cultural anthropologist - he knows how to enter the system and record its details. <br /> <br /> Yeah, any one of us may find ourselves as a sheriff. Man and his beloved South Bronx, who were threatened by two black children and escaped after colliding with one of them. That scene was exquisitely transferred from print to celluloid. <br /> <br /> But after that scene, the movie didn't seem to trust the audience and sometimes became crazy about trying to spell his message. The vague message is that <br /> <br /> Sherman may accidentally hit some children and be arrested while he is in the novel. But he will not, as soon as he is released from prison, returns to his expensive condo, appears shotgun and Began shooting on the ceiling with it while he was moving In what should be a funny scene, plaster, ceiling, fell across the party guests and they hurried to cry. It will not happen. This film has left an incredibly detailed reality in the dust. Wolfe's feelings, which were the work he had actually lost What we get is an amazing and ridiculous noisy scene that does nothing but awaken the audience. The same empty scene cried out for the truth of Wolfe. <br /> <br /> This film also failed because it stuffed a lot of sins and redeemed as an entertainment story of a devastator. moral Here we see "Don Juan in Hell" at the Opera House We received a lecture about the redemption from the poet with the aid We saw a lot of mistakes in Sherman. The black judge who taught from the throne and made a final speech about how we all have to start performing again. A journalist felt sorry for Sherman after turning him into a sacrificial lamb. And the happy ending that Sherman got down from breaking the law with a silly smile The scene in the movie is like a clown hat on the elephant's head. The circus band <br /> <br /> Not only movies But creating a boring and unconventional point But it is exaggerated as if the audience cannot absorb the details. <br /> <br /> Isn't it a show? Bad direction This movie is not bad at all. And photography is also quite good, including two exciting images that are the gargoyles of the Chrysler Building and Concordia Landing It's an incomplete script. <br /> <br /> In the first half of this film, roughly okay with the idea and action. It holds little details from Sherman's novel and Judy, a dog named Marshall. Who will be a dog named Marshall? It loses almost all of the focus in the second half, and in general it is almost worth it to watch. <br /> <br /> Wolfe's sarcasm can be a disgust. Many people know alas. Writers and producers do not have the courage to pick it up and make New York's interesting educational opportunities.
