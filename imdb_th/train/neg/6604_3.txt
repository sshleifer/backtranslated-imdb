The first one is the best The second one sucks because the conversation is terrible. Although the story is not bad (In fact, the whole story is good and bad). In this movie, I take medicine a few times. I know that Jackie Chan is an excellent martial arts expert. But it's not a good actor in Rush Hour 2, Chris Tucker, too. It's not good and Zhang Zie, I can say a few lines. (But that is according to her script) all the characters in it are not that good But something I like in Rush Hour 2 is always less action and sex scenes. I know that Jackie Chan didn't do good for him.
