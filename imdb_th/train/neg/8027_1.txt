I watched this movie all the way, and that wasn't easy. It's boring, not playing well, and in almost every detail that has been stolen from "BLAIR WITCH PROJECT" that you can't believe that the creator is serious about this. More difficult to believe that this "product" is made on VHS and DVD. <br /> <br /> So if you want to watch horror movies, just watch "Scream" but if you want to laugh out. Loud and having a good time watching some children run through the forest screaming each other and showing their inability to see the dark areas
