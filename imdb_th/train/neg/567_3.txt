This movie is one of the most scary movies that Jon Bon Jovi played? He's a singer, isn't that an actor? Does he kill vampires with his guitar? Then the plot is scary? Oh my God, this movie really sucks. In the end, the queen of vampires played by the eternal vampire Arly Jover (Blade) surrounded by vampires. But when the "miracle" killer arrived, only 4 vampires left !! What happens to 10-15 vampires? They run out in the sun ??? Then the grand "in the end" when Bon Jovi waved his head with a shotgun ??? That's really "no" in "Buffy the vampire slayer" in the 100 episodes, not the only vampire killed by A SHOTGUN ??? This is really a lack of initiative!
