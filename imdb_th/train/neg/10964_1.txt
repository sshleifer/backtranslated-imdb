I was unfortunate enough to see this Sidewalk film festival. The sidewalks were a disappointment and the film was the last nail in the coffin. Being a big fan of Lewis Carroll's 'Alice' book, I'm very excited about this premier movie, which makes it uncomfortable to watch. Usually I'm enthusiastic about modern storytelling if they are well treated. Usually, it's interesting to see the similarities between the past and the present in familiar subjects. Unfortunately, this movie is not a modern storyteller and has more pop culture distortions. The adaptation of the original character looks young and often proves to be horribly annoying. It may not help anything. The actors are not as good as well. Most performances look ridiculous, which I think may be due to bad directions or attempts to create a bad chapter. I didn't laugh all the time of the movie. All jokes have been obsolete to avoid current events that are sure to lose their pain over time. In fact, the only feature of this movie is the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is traveling to meet Alice. But even so, the score is a mimic of Danny Elfman's work. In addition, I must say that changing the croquet game into a fanatical dance is terrible. No doubt that this movie is a low point. <br /> <br /> It's funny. Didn't see this movie After my conclusion, I was truly angry.
