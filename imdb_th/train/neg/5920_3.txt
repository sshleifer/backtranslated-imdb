abnormal? Yes! <br /> <br /> Unusual settings for American movies in the war, New Zealand <br /> <br /> Unusual content, four sisters and their relationship with American soldiers from the bear. Illegitimate child of Another son of a senator who died in seven other marines (one by one) before she was killed by her husband, POW New Zealander. <br /> <br /> Unusual to see enough. Newman delivers bad performances His memorable role as Rocky Graziano in "Somebody Up There Loves Me" is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Unusual for two "good" stars Joan Fontaine and Jean Simmons for Let yourself be very small in the movie. <br /> <br /> It's unusual for me to pay attention to writing this poor movie review!
