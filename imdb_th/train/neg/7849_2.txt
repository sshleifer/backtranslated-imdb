The movie was picked up after many years, rebuilt by setting up an electronic spy device in the desert where the first film attack occurred. The crew were killed shortly before the group of soldiers in the training session appeared to find people around them. You can fill out the rest. <br /> <br /> This is a picture of salary. There seems to be no passion for everyone's performances or anyone behind the camera. This is a movie created for money and nothing else. At a certain level, this is likely to be effective. It should be more frightening in the south. (The National Guard demanded that some people stay in the swamp) but not much. In most cases, you can blame the unbelievable script by Wes Craven, which hit the same goal over and over again. Add chaos to the fact that the direction is boring and the continuous scene setting is not as shiny as it is to eliminate the tension in any scene. <br /> <br /> It's not bad. This. Let me put my feelings into the context: the reason I see this movie is because the multiplex in the local drunk and ran this movie instead of the kid flick the Last Mimzy and I want to see. What makes me cry (I mean the movies are very similar - he said ironically) I believe that this movie will only make the last Mimzy enthusiast.
