With a tendency to repeat himself, the Wenders have been consistently disappointed since he hit it big too. 'Paris Texas' <br /> <br /> 'Land of abundance' is no exception. Considering the fact that I expect to receive mediocre movies before I join, Wenders ambitions always seem to make him better. It is used to scrape now. His movies are tough and festive. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if I watch comedy that mocks Central America or thriller. The results of Diehl's characters are all predictable. Wender's assertion in setting multiple scenes with some rock songs is also very annoying. He conceals the hole in his role and direction by making a jazz scene. <br /> <br /> I'm sure many people will find this movie important and rhythmic. But in truth In a bad direction <br /> <br /> The interesting thing that Wenders acknowledges that while doing 'Paris, Texas'. He received a lot of help from Sam Sheppard and the script. Yes, that's the best wenders and he should understand now that he wants a good playwright His movie in the last 15 years + is a mess.
