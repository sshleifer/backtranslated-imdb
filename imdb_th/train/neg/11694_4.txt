So 'thinner' ... Oh .. Steven Bachman (Read Steven King) tells a story about a man who received a dessert from a gypsy senior who had just killed him. Don't know why I'm not more fun than I have. I guess what really makes me distracted is the actor. I mean, who is the leader? Robert John Burke Who is he? And when you hear someone loud, please stop hiring Joseph Mantegna for the role of the Italian mafia. And while we are here, every mafia must have a mother to cook pasta? The only good show that was done here was under 10 pounds makeup. Michael Constantine as a gypsy senior He is quite good But the rest I make you all "A better actor ..."
