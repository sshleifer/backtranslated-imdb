Great! Great! Great! no I do not like it Obviously, the intent of this film is: to track the wheel and deal with "The animator and the shakeer" who is the filmmaker In some cases, these people represent themselves as people other than what they are. I do not want a film that tells me that some people in the film industry are shallow. I think I'm wrong because I actually expect something like "Roman Holiday". <br /> <br /> I'm not a filmmaker or studying movies. But I think this film consists of a set of 'two shots' (in the main) that the actor (!) Has been accompanied by plotting a loose line and they have to talk the conversation. Henry Jaglon claims that he, along with Victoria Foyt actually wrote a screenplay But the impression is that the actor who knows the general direction of the film has a unique and unsuccessful dialogue. In this case, when Ron Silver said something that didn't flow in the conversation (And I won't go back to it!) And Gretas Kochchi laughed loudly, even though they should There will be serious conversations because Silver's words are not sequitur. You will also be impressed by an actor trying to 'go wrong' with other actors intentionally and destroy his concentration. / Another example is when the manufacturer informs Silver "Bring the document & *% # @ # ^ ^" (3 times). The money seems to be lost. I've seen another movie that looks like a drama adaptation training set, and that's too scary. <br /> <br /> The fact that Jaglon can attract Greta Scacchi (no stranger to Australia) Ron Silver, Anouk Ami and Maximilian Schell suggest that it is 'Slow News Week' For them, Peter Bogdanovich looks like 'what-the-hell-am-I-do-here' on his face all the time and I expect to hear him say: "Look, I'm a person. Directing and scriptwriters - not actors "- which will not need to be specified! Faye Dunaway seemed to be interested in promoting Liam and her son. In addition to delivering conversations, mobile camera jerks become annoying, even if it is true - while I suspect that the "natural" dialogue is - and the interest in the employer becomes an interest in youth who follow along. The group tried to interpret themselves to be shot. At least approaching Cinema Verite in order to sing along with the annoying French song while I use the mute button to do it for 90 minutes that is generally disappointing. <br /> <br /> I think we Avoid movies that stop doing this. Trying to see the value in this film, which has little credit in order to prove a great level that is misunderstood as a misunderstanding. There is nothing that is avant-garde. It is not a work of art. But not as a documentary as well I know it's a note. But the real test is whether it's fun or not. I'm bored from my skull! It has one redeeming feature: it pronounced 'Cannes' correctly, so I gave it 3/10.
