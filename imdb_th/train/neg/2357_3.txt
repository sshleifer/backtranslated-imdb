Hope this will be the last nightmare This is the epitome of good things gone. Okay, still have fun to get. But in the most ordinary sense, Rachel Talalay was there at the time of this franchise in the production team. I don't know what you're thinking. But this breakdown came with human video games and the appearance of guests by Tom and Rosanne Anne! I hope I know what you are thinking when you write / direct this disappointing junk. She also tried to distract the audience from the fact that this movie is nothing more than a popular popcorn movie, rather than showing similarities to horror. Not good glasses? And you reach them! It's equivalent to you just spent $ 9.00 making me rich. This is 10 cents. Now you don't feel special! Sorry for me, it doesn't make me feel special. <br /> <br /> And Freddy's has another face. This one is the worst. I think All the beautiful art that went into his "look" in the previous movie was replaced by a set of prostheses that were significantly cheaper and with less detail. He seemed ... less than the victim. That he should be and he seems to have skin symptoms Changing the make-up of the actors so far in that series is at the same level as leading actors. But wait! They do that and do that. So I think it's not important. But it's important for me Freddy is no longer scary. He is just ... a low-rent monster like Leprechaun. <br /> <br /> It's more ... horror than the classic horror story in Serie. This Full of things you can hope that the writer thinks is one of the intellect and the wise repartee wise (sadly it is short for both accounts) <br /> <br /> So there is nothing to say except grab a popcorn And preparing to laugh because there is no terrible or suspicious moment in this movie. <br /> <br /> Give 3.2 / 10 points from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend:
