OK, so I was the original fan of the Wicker Man and I often disliked British movies by the American people. So why did I make myself face the most painful experience in the cinema? I'm not a fan of Nicolas Cage and I might have some crazy moments. This movie is awesome! The bit at the beginning of the collision / fire is not related to the movie at all, and the female police know where Edward is going. So a bit at the end when the two girls go to the mainland. All things will be checked. The history behind Wickler's men was not really explored - and I think that setting up in America didn't help all the pagan themes. This movie is slow and without atmosphere or doubt. I must say that the best bit is correct at the end when Nicolas Cage goes up in the flames! I am in great need to see the manuscript again now to cleanse my frustrated soul. I can't emphasize how disappointing this movie is. Don't see it if you: <br /> <br /> A) I don't like American movies, new stories from England.
