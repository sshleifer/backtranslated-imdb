Omega codes are a form of movie inconsistency. There are a few good performances. (But with little value), mainly by two prophets and Rostenberg that appear only once and without lines Otherwise, the performance is certainly not good. The storyline is quite weak and there are only parts that are based on the suspicious interpretation of the scriptures. Of course not one of the best years.
