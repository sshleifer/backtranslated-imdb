It's quite difficult to believe that movies from this book can be successful in increasing the horror! The story is planned and unbelievable .. Start by placing the guilt on the little child to help suppress her pain! Then we have a conspiracy behavior of at least six people and there may be many others. (Including monks) related to what is a crime everywhere Next, we have a wife who seems to be sitting on a ferry from being happy when compared to following the footsteps. Koow's mother who is not very satisfied and receives help, help, help and support from a group of politically correct friends! Moving the scenes from off the coast of South Carolina does not help, although it helps the filmmakers to have a limited budget. The beautiful buildings, which are the dwellings of the temples, seem to be unsuitable for small islands. Enough to need a golf cart and a small ferry service like this My favorite Kim Batsinger is thin and thin in this film and her hair is in the next decade. There is also no chemical between her and one of the men. I do not like this book thoroughly. But read every book The movies that I recite must go out every time there is too much Scottish music. If you don't like unbelievable stories, wooden performances, a mixture of religion / myth / fable, my advice is to skip this chapter. Oh, and maybe a little criticism about abusing But a caring father doesn't have a life jacket on a small child on a small boat? The best part of this movie is the scenery.
