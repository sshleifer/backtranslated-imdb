The problem of THE CONTRACTER is summarized by the opening scene. The CIA wants foreign terrorists dead to contact the black killer James Dial. The terrorists appeared at the Old Bailey court in London, asking why they wanted the terrorists to crash if he would spend the rest of his life. In prison? He will leave the system in one way. CIA didn't have a chance before he was arrested? If by chance he was convicted of killing him There is no logical reason to kill people who are going to live in the highest security prison. <br /> <br /> Due to the location, story, the audience may choose to ignore the hole of the fire plot. The participants of the Dial were killed by gun bullets and taxis as they drove the car, but Dial tried to escape, so the police were close enough to shoot someone. But is it too far to arrest someone from a car accident? The plot of the movie is about ignorance. Later found that the police inspector pointed the gun that he said "This airport was surrounded by weapons coppers" but Dial managed to escape very easily without explanation. The whole movie fooled viewers by relying on things that were never explained. Which includes an important character called Emily Day. Why did you help Dial even if he was an escape? Your guess is as good as mine. <br /> <br /> This is a bad thriller and not being a "big name" actor. Wesley Snipe has been selected. Is a movie star But killed his career by starring in unreasonable movies Charles Dance also appeared in large Hollywood productions such as LAST ACTION HERO and ALIEN 3. But again, he is best known for his direct acting on DVD in Today, the likes of Lena Headey may become a great player in the cinema. But they failed to bring THE CONTRACTER back to work
