This movie is boring, characters and situations are unrealistic. Unbelievable. The action is hilarious. This movie is very busy. It seems that when the action song begins to show, the most impressive talent is in progress. That voice was dubbed by Mr. McGregor or steven, singing too much and it changed his voice. There is a way to interact too much in this movie and a terrible performance on behalf of everyone. This film is a great sleep therapy. The fight is ridiculous. The effect of changing the eye shape on the evil addicts is appropriate. The main villain is a joke and his character develops badly. The main villain is used to describe the story through questioning. He will throw a random plan in, for example (spoiler) "CTX (his drug designer) is going to be in the tap water" which is not mentioned in conclusion Again in the movie This film is recommended to pass.
