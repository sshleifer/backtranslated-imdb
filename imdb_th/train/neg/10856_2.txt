Now look, I won't lie to you. But I received this film for $ 3.99 from a friend because it has Danni Filth, the lead singer of the popular metal band Cradle Of Filth. I expect to be violent and rosy at The best, because that's what Filth can show as a plot story. <br /> <br /> But my beloved God is wrong. This movie is a big blow. Is a low-budget movie (hahaha, waiting to be ZERO BUDGET), making it clear that the lack of beautiful Howard Stern orchestral scores and Spielberg's special effects The bad blood <br /> <br /> For example, when our stars and evil demons Mr Filth kill the bad guys Grabbed at the neck and spit blood But, oh, I seem to have water filled with fake blood in men's shirts. <br /> <br /> Your Cradle Of Filth fans: You will hear two songs throughout the movie. But with low camera angles and shooting, they dragged the overall happiness of the song down. <br /> <br /> My last comment: steer away from it. It's blood, blood, chest, and hey, even the absurdities with it. So if you like horrible violence near no noise (yes, there are any words in this movie) then buy it. But if the wrong movie is not something you should avoid Don't waste your money.
