I rented this movie about 3 years ago and still stands out in my opinion as the worst movie ever made. I don't think I will finish it. It's worse than the home videos made by high school students. I remember what they were doing back in the 1970s and in the past, there was a man with polo shirts, oakley sunglasses and new SUV models like Toyota Rav-4 or something (I do not remember) I do not understand how they can say that in the 70s he might have a mobile phone. I can't remember how horrible it was. I went back to the video store and asked them why they carry a movie and if I can restore my life time To this day, it's the worst movie I've ever seen.
