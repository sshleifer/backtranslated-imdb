I tried to watch this movie without actually being able to watch this movie, because while it should have a "good" message, the problem was that it was clearly evident as one interpretation of the Bible. In my opinion, the interpretation will make a lot of people misunderstand. In addition, I am a madman in the film and the performances in this film are not completely acceptable. I have never before I wanted a negative score to rate a movie. Therefore, if you want to be preached by those who do not have unceasing power, so please get this movie. This comment is also a warning to people who like scifi or love because the name will deceive many people as well. This is a movie that is unfortunate because the basic idea is feasible and those possibilities are overwhelmed. The only quality of the film's redemption is that it makes me realize that the characters in "Time Machine" should show more moral morals than in his future strange behavior.
