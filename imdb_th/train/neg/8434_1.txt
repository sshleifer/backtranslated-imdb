This film shows Jewish racial hatred by David Mamet more than I've ever seen in American movies. <br /> <br /> That pattern is beyond my ability to continue to watch. I was very disappointed at Joe. <br /> <br /> Mantegna called a group of men sitting in New York in the Jewish weapons cleaning center. Heros, which had common sense of victory The idea that Jews are not Americans and "different". I suggest that Mr. Mamet is one of the causes of hate that is not a keeper too.
