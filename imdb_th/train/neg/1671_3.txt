I saw this in the market at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> It's a real cheap product - nothing wrong. But you have to compensate with sex or blood, or both. <br /> <br /> Miss Larry Cohen <br /> <br /> Sean Young is an interesting actor - well done with the producer. That's about you. I guess <br /> <br /> The opening scene in the spacecraft is coming down as a joke - you can take pictures All crew members are shaky! <br /> <br /> Haha - but I need someone who can do this well - at least it's not cocky.
