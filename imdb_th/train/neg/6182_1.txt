This movie makes Peter an elf in the Robin Hood costume instead of a boy in a suit that may not be Robin Hood and doesn't really care about all the qualities in him. This movie makes Wendy a madman who is babbling. And the poor captain Hook is all funny And of course, all Disney cartoons have to have too many famous characters. They then create that Lost Boys. The only characters that are not ashamed in this movie are the one-star Tink for you. <br /> At that time, right? Dear parents don't have time to notice that their children are gone !!! May be one of the most important points in the original story and they destroy it! The famous nursery between Peter Pan and Wendy is an amazing masterpiece - no Thimbles and Acorns - one of the little things that make the original story unique. It is surprising that he lost the shadow and she helped him stick to it. (Although his shoes and it is no reason for me) <br /> <br /> Breaking this great story just for the fun of children should be illegal. If so, know now if you have never known. - This Disney version does not have the same meaning as the original story - which is not really about children. This just makes me annoyed not to end.
