This film has started very well, showing the interest and strength of Shannon Lee and introducing two exciting characters in the first half. But later something happened and suddenly Shannon became a second-hand pale girl and the movie went astray in its own context. The second half lacked any special abilities and filled with ancient ideas, poor performances, terrible plot and more difficult coordination. Not to mention the horrible actors they chose for the Mafia gang. <br /> <br /> "Game of Death 2" is not good and Bruce jokes. But his daughter made it even bigger than himself Already played Bruce Lee I truly believe that she can do a lot better and I hope that you will continue to contribute to better production next time. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of hard-core games True and not interested in quality Watch this movie I wait personally But was very disappointed
