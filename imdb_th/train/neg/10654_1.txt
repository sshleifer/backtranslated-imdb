Big hair, big girl, bad music and large safety brooch ....... This is the word that best describes this scary movie. I love magic horror movies and I have seen hundreds .. but this must be the worst thing ever done. The story is a paper that is thin and ridiculous. The acting is a nasty thing. The script is completely ridiculous. (The best is the final showdown with the police and the way he works out who is the murderer - it's so scary.) Abominable and funny clothes of the same size. That show off the belly (Ugly that men actually put on !!) and the song is a playable synthetic trash and Over and over again ... In almost every scene, there are worthless songs, milk and nurses taking bodies away .... and the gyms are still not closed for loss !! All that is joking, this is a truly bad movie, the only charm is to look back to the catastrophe that occurred in the 80s and have a good laugh.
