Lorna Doone, a very disappointing version Too many missing characters, no romantic scenes, changes in texture, short stories too, low budget The conversation is not enough to understand the story if you are not familiar with the novel. In some scenes, Lorna seems to have pain in her upper lip. I'm sure the best makeup to hide it. I guess they don't want to stop shooting until it's gone. It is possible that this movie lacks the kissing scene. The only disappointing kissing scene in the end. Lorno Doo is a great epic story and should tell the truth. Lorna Doone version 2000 is twice as long, more romantic, more fun and true to the book
