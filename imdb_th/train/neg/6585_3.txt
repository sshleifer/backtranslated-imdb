In reviewing this film, I was able to pass my experience as a warrior during the weekend, my basic training in July, August and September 1971 in the world park of Fort Polk, Louisiana. Using high space is not everything I can remember. Basic training <br /> <br /> But one thing to remember at this time is the Korean post which ends with a stalemate. But it is a normal war that we know them Not Vietnam, which is a guerrilla war in the forest where we still keep the players in the endless holes The body at that time was not satisfactory. But recognized as necessary for national defense. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark is a Korean veteran currently assigned to the state department to train soldiers abroad. This film is one of his training cycles and the men of the division that he must practice. They are a normal type of movie that you will find in movies about the war from the previous decade. <br /> <br /> One thing I will praise Take the High Ground for is the fact that MGM remembers our army. It is now one with William Hazard as a black soldier. It corresponds to the spirit of the time that is changed. <br /> <br /> But I will say that recruitment like Ruslumbin will be healed from his wise mouth from the first day. Richard Widmark will not risk death or eunuchs for Jerome Courtland to believe with weapons. And there was no way he would be very worried about leaving Robert Arthur. He let the members of the parliament handle him. Of course, being shot in and around Fort Bliss and El Paso, Texas Makes good accuracy But looking at it as a movie that is recruiting the army and you can understand exactly why the government is actively cooperating. On that day, <br /> <br /> I remember that the training sergeant had a little conflict where you could Acceptable when You don't worry about what they get in your case, which is 95% of the time, but there is no way that Carl Golden will hit Widmark out during the practice in front of many witnesses among those. Be persuaded Both will know that there will be some destructive power. The soldiers will not allow it to happen. <br /> <br /> I hope I can say something better about Take The High Ground because I like it. Its talented actor Richard Brooks, the director who is capable of even stupid themes by Dimitri T. Okin and Ned Washington, fresh from their Oscar one year ago for the High Noon movie. This has been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Screenplay and the story by Millard Koffman. It must be for Coffman's bright imagination.
