I have nothing compared to religious movies. Religious people need something to see on Saturday night. I guess. But what really makes me tick is that when writing on the DVD box does not indicate this truth to potential audiences. Through religious propaganda because of the unattractive entertainment. <br /> <br /> And even though I am a religious person, I must agree with most other posters here. Poor, poorly resolved and the effort on the soundtrack is funny. The fake accent is terrible. Most characters are stereotypes and continuity go out the window. The only reason we watched this story was a waste of time because it was too late to watch other movies instead. Should go to bed. <br /> <br /> Don't qualify for this film unless you are a religious person who will guarantee what will be declared to those who don't believe immediately. Otherwise, avoid all costs. Don't be deceived by the writing box.
