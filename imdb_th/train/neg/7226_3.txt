I love cartoons Even if I have trouble understanding the whole story? The visual style is unique, with dust and decay. So I think I know what I'm doing. Surprisingly, I understand the main points? <br /> <br /> I mean - the CG actors are not really good - in the near term? ??why?! It does not work at all !! Will be a cult movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately
