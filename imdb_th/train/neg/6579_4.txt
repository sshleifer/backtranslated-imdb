"New Best Friend" is another item in the sub-category. "Steal the life of another woman"; The best thing is "White woman alone" and "rocking hand"; Even worse, you can watch almost every afternoon in a lifetime channel. For some reason, stealing this type of personal information only happens to women. <br /> There are only two basic ways to play this type of story. You can make the evil woman at first and let the audience know as you hatch and use her evil plans. Or you use the wrong advice to make her appear as a good person because of the events that seem to be not as you want until she is revealed to be a wicked person in the climatic scene Unfortunately, the creator "New best friend" can't decide how they want to play it. We first met with Mia Kirshner in the college's financial aid office to receive scholarships. We now know that she is a bad person and will watch all her subsequent activities with suspicion. But the director and editor forgot that this revelation occurred and spent another 50 minutes in the wrong direction so we thought that Alicia was a good person. This thing presents only one suspicious thing, not about whether she is evil or not. But when the directors and editors are smart and stop wasting time with transparent guidance, <br /> <br /> "Best new friends" suffer more. From the curse of the teen movie of an actor who is too old to play undergraduate students There are only two, most of them really are Hadley (Meredith Monroe) and Alicia (Kirshner). They are 31 and 26, respectively, at the time of production. It was almost 26 years old for Kirshner when she played the mousse Alicia. But it became clear when she was transformed into Alicia. In the Glamed-Up version, Monroe's casting was a joke about Nicholette Sheridan trying to pass on as a classmate in "Lizzie McGwire "She looks closer to the mid-life crisis than the vocabulary paper. <br /> <br /> The producers have to be indebted to many, since the problems in this era cover most of the characters. <br /> <br /> The basic setting is Hadley and the other two party girls (played by Dominque Swain-age 21 and Rachel True-age 35). College They share (As a student residence) is a better manor and better decoration than a mansion in the real world - New Orleans (evidence that is more convincing than a football player's mother). Alicia walked into the mansion and Began to use the life of the sheriff At the very least, Swain finally got a roommate from her model, so both were able to have a lesbian scene. Swain's support is the only good thing about "New best friend" and her love scene with Kirshner are great, cool and have art that doesn't suit other segments. Maybe it will take over the good director. Filming <br /> <br /> Hilarious stories that are not intended to be presented in a series of boring events of rampant sex and nonstop parties, each performed by the shooting of Alicia comatose in the bed in hospital About half of the time, Kirshner's screen spent time lying still in the tube in her mouth Not a good career. Mia <br /> <br /> Then again, what can I know? I am only a child
