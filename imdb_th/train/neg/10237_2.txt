The documentary revolves around Eva Mozes Kor, a genocide survivor, part of Mengele's experiment on twins, which mostly consists of a version of what happened at Auschwitz and the comparison of the emotions of other survivors from the double experiment. This film has excellent reviews. It is one of those topics that no one dares to express the opposite. <br /> <br /> I am the same for most of the movies, sucking the emotions that the filmmakers want clearly. To concentrate on One of the opinions of users about IMDb by Eric Monder (obviously there is nothing important to say about the problems in the public forum) can only find the sweetest sweet water. Amazed as the Jewish group argued with Kor at the Jewish center, the meaning of the word "forgive" was still debated, but the lonely and alone Kor had her own. "But this time sappy R that the film is in music that reflects the mood of non-stop, I let it loose enough that I could see clearly again. After Eva Cor "Self-willed" forgives her "Nazi catcher". This film begins to delve deeper into forgiveness, at least from the point of view of the neck. This film is about following her through public revelations, forgiving the Nazis and entering a new land. For me, this is the flesh of the leather that is surrounded by her inedible fat. "Forgiveness" is clearly a very sick cow. <br /> <br /> On a mission to test her forgiveness theory.

All that was done, Dr. Sami Advan, who was annoyed (professor of education at the University of Bethlehem) was right when He told Kor about the release of a statement she made about how she would sleep in her apartment. <br /> <br /> Finally, the debate at the Jewish Center in Chicago, which she "roasted" with The meaning of forgiveness and her right to do so in the wake of those still suffering from the trauma /> <br /> I done to cut with <br chase.

The movie was created badly, unable to delve into Auschwitz's anything other than just a little nonsense enough to make sure that the Holocaust was restored in the memory of the audience and stirred up tears. It shows that the story of the documentary can not participate in a fair discussion. Her ability to talk is limited to showing forgiveness. (Best of all) for the unwillingness to listen to or participate. <br /> <br /> In the end, everyone is mentally retarded today that they cannot observe the difference between creating peace and forgiveness from Speaking of other IMDb users, "I don't see that she forgives being weak - on the contrary, she just wants to suppress her spirit. She wants suffering to end. So So let it go.
