This movie is similar to "Flashdance". Did you know that this dance with Jennifer Beals is probably the most boring movie I've ever seen because it's not bad enough to joke "GI Jane" better? That movie But didn't say much Here, Demi Moore sweats a lot and has high music and we can see her fight and everything. But it is not attractive I think the idea behind this film is interesting. But the script is quite rude and Ridley Scott can't do anything about it. As I said ... it's better than "Flashdance" ... (4/10)
