I feel that the creators of this mess come out to create the most pain and nonsense that Westerners have ever done. "PAINFUL" is the best word I can describe. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, you have Shoot beautiful colors and beautiful Rhonda Fleming and speak well. My sympathy goes to Jacques Aubuchon (a disabled player) who acts well enough in an annoying role. Written so scary that there are no actors who can perform with fun. The production cost is quite good, which only serves to highlight scary stories and screenplays. <br /> <br /> What I hate: Stewart Granger looks a little like a western person with English accents. And an impeccable white handkerchief tied around his neck It was boring as the townspeople and his son quarreled and insulted Granger all the time and he never said or responded. I know that we should stop disbelief and appreciate the Westerners as a moral symbol. But this destroys the spell with a laughable, unrealistic and predictable scene. The worst creature at the end, which is passed by the bad guy's cow, will pass. In the perfect spot so that he can shoot a dynamite from a very long distance to create a rock slide to bury and scare the two bad guys. Full of drama scenes There seems to be nothing in the movie that can be believed: I don't want to believe that all the conflicts are about anything. The bad guys drive the crowd through the market and want the cow to chew the grass at the same time. I don't see why some things can't work out. Do you want disputes about ownership of land for that thing? Don't pay attention to it.
