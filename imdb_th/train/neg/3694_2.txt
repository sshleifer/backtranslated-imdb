This is undoubtedly Rajnikanth's worst movie. The first part was held with solid comedies from Goundamani, but it was getting worse and completely irrational. Our hero also dug at the Saints of the same name (Baba) through the first half of the airline. There Rajni voiced his style and in the second half became a saint, as if begging to take him through the dimensional door. To the Himalayas at Babaji (not the famous saint he dug earlier), he has special powers without clear reason (In addition to karma) This is really interesting now, right? <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is about him losing his magic and power and fighting with politicians and black magic involved. Shit that can be expected as usual with hilarious use Oh and the black magic never worked with our heroes because he had just got Param Vir ... uh .... Shakti Chakra with him, bad guys and villains. Ordinary politicians tend to think very hard, and ultimately don't matter to the story. <br /> <br /> But despite all the shortcomings, it was fun to kill time and shouted Baba, who was involved in one of the public events. It's fun to watch other people curse about this movie. AR Rehman is said to have composed songs for his movies via mobile phones. He thinks how important it is. <br /> <br /> Rajni is very popular in Japan and he has included two characters. (One of them is Keiko ... why not Samsung?) That came from Japan in this movie just for Its benefits But the way in which they show how to dress and practice is absolutely pathetic. Japanese people may stop watching the movie Rajni after seeing it. This movie may be a promotional material for entering Rajni's politics, but the results of this movie will calm his political dreams. <br /> <br /> Fun if you close your brain.
