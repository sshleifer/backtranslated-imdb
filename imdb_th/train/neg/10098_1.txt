Not worth the video rental or time or effort from time to time. <br /> <br /> * Make-up that children can do. * The show is over ... Bad governance. .. Many things are not reasonable or irrational. * The voice is not good. * The music is not very suitable. * The casting is very closed ... There must be cracks. Work ... just make me go * Bank and the bad guys ... Holy crap! As an awesome actor as he is ... He is the best looking zombie of all. Which doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> Good cover image but very deceptive ... just like the main DVD menu ... Great art and music <br /> <br /> Don't "both!
