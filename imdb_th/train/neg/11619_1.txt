I watched movies both waiting and waiting for what will happen. May be my fault in anticipation of evil and horror rather than psychology? It's an exotic story about the legendary Edipal: I want to kill my father and mother and marry my uncle and compose music with him? I do not understand why some elements of the plot appear: Why is construction going up? Why is there a large staircase with an ideal spot for someone who is in disaster? Why do you have a good kitchen? If you just go to buy things to go home, why does that child want to be baptized and the parents are the ones who resist I see many good reviews for this film ... My taste has been damaged by the rise of the 70s b movies and old sci-fi movies.
