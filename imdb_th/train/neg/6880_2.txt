I'm excited to hear that someone made a documentary about what it was like Puerto Ricans. When I heard that it was Rosie Perez, I wondered ... She should know what it was like being a Puerto Rican. As far as I know .... You are Nuuri Next, I sat with nervousness with my popcorn to see. I realized 10 minutes that my initial understanding was correct. Rosie Perez had little knowledge about what it was like. Puerto Rico "Documentary" This is a very first hand, very personal account of what it was like Nuyorican .. and all Things that are relevant to her (like most people of Nuru Gorizican I know) have some feelings and distortions in history. (What can't they do .. They are here) Yes, they are all proud. As it should be! But many people do not know the truth of culture, history and political background or real language Everything is very clear when participating in the Vieques issue. Regardless of what my personal story is about in this regard, at least I know what the fight is for. There she was arrested because of a few things she knew a little .. and joined because it was "Cause the Puerto Rican people" I didn't really understand that she wasn't embarrassed to accept it. For those of you who are not Puerto Rican, please look at this as part of the journey to find and accept women. Do not use this as the gospel. Most are not true. Please consider the source. Rosie is an actor Not a historian This movie is not and should not be the basic information for other Nuyoricans users, but just a step towards finding out more, learning and debating what reality is. Not just people from the eyes of this woman
