Do you know that when you watch an old video movie collection and know that there is something that you see once or twice and you don't remember how worthwhile it is, The Alibi is / Is one of those movies I found it recently and decided that I might give a chance as well. I'm not entirely sure if I'm happy with my decision ... In one hand, this movie is really bad. Now I have another set of free tapes ... Yes, you already understand. The storyline is predictable and not in its original state. Walking badly The performance is not good. But it is not surprising to see that while the actors were both former television drama stars ... they were too familiar with the expression The characters are bad words. This movie can also make me feel impressed. (Through the film): In the court scene, even those things do not cause a single emotion or resist some characters. The film does not have any real redemption properties ... even the conversation is not good. This thing is that it is full of ridiculous ancient ideas. And that is one thing that raises this level above the level 1/10: (although it is unintentionally) cartoons, relief of clich√©s and a lot of stereotypes I didn't pay much attention to movies. But every time I look at the screen there is something to laugh. Final Note: I consider using the line "Tori Spelling can not act" as a single line summary. But I think everyone knows that so I chose to use the current line because I saw that there is more information. Overall, it's a bad movie. But not the worst if you have nothing to do and if on the TV Good for a few laughs if you can sit through it 3/10
