I know that it shouldn't be a BSG and I can manage a slow list if they're interesting. But I found myself not interested and bored with this series. <br /> <br /> The formula for BSG seems to be: Action + Adventure + SciFi + Suspense + Mystery + Drama <br /> <br /> Formula For Caprica, probably: Bland Drama + Moderate Scifi <br /> <br /> Maybe it will be more interesting, but part 3, I can hardly see. In fact, it's at the bottom of the list that I have to watch in a week. This is a sad situation. The Syfi Channel really destroyed their lineup on Friday night. What happened to the glory of SG1, Stargate Atlantis and BSG on Friday night? They have good things there.
