And it falls into the category of "The most terrible thing" - that is the movie that the drunken student will rent to expel I was at the sci-fi film festival and what I remember was the wave after the waves, laughing, hippies sound like this movie premiered. Other criticisms will better explain the feces of this movie, and I feel bad about the poor people from the production company that clearly appears to measure the audience's reaction.
