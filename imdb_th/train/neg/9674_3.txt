This flick reminds me of a very bad science fiction movie from the 50s and 60s. It's not scary or interesting. But it's boring, scary and stupid. Special effects are ridiculous. Every actor is laughing and the ending is terrible. Lose your money for rent or buy something better. I give it 3.5 out of 10. (I found that this turkey is quite fun because of its folly)
