I look forward to watching this movie and then realize that the hope of a continuous conversation between actors is filled with unnecessary vows. Now I'm not a rude person, but the shouting is not rude. Ewan Bremner is one of the worst actors in the world at this time. (Watching his performances in the horrifying life of God) and his "Cockney" accent are not as good as his Edinburgh accent. Avoiding how much we have to suffer before filmmakers know the movie. f-word, c-word and others do not replace the appropriate conversation
