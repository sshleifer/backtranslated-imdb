I watched this movie in DVD format. My copy may be affected. But I was disappointed that there was no menu screen for DVDs. I will say that my primary reason for watching this movie is Claire Forlani. While enjoying watching, I felt that she didn't follow my expectations that I discovered from her other movies In fact, I was pleased to see Arkin turn in comedic performances. The other two actors I'm not familiar with, so I can't compare their performances. But they are fun too The show is just the love of the quality of this movie in my opinion. The story while some people speak a little interesting, no direction. I feel that the main problem arises from the script and not the direction of this movie. If you enjoy these actors at a fair level, I recommend this movie. But otherwise
