I'm sorry but even though Adrian Zmed of TJ Hooker was unable to save this sequel I passed half the movie and thought that this was original. Then there was a fierce and strange motorcycle scene. (Note that this is the only film that Patricia Birch directed) and I'm sad to know that they are trying hard. I have been kicked out of the fact that the opposite group that lost their "wheel" due to their gambling behavior in the traditional Grease was forced to use a motorcycle in the second film. When being embarrassed by Carrington, the character I hated to see what they would turn to later: maybe Mopeds. <br /> <br /> I haven't bought a hack style set. Fit to outsiders - outstanding schools - ergo-go-for-tough-guy-with-stupid-biker-helmet-look It's a horrible Disney story. <br /> <br /> So it seems like you can destroy the good things by placing a bubble gum that slaps Michelle Fir in the musical. The only thing I brought out of this movie was the idea of ​​how much to score in ten stories.
