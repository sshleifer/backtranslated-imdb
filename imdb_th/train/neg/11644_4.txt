Yes, I "get" Pasolini and his surroundings. But at the same time I felt that his "Decameron" was mostly overrated and slightly more disturbing. Valuable because of the "truth" that he suggested (people who yearn for an architecture that is broken, etc.) is obscured by ridiculous and ridiculous methods like the characters behave. In truth, Pasolini used many non-actors. But stared at the deer and the delivery of a painful awkward line made them feel tired and inconsistent. And frankly - people with teeth and teeth with many deformities feel pain to look at. <br /> Pasolini's "Decameron" is disturbing (for me at least) because of the widespread homosexual content. And widespread Not because I am insulting or incriminating (I am not) but because the emphasis on Pasolini is placed on the image and the situation that is not in the wrong way is contrary to the new realism that he uses otherwise. Almost heard him say "Oh - I have to stick to a cute and naked boy in this scene!" Sometimes it seems that Pasolini is trying to play a corner of homosexuality, giving his nose criticism and sometimes because he enjoys that aspect. No matter what his audience will like, <br /> <br /> The disparity of 9 or 10 different stories in Pasolini's "Decameron" makes me feel that Pasolini failed as a storyteller instead. In terms of Buttons of the new realism. He seems to be bored with each subject, so he makes them look unbelievable and have little confidence. Even Pasolini's last conversation in this film, which some people seem to find important ("Why must create art when dreaming of it is very sweet?") - For me, it just makes me wonder why Pasolini would be if he felt this way? In my opinion, movies that are created better (And having more homosexual content) is Fellini's "Satyricon". It is also full of strange people and ridiculous situations. But it was successful because of the pacing, direction and strong storytelling while "Decameron" failed by those same elements
