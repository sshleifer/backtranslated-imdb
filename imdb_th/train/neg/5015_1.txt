As a film critic for many Dutch websites, I have to watch many movies and not all that are very good. Some movies are terrible, you won't be surprised that the video will be released. With the prohibition, I was surprised to launch the video. This is a very low budget. The quality is not good. Very bad. Write waste. <br /> <br /> Teen groups play banned games. They wrote their most despicable desires or actions, and later people were killed because of taboos. The question is, should we believe in what we see? <br /> <br /> This movie has an interesting pivot point and I won't leave it here. But the interesting thing is foolishness, bad actions and unreasonable. <br /> <br /> Some actors have played in a much bigger position than before. If you see this everywhere, try to dodge it. There is no reason to have no sense of human quality in this movie.
