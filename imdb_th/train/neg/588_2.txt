I was forced to write a review of this IMAX feature to remind others to receive your money. Almost every episode of "Human Beast" by Desmond Morris or David Suzuki's "nature of things" can offer the best content. Director not only But taking advantage of the 65 to 70 mm film stock and the incredible IMAX presentation screen. Everything on the screen is not very impressive due to previous access to the program. The audience will be introduced to Heather, pregnant, husband, buster and niece and their nephew. We follow them for forty minutes that are endless when they eat sweat, listen to music and more. Although we have been given access to scenes in the human digestive path and learning about the natural dive response What do we learn about babies? Most elementary school graduates? Are we far away from Trans Atlantic Heather? Do we care about avoiding this film at all costs? If you want to see the IMAX feature, I would like to recommend "India: Kingdom of the Tiger" that captures beautiful images or "Space Station 3D" that is technically exciting.
