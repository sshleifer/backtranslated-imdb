Again, such as Charlie's Angels, Inspector Gadget and Thunderbirds, the TV series became full-length movies and damaged by hundreds of people watching. Essentially, Duke's cousin, Luke (Johnny Knoxville) and Bo (Seann William Scott) in Hazzard County spent a lot of time driving in "The General Lee", but they needed to work together and stop their family farms. Which was destroyed along with almost the entire city with the disgusting things of Jefferson Davis 'Boss' Hor (Razzie nominated Bert Reynolds) to make way for a large coal mine They received help along the way from Daisy, cousin (Razzie nominated Jessica Simpson) and Uncle Jesse (Willy Nelson) while being chased by Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane. (Ph.D., starring Joe Don Baker as the governor of Jim Apple White, Jack Polic, in the position of Cletus Hogg, David Koechner as Cooter Davenport, Michael Weston, is deputy Enos Strate and Lynda Carter Pauline I Thinking that the only reason I gave this movie is a special star because Impressive showing the car a couple of times and that gorgeous body of Simpson (I will admit that her legs than Catherine Bach, but still!), But beyond that, it's quite boring. It has been nominated for the Razzies for the worst worst director image for Jay Chandrasekhar. Worst Remake or the worst screen sequel for Simpson and her "Daisy Dukes" and the worst screenplay is quite bad!
