I want to write about it. But still no I want to talk about the difficult dialogue from the movie, but "hinglish" is a joke, only 5 minutes later. It's too much. I like to be frustrated with 'Keep-u-guessing', but it can be predicted that ... um mm, Yash raj (?) I like talking about cutting-edge actions. <br /> <br /> * Sigh * <br /> <br /> All of this movie is perfect for: 1. Those who try to commit suicide - I promise it will. Pushing you out over the edge. 2. Sado-masochists - This film is more effective than barbed wire at Silas in Da-Da Vinci. Code 3. People search for alternatives to spreading terrorism. The audience from the hall seemed to be in the mood to 4. Lower someone Cinema Piraters: more power for them. If any movie is appropriate, there will be no audience that uses the money to watch - this is it. 5. Barnacle, Plankton and almost all types of green algae - because almost all other living things have to use IQ rather What the movie presented later: The film director is clearly seen as his own species. (And I hope that the gods that he is the only person in his category .. Enough) <br /> <br /> What makes this movie better: 1. Story 2. Choreographer 3. A Screenwriter 4. Daredevil Coordinator 5. Story (Did I say?) 6. Director - especially those who are not mentally challenged (Even if those who are challenged may do better) 7. Anil Kapoor = Black Plague - Avoid all costs. 8. Legal Warning - "Watching Yash Raj movies is harmful to your mental health"? <br /> <br /> What I like about movies: 1. Kareena Kapoor - for obvious reasons 2. English subtitles - "Mera Dil Kho Gaya" becomes - "My heart is in emptiness. "," Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya "became" I am a flirtatious lover. Im a vagabond ".. without framing.> <br /> In short, Tashan for me is like the opposite of a cube-cube. Tashan's player IQ promises to reduce your IQ and .. in just 2.5 hours! <br /> <br /> * Breathe * .. but that's just me I may be wrong. You have been warned.
