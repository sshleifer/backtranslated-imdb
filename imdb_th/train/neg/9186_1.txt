Do you know that you feel the hilarity when you watch a movie that tries so hard to be serious? Think that this movie provoked and failed miserably? When you can't help laughing at the terrifying nature of the trash that is scattered around your screen, "House of the Dead" struggles to get a low level of cinema. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end "House of the Dead" begins to make you feel like you just woke up to search. Where the cat is placed, it curves neatly on your forehead while you sleep It is clear from the beginning that the actress has been casting according to their cleavage size. (Which they take advantage of unscrupulous) while men for their "kick-ass" attitude is simple. I don't care about the characters at any time of the movie and find myself wanting them to die for I have suffered from this torture. Uwe Boll should consider showing two hours of the actual game as a movie. At least we will show better? However, not being able to bring the offense to the actors because it is certainly a challenge to create a convincing movie when faced with this film. It is the worst part of this movie and there are lines like: "This is pure and simple zombies" and "No cap'n, we must not go there! It's evil! "<br /> <br /> We all know that zombies are not provocative or full of meaning. Best of all, they are not dangerous, two hours of bloody action and fear, trash bin, yes, but fun with trash. Not the garbage that bursts out of your garbage bag as you drag it all over the room and the shoe charters in the yogurt box and the banana skin area. As IMD says "House of Death" received such bad reviews that no Danish cinema bought this movie. If only we can get the same privileges, <br /> <br /> Final score: 1/10
