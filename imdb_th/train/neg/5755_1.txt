I saw this movie in the screening of the High Falls Film Festival in New York and I must say I found it boring and complete. Although it is funny in some places But the only real laughter is that it seems to be true to talk and that some performances in that place are scary and especially made of wood "Lady Cutie" has never heard of) There are many things I want. I feel that JCMac, the redemption feature of this film, the real action and true effort and performance (from the actors). Show another person and become a more strict director. This may be half the good movie. Let us just hope that it will not be sent out in the general version, or if you really need a copy, look in the bargain bin in Lidl.
