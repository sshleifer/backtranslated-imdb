Not a woman's movie But it's a gang movie One of the worst movies that male directors do about women, director Andy McKay doesn't know women. Peaks of bad taste, American Pie's humorous style, rude stories, meaningless, irrational stories Rude fantasy comes to life on the screen. Insulting and not funny, of course I wonder how three good female actors accept participation.
