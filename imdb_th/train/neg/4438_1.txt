I borrowed this movie from the library, thought it was delightful. How am I wrong? <br /> <br /> It's a terrible movie that I have to write something about. Mira Sorvino is terrible. In this movie, it's very painful to watch this scene with her. She is a beautiful woman But in this film, she doesn't have any charm at all. But I must be witness to her awkward effort to seduce almost all the main characters. <br /> <br /> And the dialogue of the movie is boasting and lacking in humor. <br /> <br /> Completely failed.
