I love Adrianne Curry before this show. I think she is great in the Top Model and is really happy when she wins. I like Chris Knight as well. He seems to be a great person. But this show makes me sick! I was angry both for what happened in that list. I do not care that they are different. I know that longevity cannot be achieved between love, but Adrianne. You are only seven months together. No wonder he didn't offer And I do not see that forcing someone to marry you before they are ready If it should be, why not enjoy each other's company and love each other and let it go naturally? Changing the wedding ring into a ball and chain is not entirely necessary. It is surprisingly clear that Chris loves you whether or not there are rings. And Chris was ashamed that you destroyed and offered you anyway! You have been through a failed marriage twice, how can you break into another person because you set it to fit? I hope that the relationship will remain. But I felt that the marriage was hasty and for all wrong reasons Perhaps now they can breathe and find the right reason to marry from within the marriage.
