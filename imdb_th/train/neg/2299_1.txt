I believe in heaven and hell Kay, who went out of the way, I just wanted to say that anything in this world that has morality that calls itself "host" thinks what they are doing ?? The last time I checked the host, did not divide the hatred of hatred on the TV, or tried to reduce their beliefs into all the unlucky souls of those who were stupid. , Conservative, prominent in the Bible, Fred Phelps, Pat Robertson lover, doing every day I totally speak for free But since when it covers a very beautiful man, saying that if you use his ideal life, you will be sent to hell immediately. This is just a perfect example of why religion is the cause of many problems of SOOOO. One day in the classroom, I have a teacher instead, so we decided to watch TV because teaching did not make us work at all and we (compared to Many of us intend to watch the club 700, and of course, Jeremy Pat is boasting and praising the Bible and he speaks to Simon along the line. "God says that homosexuality is a sin." Actually, go. "Well, I guess he was right." WTF ??? Seriously, if the host tries to make people think that other people's sexual tastes are a big sin, they need to take the host, wrap the adhesive tape and throw them out of the cruise ship in the middle of the Arctic.
