This film does not encourage children to be better and have a better attitude as they should be family movies, and this is not considered a family because it has something in that children should not see. If you ask me If there are fewer sexual themes in this movie, it may be better. Hollywood doesn't do anything to create a better movie by increasing sexual situations. There is no real reason for them. At least this is a TV movie. I don't want to waste money on this garbage by renting. If you have other things besides watching this movie, please continue.
