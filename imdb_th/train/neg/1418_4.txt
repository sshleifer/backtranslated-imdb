I don't know why this behavior can be tolerated in the movie business! This movie (short) has a total (to say the least)! It is a bunch of 5-7 year olds who wear diapers with large bobby pins acting like adults. (And too much!) However, it is interesting because it is a good example that "good old days" may not be as good as before! (Thank God that we have laws against this type of content right now!) <br /> <br /> {This is a short one from "Shirley Temple Festival"}
