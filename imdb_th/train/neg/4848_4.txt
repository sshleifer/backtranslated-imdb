I love good war movies and I fall in the category. "I've been doing that", so I think my review is correct (IMHO). When watching this movie on DVD, I can safely say that it is a garbage dump. There is no way for me to recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> It started with me shouting at the TV. "You won't do that," etc ... but I know there's a little bit. The work experience is an obstacle, so I feel cold. But in the opening scene, when the trailer fell, I felt disgusted that this movie would be difficult to predict ... I was right. <br /> <br /> There's no reason for the scene. EOD. I just know that the army team has some of the most insurgents at the end of the control line or the remote trigger. So much that I scratch my head all the time. Then, when you think you know that the story is about to happen, the men in Humvee are driving around the desert, one of the most valuable assets in the theater when looking cheerfully with some SAS contractors. <br /> < br /> The sniper scene is very laughing. It doesn't make sense and makes me want to close there. Then, for them to drag it out for a long time and then test my patience, it started with "Contact Right" and went down quickly. If you have a Brit accent, you will be shot. But if you are part of the EOD team, then you are a great shot and save the whole day. Then, as you thought, it ended up in a long, mysterious time without adding anything to the story. You are watching and asking why it is not finished. <br /> <br /> Then we have a liquor scene that they just hit together to laugh ... other scenes that you want to end. It didn't add anything to the movie. <br /> <br /> Then, when my life looked very boring, the main star went out to hunt someone. This is the most ridiculous scene I've ever seen. It challenges logic and all the ability to write good stories ... it's unconscious and scary. I still don't understand why they waste their time. Then watch him just jog along the busy road, head back to the camp, let me roll to the ground with funny laughs :) <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that this story is all over. List without having to decide what it really wants I thought it would be an illogical EOD scene, but then it went on a tangent trying to be something different, but it was as difficult as trying to just make me bored to death. All I need is the end. It is a collection of stupid scenes that are confused with stupid scenes. Action (ish) scenes <br /> <br /> There is no way I can recommend this. Sometimes my work experience may reduce enjoyment. But even naive, he must realize that this is not reasonable. The only thing that is stupid than this movie is the very high IMDb rating ... which must be a 24-hour PR team of the PR box office that seems to use this website to make everyone think it's good. ... It's not. <br /> <br /> Not recommended ... It will make you bored.
