What can be said about this disaster? I watched it because it was broadcast on cable. I'm sorry for wasting time But at least I don't lose money. <br /> <br /> The most wonderful creature you'll ever get! Please, you must be very generous not to be angry with the CHEAP Halloween costume. Oh, there are still horrible performances, f / x and conversations. Encounters with life are unbelievable. /> <br /> This is the worst thing you can get from flicking directly to the video. "Unknown creatures" makes the FULL MOON PICTURES movie look like "Halloween" <br /> <br /> Please avoid this at all costs. The only "positive" thing about this trash is Sexy woman
