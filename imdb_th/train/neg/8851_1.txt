Do I often be dominated by THE HOWLING (1981) of Joe Dante? So I'm not interested in checking the sequel. I recently tried HOWLING III: THE MARSUPIALS (1987) ?? By the same director with this person ?? And found that it can be viewed But nothing special. <br /> <br /> The second episode, however, has a bad agent and I know I have a good time watching it ?? If most will indulge in the eyes of a beloved but horrifying icon, Christopher Lee rushes in the midst of it all. (The graceful old star has been pitifully confirmed many times in the interview that he has not appeared in horror stories since he was The final picture for Hammer Films goes back to 1976!) However, this movie should have a subtitle "Your Movie Is A Turd" or not? A surprisingly incompetent person in every department (Starting from the make-up of a werewolf) Important! <br /> <br /> The plot (and conversation) is not only scary. But it still has a great connection with Dante's movie Strange that the original novelist Gary Brandner wrote himself! Is still one of the undeniable highlights (er ... the low point) of the movie is to fix the pointless oval ?? Which tries to give both the shape and style But only serves to highlight embarrassing factors!

Her pupil's herd and participate in three-way lycanthrope sex, occasionally hilarious!); (One of them is a dim black girl) that is particularly annoying. <br /> <br /> Helping Lee on the good side is two yuppie heroes (he is the brother of the character Dee Wallace from the beginning of the movie and she is Her colleagues) and the band of guerrillas of the genre Transyl (Still, they are often able to easily manage to defeat Danning's dumb werewolf!) The notable thing among them is the dwarf who throws a knife which is particularly disgusting. (But at the same time After that he revived under the control of Stirba to lure Lee. (By making the children ridicule him through the village road) into the trap. The background must be the lowest point in the profession for outstanding and elegant actors? Either in this order or in the top sequence in the disco that Lee has created to wear sunglasses that look cool like no other among uninterested teenagers. <br /> <br /> Finally, if I'm forced Speaking of this element which did not make me completely dissatisfied, I thought I might say that the ossuary series (which the heroine had to sacrifice) was interesting or a hybrid animal werewolf / bat (Danning's favorite pet ' Live the 'body of the victim', too strange to be despised ...
