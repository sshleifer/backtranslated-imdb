Hmm ... Okay, I guess I will get all gorilla shooting techniques. Unfortunately, I think the gorilla can make better movies ... This is just a complete mess from traveling. Bad performances, bad governance, bad stories and scary movies How was this garbage released? I would never know. But there and unfortunately I watched it Filmed in a location in Tennessee by Greg Swinson and Ryan Thiessen (Harry and Lloyd), "Five Across The Eyes". I suppose it should look similar to the movie "Blair Witch" but short ... OK. The black nose drifted down the cliff. In fact, I was embarrassed for these young women, which I'm sure promised a Hollywood star. But ended with this dung The conversation is ridiculous and makes you more angry when you listen. This method is probably a horror flick, another mystery, since there is nothing even scary about it from a distance, except the fact that I watch it ... Try this in size: there are 5 of you and 1 of her doing math and defeating her ass ... "Trilogy". Sadly, it continues (and on) another 95 minutes of stupid mind. <br /> <br /> I see it. Free and need a refund
