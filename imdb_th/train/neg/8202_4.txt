It is remake og the Thing (1982/1951). I think it has a lot of factors from the previous movie that rejected this story. <br /> <br /> So a bad performance, James Spader is a superlow gate. Once enacted his own laws with his coffee mugs and what he thought / strange movements, but that's about it. Other actors I didn't notice You don't get the feeling of getting to know every main character. And the plot development is slow, boring, and yes, I know what will happen in 30 minutes. Score / Ultra Bearing music has a lot of people getting ubertallented Out to score for coke and credit But this is an important shit Some special effects are good if done in the early 90's. If you like Slimy Aliens, chills and excitement, don't watch this movie. It's a boring combination of Thing, Alien 3, Outbreak and Jerry Bruckheimer's / Michael Bay production. Really bad. Now, this combination will be cool if someone knows what they are doing and alone in this production. <br /> <br /> Although I can see worse for everyone, but if you're on a cold night and want to look at something, it will pass slowly.
