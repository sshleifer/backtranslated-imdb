I waited almost 25 years to watch this movie, thinking that it might be a lower-quality work from an era of animation that is no longer the quality that has ever existed. It is one of the best villains of all time, based on the favorite children's books and the production of Disney Studios. Is there anything wrong with it? Almost everything. <br /> <br /> It's not everything. Vincent Price as Rattigan and Henry Mancini's elegant score are two of the movie's grace. The price is fun, evil and Mancini is more professional than the material that deserves. They brought the class to a confusing project. <br /> <br /> While the rest of the movie, while filled with inappropriate situations for adults, still suffers from boring scripts. Complete, working with general sounds, melodious, scary music and lazy animations that never happened On Disney's Saturday morning television program in the mid-1980s <br /> <br /> This was a complete disappointment for me. It's amazing that this film is almost contemporary with The Secret of NIMH. Independent studios create something with creativity in the example rather than the GMD price in an unlimited period. <br /> <br /> Special stars that make things This can't be "scary" to Price and Mancini.
