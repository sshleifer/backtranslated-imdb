I expect to enjoy a romantic comedy movie about hip hop. But was disappointed in many levels. First of all, the story was badly recycled until almost unbearable. Second, the display settings and the story are not true or reliable. Thirdly, there are very good black actors to choose from than these standard options. What about the initiative? Thirdly, there are very few hip hop songs that are played in the activity - if there seems no one really centered Overall, this movie is very disappointing. But the editing style is very interesting and almost makes this movie valuable.
