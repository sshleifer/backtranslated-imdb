This movie feels bad, doesn't do well, and doesn't write well. <br /> <br /> Jon Heder is very annoying. <br /> <br /> In addition, Diane Keaton is a mother who is a man who is too passionate about himself, who cares too much and is not enough about the lives of his children. She (see because I said that) <br /> <br /> Anna Faris, even though I like her in general, then she plays a ridiculous idiot in this movie. <br /> < br /> Jeff Daniels has passed But nothing special. <br /> <br /> Please skip this movie if you want to save your life.
