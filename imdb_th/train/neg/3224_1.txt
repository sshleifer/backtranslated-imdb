When I was a kid, I remember watching this thing while visiting my friend "Uncle". Our Phil, we're back! A Dinosaur's Story is a stupid cartoon about dinosaurs named Rex (voiced by John Goodman). He tells the story of a little dinosaur. He explained that he was part of what brought them back with some friends. The villain, doctor / professor in this movie, I think it would be their responsibility to return. But I don't care about him. Children may like this. But personally, it's too wonderful. John Goodman is probably a bad thing!
