I don't believe that some people really like this. Still calling himself Batman fans, even saying better than BTAS, which is not It should be an imitation for them to use the Batman name for this shit. Not Batman. <br /> <br /> The whole premise of the show is '' If you can't beat someone. Get a bigger weapon to help you. '' Batman is not just a weapon. He uses his batarang and his hook and the Batmobile. He doesn't think of new technology every time he can't beat someone. I don't know where they get ideas from Batbot anywhere or whatever. They destroyed all the villains. Mr. Freeze disappeared from a scientist who was sympathetic to a criminal crime. Catwoman is now a 40 or 50 year old woman who is dressed as a dumb. Now the penguin is a ninja with a 50-foot tall hat. Ventriloquist Now called Scarface, causing Dummy to become the center of the character. They also have stupid ideas that make him a giant! WTF? And two of the worst character changes: The Joker and Riddler. They transformed the Riddler into a Gothic / Retro teenager and The Joker for a dreaded gymnast. They have the most complete and completely destroyed Batman, even more experienced than B&R! I hope I will meet with the creator and or writer and animator of this show, so I can hit them in the head with a bat baseball bat.
