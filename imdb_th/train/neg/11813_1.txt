Before Stan Laurel became the greatest comedian team of all time, he worked under the contract with Broncho Billy Anderson for a cheap price, many of which were a parody of an important Hollywood movie. After an argument with Anderson, Laurel continued to play an informal parody drama at the small-scale (and pathetic) Joe Rock film company. <br /> <br /> Movie parody of Most laurels are a little funny at the time. For modern audiences who have not seen the original movies that Laurel is mocking 'West of the Hot Dog' is a common joke in cowboy filming. It is a parody of the 'West of the Pecos', which is a space creature released two years ago without an important actor, since 'West of the Pecos' has never been so successful. It is difficult to watch. Why Stan's film unit chose this movie as a target for laying their bodies, why are they waiting so long after letting mock And they received the name 'Hot Dog West', where it may be because of the fact that 'Hotdog!' Is a sexual exclamation that was supported by Americans in the 1920s (eg The same as in the opening scene of the 'Machinal' stage. <br /> <br /> 'West of Hot Dog' was produced and directed by Joe Rock. Among his other achievements, Rock introduced Laurel. With Lois Neilson and he is the best man in their wedding Full revelation: In the last year of his life I received a great honor from befriending Joe Rock and interviewing him. At that time, almost ninety years old, the memory of Rock was clearly impressive ... but he couldn't remember anything about 'West of Hot Dog' and I couldn't blame him. This movie is clearly forgotten. <br /> <br /> The character of the heroine, Little Mustard: If that means some parody in 'West of the Pecos', I don't understand. There is no 'gag'. Can be 'a few here, including the way of laurel in horses Just a moment in this movie, Stan Laurel reminded me of the great Buster Keaton when he suddenly ran away. 'West of the Hot Dog' has similarities in the content and tone of Keaton's short comedy 'The Frozen North', but Keaton's version is much more fun. The story of this movie is quite predictable that Keaton's 'Our Hospitality' feature will occur, but (again) suffers from comparisons: here are two varmint brothers who expect to inherit Last. Chance Saloon but the previous owner However, brothers will become legal heirs if Stan dies. Um ... <br /> <br /> Seriously, though: Is it legitimate? As soon as Stan took possession of the property, any additional questions of ownership or succession would be his decision, not the decision of the previous owner. I have plenty of time to consider legal issues while watching this boring comedy. At one point, there are rules that relate to raw animations drawn directly onto movie stock. It looks cheap and not funny. <br /> <br /> 'Hot Dog' is not a traveler and no winner: it's just a fraud. My rating: One point from 10 Hang on, Stan: In the next few years you will be half of a funny legend.
