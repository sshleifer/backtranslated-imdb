It's hard to say what is the worst thing about this show: poor performances, bad acoustics in some parts, bad CGI, suits that are not suitable for the moment, scripts that not good It would be good if the script based on the original storyline came a little longer - there was a lot of tension and good content in Beowulf to make good content and a better story than the scriptwriter could do. A strange new one, such as a crossbow that shoots explosive bolts. <br /> <br /> I saw that this movie was created in "just" 21 days. It shows the lack of quality. I started to think that this is a general (bad) attitude taken by Sci-Fi channels (and others) when talking about creating movies from classic tales in the past few years. <br /> <br /> Disgusting !
