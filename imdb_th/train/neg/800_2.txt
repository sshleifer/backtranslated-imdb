In fact, this flick was created in 1999 with a relatively good production cost. The actors are charming and capable enough. There was no group of clowns running around, bursting out to spend hundreds of rounds. But never hit the meat Or having to chase a car / car that is worth thousands of dollars of beautiful machinery being dumped in a waste bin. <br /> <br /> The interior looks modern, respectable. There is a high-tech computer room decorated with what looks like a remnant from the 1950s electronics lab and the pancake make-up on the body makes me crack. Not a pancake makeup in normal sense. But what looks like a dry pancake dough will be hit on the exposed skin. This should support the idea that the body has consumed it completely - even if the virus makes the conversion sound as an exercise for students (viewers). <br /> <br /> Yes, the virus. Not the worst evidence for sci-fi horror flick that I know. But can't Computer viruses sent through the television screen (Or computer screen) and become a deadly disease? Let the Warp powered break. "Star Trek" is one thing. But photons become viruses? This is a stupid thing. "Scary factors" that do not want Flick may use one of the horrifying dream sequences that the deceased lives or has a cat jumping out of the closet or something because the thing that the virus doesn't do There is the same excuse for playing in this warp that Lord Oliver gave for some of his worthless places later. He needs money However, there is no other comparison between these two things.
