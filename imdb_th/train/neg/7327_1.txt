Morally strong Writers who use the character as a mouthpiece to speak for themselves, predictable, plan the plot (Saying five times faster) Children imitate Britney Spears. This movie has a special earmarks of negativity. <br /> <br /> I truly believe that Jesus Nebot and Julia Montejo are determined to create an emotional movie that Stimulate ideas in difficult situations Not always white people and blacks, people who are criminals by definition do not have to be bad humans and may have a reduced situation, especially when one has the well-being of a child first. However, their true intentions were combined with dialogue, preaching, and monotonous situations. Proper production costs and the use of interesting camera documentary images are not enough to achieve the goal when the script and the scene of the show is depressed. <br /> <br /> Logic is often compromised to create tension: so first Tried to blackmail Pablo to participate in her documentary in exchange for helping them escape and then, in the same breath, generally told him not to trust her because she didn't help them. From a selfish and I have to run for Pablo was stricken with a tantrum. Christina's well-being was important to him so he had to escape from being arrested and imprisoned or exiled for her. But he was ready to risk everything to appease her when she didn't want to go to Mexico right. Talk about raising children beyond their limits. Third, when Pablo's employer gave a phone call to Detective Bright, she was an unprofessional person, especially when she was in a senior position - did she think she was really persuasive? Oh yes, I have to change myself. Wims, a CCH Pounder detective, can wipe the floor with her. <br /> <br /> For justice, I want to list what I like. Um, I like dwarves. And i like the fact that dwarfs are sexy names There is always a cross dressing, a plus; Cross-dressing, young, no less! Harry is more lovely than Christina. But my favorite moment in the movie is when Christina kicks Detective Nobel-Bright. I also find it interesting that in the minority characters. (Which I am very grateful for now) The black characters are racist. Unfortunately, it has just been thrown out and not explored. <br /> <br /> There are outstanding and unofficial scores. But in general, context - not specific, does not increase the mood or tension in any scene except sad sadness Every time the main character is in anguish, as if they think that his performance will not show enough: 'In case you are not sure, he is not satisfied and we have musical evidence to prove it.' <br /> <br /> The arrogant clich√©d conversation causes a lack of abbreviations. Everything must be spelled out in the dialogue, even though the body language will remain until it is well conveyed. For example, Pablo speaks all of the impolite words and the mourning night that her children will not crawl with them in the morning. <br /> <br /> 'Papi told me about Mama. Again '- unscrupulous exhibition that blatantly introduces the deceased wife in general! (She was the most beautiful woman that the widow had seen as best he had ever met. Why don't we see a man crying like a woman like Shakespeare's - she may be fat, ugly? But the love you have for you is now. _There's_ is a story that will stimulate me. <br /> <br /> The police often walk one step forward so that many scenes give off-site feelings. Of the French story The pursuit of the most boring foot ever - Bright and Lightning looks cool and easy. (Of course, he was not as fast as lightning and she was fine. I didn't feel the need to spell it out.) Some men dragged along with the little children that endured the police. But after that the child was cut down to reference Margaret Cho. It was so sad. We have seen this in the story 'Cops'. <br /> <br /> Hackneyed and Deus ex machina that Hackney and the mercenary: As an employer, you are actually taking his green card examination because He can refer to the author. Inspiring to speak on posters behind your desk? <br /> <br /> There are many scenes, including the above, threatening to become porn: 'I will do this for you as long as What do you do for me ... 'I almost heard the word bowm-chicka-bowm-bowm <br /> <br /> When parents see pictures from Pablo's repentance, the sorrowful mother's sorrow is the most real thing that the movie feels. Unfortunately, this is diminished due to The fact that she looks full of his emotional words until she walks the missile The more suspicious looks will be more reliable. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid of the stupidity of the main characters doing things to see the plot: hold a convenience store bought by Do not wear a mask The grave of a dead girl And why my mother didn't remember his face when she saw him before he drove out! 'Do you look so familiar ...' <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of unnecessary scenes, worthless scenes with a soid and a bartender that has been improved? Character development? tch too late, <br /> <br /> Speaking of unnecessary traits that have never been taken, Lightning Detective says that the unbelieving detective is a bright Scorpio who reveals that he knows only a little mystery. any And I do not think that believing in fate is quite a qualification like Jumbo Voodoo mumbo. <br /> <br /> At the end, when Brite holds Pablo as he dies - wait, why are you interested now? Her character is not consistent with Sod's. She had to shoot him just because he said 'Stop or I'll shoot' (She cares about _so_much_ about her honesty until now). He doesn't have weapons. No need to force death. What happened to him shooting in the leg to make him unable to move? <br /> <br /> Finally, Cristina's innocent acceptance of her mother's death caused Dr. The knight was peaceful for the death of his daughter. And the planning of the family where the children were killed became Christina's new family ... causing me to be angry that she would be a 'replacement' for their little woman In addition, it is unrealistic that the white pair will accept the Latin daughter of the man who killed his daughter. I am not saying that a generous person will love someone who cannot do that. I just say that the characters here have never developed far enough for me to believe that _they_ will do that. <br /> <br /> I think it's disgusting that another IMDb investigator says, of course. The woman she was moved by the sappy scene. I am a woman who reserved my emotional movements during the time that does not refine the feelings in the manner produced. <br /> <br /> Co-writer, co-director, Nebot, actor That he himself wore Uncovered too much in this production, many people do not make the broth. But the only person who cooks alone may end up doing special after school. <br /> <br /> In summary, the name of this movie is less related to the story. Feeling sorry, useless, and losing, while revealing that you won't see your money again.
