This may be one of the worst movies ever created. Bad performances, bad special effects, bad plot, everything is not good. In the last 15 minutes, cats that are suitable for robots will be used, which disrupts everything. Malcom MacDowell requires payment. House values, because otherwise he will have to sell himself in Hollywood Blvd to pay. I just don't know how you go from Clockwork Orange to this shit and can look at yourself in the mirror every morning. I can make a special special effect in my bathtub without continuity. Editors must sleep. or Drugs are terrible. Acting. They must smoke badly or not. Guns, shoots, blue shoots or bullets make your mind, bitch and other women in the movie look very confused. It's called 2013 Seadly Wake Nothing related to movies
