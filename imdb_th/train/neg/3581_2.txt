I can't decide whether this movie is so bad or mention the name Enid Cole Slaw. "Very bad. It passed well and came back badly again." No matter how it forced me to look the same as the strange colored vomit pile, and there are many scenes that you won't forget even if you want to have a girl. Liotta, who scoffed, told Pia that there was a pigtail that won her creative writing looks like a penis. Later, a little more, Ray again attacked, not having the right shape. But as a rubber hose in the garden, one company told her mother that she wanted to go to sleep with Walter, Walter's old father. There are actresses in the cemetery scene with the best lines ever written by Pia or others: "WWWWHHYYYYYYYY!" There is a rubber plantation again while Walter waved to the face of Pia and Roar. "This is your favorite thing! There was a date and her date opened by the close-up of masticating each other. They started tearing each other's clothes. There was a shower but forgot to take off her dress. Perhaps the best thing is that there is a Pia typewriter, but there is a key with a small talking head of those who torture her the most. (After that I was afraid to open my laptop) and finally there was the "The Awards" revealing Hollywood for the toilet. It was the second best line separation ever. "I think I'm not the only one that has to go to the top." I saw that I spent more time commenting on "The Lonely Lady" than I had in a better image. Although being warned in advance that when you start watching, you may not be able to take your eyes off the screen until your life is gone for two hours.
