A heartbroken woman, everyone in the world can't prevent me from hitting the stop button for about a third of the way through this terrible garbage. With a bad performance, the script is as bad as CGI FX that is so bad to get together. This movie is an insult to the werewolves. It should be serious, which in itself will be funny if this movie can make it a bad joke. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies that people behind the camera. Apparently has the ability But too lazy to do something even one of the four appropriate Avoid expenses and watch one of the classic Werewolf movies instead. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10!
