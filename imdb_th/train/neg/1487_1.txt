Thanks to this movie, I can now answer that question. "What is the worst movie you've ever seen?" <br /> <br /> I can't miss the last second. A bad movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely nothing. Named the only element of horror and this film failed. To be honest, I see better on YouTube. This is a general conversation: <br /> <br /> "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve, are you?" "Steve, I'm not joking." " Steve is not a joke! "" Steve, are you there? "" Steve? "" Steve? "" Steve? "<br /> <br />" ARggh !!!! Ahhhhhh !! !! Nooooooo! "
