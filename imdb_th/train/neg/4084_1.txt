Every time you are welcomed, Jay Radio invites the listener to present the name of the movie that the audience cannot stand or never watch. This is a movie that I think ... many days later <br /> <br /> There is something about playing by Shakespeare. Not sure, but I think I was bailed in this movie for about 20 minutes. .. think I know that my toenails won't cut themselves and they look at me reluctantly to be cut. <br /> <br /> This movie looks boring and pretends to me < br /> <br /> Although this is the first movie I scored to (Which I try to see). Really, I won't do it. I want to take you out of other movies by Peter Greenaway, British film director. I remember thinking "The chef who stole his wife and his lover" is a truly excellent English film, although its contents are in a turbulent stomach - great movies. But I can understand why people stop looking at <br /> <br /> Another great movie about Greenaway is "A zed and two noughts". Again, there is some content that pushes the boundaries of tastes good But interestingly, however, <br /> <br /> Other movies that I often think are too late for the topic of such radio programs are "Brazil". Never see how to sleep all night. <br /> <br /> If you don't have a taste for your important movie, which is stylish, chic and attractive and difficult to follow Clear the Prosero book
