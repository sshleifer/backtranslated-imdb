This movie is the worst movie I've ever watched. It was like "Homework assignment" for movie classes It completely disappeared. Mark when it comes to "message". It tries to convey. The character is exaggerated. Bad performances and for the story ... It is the most ridiculous. The cover image is what makes me think it might be a good movie, a handsome actor and that's about it. The moral of this movie: Never judge this movie with cover! Save your time, money and energy and create a movie at your own home and you are better than me. It's very painful to watch and quite frankly I'm surprised that everyone will spend money to do and distribute!
