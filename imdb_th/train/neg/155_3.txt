This is not a big children's television movie, as far as I can tell. The villain is an espresso group that has a lot of chocolate coffee beans. It seems that this theory will be examined by the fact that the narrative is called 'Insomnia' When talking about the first civilization that is insomnia, I think "Wow! A film of devastating martial arts! "But without such luck Even if you have to consider it as an experimental film, when the villain is strangled with the old white eyebrows of the old man, Zu Warriors gives the same level of feeling that opens or closes the subtitles. That's not a good sign. I found that the special effects are somewhere between Ray Harryhausen and Xena: the original Warrior Princess.
