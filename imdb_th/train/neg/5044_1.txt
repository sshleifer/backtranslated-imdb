I am looking forward to watching this movie after reading positive reviews in the New York Times. In addition, I am also a Shanghai citizen, so there is more than interest in the past. However, after watching it, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Slow and boring movie timing, blood flowing. The director lingered in some scenes for too long. There is no passion or chemistry between couples. No conversation at all. The conversation is absolutely necessary to compensate for the lack of acting. At the end of the movie, you don't feel sympathetic to the characters at all. This film lacks everything. Weak script, poor performance and no editing The director tried to imitate some of the noir movies. But failed miserably A good movie is a movie that attracts attention and succeeds in concluding that you don't feel that time has passed. This movie feels as though it won't end. Don't waste money on this movie.
