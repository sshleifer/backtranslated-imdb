Does not match my type. Action Street fighting style, this DVD match is what I found because there was a friend placed while we had a few beers. I'm quite open-minded and a fan of Eamonn Walker, so I'm ready to enjoy myself. <br /> <br /> Blood and bones are the story of Isiah Bone, a former person who turns into a road. The fighter for the unclear reason which was finally revealed when the movie proceeded. Blah blah blah <br /> <br /> A boring movie. I understand that movies like this do not depend on planning. But do they need to have stupid, predictable and foolish stories? It may not matter. But the gum will annoy me There is no plot and better action than a small group of beasts combined with unfounded and complete psychological feelings. It is equivalent to a turkey cinema. Some skin is packed with internal organs. Rotten At this point, I should talk about the exact thing. The drawing point of this film is fighting. Even on its own, the fight is quite bad. Bone manages to bring a strong and strong street fighter in a single fight. (A large or two people are the humorous efforts of the filmmakers to resolve this inconsistency.) The fighters never conclude that one by one is a foolish trick. Although this is repeated and stupid, the broken arm and the face kicked with agility that allows us to see time and time again. <br /> <br /> This film is a popular movie. Go straight to the DVD status, do absolutely nothing and everything we see again and again And not particularly good
