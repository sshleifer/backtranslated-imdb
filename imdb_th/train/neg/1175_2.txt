Rohmer's digital technology is used to 'fill' the background. Sometimes it works well. The scene in which Grace and her maid's witness from a distance, the execution of the king, is remarkable. Sometimes it makes the movie look strange, similar to home videos. However, the major failure is the true mistake of the scene. Mise en creates a strange effect in the viewer. We know that what we see is not true, so how do we feel about the characters? I don't care what happened to Lady or Duke. <br /> <br /> Other important failures I regret to say that Lucy Russell's acting in the lead role is She is in almost every scene and success, or in this film, depending on her performance. Ok, she is speaking a foreign language. But she cannot express her true emotions Showing her emotions in the scene that she told her friend, Mme de Meyler (a great performance from the launch of Helena Dubiel) when seeing the head on the pole, causing an embarrassing laugh among the audience Watch her hands when she shows emotions! <br /> <br /> All in the movie is very disappointing.
