First of all, let me say that this is not a movie for people who are looking for something lively and fun for the holidays. This film is cold, cruel, and completely depressing. Mary Steenburgen plays the dirty mother on Christmas because her husband is unemployed. They are losing their homes and can't buy Christmas gifts for children. holiday Then Harry Dean Stanton as Gideon angel Christmas hat and dark coat he come off like a child pedophile hanging around children, nothing is better. Cultivating the Christmas spirit in Mary Steenburgen rather than killing her family and proposing to bring them back if she believes in Christmas again. Santa Claus is a blackmailer and his Christmas workshop looks like a paradise for Nazi refugees on the ship. This film puts everything so thick that you don't care that the happy ending will happen because other films are bitter and unbelievable. I'm sure this movie wants to be something Capra too. But it makes happiness and confidence in what holiday movies should be
