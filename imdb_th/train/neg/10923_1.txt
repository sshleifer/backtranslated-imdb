A TV movie about the ancient Egyptian curse brought to the United States in the 20th century during the filming of DeMille's first 10 commandments and was awakened again when DeMille's scenes were dug up in the desert. > <br /> One of the worst things The movie I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> The question is serious filmmaker or joking when they make this movie? If this is a serious matter, it is a movie that is not laughing and is a great movie for choosing bad stories. If it is a funny movie that is not good But it's funny for all the wrong reasons. You will laugh at and watch this movie for a long time and maybe more than any other "comedian" in Hollywood.
