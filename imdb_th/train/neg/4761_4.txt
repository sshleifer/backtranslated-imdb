Harold Pinter wrote Anthony Schaeffer's classic drama about a man who would visit his lover's husband. Original movie starring Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine Ken has a role in this version of Olivier and he has paired with Jude Law. Here, the movie is directed by Kenneth Branaugh. <br /> <br /> The performance is very beautiful. Both Ken and the law are gangsters in their roles. I like chemistry and personality clashes. It's great and reasonably enough to look at the direction of the messy script. <br /> <br /> The dialog box of Harold Pinter is sharp and sharp, and often very witty and I understand why he chose to write the script. New drama The problem is that the script moves horribly around the character. Michale Caine walks the law through his exotic modern house with sliding doors and no good reason to bloom. Conversations occur repeatedly at various locations. I know that Pin has done that in his plays. But in this case it's boring Why do we have to have them both over and over again, the fact that the law is lying with Ken's wife? It would be fine if in some respects Law says that we have done enough. But he doesn't do like every time for the first time The script didn't move Ken through dealing with all good rules. To begin with, he was angry to start, so he had no chance to turn back and scare us. (Don't think too much about revealing a game that makes you wonder why he has to pay attention). In the traditional way, we never doubt what happened. Here we do and while it gives the edge, it feels guilty because it is clear. We are forced to wonder why Milo's Milo does not see that he was set up. There are a few examples that will tell you more. <br /> <br /> Thinking about the past, I think it is a movie that has a chance and cannot be missed. The wasted opportunity is an opportunity to have a better fireworks between Ken and the law. Countless times in the selection of luxurious settings and strange shifts in the plot that lead to the creation of tension and excitement But we get intelligent conversations and great performances in movies that do not let them come true. <br /> <br /> Despite the great performances and excellent conversations, this is just 4 out of 10. Because the remaining script just doesn't work
