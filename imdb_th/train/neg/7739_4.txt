Remember when Harrison Ford was the greatest star in Hollywood because he made a great movie? Those days feel like far more memories. <br /> <br /> While "Hollywood Homicide" is not scary at all. It is a funny movie that is not particularly funny and action movies that are not particularly exciting. Too much digest cannot cover the weaknesses of the central storyline. At the very least, Ford, at least, seems to have more fun with himself than is his last few projects and he can show movies Almost always, Hartnett is sufficient, but he and Ford are not Newman and Redford as far as chemistry is concerned. <br /> <br /> All in all. "Murder in Hollywood" is a reasonable distraction. Take Ford out and it is not like that.
