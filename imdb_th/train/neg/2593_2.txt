American Pie: Beta House is a game of type Limbo that is between types. On the other side, it's a joke that doesn't have a plot and has a joke. On the other hand, it's a soft porn that can be viewed. Basically, Beta House is a collage of sex scenes - some humiliation is a joke for others - with some points thrown in an effort to collaborate. The character has almost no two dimensions. Most of the development relies on the knowledge of Naked Mile and the "important" plot scene is so far apart that you wonder why the writer feels the story. <br /> <br /> In all fairness, I'm not going to watch this movie without expectation. I like three original American Pie movies and think that the Band Camp and Naked Mile are good rentals. I think Naked Mile is almost good enough to be released in theaters and when I see that some of the same characters come back Beta House I'm excited to see it now. I know that there are many scenes of intoxication and sexual humiliation in many forms. And I'm okay, because in the past these scenes were supported by stories and combined with the plot However, in the Beta House, almost as if the writer had forgotten why the formulas in other AP movies were working, they used too much energy to nudge, which they forgot to write. This story is disappointing and not worth the one dollar rent. The jokes are crippled. This story doesn't exist and the porn looks too tame if that's all you really care about.
