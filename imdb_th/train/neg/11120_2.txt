You know that this movie is not good when its highlight is seeing a short period of "Jeopardy!" <br /> <br /> The most sad thing about White Men Can't Jump is it. Has enormous potential For many years I lived in the area quite like the picture in this movie. High racial tensions and basketball are meaningful to everyone. Movies about members of This "basketball culture" is very interesting. But the mediocre performances and bad scripts in the White Men Can't Job have left something to be desired. <br /> <br /> The sequence of the movie is cyclical. First, Billy may win or lose money. By playing basketball games Then he returned to his home and went on a trip with his girlfriend; And the process is repeated Most stories are built for the highest point of some types, but the "key points" I see are just another sequence of repetitions (in this case "Billy wins or loses money by playing a basketball game"). br>> In order for the plot to be developed, need to fix some problems And this dilemma must be interesting if the film is interesting as well Clearly, the White Men Can Jump author didn't forget this rule because the plot can be concluded that "Billy has to pay" I admire the change of rhythm from other sports movie formulas. But - I'm sorry. Really scary I will receive less care if Billy gets the money to pay for his apartment rental. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, the White Men Can't Jump is a successful movie. Obviously, there are some sports fans who will cancel scary writing for some scenes with basketball in them. Others, I'm sure being tempted by the big names that play the leading role. This made me wonder if the actor was replaced by an unknown actor before and the basketball theme was replaced by lacrosse. Who will go to watch this movie? I don't think so. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie two stars in ten; Special star for "Danger!", A scene that made me wake up for a few minutes.
