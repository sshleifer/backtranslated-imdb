I admit that when I was older in the hippie-dippy era, I was soulful for this type of movie. I can enjoy the hippies of the hippie genre more than most "normal" people. However, this film is just scary in every way. <br /> <br /> Every recognition of the idiotic hippie is presented as a gospel. Police killed a young long hair when he landed peacefully. This movie is so scary that it's not funny to see a fool on the hippie nose. It's like Dragnet, the left wing model, except for no professional actors. The only reason I gave these two stars is because there is confusion in the soundtrack. In addition, I can't find a negative star option. <br /> <br /> No actor, almost without a shaking plot. Even the script ... You understand, it's a "art" movie .... All of this is done at the depths of the root canal excavation. Drag the scenes that are meaningless to fill the time. <br /> <br /> The art of imitating strange life, celebrities "The person who did not do" movie joined the community in real life and robbed a bank in Boston, one of his co-bandits was killed and he was sent to prison where he was killed in a suspicious weight lifting "accident." .... and just think that he must leave this thing as a heritage ...
