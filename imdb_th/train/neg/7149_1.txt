Anyone who writes "Redline" as a great car movie must be rewarded by Daniel Sadek to promote this special craze flame. The worst motor vehicle movie or movie that has been created easily 80 Put special effects and weak characters without relevance. Not writing screenplays and making movies But should be in the real estate business <br /> <br /> This is a lame movie that has a lame plot and action scenes that have never been done before. What offended me was not that the creator of this film was an idiot. But they think that the movie revealed to the public will be an idiot enough to fall in love with it.
