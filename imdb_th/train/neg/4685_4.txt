Until the last few minutes of the movie, I will rate 7 or 8 stars. However, the ending is terrible and "Hollywoodized" destroys the integrity of the first 80% movie. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a submarine and the possibility that they are ordered to shoot their nuclear missiles. Captain, Gene Hackman , Intended for the launch, while his first Denzel Washington confirmed the first launch order The problem is the launch of both the captain and the 1st officer must use the shot button at the same time. Hackman is determined to launch, and Washington stands firmly until finally the result of armed riots on the ship. Eventually, the error was discovered and the launch of the missile was not cold. However, this is not a true part. After they landed in front of the Washington and Hackman Audit Committee (who just spent half the movie trying to kill each other), holding hands and being close friends! Ha?! Trilogy, ending to make movies valuable for me.
