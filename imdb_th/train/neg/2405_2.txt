This film deserves a revision about the Mystery Science Theater, although it has nothing to do with King Solomon. But it is worth watching because it is a really insolent riot! It's worse than "destroying all the monsters". Don't forget to check the following: The magic coin (looks like the Shriners here). Norfolk polyester jackets that are clearly visible on "Allan Quatermain" David MaCallum stuttering. (Which attracts attention from worse performances). Unbelievably bad processes work with "Monster" Every monster - a hand puppet that attacked a young woman, a giant snake at the menall Macallum, while he sank in the bright red oatmeal on the crab motor, hilariously amazing. It looks like it is made of plywood that is mounted on the old dredge sand and seems to be left from Jr.Sr prom ("Journey to the Future with '71"), Phoenician City - where they wear their armor. Roman Empire But there are mysterious things that the Egyptian hieroglyphics - (Phoenician invented the alphabet letter come!) And the worst of all, Macallum and Ekland (along with her horrible wig). Play the kissing face - Oh, horror! The best part is that brave explorers can lose French cartoons and African men. -Snuffleupagus Or whatever - apparently choosing to die bravely instead of being in the scene anymore
