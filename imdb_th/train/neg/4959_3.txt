Remember the Batman animation of ol? People who appreciate? Can people of all ages appreciate it? A man who shows Batman as a real detective instead of a hulk in a bat costume? People with villains that you can relate to Are people with bad characters with real motives? <br /> <br /> Clearly, Warner Bros. can't. So this wreck. <br /> <br /> What do these people know about Batman? Have they ever watched Batman before? Do they know that Batman means being a 'detective'? Combining 2 clues doesn't make you a detective! That makes you a little smart monkey. <br /> <br /> This is the basic layout for the episode: <br /> <br /> Penguins steal something. 'Credit opening' Batman finds a dead premium that he is. Batman goes there and has a commercial problem. Batman finds a clear / silly solution. Penguin escapes. Penguins do nothing clear again. Batman follows. They do kung fu. (According to how everyone and I mean everyone knows kung fu for some reason) Penguin of Batman Punch He was knocked out to arkham. (Note: It is often a different villain in every episode.) <br /> <br /> As you may have noticed, then Batman is not a great detective. "Joker left this cotton candy on the floor. Maybe he was at the old amusement park"! Yes, he was there 6 times. <br /> <br /> And I talked about this, but everyone knows KUNG-FU! Both penguins! What are they thinking (Maybe because someone who created Jackie Chan's animated series) <br /> <br /> The thing that really makes me upset is that acting is just an action. There are no smarts. If the military wants Thinking he will use technology and do a little kung fu. <br /> <br /> But wait, don't forget the villain. After that, the military officer would be like if he didn't have his own gallery. <br /> <br /> First of all, I must say glorious for originality. I do not think other Batman media will have fantasy jokers and scary monkeys that have locked Riddler like Emo and Ivy poisoning as a minor. (Which is quite confusing when you think about her sexuality Her main strengths?) <br /> <br /> What's more interesting is that every character now is a devious 2 dimensional dimension game. <br /> <br /> EG < br /> <br /> The Killer Croc wants to make Gotham overwhelmingly unreasonable. <br /> <br /> Man-Bat is a mad scientist who is crazy about bats for some reason that cannot be explained. <br /> <br /> Penguins just want to steal everything without reason. <br /> <br /> Notice the pattern <br /> <br /> But the most insult must be Mr Freeze. <br /> <br /> Can you remember the Emmy award? Win the episode 'Heart of Ice' from Batman: The Animated Series. What makes you Freeze is the motivation for his crime? A very good episode used in his original comic book. (Mad scientist)? Does the person who makes him fall victim with a goal? Hell, even Batman and Robin agree that using that as you hold in the POS movie <br /> <br /> This set says "F # ck" and makes Mr Freeze rob the jewelry. Before the accident, with only the wealth of his heart, then being frozen and giving the power to cool things down. Then he continued to steal the gems while saying sh! T line like " Have a ice day "<br /> <br /> Maybe they look at Batma n & Robin After that <br /> <br /> but he looked at the bright side This series makes you feel nothing for the villains. That means you are a good person for you.
