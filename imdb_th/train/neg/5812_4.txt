"This story is dedicated to women," according to the instructions "who fought for their rights since Adam and Eve started the loose leaf system" when "politics" was filming the nineteenth amendment guaranteeing the voting rights of Women are only a decade. And movies related to the political power of women as a vote group The prohibition of sponsorship and the closing of the liquor store is important for women at that time. <br /> <br /> The good-natured Marie Dresser (While Hattie Burns) had political behavior after the girl was shot and killed. And was drafted in the mayor's action after delivering an effective speech to the congregation of women. Ms. Dressler was supported by her close friend, Polly Moran. (As in Ivy Higgins) and her husband Roscoe Ates stuttering Dresler (as Peter Higgins) escapes. The mayor of the town draws controversy from the people in the city; So Dressler ordered the women to stop the strike, denying "everything" in the "living room, bedroom and bath room". <br /> <br /> This film sounds much better than you see. Humor, frankly, not too good. And there are some situations that are inappropriate and not appropriate enough ("You look like Madame Queen" means the character Amos and Andy) and the mix between the shot and the slap is not compatible now. Producers may consider making movies more dramatic, focusing on the dressler and characters played by William Bakewell (as Benny Emerson) and Karen Morley (as Myrtle Burns). <br /> <br /> **** Politics (7/25/31) Charles Reisner ~ Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Roscoe Ates
