As if there were not enough people floating at that time, we came here again to imitate GODFATHER from the director of IL CONSIGLIORI (1973) which I watched earlier this year. The name that is highly valued at this time is Telly Savalas, who entered the judicial process and saw for the first time from behind, quite concentrated on his flowers and wearing a beret in a French painter style! In addition to not having the slightest view of Sicily, he does not have any accents other than his familiarity. Antonio Sabato therefore made it an unlikely connoisseur besides being an irresistible actor. His relationship with Savalas, who became a father who flicked his eyes, was unbelievable. (Especially when he became a lover associated with a lively teenage niece)! In addition, for the gangster flick, there are little actions that are worth talking about and nothing in a memorable way. (Although the final scene of the clinic scene is well managed); In addition, scores from Francesco De Masi provide benefits. But nothing else Incidentally, the basement DVDs that I bargain for rent begin to drop out through credit so that there are no cast members - or even movie titles - on the list!
