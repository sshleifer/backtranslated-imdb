I heard a lot about this movie that it's great and one of the movies of the early 80's that most fans of slasher movies have to watch. I rented it and I must say that although it still keeps the attention as much as most slasher movies like "April Fools Day", "Friday 13th" and "Prom Night" but this movie may be correct. Above with the above mentioned just But the lack of enthusiasm and true potential from the characters, including the stories that are in progress The character that I find unfortunately in this movie is a strange guy with curly hair that crawls around the dormitory and definitely leads to his true air role at the end when he encounters a murderer. Also, a man who looks dirty and dirty with a gene jacket, he may play more roles in this movie that may make the movie more interesting instead of a movie played with this man because it is another loser. With his girlfriend, and then lowered his part and cut him off until the end, which was rubbish, I was disappointed in his part in the end As long as the true identity of the murderer proceeds when the person is released, who he is, I laugh. But it was obvious and he threw himself out of himself The real intention is revealed. This movie should be at least once a look for slasher fans, but don't spend your money getting it in hard, hard to find, something to find.
