Nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Then, the characters that don't have no personality develop. <br /> <br /> The end will not come because there is no beginning and not in the middle. <br /> < br /> There is a beautiful shock that makes it unattractive because it is not allowed because this film doesn't have "no" in this movie because there is no story or character or theme or concept or symbol or conversation or dialog Or issues What! <br /> <br /> There are advantages: have a good soundtrack But the sound editing is good, and the right movie is to watch it, not worth your time, so if you're really interested, I recommend going to buy a soundtrack or something. You will get everything you can do from this movie without being tired, headache and impatient. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
