Gee is a movie that sucks! ... I said that I wanted to be an expert in bad movies for decades. So I decided to start with this. It's a pretty alternative. I joined this adventure to find missing gems and masterpieces that I didn't understand. But I don't see anything in this pastel color Previously, I had never watched a bad movie before. But I have the feeling that this is what is called "very bad." It may be because it's so funny! First of all, there is inaccuracy. There are inaccuracies about the plot, physical inaccuracies and psychological errors. Especially after that, there is insanity like Van Damme's cheeks in blue spandex. There are very tacky lines as well and I will not start talking about some hilarious movements. There are no bad performances from everyone involved in the film, except for the specific cases. Jeffrey Lewis looks completely pathetic as Frank, who is the most stupid character. And to tell the truth, I was very surprised to see that Van Damme worked well in playing twins. He succeeded in obtaining different tones and emotions in two roles that convinced me. But most movies are terrible and the sad part is that it was produced by an important movie studio ... which is now bankrupt.
