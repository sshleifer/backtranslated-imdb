With too much violence in this movie, it should be NC-17, but the blood seems to be a pg-13 and there is a lot of oaths when the mother has a bad male friend who has the original silver gray hair. There are many character development which makes the movie look better. After that, the child comes to life again as a scarecrow. There are unconscious hours and ten minutes to kill people. That violence is too much and I think the number of bodies is higher than twelve, which is a lot for movies like this. Almost every character in the movie is stabbed or cut off. But the teacher called him "White trash" and "hoodlum" (although the character Leicester is anything but a hoodlum is not good. I know the hat and part. The hood they did not draw in the class, sitting there and throwing stuff on the teacher) The teacher deserves a gruesome death than every character. But was stabbed in the back There are two suspicious scenes in the movie. But not long enough to be scary As I said that killing is too much and sometimes people who are not involved in the story are cut off. If the blood looks really fun, it would be nc-17. Two children describe the body found in the fields. They explain that it has a better condition than they actually describe to the police that there are worms crawling in the gut. His stomach was not opened, so there was no worm in his stomach even though I wanted to see it. The show was so pathetic. The character was defeated and the scarecrow was able to do a lot of gymnastix stunts. I would suggest renting this movie for the death scene. I won't see it again soon, but I like too much violence. In addition, don't worry about the sequel. I watched five minutes and got bored until death. Sounds good but not the original scarecrow.
