I usually do not comment. But there are things to say Where to start ... <br /> <br /> Jeremy London's performance is terrible! I don't think he is so bad. The plot should be well-directed with good performances from leading actors. Unfortunately, this film is one of the movies you read and thinks it has the potential to be fun. But was disappointed from the beginning. <br /> <br /> At least I laughed well. I will not waste time if I am you.
