While the film has a bad smell of bad movies But it seems surprisingly many levels First of all, for an old movie fan, it's interesting to see the role led by Dean Jagger (not having a relationship with Mick) while Jagger continues to have a very respectable role as a supporting actor. (Although receiving the Oscar in this category for 12 O'CLOCK HIGH) Here is his performance unlike any other, because he has a full head of hair earlier) and because he is a bad actor The most in the movie This film shows that if an actor cannot perform in his previous movie, it does not mean that he cannot finally learn to be an excellent actor. Another good example of this phenomenon is Paul Newman, whose first film (THE SILVER CHALICE) is one of the worst films of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> The second reason to watch the movie. This is the horror of it all, poor writing, poor performances and bad special effects. For example, when Jagger and the Cambodian without a name were on the water, it was clear that they were walking in and the background was not expected. In addition, when they leave the water, their costumes are 100% dry !!! The terrifying continuity and unbelievable bad conversations have occurred throughout the story - so it's hard to imagine why they didn't ask Bela Lugosi or George Zucco to star in this movie. In many ways, this is a perfect example for a class about ways to not make movies. <br /> <br /> So while giving 3 can be a little bit generous. Fun to laugh at And short, so it's worth watching for a bad movie fan
