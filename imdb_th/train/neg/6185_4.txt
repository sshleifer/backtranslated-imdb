My first comment of the year 2010 is "Into The Blue 2: The Reef". This story is about two divers, played by Chris Carmac and Laura Van der Wart. Exploring the hidden treasure at the bottom of the local coral reef One day after the survey date, they were paired by David Anders and Marsha Thomason. They told the young divers that they wanted to hire them to explore the coral reefs and find rare artifacts about Columbus's hidden treasures. Reporting at the bottom of the coral reef <br /> <br /> The next day, the bottom of the coral reef and rough after a day of diving, they found nothing. A few days ago and the two hired divers found that they were part of a serious plot that they could not escape, otherwise they would be killed. They were hired to find two large containers. One consists of a nuclear reactor and another consisting of axes. <br /> <br /> This film has a story about others. (Brother of the leading character) trying to fix things with my girlfriend. I think this part This story is a waste of time and also includes a very hot sex scene between couples that I completely lost and do not need to show. <br /> <br /> But apart from this The movie has good underwater photography and has a harmonious color, which is why it has received 4 stars. Into The Blue 2 is the sequel of the title only. No actor or original character returned. In any way, it has a stupid plot, stupid characters and boring important points.
