This is a relatively low budget, which was created for the TV, the type of movie intended to take advantage of the original success. I am a big fan of b-movies and this may be good if they don't attach the name "cube" to it because as the director and the original plot are better and this movie destroys me. Taste the whole set The characters are annoying and lament. There are problems with continuity. The story rarely gets an opportunity to develop because of an exaggerated dialogue and suffering from it. They use the same horror features more or less and throughout the movie, and because the first one is very good, this becomes a disappointment. <br /> <br /> If this is a stand-alone b-movie, I might give you an estimate Four "1" ratings that I give are quite a lot of instructions about how to make the effect and intelligence completely compared to the first version.
