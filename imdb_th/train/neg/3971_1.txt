Give me money back! Give my life too! Request a little credit This movie is worth vomiting. Useless and time consuming It's a waste of energy and completely pointless. Ok, I understand the place and the sound of ideas. But let us rest! Next time just give me money and let me spend. A child struck by a mother, remorse, blame her husband! Traditional thinking ~! living! Sorry, but this movie made me waste my time, money and well-being. I want to see cooking eggs! There is no real explanation of why this happened. Prison? why? Loss? Clear, but why do the duties deserve. I'm doing here. Oscar and movies. I'm doing this for wages or not. How much did this movie make money? This stupid fool hired enough copies.
