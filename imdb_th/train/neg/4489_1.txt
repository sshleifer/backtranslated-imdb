`The Matrix 'Is an exciting summer blockbuster that is visually wonderful But there is a curious idea that provokes the idea of ​​'Twilight Zone'-ish. The general rule applies here - and this sequel does not match the previous model. Moreover, it doesn't compare to it. <br /> <br /> `Re-load 'on the screen in the most unprofessional way. In a few seconds, opening the first impression is generally good, because Trinity was fired in the dream immediately. After that, the dive film on the nose after the first 45 minutes of disaster, it gradually increased as they entered the matrix. And Agent Smith's battle will happen, but it will lose all speed when it's time to chase the car for 14 minutes and even worse when wailing at the end The worst is the scene where "Zion Rave" is not long. Not only does it not only involve the plot. But is also a pathetic excuse for porn music and sad dance music. <br /> <br /> The bulleted aspect of 'The Matrix' is a good addition, but in `'reload' They use too much to make it look boring. The first time there was an interesting change But here it is too linear to be interesting from a distance In general, this film is just a series with a variety of styles that make us unable to know how empty it is. It works on the wrong principles, the bigger the better. It seems that the franchise "The Matrix" has descended from special techniques that mislead other franchises, such as the fairy tale `Star Wars. <br /> <br /> The performance standards are not good. Most The best character of the course goes to Hugo Weaving's 'Agent Smith', the only one that is a little interesting. Keanu Reeves is a real Neo, but in all special effects there is a small space that can make a lot of impact. Academy Award winner Lawrence Fishburne was reduced to just a monotonous mentor with a bad conversation. Carrie Ann Moss, as an action chick, could do it. Better by other actors <br /> <br /> Poor movies and being combined `The Matrix Reloaded 'is a disappointing story. People who do not like the first person should not flock together. This is for dead fans only. Even in the sub-genre of films, special effects bonanzas (Minority report, Matrix, etc.) This is still quite bad. My IMDb rating: 4.5 / 10
