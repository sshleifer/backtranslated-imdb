It was a powerful start when Julia Roberts's character was punched by a contemptuous husband and played by Patrick Bearkin and I felt ready to experience the powerful movie in Same level as Farrah As concluded that I was the wrong person This film is nothing like the powerful Burning Bed and Farrah plays a part of the woman you truly feel and feels the pain and desire to survive. Sleeping with the enemy drifting after the first act of cheap excitement, with Robert pretending to die to escape her husband and to live in Iowa. At first, her husband believed she was dead. But began to suspect that she might be alive and leave after her The rest of the movie is a cat and mouse game in which Julia gets a house in a small town in Iowa and changes her identity .... There is no mention of her course getting money for this, but at this point in Film I didn't care about that much. She met a man (Nice wimpy) and fell in love with him and her husband was over. But not before he handled her canned soup and stretched the kitchen up This is me, assuming that it will give a cheap excitement to the audience. But I didn't care much if she was a abused wife because the movie, as I said, cheated the audience. If it is still in the path that I may feel to her and her situation Of course, the husband was killed and everything was good for the little Robert. If the real world is something close to this .... See Burning Bed and you understand which movies should be seen as a matter of domestic abuse.
