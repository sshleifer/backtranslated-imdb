I agree that I have to move fast through this badly transferred DVD after about 30 minutes - nothing happens and everyone has explained the "plot" but there is someone talking about the opening scene - butcher knife. Stabbed through the wig and it is plugged into the grass in the front yard! I guess the tiny boy did that. It never explained. The opening of the trippy really. <br /> <br /> I hope this is a better movie written or thought out because of what we left if cute. boring It's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> I want to see the updated version and if there is a video missing, I want to see if it can help or not. Otherwise, it is the best odd little movie if it passes quickly!
