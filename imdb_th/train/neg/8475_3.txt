(Note: I think I will be the only person who writes what I do below. But I see other people here agree. I think it's very clear - this is to disprove the victim-cat bits - however, this is what I have written :) <br /> <br /> The owner has left the holiday For two weeks - traveling to California - letting the cat (Sylvester) be alone and locked in the house. That means no milk But the cat for his relief was found with canned tuna However, for his fear, he could not find an open place. <br /> <br /> It turned out that the little rats in the house had it ... and also took the cat. This is a rodent that teases Sylvester by opening and throwing it out at the last moment. Sylvester tried everything he could to open the tuna cans, but couldn't do it. <br /> <br /> This is a frustrating story and why they make the sadistic mouse "a good man." "That is above me It's like Tom & Jerry's cartoon that Tom, the worst, is usually the worst, although many times the little mouse starts to conflict!
