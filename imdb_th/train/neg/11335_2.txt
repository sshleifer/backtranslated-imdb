Recently I watched Belle Epoque, thinking that it was great because it won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. I was a little disappointed by the predictability and simplicity of the movie. Perhaps the conflict that occurred with me from the time of filming until now, plotting the story of a man who falls in love with a beautiful woman. In addition to the predictions of the plot, some scenes in the film do not feel like the story (Such as some events at the wedding) sometimes this film preached in its thoughts and in relation to the Franco era, movies were created and churches The only thing that the movie did was a lovely moment. The scenery and characters of Violetta were strong and independent women at a time when women were not really involved in those features.
