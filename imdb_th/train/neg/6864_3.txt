There is a little bottom spoiler which can destroy the surprise of an unexpected and funny comedy ONE scene in this movie. In addition, there is information about the first movie in this series. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on DVD, which was given as a gift to my roommate. It comes with the first movie in the "Blind Dead" series. <br /> <br /> The film is worse than the first movie, "La Noche del Terror Ciego". Changed a lot In the boot, this movie was dubbed in English. (The first part is the subtitle) which I often find that there is a distraction. <br /> <br /> The idea behind the series is in the past, the Templar branch. Participate in evil and secret rituals From the discovery of these crimes, local farmers ordered the Templars to die in a way that could no longer be used to prevent them from returning to hell for revenge. Then we crossed over to the present day because of certain events. The Templars arose from death in order to exact revenge on them for the villagers whose ancestors made them confused at first. Of course, since the knights without wings, they have no eyes, they can find their victims when they make a noise. <br /> <br /> The Templars are a secret order since about the 12th century. 150 years before they were suppressed in the early 1300s by the Pope and others because they were secret, so there were always rumors about their ceremonies. Each one for a start. In addition, due to the method of organizing society, you do not need a church staff to take care of things, which means that they are not insiders when things heat up. And because of the nature of their trials, they were tortured in confessions The order is strongest in France. But there are in Portugal and Spain where this movie happened. <br /> <br /> At the first film there was a sacrifice and a virgin virgin drinking blood directly from the innocent body. Of course, this is a horror movie after that. The image of the breast here) Then, when the knights come to life again, they attack their victims by eating them both and sucking blood. In the sequels of this story, this thing will disappear altogether. You still have the same scene. (Repeat is not the same image) of them who sacrificed the virgin. But they drained blood into the bowl and drank from it So when they come back, they just hack people with their swords or nail people to die, which I have to say is a less effective way to annoy your audience. There is also a time issue: in the first film, dating is very close to Templar. Here, they are saying that this is the 500th anniversary of the farmers who burned them in the stew The Templars lost their eyes too. At first, they peck They are now burnt and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Oh yes and maybe it's just me. But there seems to be a lot of people from the first film that appeared in this movie (even having to die) is not really a problem because this movie is completely different and not a sequel in terms of continuity. But strange, no one else. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this movie is the rich that is used. The child will distract the man while he breaks the jeep. This boy's father was sucked by this rich man in an attempt to get a jeep, so he walked out and told her to find her father. It's quite out of the blue and is the most fun scene in the movie. Of course, why the child does not die now is beyond me and disappointed for the horrible fans. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie to anyone. It wasn't so bad that it became a joke, so it became a common horror movie. Most of this film has many people hiding in the church, each trying to go alone to escape the surrounding blind. When the movie ends, you won't be surprised by the results. In fact, quite disappointed. If you enter the novelty of watching Spanish horror movies, watch the first movie, at least creative and not expecting results.
