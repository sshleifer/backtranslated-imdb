I'm totally confused. I'm a big fan of Seagal for 25 years. I've watched all his movies and dozens of times. I can describe this movie as "Wacky" only. Steven Seagal shared the screenplay writing and created credit for this film. But I had a very hard time believing that he would choose to voice his own voice in many of his chapters. What I didn't receive was if they had to dub some of his vocals. Appeared in the rest of their voice I expect Seagal to be the same as the rest of us. But Segal in this movie hardly revealed the same sentiment, courage, charm and sex appeal, so he easily showed us in all his previous films. What I found missing was mostly his attitude of self-confidence and his bad laughing which easily transformed into a lovely smile. Where is your attitude and charm that makes him a big celebrity ??? I hope that this movie will not indicate what Seagal has left for us - if so, his entire life will have to admit that the Seagal that we know and love is lost.
