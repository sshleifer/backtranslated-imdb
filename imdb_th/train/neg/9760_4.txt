The filming team was unable to reach the occupied territory well, so filming on the Israeli side was dominated. I was impressed with the completely different view of my mother. The Israeli mother lost a child who had a very happy life. Palestinian mothers lost children who had the possibility of personal life and despair. With a completely different perspective, any meeting has no real opportunity to meet each other. The word "peace" does not have the same meaning for each person. Peace to Palestinians is freedom. Peace to Israel is safety. With this bottom of the abyss, is this movie really valuable? I finished with the feeling that I had watched propaganda that was pointless - both sides were unreliable.
