I want to like a pillow book Interesting storyline, interesting character outline, Ewan Macgregor in total glory. Unfortunately I hate every minute Greenaway is attracted to the presentation of movies that are unique and do not benefit movies. I won't get into the deepest performances of Vivian Wu. <br /> <br /> You get the attention of a story with 4 billion small windows, images and letters that are rolled on the bottom of the screen. That shows the lyrics of the song being played It seems that he has not seen the presentation of the real story and developed the plot, and has been involved in the decoration of Fu Fu, which has nothing to do with anything. It's quite similar to the presentation of John Singer Sargeant in the lively Hallmint frame, which says "GRANDMA LOVES ME!" In a big sparkling character. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be the death of the ego Director of director instead of what it may be - beautiful, disturbing and frightening In the hands of another director (Jeunet? Coppola). It may be a masterpiece In Greenaway's hand, it is the best relegation in the Fine Arts class that is too serious.
