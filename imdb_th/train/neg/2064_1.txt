Oh, dear, as Chevy Chase and the gang that SNL created a new peak with the sketching style, this thing failed miserably at every level. Fortunately, Chevy is almost none of this and can't be blamed for. This rag It was very serious, very bad, even though it was a political comment about the United States at the time of the release (1974). The sketches are too long and the friction effects that they may have disappeared because they were pulled out to the point of being completely boring. This is a credit when the Chevy movie launches, and I'm happy to say that everything he did after this was better. Avoid though being curious
