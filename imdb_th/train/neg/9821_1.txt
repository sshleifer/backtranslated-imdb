Often I watch movies that are scary like this movie. I continue to watch every minute. Hopefully this will be a joke only to find that it intends to be serious. Seriously, like this type, <br /> <br /> The acting is shameful and the situation is horribly planned and clich√©d. If the movie was created in the 1920s (for example) and the quality of Hide & Seek (Cord) in its direction, we would think that the theater was innocent. It happened. This movie was created in 2000 and I haven't seen a movie from a quiet, charming era like this movie. <br /> <br /> Definitely not for serious movies. > [Not worth the score]
