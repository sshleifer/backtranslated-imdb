John Wayne Lone, the first actor in the Western world, has more possibilities than all the Owen dramas that Wayne created for Lone Star until that time. One of his old friends, Paul Fix, is in the position of being a better actor and the villain Lone Star. these Plot about the wrong identity, theft, salary and murder is a tedious and as you expect it to be in the 1930s at a cheap price in the western style. But Wayne's good looks are charming. Makes it more fun Eddie Chandler, bald, bald, unbelievable as the "partner" of Wayne's hypocrisy, and there is a story that happens whenever Chandler and Wayne are about to become scary. In contrast, Wayne's love and interest are none other than Mary Corman, the little "Mary" from the beginning. Now she is 20 years old. Blond and cute hair is a button. Wayne's top women, mostly in the Lone Star / Monogram "B's", are quite polite and colorless. But Mary is energetic, cute and sexy. There was one scene in the general store where she worked, which Wayne asked her to take a "tonic tonic" bottle that was going on the upper shelf so she could climb the stairs and climb to the top The shelf then again when she came down from it a few minutes later when he asked her to climb up and make him receive another bottle. The film was surprisingly created in 1935. Wayne none Trying to hide the fact that he is checking her butt for sure. However, it's a small "B" that is not very interesting. But was not as absurd and random as much as his LoneStar productions at that time The last fight did not manage everything well and Chandler was quite upset after a while. But overall, it is worthwhile to watch if just to see Mary Kornman that is cute and sexy.
