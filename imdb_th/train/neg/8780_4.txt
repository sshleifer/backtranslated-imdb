Jonathan River (Michael Keaton) suddenly became a widower when his wife died. Soon after, he was contacted by Dr. Pryce, an expert in Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP), who claimed that he received a message from Anna, Jonathan's wife who had died with various electronic devices. Anna trying to tell something to Jonathan? Is this just a hint of something in a bigger or other universe? It's good to see Keaton in the lead role, but the story he stuck is complicated and ridiculous at the point. As if the movie didn't know how to answer any questions that happened, so it distracted the audience with new, unrelated questions. <br /> <br /> Keaton himself is quite good. His widow tried to communicate with his deceased wife. He grew up a bit as an actor by leaving the role. waacky-hijinks The friendships he played 15 years ago, he might look a bit frustrated, may have a slight wrinkling than expected. But he had no manners and dress that he showed during his fourteenth century in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> So it's not Keaton. In mediocre performance, it is a self-subpar script written by Niall Johnson. The story is more confusing as it progresses in each winding path that ends with another winding path. All of this is good and good if the path leads to an acceptable story. Something that connects everything more or less together and explains ... something. But not white noise I know little about what happened to Jonathan before I saw him first. <br /> <br /> Keaton is the only reason to watch this garbage, even though he is well supported. From Ian McNeice (as Dr. Price) and Deborah Kara Unger is a necessary love
