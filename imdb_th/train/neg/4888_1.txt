Nick Millard, also known as Nick Phillips, should leave alone enough when he does "crazy criminals" 10 years before letting this great time and effort. The fact that "Criminally Insane" was originally less than an hour long should make him understand that he may milk this story to what he is going to leave ... but instead of using TONS images From the original in this picture as well as the recycling point of the original opening sequence! Too bad to bring the old Priscilla Alder back quickly, not helping this thing. A little original image that is in this flick looks as though it was filmed with a rental mobile video camera! If this movie is priced over $ 100 so I will be very surprised and I will be equally surprised if it makes anything close to that number! Avoid this one and see the original instead!
