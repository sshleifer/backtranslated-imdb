I just came from watching this movie and decided to see what others thought. I was left wondering how these people who gave shining opinions saw the same movie! This may be a very good thing. But was not successful The script is very weak - the plot has many holes that it will create a good net for the fishing scene. The character has not developed and the story jumped so much that I found myself asking questions. "How can we come here?" At least half a dozen in this movie. <br /> <br /> There is a lack of chemistry between the cast members. This may involve the comedy of Lindsay Lohan during the filming. Obviously everyone appears and works for them. But not bound to their role. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie that is worth watching ... Go for a board game. Warm bath and save money for something worthwhile!
