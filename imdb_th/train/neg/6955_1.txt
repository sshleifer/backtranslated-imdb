I don't see the charm of this series. (Which seems to be a sci-fi) it's just "Let's see what soap happened this week." And Oh Cylons deals with the incident I am confused that WTF should happen. And don't even try to lie to me about "Curved story" <br /> <br /> It's a drama with some CGI thrown in. This is not science fiction, other than the original evidence. <br /> <br /> This series is not everything that is possible. If you like the cool, scary, frightening and videotape editing camera, this show may be right for you. Since it seems that raving about this show is a clear indication that the singer's comments have changed from Picard's TNG.
