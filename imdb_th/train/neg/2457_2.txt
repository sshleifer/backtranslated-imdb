Some people don't like animation. Personally, I think the animation is quite amazing when the film is finished. There are many old cartoons that I love. My problem with this movie is not animation. But basically it's a way to create characters, all ... stupid, and for this movie they shouldn't be Obviously everyone in LOTR has a problem that is wrong. (For beginners) Just the way they generally do bother me. My two sisters and I are laughing through this movie the most. I think if many people have seen this before before seeing new people, they won't go. I'm glad I rented it and didn't buy it. There are some movies that cause me headaches. This is one of them. However, this is not the worst movie I have ever seen, even though it is in that rank. Or down there depending on your view
