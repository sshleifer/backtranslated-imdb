I'm not sure how to rate this movie because it's really bad. It's really funny. I am not a fan of Gackt in any way, although he has the ability to even have a strange alias that sounds like a cat that is bald. I always think that Hyde has the ability But faith is an interesting album. <br /> <br /> But in general here This movie is ridiculous. It's superior and ridiculous, almost like a joke of supernatural action movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is almost no plot, except for vampires, about gang friends. In one way, this movie reminds me of Spider-Man 3 with too much thought, which results in not having enough time to pay attention to one of them. <br /> <br /> Action scenes. Laugh. Solve quickly, almost incomprehensible with ridiculous choreography. Although Hyde looks very stylish during action scenes But that is only redemption like this I am a good action movie sucker. But the action was created horribly Although the last shot was okay and the highlight of this movie was depressing. <br /> <br /> It's a jump between songs, not a good thing. It wants to be a drama or action or horror scene or a love story ... what the hell. <br /> <br /> If this review makes you crazy, why? Is it because of your love and Gackt and Hyde? Don't fool yourself. This movie is not good.
