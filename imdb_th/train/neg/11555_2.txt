Great slasher movie - very bad, it's a producer and not part of the script. The basic plot summary - a man with glowing red hair invites women like this to his flat, only to enter some sort of coma. Only the crew that cut behind the scenes had to think that this movie was an advertisement, as I did and cut off the movie. Nothing flows. You have lost the red head he was with at that time. (Not before he left?) And almost every time it seems that the camera of the dead and the next shot when he wakes up Not that I can blame him. I passed 2-3 times and had to rewind and continue to try to recover the existing small plot. Warning When you see the ending, do not try to connect with what happened. Up first - you will get an aneurysm Not worth the time, effort, or God forbidding money. The only reason to get 2 instead. 1 - The less chance that hacking took place during the movie release and the scary version that I watched.
