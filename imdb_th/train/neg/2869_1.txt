The story is going on. Netflix sent me a DVD, so I went down to an analog rental facility known as "Blockbuster Video". They suck. You know, really bad. They have 150 movies. Your viewing pleasure But i never want to see them So I saw BTK's killer there on the shelves, all alone, desolate. I like watching movies from serial killers. It's just part of humanity that I won't understand, so I want to see things like that. Anyway, I put this DVD and immediately from the first moment it sucked. I am sitting with bf and I like "What is this kind of shit?" The work of an unstable camera, a terrifying performance - the first scene in which a woman is killed, you wonder if she will just calmly talk. I will put your neck down. I really wonder if the director has strengths in this shit? There is nothing good about this "movie". What I have to say to the director is "Are you the owner of the freakin stand?" Every match is brutally uncertain. The scary music is like they just decided to create a movie someday. They may gather people from WalMart to show and "act" for them, just scary. If you make a movie like this, directing is your hobby - not what you should do for a living - don't go to the kidney shop to make a movie like yourself. Better to leave the house for your friends when you have a party and run out of interesting things to entertain them as well .... Then you divide your BTK KIller movie out and say that
