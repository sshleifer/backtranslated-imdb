That is what the name should be. <br /> <br /> This film consists of guns, explosives and irrational killings to create one action movie "Action". I'm in the question set: Answer the type of agreement. <br /> <br /> What happened in the movie? People die. <br /> <br /> Right? Yeah <br /> What is the plot about? What plot? <br /> <br /> What is the point of the movie trying to do? The killing is the only solution. <br /> <br /> What does the character look like? A lot of flaws and conflicts with their personalities. <br /> <br /> Is this movie good? Yes. I'm sure they use a good Panavision camera to shoot. <br /> <br /> If you like killing and greed continuously If you are rejected by "Entertainment" with low standards, so "Made Men" is not suitable for you. <br /> <br /> If you want to summarize, the overall plot is foul. That story can be completely irresistible and nothing else. <br /> <br /> This thing proves one thing: actors, directors and anyone who helps create this movie is not "done"
