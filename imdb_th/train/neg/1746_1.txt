Probably the worst Bollywood movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> No plot. Very little character development. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous and ridiculous humor. Films both chaotic and without direction There is no end to the story. The airport was filmed in department stores. <br /> <br /> The same story chewed over and over again until you wanted to say that "Please, just go further !!" Even the songs and dances are pointless and the choreography is not good. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is that it has a hot scene Around ... <br /> <br /> Btw I'm not from the background of India. <br /> <br /> 2/10
