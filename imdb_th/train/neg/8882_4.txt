If wanting to call a movie about deformed ghosts that must take revenge from the dead and undead dead people, it would be ridiculous. But this is an undeniable combination of GASLIGHT (1939 & 1944) through LES DIABOLIQUES (1954); While still able to watch in itself, it is an ancient idea that will encourage laughing. However, thanks to the terrifying strait that the British film industry found itself in the late 1970s, even the usual screenplay could attract 10 stars - Cliff Robertson (as a conspiracy husband), Jean Simmons ( In the title role) Jenny Agutter (as a half-sister artist - Robertson), Simon Ward (a mysterious driver), Ron Moody (as an unfortunate doctor), Michael Jayston (a business partner of Roberto ), Judy Geeson, best friend and Jayston's wife) Flora Robson (as a housewife), David Tomlinson (while the lawyer is reading Simmons) and the most surprising Jack Warner The (As a gravestone engraver) - Although most I'm sorry to say!
