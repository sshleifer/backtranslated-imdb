"Home Alone" for the first time is one of the funniest movies in the 90s. The second is funny as well as actors and jokes! Now "Home Alone 3" has come. I want to know how they will continue to do the same thing when considering that Kevin will be 17 years old. 1997, will he take care of himself? So what does the director decide to do? He took his child away with annoyance and made him sick. The child was 6 years old and his mother left him alone in the house? Which type of city team is the most stupid? I don't want to get too much details if you want to watch this movie sadly. But please I suggest you stay away from it It's not worth your precious time. Go to fold the paper, do chores, balance the pencil on your nose or snooze! It's better to watch "Home Alone 3"! <br /> <br /> 1/10
