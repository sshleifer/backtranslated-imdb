This movie isn't as good as 'Perfect Stranger', but it's not funny. It cannot be attached to one type of comedy - it jumps from SNL to Adam Sandler-esquire, romantic, with a small guy scoring big, swapping hard, being a 'Loser' (movie) genre. Of the computer, although there are some moments that hurt some comedy (Falling from the hill) but no one is funny or special in any way 'Schindler's program' is more fun (and feels shorter). You never know that Andy Samberg should be in high school, quit college or just a loser who lives with his mother - Sissy Spacek in the role. Her worst And poor, Ian McShane, a serious actor, if I had to name it to get shit to read on the camera The story is long drawn and completely predictable until the end. (No spoilers here in the case that Adam Samberg's mother wants to see) Don't spend any money to watch this movie, and maybe Lorne Michaels will get a clue and start building quality (yes, Wayne's World And Tommy Boy is quality)
