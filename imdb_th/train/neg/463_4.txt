Blond and blender are not strange. Essentially, it is a young version of the torn dumb and dumber but less funny and they use too much background noise and too much music. Background noise. And too much music It started to be very boring and unreasonable. It didn't go anywhere soon and I was more frustrated when this nonsense continued. Perhaps the only thing that helped me from giving this movie is 1 The minute I found it to be quite fun and interesting because it was near the end. But that was only one part. In addition, I couldn't help but like Pamela Anderson and Denise Richard's character a little, although this movie didn't laugh at all. From me it makes my attention, I will not say to avoid this film completely. But there are thousands of better movies that give you more time and money than your blonde and bludder.
