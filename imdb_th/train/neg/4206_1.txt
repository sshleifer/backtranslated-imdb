I was at the premiere of this film at the Toronto Film Festival in 1997. After screening, when some writers / directors and actor members offered to answer questions, anyone could not ask anything. The movie doesn't get well directed. (Why on this planet has random frames falling out of some scenes) Acting evil (David Arquette, in order to paraphrase Dorothy Parker, does not use emotional boundaries from A to B. He parked at A and brought lunch) and the most pointless. The character completely behaves outside without reason except forcing the plot to move in a certain direction. Finally, this movie comes to a random and completely pointless end, which should be "Make you really think" Unfortunately, what makes you think "is 90 minutes in my life, I never come back."
