When you look back to the bad sequel of Nightmare, like Freddy's Revenge, you have to give at least credit for trying new things and even though The Dream Child is more fun. But nothing new in the series Yes, there is a deadly creativity like a child who becomes part of a comic book and confronts "Super Freddy", but even though it is a scene that is not familiar with their full abilities. <br /> This shows The official death of the horror of the series. It seems that Freddie is a joke now ... but what? <br /> <br /> My score: 4/10
