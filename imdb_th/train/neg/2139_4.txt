I really want to be like this, but in the end it is a movie that does not work well with too little laughter. <br /> <br /> Politics is the top spot. It will offend the Republican party. But that's what it was designed to do. The only thing that gave me a reason to laugh gently. <br /> <br /> The problem is that it looks like it's actually happening. Hurry. (Like about a week) and it has some stupid subplots about some Bimbo singers who don't seem to be on that topic. <br /> <br /> Turiqistan clearly states that Iraq or Afghanistan or other countries in the United States There is f ** ked since the 1950s. The humor is a little dark (amputees dance with prosthetics by Tamerlane), but it is a mark, especially with companies that are involved in the restoration. ("Democratic democracy"!) <br /> <br /> However, like Many satirists criticize the United States and seem to be serious and hard working. I guess it's going to be a counter for many bs propaganda, so it has to make the bald head a point. Who knows. I like the way to eye and blink more. But that's only me. <br /> <br /> Next, I'll probably look again. Maybe I miss something. <br /> <br /> I hope "W" will be even more.
