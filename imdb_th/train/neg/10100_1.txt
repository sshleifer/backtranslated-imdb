I always support independent art and I try to be comprehensive and patient ... I always support everyone because their efforts are worth ... <br /> <br /> But this movie just moves out. Away from all understanding and patience. Limits! <br /> <br /> Imagine the following situation: <br /> <br /> 1 Think about the worst horror movie you've ever seen. In life <br /> <br /> 2 Try to think of an excellent and attractive ART. For DVD box set of the movie ... and the plot of the story ... <br /> <br /> 3 Voila! You get ZOMBIE NATION <br /> <br /> See it only when you have nothing to do.
