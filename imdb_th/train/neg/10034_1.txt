If there is one of the worst movies of this year - it's TASHAN. The first promotion gives an indication that this movie will be a boring Dhoom 2 style movie and I know that it will not be a bad movie. What is it because It's a Yashraj movie or maybe seeing a magical promotion. But this movie shocked me. It was the worst. Dhoom 2 and what I expected, the introduction of the boring First Saif. Then Saif - Kareena met. Kareena was so inventive. Anil Kapoor. Strange movie? What role does it have? What is he showing His first scene is okay. But then his actions were repeated, and he acted overly, then Akshay, who provided a beautiful scene But then the film became more boring and with all the outdated things The ending is another joke. <br /> <br /> Vijay Krishna Mancaya will have 3 more films to direct if this film is working, that is the old drug strategy. So Vijay is another crap program. The filmmakers music (Vishal Shekhar) is normal. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar's performance in the movie is really fresh. He has a really interesting time. Saif Ali Khan is where Annoyed, Kareena is an outrageous Anil Kapoor. The breaking up of the rest was okay.
