This village was built for one episode in the most boring MST3000 ever. I am not a Shakespear fan, but I do not believe that he intends to do his work for a slow and boring pace. It is also one of the rare movies. The most because there are many hamlet items As I said, this is quite boring. Is black and white, walking slowly and with the least scenery The actors also danced too, so it didn't help anything. This is the only MST 3000 that I can't see in a single seat. The guy who played Hamlet said that his role can make anyone.
