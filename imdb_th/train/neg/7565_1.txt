This movie is the biggest thing that lost nine dollars that I spent in a very long time. If you know how often I go to watch a movie, you may say it's hard to imagine. But never lost, it's true! After watching an example for this movie, I know I have to watch it! If you're a fan of horror, mystery and wonder, why wouldn't you? Examples are not interesting and exciting. Unfortunately, this movie is not these things. <br /> <br /> From movies to chapters until the film's performance is a complete movie. If you are reading this, plan to go to the movies, hoping to get excitement, mystery, action, horror or anything other than losing an hour and forty-five minutes. I'm afraid you will be disappointed. > <br /> "Why is it so bad?" You may ask yourself. Let me tell you. This movie is not mysterious or suspicious. There is nothing about this movie that makes me "depressed", scared or curious. The script is the most ridiculous. There are many times in the movie that the conversation is ridiculous. I started writing it as a relief comic, only to find that a few seconds later it wasn't. The performance is extremely scary. I like Nicholas Cage. But this is a mistake. Every show in this movie is incredibly below average. The movie shooting is terrible, without a doubt that one moment or magical. Finally, the story is completely transparent. You can see the end of this movie in one mile. <br /> <br /> I'm not a cruel critic. Frankly, when I go to see a comedy movie, I want to laugh and when I go to see the mystery / suspense / horror, I just want to surprise. This movie is boring, pretending badly, poorly written and very disappointed. Do yourself a favor and go see something else.
