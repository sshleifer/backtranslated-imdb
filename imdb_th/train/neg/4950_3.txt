I think that can summarize this item about anything. Batman TAS is probably the worst thing that has ever happened to a cartoon based on a comic book, because everything that happens after that will be compared to it and there is no thing. Which can be measured It's too good Is Batman better? "Yes, but it's not the standard version of" Justice League. Good? "It's not too bad. But there is no standard. "<br /> <br /> Batman doesn't have standards as well. But I won't hold it It will not be fair and there are also many other problems. <br /> <br /> The concept of crime, fighting Batman, younger and less experienced, is a good thing and sometimes the art is very beautiful. But throughout the rest of the art that is worthless to the American, and this is a betrayal of the many flaws of the performance. It was written and designed like an American. If I want to see Jackie Chan Adventures, I will see Jackie Chan Adventures or I may hit my head in the wall at any time and get the same results. Unpredictable and smart devices to fight Batman When he was forced to fight by hand, he would turn to something that was right or incomplete. He does not mean being a monkey with Dreadlock, known as Kung Fu, and can jump into the air for up to twenty feet along with the speed line. If they want to do so, the villain has less important characters than they can use or * gasp * they can create all new characters. And it's not that repetition is a bad thing. Don't understand me wrong TAS (I went there again). Bring Mr. Freeze from your standard revolver and make him a memorable and moral character. Freeze is not a classic villain at that time and they make upgrades. But the point is What Batman does is bring everything you like about Batman and legendary cartoons and use to transfer large amounts of information. They guess what they eat. <br /> <br /> Clearly. That this program could not resist the TAS but stood on its own leg and it didn't work for me The plot is not good and they do not develop any better. They are written for a group of children under the age of twelve. Should children be happy with the show? Of course they should This should not be a show for adults with swearing, naked and irrational violence. But the sign of a truly good performance is that it can be enjoyed at different levels by all ages. This show doesn't receive that mark. <br /> <br /> Is this show a TAS? Of course not. The problem is that it's not JLU.
