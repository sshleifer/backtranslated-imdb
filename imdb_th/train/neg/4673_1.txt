I love Henry James's books and Washington Square is no exception. I am very excited to see a new movie coming out of the title book Jennifer Jason Lee as a great actress and Ben Chaplin. Good enough to take the lead. Albert Finney is someone else and does not perform well I want to take pictures of Maggie Smith .... or quite ridiculous of her role. The real problem and what is missing in this latest version is the script, the song and the direction. <br /> <br /> I slept in the cinema and watched a long movie. This story is boring and boring. There was a temporary pause in the dialog box over Pinter Play. In this book, I was deeply concerned about Catherine Slayer and her life. This film has the opposite effect. I don't like the twists that her aunt has sexual attraction towards Morris. Eeeeeeeek YUK. <br /> <br /> Look at it. If you can't sleep, it's a clear snooker. Don't watch if you are happy. You will have to use Zoloft after this. <br /> <br /> Of course, "The Heiress" is great with Olivia Haviland and Montgomery Clift in the role of the actor who plays her father in the sign That was a cold and bleak father .... still regretting that his wife had died and hated Catherine This film is not faithful to this book. But it's not this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a box office that failed. I do not doubt why
