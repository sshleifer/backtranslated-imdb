I think Harvey Kafitel, a new fresh boy from Sex Pistols John Lydon, then a bonus song for Ennio Morricone. I expect that the first Italian thriller made in America, Istead. That doesn't make sense and the movie that made me say: WTF !!! There are too many unanswered and insufficient questions. Result: Potential classic cultures have washed down the toilet. Keitel and Lydon work together well, so perhaps Quentin Tarantino may unite them. This with a better script. Oh and Morricone score: OK, but not memorable. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not a waste of time, but not "must see" unless you are a hardcore Keitel fan.
