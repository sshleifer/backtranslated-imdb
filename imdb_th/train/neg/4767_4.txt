I watched this movie when I liked the plot, strangers were taken captive, trying to find a way to connect them. <br /> <br /> The settings and locations were clearly influenced by the first. (And best) see movies and even though there is not much action But the story continues quickly Hart hasn't given up on the show. <br /> <br /> There are some things that disappointed me. 1. The pedophile is a more distinctive way, allowing him to be opened by everything from children to bodies. <br /> MJH's 2 lines about her past police In fact, he was the least deserving person to be there. He didn't help in the events leading up to the arrest. <br /> <br /> 3. The ending ..... What kind of movie ends in the middle of the story? There is no resolution, no hanging, no cliffs, no clear end ... It ends. <br /> <br /> And for that, I left two stars at my level. 2 points. But not the end!
