Three writers tried bravely to adapt Jane Stanton's Hitchcock novel for this film. But in the end, this TV movie was injected with excessive sexuality. The struggles of the artist Meg Tilly suddenly found himself being hired by Ellen Bertin, a mysterious man who wishes to paint murals on a ballroom wall she didn't use. After learning about the last reunion held there - Ellen's daughter's party - Tilly decided about her artistic content, never dreaming that her daughter had died mysteriously before the start! Two great actresses serve with an unbelievable yarn that cannot be closely monitored. Burstyn's role in the camp while Tilly is stuck in doing a dream routine. There is only one line in the movie. (In the morning after the murals are finished) there is an expense with feelings of honesty, anger and betrayal. The rest is a piffle.
