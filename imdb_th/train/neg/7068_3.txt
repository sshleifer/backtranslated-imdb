Schiller began on a dark and overcast night when the bus sent three passengers outside the bus station, a young man named Mason. (Jesse Emme Murray) Professor, College of Dr. Howard Conrow (David Wahl) & a woman named Sharon Phillips Pennington) inside, they discover that they missed the interconnected bus and overnight here In the waiting area, they meet up with two other people, Ronnie (Jim Wolf) & Lindsay sleeping girl. (Marjorie Fitzsimmons) who is a terrible nightmare ... <br /> <br /> While swimming in the indoor pool Meet a male friend named Billy Water. (Jesse Johnson) The next time Lindsay sees Billy, he dives into the pool and seems to disappear in the air before he appears. Soon after Lindsay discovered that Billy Water had died from a diving accident 5 years ago ... <br /> <br /> Lindsay woke up and told his dream story. Let her listen to everyone, reply by saying And decided to share it over time ... <br /> <br /> Next is Mason, who tells his story and two friends, Scott. (David R. Hammham) and Jimmy (Will Tucker Ville) <br /> <br /> Sharon, whose story revolves around a journalist named Tom Williams (Tom Delventhal ), Which she phoned shortly after Tom was at her front door, but he actually became a vampire ... <br /> <br /> Ronnie's turn & he explained how he discovered that He was able to bring the dead back to life. Unfortunately, he killed the murderer Nelson Nelson. North (Bradford Bolle) Return to the life that killed the dead ... <br /> <br /> Finally, Dr. Conow tells the story that his two students brought the ancient Aztec war gods. The name Ixpe (Kimberly Harbo ur) comes back to life ... <br /> <br /> Then go back to the bus station for one (predictable) twist ... <br /> <br /> Written, produced and directed by Daniel Boyd Chillers, is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. I tend to like this sub-genre. The script by Boyd is lacking. You need to see the final twist that reaches one mile, and each story is really weak. The first one is totally pointless & seems to be endless and the best. About Kraft, these are short, short stories that are rounded off with elaborate twists. The second story can be predicted & again ending without any return. So continue throughout the Schiller, where each story is not very satisfying to watch and there is no reward for doing so. The dialogue and character of the character is not well written. The story seems to have no original idea of ​​their own. At least each story is not long. & I like the idea behind the link group. <br /> <br /> Boyd's director obviously works with a very low budget & it shows. All I can say is if you want to watch a short 15 minute short story set in the pool, then the chillers for you. Stories are not smart, scary, or have tension or create anything. Having said that, it has beautiful scenes and surprising abilities. Violence and cleverness, nothing happens in the chillers, the tearing heart, the head that has been cut, the head and the bitten hand is as scary as it gets. <br /> <br /> Schiller technique Is a bad thing Impress everyone Basic movies, bad music, special effects, cheap & under average production Schiller also has one of the worst closing songs of all time. The show is also a very low standard. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that many efforts have been brought to Schiller as a low budget movie, and at least the filmmakers have tried at least I'll give credit. At least But that didn't stop me from thinking that it was ridiculous Similar anthology films, such as Tales From the Crypt (1972), Asylum (1972), The Vault of Horror (1973), The Terrifying House of Dr. Dr, Terror (1965), Creepshow (1982) and Tales from the Darkside : The Movie (1990) is much better than Schiller, so watch one of them instead
