The first scanner may not be a great movie. But at least it is original. There is no novelty. For this, acting is worse in my thoughts and the story is slower and nothing special. Like the dialogue and special effects that are not better than in the traditional way, this is the first movie that is inferior in every area. But it wasn't Not creating a good movie if they do something better with the story and make it interesting. This may be a good movie. In fact, I can't go through it all without having to send it quickly. Remembering The movie and not more than that, everything has a movie that is worse than that with an emotional temper. I'll give the scanner 2 to 4/10.
