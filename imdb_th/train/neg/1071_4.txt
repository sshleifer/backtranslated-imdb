The movie is very weak, mostly because of a bad story. But there are bad performances in the case of Robert Downey Jr. and the irrational behavior of many characters If you are a person who likes to close your mind and watch this movie because of creativity or performance criteria, you may like this movie. Personally, I can't do that with drama and find this thing far beyond reach. <br /> <br /> I was particularly annoyed when the main character, who should be a creative person with mental retardation in the movie. This story, if the main character behaves like a normal person would do in these situations, will not have a movie. <br /> <br /> The first improbable action is when the main character, the lawyer who has experienced Finished named Magruder played by Kenneth Branagh was made to leave the party and one woman Mallory Doss played by Embeth Davidtz, who was screaming that her car had been stolen. They stood in the midst of a tropical rainstorm while he bothered her in getting the car home. <br /> <br /> She told him about her strange father who is a strange sect and doing crazy things. When they reached her dilapidated cottage in the poor part of the city, they noticed that her car was in the driveway. The fire in the house was stuck and some objects in the house were destroyed. <br /> <br /> Things are strange. She's strange. (Looks like a homeless person. She took off his clothes until he was naked?) Yes!). In addition, the strange father of the house was completely destroyed - everything should tell Magruder, "This is too strange for me. I am out of here! 'But not Magruder. He slept with her and was inspired by her story and sex. Use the case to try to make her father committed. It makes everyone stunned! <br /> <br /> Then was the super-lawyer that he was. He arrived late at the office wearing the same shirt he had the night before. (The fact that all women in the office notice) is likely that successful lawyers will act like 16-year-old? Magruder makes the police angry in some cases, so when he goes to the police who claim that there is enough evidence that the father is threatening them, the police do not care about him. I do not believe the help that is not satisfied at all. <br /> It shouldn't be possible.
