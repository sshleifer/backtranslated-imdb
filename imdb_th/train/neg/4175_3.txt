I think Michelle Ironside's acting career must end if he has to act in this low shit. Of course, he did better than wasting time with the garbage in this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie might be better if it has a good budget. There was one scene in the outpost, which seemed to be outside the front of the train station and I thought it. <br /> <br /> There was one scene that made this movie 3 and it showed. The spacecraft landed and descended from the lake surrounded by forests. This is very good. But the rest of the movie forgot it. <br /> <br /> There is another scene that looks like an engineering factory that I bet on and doesn't look like a space. The character says that it is <br /> <br /> This stupid movie has a very low budget, no reason and God helps Micheal Ironsides.
