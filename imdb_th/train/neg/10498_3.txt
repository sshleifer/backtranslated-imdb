I got this in screening. All I can say is: What ... ... Hell? This film plays smoothly like Mickey Mouse reading the script "Scarface". It's too strange to understand a little. And even if you leave your brain in the car, the movie is still so strange that it's not a joke CIA came after Erwin received an inquiry. Erwin made a mistake for the poachers and set out to "stop" them. <br /> <br /> That is the whole story. The rest is the lamp of Australian culture ("Didja saw dat?" And "Crikey!") And the sequence of strange choreography. above Yes, right: Steve Irwin's knife fights with the men on the top of the RV. That's your guide for this ridiculously bad movie.
