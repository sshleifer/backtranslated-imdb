When I was a child, my friends and I believed that Gymkata was the most violent and violent movie ever created. I'm not sure who started the rumor. It may be due to the difficulty of a 10 year old child who is not allowed to watch for any reason. For many years after Gymkata was released, it became a late-night cable movie and for this reason I was able to compensate for the loss of time. I have to see the scene from the awful excuse for the movie more than once, and I can see it from the screen for 1-2 seconds. However, in addition to the forced sex of gymnastics and martial arts, bad scrubbing The dialogue is hard and the story is very difficult. The movie has some things going on. With the bad things about movies, pictures, sounds, really fun, never before in punching or kicking with a little force and lots of volume! The canned kung fu sound is sassy. But the slow and pointed song and the slow-motion scene for almost 5 minutes is really strange. Chasing through the city of insanity, bloodthirsty villagers are not as stressful as it is annoying and have bad wigs and extras Enough for everyone But looking into the camera and waves to make this train fun. Will it be a classic cult status? Where is MST3K when we need it?
