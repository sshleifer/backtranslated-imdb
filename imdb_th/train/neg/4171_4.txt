I passed this name 15 or 20 times while Blockbuster looked for something suitable to watch. All I can say is that they have a good movie coming out halfway the night that I choose to rent. <br /> <br /> I'll give you credit for jumping and better scope. "Dracula 3000" But in reality It's quite easy to say, since this DIDN'T has Caper Van Dien in there, as it lacks a shovel: interesting actors, interesting stories, good conversations and originality. But I think you don't have everything. <br /> <br /> *** The spoiler in front *** The crew is not suitable. Vampire hunter (One of them is a vampire ... along the body) fly around from a colony to a mining colony, digging, trying to get rid of all the vampires found The crew consists of: cocky, captain never done well - (which died early), - by - his book But still had no experience, the first friend of the vampire hunter said (Not a typo) Cowboy scrambled and Asian commando "A guy who's dressed up" is very strong ... almost sounds like an actor in MTV's 'The Real World', after the captain died in a violent confrontation with a group of bloodsuckers (and when it appeared, lovers On the part of the human anatomy body) his first friend takes over ... blah, blah, blah ... everyone hates him .. blah, blah, blah ... I can go further But as I said it was the same story used in about a hundred other other movies. <br /> <br /> The effect is cheese and why Michael Ironside was in this movie. Beyond me Vampire hunter (Not a printmaker) Hot, but of course, if you wait for her to reveal more than her cleavage, look elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I can't speak. It's the worst movie I've ever seen when I actually rent 'Starship Troopers 2', but wait for this movie to be broadcast on Sci-Fi.
