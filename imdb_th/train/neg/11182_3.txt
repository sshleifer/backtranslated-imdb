A very stupid movie filled with silly torpedoes and Jewish references through It's a serious movie. But cannot be serious Familiar movie plot ... Wrong at the wrong time Cruel subplots involving Kim Basinger The robot is very shocking and too. I noticed that Al Pacino's acting ability seemed to be down. Problem Solving Tools But nothing is more troubling than the awesome accent Pacinos in Atlanta Damage control is necessary to fix the damage of the film. OK, one of my torpedoes isn't good. But not as bad as in this movie This film manages not only But will be boring But nasty as well Usually, nasty movies can be viewed for the wrong reasons. This movie cannot be viewed. I managed to sit through this thing. The plot, if written a little bit better, may be better than performing a little bit and eliminating scary subplots and even stupid jokes. What we left was a boring and foolish movie that made sure that it penetrated into our heads that Eli Wurman was a Jewish, shameful to every good Jew everywhere
