I will admit. I think Uma Thurman is the most beautiful woman in the world and makes it a mission to watch all the movies she joined. This story must be ranked as the worst movie I've ever seen. (Yes, it is ranked lower than The Avengers) Everyone looks lost and it is not linked to each other beyond belief. <br /> <br /> Although you think Uma is the goddess that I like, please Don't be under you in this movie. You will hate yourself the next morning.
