Don't waste time on this movie. It may be good, but the ending is one of the damage I've seen. I have to seriously doubt that the people involved in the creation of this film will see the last scene and think "Yes! Now has an end! "And slapped his own back For me, it seems that they have just finished thinking! They created the final scene to be cool. But instead of letting it look broken When the last shot faded to black and I heard the music, the credit began to shock me - I couldn't believe what I saw. The best thing anyone can do with this movie is to write a new ending and provide content. Seriously, I like to get anyone to come with one of the rooms. Watch them on the page and say - WTF ?? !!!!
