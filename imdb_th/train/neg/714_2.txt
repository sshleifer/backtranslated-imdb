This is a movie about tired ancient ideas. Is there a Nazi witch to be the chief, experimenting with SF in the basement? Oh please! <br /> <br /> Scary and scary feeling. The general impression of this film is the very scary concept of fear. I do not have any expectations: the older Sanders from Buffy and the heroine with a monkey-like face that doesn't seem to know how to do it. Adrian Barbara said that I had just met before in "Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death", which is more fun. <br /> <br /> The camera and editing add a general impression
