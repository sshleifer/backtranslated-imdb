The basic story in this movie is not bad. A woman makes it big and comes back to her old school to be loved. But even though Robert Young and Eve Arden have good performances My fault in this story is Joan Crawford or director or both, because her performance is terrible. Instead of being a real person, she plays the role of a deer attached to the headlight. In other words, she stared at space and expressed that "I'm a perplexed person. SOOOO" After a few minutes it was really annoying for me. Now is not the only Crawford movie that I don't like in her performances because she has done more than being involved in doing too much - in movies like JOHNNY GUITAR or her later movies like BERSERK! My advice is to try another Crawford movie - definitely better.
