I'm really disappointed with this movie. The first movie Waters I saw was Serial Mom and I liked it. Then I saw Pecker and I liked it. Then I watched the polyester and really hated it. The only thing I like about this movie is DIVINE. She / he is very talented. I was truly surprised. Overall, I won't recommend this movie ...
