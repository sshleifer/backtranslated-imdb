- A small hood will trick the local mob boss out of a lot of money. Of course, the mob leader wanted his money back and didn't care that he had to kill to get punk. Enlists his friends and old gangsters to help him save his life. <br /> <br /> - If this sounds Nonsense is possible All the ideas that punk drove a buggy that wears a Izod may make one of the most powerful mob in Rome just a normal fool. His friends may be good with guns. But he was against the trained killer group The old gangster is more than a relief of cartoons and there is no real help when talking about gangsters. There is also a small story about how the father of a friend was killed years ago by a group leader. But it was made from a small story and it didn't help this movie. <br /> - The group leader, Mister Scarface, played by Jack Palance. I think he has a name because he has something. That looks like shaving on his cheeks. Palance doesn't work like other actors do what he needs to get from the examination. <br /> <br /> - I've seen some good crime / Italian police. Not long ago, but Mister Scarface was not the only one of them. The. Take a look Saddar Syndicate or the Revolver.
