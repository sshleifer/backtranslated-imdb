Viewing Smother may be my life that is not the longest in 90 minutes. There is no laughter to have; In fact, I do not remember ever smiling. Diane Keaton is a formidable disgust as a middle-aged chain-dog detainee, a textbook that dominates the personality of a mother who is a persistent annoying woman who suffers from certain personality disorders She is a misappropriation, hypocritical, innocent, childish, narcissistic and worst of all. <br /> <br /> I think I should talk about other characters in a short time. It's just a long, clich√©s movie, which is an unconscious cousin that tries to break into the "The Industry" for a long time. In any way, a lovely father is also a lovely wife. Don't take anymore (But eventually moved beyond feud and resigned from home) Who likes to chew, throw pillows while everyone is away, etc. <br /> <br /> God is a snore I was never a fan of Diane Keaton and Smother only reminded me why. Too much use is too much use, no matter what you do in the best image. Her efforts in comedic physical performances are especially disgraceful. What do the directors think? <br /> <br /> While I like Dax Shepard and sometimes tolerate Liv Tyler, their performances are boring and boring. It doesn't matter, because I didn't do anything to pretend to be the end of Keaton too much, and sometimes she doesn't like Shepard for her. At the end of the movie, I want to hit her by myself. <br /> <br /> Very bad
