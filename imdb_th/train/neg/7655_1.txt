We should all congratulate Uwe Boll. He made things unthinkable. He may be the only director who has two movies in the top 100 in IMDb! He is like a cockroach in a movie theater. No matter how little talent he has, and no matter how bad these films are, he can continue to build it. I know that they use their own funds through some strange German funds. But even then, his ability to create a movie, despite the complete failure It's not bad, except that the video game developer still gives the best features to this guy. I really like the Alone in the Dark genre. Even the newest Nightmare is still good for playing games for a few hours. There is a great movie created by the adventures of Edward Carnby. But this is not now. Uwe Boll joins Bloodrayne and Hunter: the Reckoning. What's next? Silent Hill? Doom? I can only imagine that this guy must go through the game adaptation of the movie if he doesn't stop. Some people want to reduce credit, or these video game publishers need to be smart and realize that when they make a bad movie out of a game that killed a franchise, no one is interested in that name anymore> <br /> Think of it. House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark is the name of the game that works no longer. No way. The new House of the Dead game comes out for the X-Box and nobody cares This name is dead and all because of Uwe Boll. So if one of you works for a game publisher or knows a game publisher or has access to a game publisher ... please remind them. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worthwhile to review. I can't separate what I don't like about dung from the rest. Indeed, everything about it, writing, acting, music, CG effects, editing. I think if I wait until it comes out on the DVD and then rent it with low expectations, I won't be disappointed. I'm wrong. Do not underestimate. Uwe's ability to change a large stack of BOLL sh * t
