Skippy from "Family Ties" plays Eddie, a 'nerd' metal 'nerd that was chosen when his favorite' Metal 'singer Sammy Kerr died. He threw a ruffled body. All posters on his bedroom wall But later when he received an unpublished record that held the spirit of his metal idol The first time he was sucked into the idea of ​​revenge. But then he didn't want to use it as much as Sammy did. Which is not true as his primary victim seems to go to the hospital only This movie is a laughing story and is associated with real metal, as said "Rock Star". OK, maybe it's more garbage than that piece of garbage. But you got my score And how everyone can take root for men played by Skippy from "Family Relationships". I don't have a clue. The hijack by Gene Simmons is ok. And Ozzy Osbourne comes to consistency. I applaud him But not otherwise. <br /> <br /> My grades: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Elise Richards gets the upper part of the pool party.
