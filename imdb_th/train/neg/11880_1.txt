Office work, especially in this era of computers, multipurpose photocopiers, email, voice mail, snails and `temps' is a land full of possibilities, mocking earlier veins that were captured in movies such as' Clockwatchers'. And 'office space 'And was very successful The latest addition to the temp / humor pool. However, the Haiku tunnel, which was directed by Josh Kornbluth and Jacob Kornbluth, could not live up to the previous generation and left laughter at the door, waiting for an opportunity to sneak in. Unfortunately for the audience, the opportunity never arrived. So what you get is a good effort. But as a man once said that there is no cigar, <br /> <br /> As a commentator / star of the movie Josh Kornbluth (played by Josh Kornbluth) points to the opening frame. (In one person's speech sent directly to the camera) This story is pure fiction and takes place in the fictional city of 'San Franc'l'isco'. It is innovative, if not presenting a lot of imagination and responsibility. Funny However, it is a hunch that it must be done, which is all - such as a disclaimer - not a funny thing. <br /> <br /> Kornbluth plays Kornbluth, a novelist who wants to support his own work to be `temporary '. The work that suits him and it gives him time to work in his novel from time to time. But when he went to work for a lawyer Bob Shelby (Warren Keith), he worked well on the first day and Shelby sent the chief secretary Marlina D'Amore (Helen Shumaker) to Kornbluth to persuade him to go. ' Full time for the same company that initially caused fear in the center of Cornbluth, but he entered the cave and signed the position. He was nervous about this. But at least the other secretary now acknowledges his presence. (Of course, they will not do anything with temperature) and if things are too rough, he has seventeen important letters that he prints. Must be sent by mail - to fall back (he caught them because sending that letter was easy and he needed something easy to make 'reserve' in case it would be too much for him). These are `important 'and at the end of the week Kornbluth still has a book on his table. And not having to use the special ability to understand that when Shelby discovered this, Kornbluth's day while the white-haired boy was about to end and quickly. <br /> <br /> Brothers Kornbluth, who not only directed But along with John Bellucci, also writing a screenplay for the film, should take it from Ben Stiller. The book of comedy stated, "If you play it straight, they'll laugh." But they can't and the audience won't. Because in comedy, even looking as neutral as possible when the main character (Including most characters in this case) `play 'funny - as he knew he was funny - he never was, and that is what Kornbluth did here, so instead of" funny "he met insincere And pretentiousness is a great mistake in judging the part of Kornbluths because letting them sabotage their movies. <br /> <br /> When trying to distinguish why this movie is not working It has a reason Two reasons: the direction, which is not necessarily bad, it is negligence. And secondly, the performance began with Josh Kornbluth quite easily. Kornbluth seemed to be too impressed with himself to be effective here. Unlike Stiller or even Steve Martin, the two men use humor to devalue themselves effectively. - Corbeth apparently has an ego that will not allow himself to fall in That light It seems that he has a desire to let his audience know that he is the true character of Cornbluth. In fact, he is more intelligent than Cornbeth's character and being unable to get through makes him go. Including movies Rather than allowing millions of office workers who may be able to watch this movie with someone they can connect to or with someone they can identify, Kornbluth affects the manner in which he acts to alienate the people he Try to reach So what happens is the case of poor and unbelievable governance. Acting and when you consider that the screenplay is weak in the beginning with a mysterious narrow focus (according to the potential of a variety of topics) it is Easy to understand why this person is not flying. <br /> <br /> The elegance of this film is Warren Keith's performance as Shelby, which delivers the fine details. At first unbelievable, and itself - a fairly humorous. However, its effectiveness has been greatly reduced since Keith must share his scene with Kornbluth, which will automatically cancel his positive involvement in the project. <br /> <br /> Shumaker and Sarah Overman (Julie Faustino ) Managed to put their heads above the water with their performances, which is commendable if not completely memorable At least they made their scenes look and Overman was able to raise Kornbluth's performances in no time. But still not enough to save the whole day or movie. <br /> <br /> The supporting actors include Amy Resnick (Mindy), Brian Thorstenson (Clifford), June Lomena (DaVonne), Joe Bellan (Jimmy the Mail clerk) by Contour pendant by Harry Shearer, the disheveled look as leader of the inauguration - a role that would answer the question, "he thinking when he agreed to this," the environment in any way. There will be situations that will happen forever. One will become someone's funny cannon fodder and a movie that shows that the situation will always be with us. Good people (see paragraph one) may become a classic in their own right. However, 'Haiku tunnel 'Will remain among them for a long time without a doubt, because it is another destiny - in a kingdom known only: `confusion' I give this rating 1/10 <br /> <br /> < br /> <br />
