This film deserves 2/10 1.5 stars for young women. (I'm sorry I'm biased. I think the beautiful girl is the highlight of the movie only) and 0.5 for the fact that it's shorter than Azumi 1. I watch Azumi 1 and 2 in 1 seat. I was surprised that I could sit. <Br / > <br /> Talk about the positive points of the movie that Ueya Aya's cute girl That is all there is to salvage the entire movie. The truth is that if the main character is male, I am sure that most people (including me) will not get in touch with the movie. <br /> <br /> Now, talk about the negative point. First, it is a real, scary story and there are many repetitive scenes. The scenes of Nachi and Azumi come back and it seems to be a way of filming the drama. General Japanese dramas tend to like past stories and this film too. Secondly, this film is too unrealistic in historical settings. I don't mind unrealistic movies. But this movie is like a bad way to show creativity by throwing in a ninja that acts like a bear and spider web, etc ... It reminds me of Shinobi. Although Shinobi is a movie with a fantasy scene. Moreover, in drawing What effect does the "i-Don't-know" movie director who is dying by injecting blood (literally) around ... people who don't know their heads are cut ... etc etc etc .. . These performances cause too much waste. It seems that the influence of anime is strong in this film. It greatly reduces the performance. Third, Azumi is not a killer. She seemed to be the only soldier with me than she was a woman. I do not think you see a killer that has entered the barracks. The only time I felt that she acted as "Killer like" is when she kills Kiyomasa Kato at the end of Azumi 1. Eventually the plot is skinny in both films. It's a linear plot that doesn't have any development and surprise.
