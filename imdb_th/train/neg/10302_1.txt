Since "Rugrats" fall from the category of good and funny cartoon series to fearsome and worthless fares for two-year-olds in the last three or four years. After making all the characters worse, add new characters that are boring and replace some sounds. (Even though I like Nancy Cartwright, you are not Chucky Finster!) And there is no continuity. Tommy and Chucky have a new puppy. But later, the dog never appeared) You think the creator can kill the show for mercy, but noooo. <br /> <br /> All I will say about this special is that it sucks! While not as scary as Kimi, everyone is more stupid than they include Grandpa. (My God! He used to be the best character in the show. The ending doesn't have to be fluffy, and the only thing that is different between now and other crappy episodes ('98 -'01) is that children can interact with adults. Ah, so fun. <br /> <br /> There is no star for "The Rugrats All Growed Up" Klasky-Csupo. Please destroy this show first.
