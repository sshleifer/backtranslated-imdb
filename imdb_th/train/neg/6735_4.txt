The best thing I can say about this movie is that it's a good story. It doesn't fall flat. The next best thing is a performance sponsored by an actor who plays Godfather Edward Edward, Holland Taylor. And the great actor plays the husband of Taylor The actors that helped to criticize the potential set of Messing in the first scene brought a ridiculous quality. But won the prosecution OK, that's a positive story There will be no emotional investment in this organization unless it is done as quickly as possible. On the other hand, Messing sincerely tries to send movies and create chemical illusions with Mulroney You can do that But was not strong enough that the actors would pull these things out without help, giving "E" to her for effort and "C +" for success Considering the indifference of Rooney, one thing that can help Messing is acting. Irons-esquire Of the talented cavalry from the actors who played Jeffrey But his performance is weak, suspiciously mewling and merciless. <br /> <br /> If I try to analyze this, I will pay more attention than most people involved. It is not dangerous enough to pass the time if you have nothing to do and less disgusting. (And less creative) wedding singers But you better see "My best friend's wedding" again
