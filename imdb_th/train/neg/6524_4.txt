The Angry Red Planet (Quickie Review) <br /> <br /> Just like "The Man From Planet X", this is a strange science fiction that is drawn from an era in which fantasy and science fiction still curse near the same thing. Meaning, we have special effects that are very ridiculous and scientific disguises that are disguised as science fiction. And yes, it is another "classic" that is released with high quality transfers with clear images and clear sound - by Midnite Movies <br /> <br /> So the main reason for watching this movie what is it? Oh, of course, all the time that our space crew is on Mars (do you think "Angry Red Planet" is called Neptune?) Before that, there was a poorly qualified space crew that took up the spacecraft, which they smoke and Throw around the homosexual women aimed at the crew members. It's not quite right for today's standards if it's not funny. But Mars is the real reason we look at this. In general, this movie is black and white. But Mars, Mars, is a blood red. It was filmed in this strange red plastic shadow, causing the angry red planet to look very interesting. It's a really remarkable story, just as the alien audience saw. The best thing is "ratbatspidercrab" Do you think it's a joke? That's what they call it in the movie! It's a huge fantasy. (Small puppets) of things that include the characteristics of mice, bats, spiders and crabs It surrounds all the puppets and scares * t from our "brave heroes". There are other strange and inconceivable aliens. But the person who received the cake Finally, after their harsh experiences on Mars, the young female sailors dress up their "ships" and return to the world they came from. <br /> <br /> This is not suitable for everyone. Science fiction movie enthusiasts and curious and general movie lovers, fans of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 will also have a field today. (If they have never been to the show) <br /> <br /> Modern score 2/10, 6/10 points, Nostalgia, 4/10 Overall. <br /> <br /> (www. ResidentHazard.com)
