Oh, a famous actress in the movie that she played as a mother and child. It was shown on BBC 1. At midnight I wondered ... Yes, yes. TVM <br /> <br /> You have to give. It's for TVM producers, not the content of creating a movie. They often give two simple movies with two mixed themes and nowhere to hide. The first form is a woman who is in danger of crossing the pollen pattern with a woman suffering from the pain of a divorce theme, which means that we have the scene of the heroine who survived the killings, followed by the scene in which her son Sam asks why she divorced? And as a TVM, she replied that the reason is "people change" instead of saying something on the line, like "I am a sleepy person, right" or your father cruises public public toilets for sex. "Just as happened in divorce life It is Sam. I feel sorry not only But his parents divorced from each other But he was as thick as two short boards. In fact, since he was stupid, he deserved sympathy because he didn't know that a man was washing things The bathroom is a drug dealer, unaware that you may die if someone fires at you and doesn't know that I love LUCY. It is not painfully painful if only But only our childhood is innocent. Ah and Orwell said that Sam is an expert on sudden marine life, character development, or bad scripts. I know where my money is and how strange Sam, the boy, didn't notice that if the story was put in 1994, why people often wear it. Driving clothes and train since 1950? Appeared during the planned twists, it was a deceived mother Then there was a final plan that made me feel like an idiot watching this thing.
