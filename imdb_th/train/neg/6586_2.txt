If you admire the renaissance in Asian horror, do not mess with Gawi. This film should not be mentioned next to the A-list, such as Ringu, Tale of Two Sisters, Cure and Ju-On (or good material such as The Eye or Inner Senses) Those movies are filled with finer details, unexpected images, rich characters and popular western movies. Gawi feels stressed along with the limbs and the remaining organs of all. That made American horror punch in the last twenty-five years. This film tries to blend the story of Asian ghosts and bad Hollywood movies. Aesthetics is bound to cover others. Guess? There's no story to tell filmmakers. That robbed Ringu for evil subplots But the situation is hopeless. Clich√©s, characters, shit, ridiculous plot, blunt ghost, ho hum
