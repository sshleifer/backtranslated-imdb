Reasonably good movies But it's not true. <br /> <br /> Rubin "Hurricane" Carter is a liar, a murder observer. New Jersey did not go for the third time 20 years ago. The driver received an offer in 1976: "Pass the lie test and go free". He didn't use it. This movie should not be done. But talking about money Many people live unjustly in prison, and blacks are no doubt more than white. Why choose fake stories? <br /> <br /> Jane
