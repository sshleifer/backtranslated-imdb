I walked into this, hoping it would be "The provocative idea" The little jeweler has checked this thing. I love indie movies and expect to dig as well. Knowing what the hot button on this topic is, I expect to be really entertained, even seeing the perspective of an outsider. <br /> <br /> All I can say is Wow .... If you suffer Own You will like this Personally, I don't like the idea of ​​being angry or cutting myself, so I think it's garbage. Bad script, bad performances, bad stories, bad governance, bad fixes .... I can go further. I have no clue why the critics claim that he or she is creating political issues by giving this film the 10th, misleading and foolish. Voting for movies on IMDb is not typical! It's just for others to think that this kind of garbage explosion is okay to watch as long as it is debatable. (This movie isn't it trying to be VERY HARD but it is a failure.) <br /> <br /> You know that this movie is not good when you spend 15 minutes praying that all the main characters die. scary Unfortunately they die But not in pain, etiquette that will make the audience receive justice or vengeance that watched 2 hours of shit. They just endure. <br /> <br /> Do something you like yourself. I get this movie in the trash, bargain at the video store in my area for 0.50 and feel torn!
