The Williamson accent is difficult to wade through. He spoke incredibly quickly, as if he were rushing to break through the line. During the time he behaved as if he were talking to someone when he should talk to himself All of that, and his bald spot was annoying me. He is too old for this role. In reading Williamson's other story, maybe he received this role because he was mad and the director decided to act as an art or method When the actor announces Hamlet is crazy, you believe that! Marianne Faithful is an amazing beauty and able to convey the role of Ophelia and still pass away. This set is dark and divine. But seems to be shooting in a real castle, especially the scene in the tunnel / path that the dead king shines in the sky
