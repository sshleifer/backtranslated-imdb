Who am I? No, I'm not kidding. That's what it says in real video. <br /> <br /> Convert; Quick: Beautiful woman standing smiling For some reason this causes everyone to kill each other. <br /> <br /> "Search Ariel ... Where is Ariel ... Can't find Ariel ..." She is behind you. <br /> <br /> The thing that can be said about this terrible little space Opera has already been said. It looks like <br /> <br /> A group of actors playing. Is a character that plays as a prisoner before The casting was quickly knocked down. Then they fell in the same way. Every scene is broadcast nearly fifteen minutes in advance. Maybe it was a drawing of a straw to see which actors had the most screen time and paid more checks. Aliens, viruses / holograms / VR witches / mistakes. Looks like there is no physical strength and does nothing. Why isn't she on the computer instead of doing her "teleporting vampire" routine? (Actually, it's more interesting if you are a vampire or do more than just stand and look at other people, which is what you used to do enough to make all men kill each other ..) <br /> <br /> This is not a space flick. There are many pictures of old-fashioned western routes. Easy Rider route in the 1950s. The film noir nightclub scene, even trotting on the beach in fantasy land, has no real depth or meaning. The club is black and white. Of course, working with "The Wizard of Oz" doesn't work well here. This may be a good thing because the pictures that they show are very stupid. You may cry at that time, especially when you see the "space ship" that is about three inches long. <br /> <br /> There is no feeling for the characters because they are prisoners. Or without personalities, but because they want serious study, except Billy Dee Williams, who looks depressed and lost, probably because of this job ... <br /> <br /> This is one of them. The movie that, when viewed with friends, will make some silence "loud", especially when the foolishness of his efforts in one cartoon comics (Including a line about French kissing a meteor ...? I heard that Right? Maybe not ...) <br /> <br /> The original virtual girl has "killed" which does not mean anything because they are not real. Start with okay. "Other characters" are not. So <br /> <br /> The funny thing is the scene that makes the video box look horrible - skulls - aliens (green filters are placed on top to make it more. .. Well ... green appearance) which is actually Android after he was killed and ultimately nothing related to anything else that is working. <br /> <br /> Another story that I obvious Whenever there is an explosion (At least in my cheap DVD copy) Everything becomes a high pixel. I don't mean pixelated LITTLE. I mean a large block, about 1 in 16 of the size of the screen. Wow.
