This film can be judged from three perspectives: according to the history as the profile of Amin as the creator of the thriller. <br /> <br /> It failed as history mentioned in passing the coup thrown. Obote Asian expulsion and Entebbe hi-jack in the background but not in a consistent time frame, in chronological order. <br /> <br /> As an Amin profile, it may be interesting.

If you know Uganda or read a book - don't see the movie - it will make you depressed And if you want to know why the doctor is so reckless - he can't
