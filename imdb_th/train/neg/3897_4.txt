Top-rated comedians have I.R.S. representative Tony Randall exploring a strange farm family in Maryland that has never paid taxes; Debbie Reynolds is the daughter of a tomboy farmer who squeezes taxpayers who are not interested. Debbie makes her participate in the inferior sitcoms in this period - and this girl is no better than bad. The pictures start brightly. But having a flag at the center of the spot, Randall is not a bad match for Reynolds, but the tank can beat the chemistry. Based on the novel "The Darling Buds of May" by H.E. Bates, which has a bad sound mix, makes all actors listen as if they were stuck in the room.
