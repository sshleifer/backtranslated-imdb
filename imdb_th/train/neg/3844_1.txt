First of all, I want to tell everyone who has watched this movie that the actors playing "Transvestite" is one of my friends. His name is Robert Dugdale. He is a great actor, although it is not said. Much about his work, he has played many plays and musicals. He currently lives in Terrace BC. That's where I came from. He came to our house almost every Saturday. * Laughs * Okay, now about the movie. Look The main reason I found it to be a bad movie is that it was never in that place. It came back between times, so it's hard to follow at some point, and the second is really boring. visit The movie doesn't compare.
