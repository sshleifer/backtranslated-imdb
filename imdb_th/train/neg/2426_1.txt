Believe me, this is one movie that you want to avoid and this story comes from a fan of Denzel Washington. The disappointing part is that it is one of the three great movies. The first part of this film serves a special role in creating characters and new relationships between Creasy and the women he paid to protect. This movie trailer talks about how she was kidnapped. So I won't give anything when I say that the film has deteriorated until almost impossible to detect after she was kidnapped. No matter what director is trying to accomplish, what he accomplished is to make the audience truly nauseous. The fast, agile and absent cuts will follow for another half hour while Creasy tracks offenders. These wounds are weird and disgusting that what they do is shake you out of the story. I am sure the director thinks that the insecure way of presenting this story is indicative of the change in the character of Creasy and indicates that other movies must follow. The result is a tragic ending. The ruins, though, are the first forty minutes of quality.
