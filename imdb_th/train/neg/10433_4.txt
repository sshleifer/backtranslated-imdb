The fighting scene is great. Love the old and new cylinders and how to paint the cylinders on the side. It's the ending I hate. I was disappointed that it was the world but returned 150,000 years but traveling all the way to a new beginning Are you kidding me? 38k people who fight for their existence and when they ascend to heaven, do they abandon technology? No way. Of course, they're eating paper and rationing food, but it's over. They can have Life like a human being again They have only one good doctor. What do they do when people with a toothache never think of giving birth ... Yes, then no one can choose.
