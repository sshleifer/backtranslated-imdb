Some people call Howard Koch schlockmeister But he wrote the screenplay for "Casablanca", right? He might have more than one Koch that blasted around Hollywood and I didn't like "Casablanca" anyway. Wait a moment - yes, there is another Howard Koch. That flashes around Hollwyood, that is, the person who wrote "Casablanca". It doesn't matter. I will focus on this comment as "Howard W. Koch" put into this productions, which will say a little. /> <br /> Do you know what this sound is like? Some people read Cliff's notes about Shakespeare's "King Lear" and decided because there was no original idea on Inbound Inspiration Express to update and Hollywoodize with the end of happiness. <br /> <br /> There are differences. Lear decided to divide the vast land between the three sisters and before doing so, asked them how much they loved him. Two sisters threw his feet and a brown nose to receive his money. The third is a good boy and refuses to go to the opera on Lear. But in the drama Lear still lives to regret his decision to let both men hide and discourage honest women. He winded madly and naked during a storm on a grass field, placing flowers in his hair and seeing hallucinations. Children can do that to you. (For example, my son, after all the efforts I used to raise him, did he show an interest in being a doctor or not a lawyer?) In the end, everyone in the drama must die. <br /> <br /> In the movie, it was clear that the good sister was impatient and committed suicide. But when she tries to make herself jump in and save her life, the ending is so happy or less That is the difference between Hollywood and true tragedy, unless you define Hollywood as a sufficient tragedy for yourself.
