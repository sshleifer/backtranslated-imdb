This cheap (extreme) movie is compared to the classic classic "Silent Night Deadly Nightly Night" because it has been identified as Slasher Flick. First, let me say that I think even "Silent Night Part 2" Still better (Which is filled with more than half of the original events in the movie) "Christmas Evil" tries to make psychology by introducing the main character as a slow (slow) person (very slow). He is frustrated with people who can't. Accepting the true meaning of Christmas and in the workplace, he cannot stand that the toys that are invented are lacking in quality and love. Dressed as Santa, he eventually goes on a fun killing. It is also a strong word because only 3 people are killed without the need for special techniques. No tension, no excitement, no blood, no actors For one exception: Jeffrey DeMunn is in there. He is well known for playing Tom Hanks as one of The Green Mile defenders. He still has to kick himself today to take on the role. He is the only person who can truly act. He has a better supporting role than the main leader. (Those who are not bad But if you are obscured by a little character, your support is not good as well). What a strange ending? (You have to look to believe it) "Christmas Evil" is totally boring. Nothing happens and the artwork is just misleading. This is not a slasher. You want to see a real Christmas slasher. Try to see the greatest moment: "Silent Night , Deadly Night "
