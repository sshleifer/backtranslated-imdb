One question: Why, first of all, the evidence is not funny or engaging at all. They use tape-based interviews and apply sounds to animals that speak various parts. First of all, the interview is not a joke or entertainment to start, and even if they are, I'm sure they will be more entertained when they first watch without becoming a cartoon. How does it add to the hilarity? I opened the CBS Monday night sitcom. (Which has become a normal way for me to relax after a stressful working day on Monday) and find this in Of course, sitcoms will be screened again in the summer. But seeing those episodes come back to have more fun I tried to give the opportunity to "CC". I really did. When it started, I thought that maybe it was funny. Nope and then went on. It took half an hour. <br /> <br /> And I almost saw that there was a purpose if the interview was fully shown and pointing to them. But not it is just a clip, one line cut and paste together really fast It's like the horrific Cartoon Network Robot Chicken game. I'm not a fan of the sitcoms that have now canceled CBS's "The Class" while in it. It's half an hour of the sort that I will fight through. But if it comes down to me, decide throughout the season of "Creatures" or three episodes .... Conclude that I will study "Class" a couple of hours before airing and I come here to see if I am the first person to comment ... I think it's a good sign that nobody looks at it and it will. Not long after, Cartoon Roadkill
