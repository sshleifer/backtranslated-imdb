Examples that are funny and I don't usually go to watch movies in the open night, especially with my children ... ...... You never know. This is a movie that doesn't appeal to children or adults because of the jokes too much for children and falls Love in entertainment for adults. Actually, I'm embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 years and have to explain my 6 years of age in what SH * T spells. What happened here is a classic twist of Dr. Seuss Manphe Began an evil and lazy neighbor who wanted to marry the child's mother for her money If that was a subplot, maybe that would be normal. But it became a major issue around the movie, both "Cat" played a more sub-role in revealing neighbors with his mother. Use my advice and read books and pass movies.
