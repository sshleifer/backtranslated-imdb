Of course, I've seen bad movies in my life. But this one is terrible that I'm angry at the cinema. I need a refund I wrote to the director who asked him to refund my movie ticket. Of course, I didn't receive a refund. (Or even an answer) but it's an important issue in levels 1-10. I gave this movie -42. Why "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer ??) stopped running from being hit by a bat Why do they hit the "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer ?????) with the bat in the first place instead of breaking the skull of the butt? The plot is skinny. The movie is full of clear ancient ideas and parts of it are not reasonable.
