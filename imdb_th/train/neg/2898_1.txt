Wowwwwww About an hour ago, finally I watched this movie very badly !!! I want to close within the first 10 minutes, but I think I will give you a chance because it just got better. Or at least have the qualification to exchange, for example, I think at the very least it will make you think of a genre movie or intelligently or shoot well or something ... no need to say that is not the case and I Wasted about an hour and a half in my life I didn't even think about why it was so bad because it wasted time explaining that "There may be spoilers" ... IMDb. You should calm down with spoilers and pay attention to the people. Rate movies and comments will not receive compensation for writing good reviews or related to movies or anything like that. I thought it was amusing after the film was so bad to see a bad rating, and I was shocked to see the ratings quite high ... All ratings with around 7-10 stars must be clear. Completely movie ... I am still a big IMDb fan but seriously thinking about the scoring process because this movie should be ranked not higher than maaaybbbeee like 3
