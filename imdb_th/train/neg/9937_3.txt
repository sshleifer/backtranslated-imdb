First, this movie is a very old movie, with no emphasis on explaining the political revolution in the left wing. Honestly, when people say that the only way to truly revolutionize is to stop being wise. (Which in itself is quite ridiculous because the answer comes from being a wise person) it makes me desperate As if we should all go back to being a monkey on behalf of equality - it's just ridiculous Our intellect is only one of many human qualities, but this does not mean that we should not educate at the highest level. But no doubt that this unrelated text relates to Goddard's rock music. So Rolling Stones, <br /> <br /> the song 'Sympathy for the Devil', which is our creation, that we have seen and from movies that use its name The chord sequence, which is not original, is especially used for the better results in Led Zeppelin's 'Thankyou' (Led Zeppelin II). 'Mick Jagger' Sir Jack declaims in his often ambiguous manner. (Like Bob Dylan) - Notice that the first melodious phrase is repeated without any effect again. The panther that appears in this film doesn't seem to know what they are fighting for. The most interesting scenes are related to the equations of fascism and pornography. The message is actually destroyed. Sexual 'liberation' of the 1960s and today (of course, the message to deny the behavior of The Rolling Stones during the time the film was made) <br /> <br /> No wonder the DVD comes free with The Sunday. Times! For a truly profound historical expression of left wing sympathy, listen to Luigi Nono's masterpiece 'Al Gran Sole carico'd'amore'.
