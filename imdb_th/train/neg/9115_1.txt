If you ask me, the first one is really better. Look at Sarah M. G. She is a cruel girl. See Amy Adams. She is a small fool hanging around. She has nothing! People don't love you! Secondly, Sebastian is cute and hot in the first movie. He is now "boy face". The story is not good and I don't understand. Why didn't they do this first? It was the beginning. The actor Loosy had nothing to do with the story. This is not cruel. This is playing. The first one has better performers, better stories and its meaning. I think music is better in cruel intent 1 and music is better than in cruel intent. 3 It's not the worst movie I've ever seen.
