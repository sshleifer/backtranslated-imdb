Watch this movie when it first came out in 1970 and hate hate hate! Easily the most booooring movie I've ever seen in my life Do not know where Leh was inspired from? But this is one of the movies that you want to shake the characters so that they open their mouths and communicate. The name says it all because there is no economical time in this film. The long and long silence that people can't tell how they feel (assuming) if you want to see something that will make you drink Then this is what you need If you have nothing better than doing two hours and try to separate the toaster: the experience will be more satisfying than you can get from this! Yes, Leigh produced many valuable things later in his career. But miss this
