This time there is no movie value. I have to learn to ignore the critics who are crazy about small films like Fargo and lose all the time. <br /> <br /> The theater is full and everyone has a reaction. br /> The film's hook is a black-skinned daughter who is looking for and discovering her white trash family. <br /> <br /> The performance is fantastic. <br /> > Production (lighting, set, editing, sound) is about 2 steps. Or about 60 minutes, the character is shallow and unwise I was insulted by the fact that these people could not understand each other what the audience was obvious. The audience is complaining to the movie screen what the characters should say next. <br /> <br /> I'm more fun in washing clothes.
