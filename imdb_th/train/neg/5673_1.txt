I said Oedpius Rex because it was a tragedy that this movie created too !!! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I never hated Uwe Boll like most people without humor in IMDb! <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll movies like Postal and Tunnel Rats are not good, fun and fun. But actually this movie is very scary I hate it so much that I can score zero if I can. The story is just shit! It took four out of five movies to create the plot, and then they had the middle, which was just a horrifying horror scene! Eventually ended with "villan winning ending" which was totally accepted. But of course it might be more tasteful! <br /> <br /> I'm not against Uwe Boll (as I said earlier) and I don't like violent movies. I f ** king love violent movies! I love the movie Saw, the movie Hostel, Tokyo Gore Police, The New York Ripper, 28 stories, Dog Soldiers, My Bloody Valentine, the last house on the left, Watchmen, Wolf Creek, all Tarantino movies, Sam Peckinpah. Cannibal f ** king Holocaust! But here! OMFG !!! <br /> <br /> This is cruel, sadistic and in the wrong way! And watch the movie I show! If I like Cannibal Holocaust, it's not that bad. No need to go dark again! You are funny when you are a soft-hearted person like Ed Wood. This is just an awesome experience! I feel terrible after seeing this thing. <br /> <br /> Don't watch !!!! Avoid all costs !!!!!
