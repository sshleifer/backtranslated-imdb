I chose to watch movies at the Dubai Film Festival recently because I was chosen to participate in the prestigious Cannes Film Festival. I was surprised that Cannes might have a reputation for quality judgments. <br /> <br /> Films Some critics argue that there is not too much gunfire - but natural violence is disgusting. Imagine killing your enemy / opponent in front of your little son or forcing someone to eat a porcelain spoon to prove loyalty. There are some hints about Corleone's son in Copolla's "Godfather" that seems to be re-used in this Chinese / Hong Kong movie, but the quality of the two is clearly different as chalk and cheese. The movie is recommended for those who use violence .. There is no movie here. The best may be considered better than production. Run Run Shaw for production value
