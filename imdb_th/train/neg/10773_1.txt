I just watched this horrible thing on TV. There's no need to say it's one of the movies you watch just to see how bad it is. Frankly, I do not know how much the band can be reduced. <br /> <br /> The character consists of one type of lame stereo after another and a clear effort to create another "Bad News Bears". Say the least. <br /> <br /> I saw a turkey that was precious in my time. But there is no reason to show any of their items since this is "Numero Uno". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Let me take it for you like this. Because it's terrible, it's funny ... this ... it's not good at all
