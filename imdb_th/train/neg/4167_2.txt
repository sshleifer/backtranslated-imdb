"Mr. Fix It "The man who was left asking for help from him to get his girlfriend back to them. <br /> <br /> Among the problems of this matter Movies are script editing and performances. Although I found Boreanaz a delight in his other film roles. (Except for the movie "Crow" that he did) this disappointing thing Sometimes his characters are interesting and others are flat. Supporting actors remind me of the opera players of the day. I know it's not an economical movie. But some scenes and music are not correct. <br /> <br /> My advice: See your own risk.
