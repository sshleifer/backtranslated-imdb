This movie is terrible. Okay, my favorite movie is 'The Wicker Man' (1973), so I am always bound to be biased. <br /> <br /> The shaky plot with enough to throw the original elements That 'rebuilding' is very suspicious (He is not a virgin There are many things that are unreasonable and unexplainable, which I'm afraid that Mr LaBute is not a horror movie. (The two of us clearly blown in the car at the beginning and still alive at the end of the movie?) The cage looks haggard and confused and his role tends to call "Rowan!" The least disturbing 'nod' and the original are frustrated when it comes out tacky instead of showing respect. For example, some events reflect the original. (The girl came out of the closet, pretending to be dead when Woodward / Cage was searching for the island) and many conversations were drawn directly from the original screenplay of Anthony Schaffers. <br /> I'm confident. That other people will provide better analysis and more details, I do not want to write anything about this movie again, there is no substance, throw it on the debris, along with other remakes that create names that good Of movies that they are 'based on' (in this case, very loose)
