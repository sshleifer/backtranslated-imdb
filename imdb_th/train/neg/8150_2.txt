If you want hours that are not very desirable and reasonably amusing, you can watch it. It's not really a bad thing. Yes, it has more logic than I can explain here and may tax people 'patience - like myself. I have to accept - those who tend to throw things on TV on occasion. But at least it's funny Just because it's not always a joke, you don't have to let you down. <br /> <br /> However, if you've read a book - or other Brookmyre books - you might be the best. I read them all and when I watched this movie for the first time, I insulted it. I dumped it into the trash thoroughly and very long on other websites. In fact The TV story is almost unrelated to this book and serves to rape and make fans crazy about Brooks. (And crazy) a lot of honest. <br /> <br /> The best advice ..? See this, then read the book, only you make a comparison and send your judgment.
