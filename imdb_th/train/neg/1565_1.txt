This film uses a modern name for a weak story. Kill Kill would definitely be good. The movie consists of a forbidden scene so that viewers look back and sit on the chair That scene is not necessary and is missing. This movie is something that new screen writers may think of. Just waste money from movie props and network money. I have to write 10 lines of text to criticize this film when it's not worth 10 lines in my time. But I have to push to let people know that it should avoid nonsense If people trust you to choose a good movie for returning movies, choose something else. If you have a soul, don't destroy it by making yourself dirty.
