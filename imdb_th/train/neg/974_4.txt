This movie sounds like it is fun and interesting from the description. But for me it's a bit down Very slow and difficult to follow and see what happens. As if the filmmakers took each piece of film and threw it into the air and then flung them together, no matter where they went (Not in the order) In addition, there is no subsequent filming I watched a slightly different Korean movie and noticed that the good part was well done and had to use the audience's mind, which is different from other Hollywood movies But this one makes me dazed. I watched the movie for the second and third time and it still didn't do anything for me. I still don't really understand what the filmmakers are trying to convey. If it is a demonstration of the lives of the common people, I think he is successful. But i am looking for more I can't recommend this movie to anyone.
