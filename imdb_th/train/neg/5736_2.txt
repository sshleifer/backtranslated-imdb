This is one of the worst movies I've seen for many years !! You can randomly 5 people out of the road and they can do better than anyone in this movie. Wasting a lot of time watching it. I gave only 2 because I liked the movie full of blood. But this is just plain garbage. The performance (and I use this word loosely) is disgusting. Someone, please tell me that all 5 main actors in this story are making their first movie or not. Don't waste time watching this thing. What is the better movie hostel? I do not want to believe that people spend money on doing this. I hope manufacturers will only pay $ 50,000 - it looks like a school project done by children. Does this make the movie theater?
