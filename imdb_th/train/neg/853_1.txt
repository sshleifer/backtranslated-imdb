Ok, actually I don't see why everyone thinks this is great. It's not really There are two good things that come out of this movie. 1. Jack's performance. He's so good that I can tip his hat. Nobody else said that it was pretty stupid. And what is Stanley Kubrick's idea of ​​drawing a Shelly as Wendy? She's terrible. She looks the same every time she is scared. The problem of this movie is the ending. I will have more respect if Kubrick will end up in a different way. And all the movies are foolish The problem with movies is that books are much better. So don't watch movies, read books and you will improve a lot. 3/10
