I like original horror movies I'm a big fan of parody - it's my favorite humor. Sometimes it is seen as the smartest humor. It seems that the Wayans boys will understand that concept perfectly in the original movie and forget it for a while when creating the sequel. I think Wayans is a family of comedians. Alas, even the genius made a mistake. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a promise. I like the parody of "The Sorcerer", especially "Out Mom". The mouth is now a quality material of Wayans, but other than that, I can only think twice that I laugh: 1) When Tori Spelling was tempted during In the middle of the night with the spirit At the same time, he said "It's just a call to the bandits !!" That's a joke. 2) The parody of "Save the Last Dance" that the character Cindy beats inadvertently while the girl is training her new posture. But even a short laugh could not be compared to the laughter of the first horror movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is a pure trash. The jokes from the first film that are sensitive or implied are expanding and too much. For example, in Scary Movie I, there are many writings to say that Ray's character is gay. This is hilarious, but in the second horror movie, the male and female penis strangulation scene is terrifying and unlikely. Believe This is the format of the entire movie. Shock Shock * alone * Not filming far. This is a trend in 2000 and 2001. Unfortunately, <br /> <br /> as much as it gives me a very low Wayans movie rating. I have to give 2 out of 10.
