Even with excellent actors But this is a movie without a logo, especially from the aviation perspective. It may be somewhat better than "von Richthofen and Brown" that is awesome but not too much. "Blue Max" is still the best market in the last 35 years, while "Darling Lilli" is fun if not serious It's interesting to guess what ILM can do with Zeppelins and Gothas in the high quality WW I aero movie.
