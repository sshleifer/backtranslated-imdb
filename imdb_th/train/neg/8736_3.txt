This movie has a good concept. But the operation was not possible. <br /> <br /> What is this concept? The smartest thing is "Dirty Harry", corresponding to "M". The child killer begins to scare the city. Leading detectives (Dennis Hopper and Frederic Forest) never deal with murderers. Before The mayor and the police chief, in despair, hire a local mob to speed up ... to go to various places and do things that the police can't do to end this mess as soon as possible. <br /> <br / > To be fair, this movie has really good things to offer. <br /> <br /> In addition to the concept, I like the look of the killer's hideout. Norman Bates has his basement. This guy has an eerie drain. In some shots, the light bounces out of the water and creates reflections on the wall. Often making these scenes with creepy quality like a dream. <br /> <br /> The performance is also good. Dennis Hopper is one of the older actors. <br /> <br /> When you pass away, it will become more and more depressing. <br /> <br /> This movie walks the story. Too soon, the actual investigation process from both teams felt the rush when compared to the complex and fascinating feelings. This may be resolved in two ways: making the movie longer or cutting some parts. These will help the team to devote time to the actual mystery. <br /> <br /> To be An example of this badness is one of the key clues that help them to be zero in the proper suspect. At one point in his life, the suspect went to the pet shop ... correct ... I'm serious about this. It's like they go from point A (the first clue) to the point Z (the suspect) and skip the step "between" all. <br /> <br /> There is a character. The only thing I like is the two bags you meet about halfway through the movie. When considered as a secondary character, I would call it a bad sign. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a mob corner. This is what makes me the most benefit because this is the reason I $ 3 to buy a DVD from the first What do I mean by hook! During the last 10-15 years, there is a certain number of consecutive killers. The mob angle is the mechanism by which COULD helps it to be higher than the rest ... but can't. <br /> <br /> I think the gangster's methods are cruel. But it's fun and exciting at the same time; Is like a vigilante movie or something ... maybe they will throw some movie robbery elements as well We are talking about criminals after all. We get the most nasty protagonists who are committed to celluloid. What did the detective question the mob witness? They interrogated and killed them. Not that these witnesses are too bad. I found criminals less than the killer they were hunting. <br /> <br /> If the good score I mentioned is enough to get attention. Maybe someday they will reuse the same concept and do it correctly. I hope so I hate to see such good ideas.
