This is one of the movies that are severely disturbed. Although they deserve what they have received ... the sadistic executions of the sadistic are "above" a little. The only character that shows conscience during the first part of The hunt was killed before he gave some help in the sad story. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie But this is just a trick to convince the audience to feel safe before the happiness of what will happen. <br /> <br /> The only thing that can save my movie is if Jack Nicholson jumps out. From the bush and shouting "Where is Batman?" Kim Bazinger may scream. <br /> <br /> Now it's cool!
