As a joke I'm watching it in Channel 1 and I think watching dry colors is more fun. What happened to Caspar Van Dien that brought him into this nightmare? Great performances, a very boring plot and a terrible direction. It was really scary. It should be full of doubt. But it is more funny If you want to see a terrible performance, writing a chapter and a small story, watch this movie. If I were Van Dien, I wouldn't ask for only 10% from my agent But shot the illegitimate child in the process What is turkey It's not suitable to be a MST 3K !! It will be a good movie to treat you insomnia. I like the part that Van Dien threw over the water and came back in just a few minutes! I can imagine that this was written by a non-partner writer, taking advantage of the author's protest. It's a very scary movie !!!
