This is a popular movie that may be due to the humor in this story, fast-moving stories, depressing characters, clumsy sounds, etc. The funny thing is that you can't create a movie with this title, but "white" is something. Any other thing is considered a racist by PC police. <br /> <br /> However, Woody Harrleson, as a white man who becomes a good person, if not better than a black basketball player One /> Snipes had plenty of comedy to humor a lot. The bad part of this movie - which doesn't bother a lot of people - is the most rude in here and the boredom of every character. That includes Woody's girlfriend, played by Rosie Perez. There are no good and clean people in this movie. For this reason, I cannot recommend this movie sincerely, at least not to make friends or blasphemers.
