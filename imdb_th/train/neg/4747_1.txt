I think this movie is terrible. I am a Chinese person, so I think everything is wrong. Many facts are incorrect. The only thing that is correct about Chinese history in the film is when Wendy's mother explained to her husband about the statue that protects ShiHuangDi. Many actors and actors are not very good. Some jokes that should be "funny" are really stupid. I think this movie should be ranked as bad as possible. Disney must really get more information about Chinese history if they want to create an extravagant movie. Mulan is quite accurate. Watch this movie if you want to waste time.
