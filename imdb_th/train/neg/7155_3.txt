I'm sorry but I don't like this doctor a lot. I can think of millions of ways. It's better. People who make it clear that there is not much imagination. The interview is not very interesting and there is no real insight. This image is not composed in a very informative format as well. It's too bad because this is a movie that deserves special features to watch. One thing I would say is Isabella Rosselini, more beautiful than she received. All considerations will be given '4' only.
