It is difficult for me to believe with all the horrible truths that have been demonstrated in recent years. This one must take the top spot for the worst. I still wonder if this is just a forgery of the SCTV gang. If Andy Kaufmann is still alive, I can be sure that he is behind this story. Can a rock band bend lower than INXS to do such a shameful thing? The evidence is easy and morally The karaoke audition group refused to be the new lead singer of INXS to replace Michael Hutchence (who killed himself in 1997) for eight years and is no longer popular. The culmination of pathos by self-testing to select a group of talented and talented people to become the new lead singer of the band that is 20 years old. So they jogged these horrible singers (me C American Idol is that the share of doozies) the repeated brutal music with classic rock music. Then they cut the INXS members who spoke seriously about the advantages of each candidate. You can see better rock performers at every nightclub in any city in the world. <br /> <br /> It has an unconventional element of other reality shows. Participants Lame Reality Interview Lame, host / host Lame "Judging" the show and the boot of one participant at the end of each program. Can these items be predictable? Obviously showing the ability to publicize the band; The last hope to find a star that disappeared before they were buried in the forgiveness of Michael Hutchence. If he had a formidable life when still alive, he had to roll into his grave. Great music before But I don't know how pathetic it is. If INS is a representative of rock and roll, this show will be the final proof that rock and roll is one of them and is dead.
