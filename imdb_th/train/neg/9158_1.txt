Oh my god. I bought this movie and ... I ... see ... all things ... ... okay, it's okay ... I know I will be okay in one or two. Last month, I hope to get rid of flash backwards. I'm going to eat something after the movie. But I can't get up to try the food that is currently not good? Yes, bad, very bad. BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD Hey, he doesn't seem to get the message through the right way. Hmm ... There is no word that describes horrors .... not scary ... Hmm ... Nasty. disgusting Now I don't know what to do except throw it away. It is possible to burn it. I don't want it to end at the bottom of a thousand years of architecture. The worst movie since "Hey Happy"
