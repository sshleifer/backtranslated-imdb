We all ask ourselves "Why don't they create a slasher movie that works that way instead of making a great movie? They can do better?" Well, with the Prom Night they've done a new average. But the fun of the 80s movie Jamie Lee Curtis and made it worse It is a drawing from a movie number slasher which tries to attract teenagers clearly. (So ​​there is no violence, etc.) The knife in this movie represents violence. The director spends a lot of time trying to make the killer look interesting. There is another thing that goes out of the actors window, including Britney Snow (which is great in spray). Try the hardest work. But the material does not do anything but frowning and frightening Will hear the attack It seems that the only place that the knife in this film works in is the editing kit because the movie seems to be killed. (I guess the terrifying thing from the distance ends at the floor of the room to not let the children be scared.) But in pouring money from Americans, send this movie to number 1 at the box office !!! Slasher movies are very fun, but in the case of Prom Nights it makes me want to download the original. I see scarier OC and Dawsons Creek episodes.
