Considered by John Doe, apparently inspired by the creator of Kyle XY, I expect that its pilots are very interesting. However, I might have too high expectations because I am quite disappointed. First of all, they changed their supporters to become crazy people with crazy ideas about showing his amazing knowledge in front of audiences in public areas. So after that scene, I began to worry that it was just entertainment. But the problem is that it's worse because there are no other characters introduced They pay too much attention to John Doe, which makes the story less interesting. I was a little disappointed by Dominic Purcell's performance because I found that he didn't make John Doe reliable. Another problem is police matters. It feels like Déjà Vu and feels uncomfortable. It leads us to the worst problem in the scene format group. I saw the filler after that. <br /> <br /> So overall I was very disappointed and didn't recommend anyone. Considering how bad it is for me to understand better now, why the program was canceled Sometimes I feel that it has missed the goal. Character development to help the protagonist find his identity. It's sad because it has the same potential as the people he met at the club. The production quality is quite good and the casting is correct. But I will never know that it will be better, maybe not because I'm not planning to watch the next episode.
