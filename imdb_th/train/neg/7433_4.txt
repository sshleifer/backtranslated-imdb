I have to say honestly before I fall somewhere somewhere in the middle, so I can't fully comment on this movie until I see it full. In general, bandits include Sid Carter (Sid James) and Ernie Bragg. (Bernard Breslaw) plans to steal birth control pills from the maternity hospital Finisham. This is where the character name Matron (Hattie Jacques) works with team member Sir Bernard Cutting ( Kenneth Williams), Dr. Francis Goode (Charles Hawtrey), Dr. Prodd (Terry Scott) and Nurse Susan Ball (Barbara Windsor). Patients and visitors are also nearby, like Mrs. Tidey (Joan Sims) who is pregnant and Tidey, her husband (Kenneth Connor), who is her father. Starring Bill Maynard as Freddie and Wendy Richard EastEnders as Miss Wilding This plan doesn't work because everyone is traveling. That's a story that everyone can say about the movie until I can see it again. Okay!
