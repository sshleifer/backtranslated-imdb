I'm glad some people like this. But i hate this movie It is a very good idea for the story. But that is the end It's not good to write, not good and bad. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting issues. But they were skipped too quickly, the writers need to be aware of what needs to be treated. Like lying about why she was kidnapped and dumped instead of "what happened". 5 seconds later, they told you <br /> <br /> This movie had no doubt and I got bored from the beginning end I just want it to end. <br /> <br /> Go and rent the misery or the best plan if you need a doubt or a twist that makes you guess how to finish it.
