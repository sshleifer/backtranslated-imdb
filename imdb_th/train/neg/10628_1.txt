This "documentary" is called trying to say that the United States pretends to make up the lunar lunar year. <br /> <br /> Everyone who has studied this story really knows. <br /> <br /> First of all: there is certain evidence that when the astronauts were on the moon, they brought many stones back from the moon for geological studies. These things spread all over the world to hundreds of labs that have passed the tests. And they all concluded that they came from the same planet, not the world, because the inner isotopes of the basic elements are different from those found on Earth. But similar to that calculated on the moon. IE conspiracy theorists have never studied anything: they take things that fit their theory and don't care about the rest. <br /> <br /> Another claim that Wrong from them is that the wind in the moving flag IE hangar has a reasonable explanation: the astronaut moves it with his hand, so it moves. And what proves this: If conspiracy theorists have studied images, they will see that the flag is not moving after astronauts let it be IE. The conspiracy theory is a bad scientist. Must or study just until they get what they come in so that they can lie from that and make a profit (this IE is called) <br /> <br /> Claims say it is impossible Has been taken up on the moon, because the shadows are all from different places due to the light sources of different artificial lighting of the studio. Another conspiracy theorist is unusual, like in the desert at night without a light source. But I suspect that any conspiracy theorist had been outside Grandma's basement for more than a day with more than a day of the Star Treck meeting. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy theories were in decline. Big time They only see what they want to see. So they lied all of this to seem important - that is the truth.
