Anyone who can find a ransom in this shit piece should be examined for their heads. We have a slow-hearted wife who is addicted to heroin and is a part-time partner who has blisters all over her body. Now she is spraying breast milk all over the kitchen floor, so the release is similar to Helen Keller's hand laying in the running water. We have a husband who begins with the patronage of a prostitute who is just his daughter. (She regretted him because he came too soon) and ended up killing his female colleague having sex with her corpse and then shuffling her. We have children who were persecuted by their classmates and returned home and beat their mother. You see it all in a deep circle, right? The only good time in this terrifying rag was when the father killed his son's torture case. It is good that this turkey filmed a video because otherwise it would be an expensive movie. If the man who thinks that the artist should be interested in this matter is really serious, it is not surprising that most people think that the artist lost consciousness. We saw this lousy movie and put "Zero Woman, The Accused" Oh, my God. It's a simple matter that is worse. What will happen today in Japan, sick, sick?
