I want to watch this movie because Elisa Dushku But she has a small part in it and her character is not very fond However, the main character played by Melissa Sagemiller is very beautiful and is the perfect pleasure to watch throughout the movie. This is nothing but a showcase for her looks and talents. She works very well. <br /> <br /> My own story on the face is very ridiculous. After a car crash, some friends may die. But still alive, while various mysteries arose, some villains followed them But we never know who they are (May be those in other cars But we didn't hear anything about why they were like that. The final scene seems very ambitious. But I can't do anything to be consistent Open scene where the bad guys (Who wears a strange mask) cuts the wrists of a blonde girl and collects some of her blood that has never been described or tracked Except that the bad guy should be a representative of a surgeon who is trying to get Cassie (Sagemiller) back from death ... but it doesn't seem to work. Bad people are bad people They just confuse things that might be interesting. In supernatural stories about death, love and sacrifice. Who the hell needs bad people <br /> <br /> 3 of 10
