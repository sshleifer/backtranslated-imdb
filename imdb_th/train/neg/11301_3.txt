Nothing can destroy the movie as much as the combination of bad screenplay and bad direction. This is the case with "The Mummy's Tomb". <br /> <br /> This script is a concept left from a better universal horror movie, such as "Dracula" and "Frankenstein". The direction is repetitive and musty. That performance was normal. Even Chaney's Kharis were weak compared to Tom Tyler in "The Mummy's Hand" and the producers were stupid enough to add images from the better prequel of Christy Cabanne and point out the weaknesses of their movies. <Br /> <br /> Universal recognizes how bad this film is, and essentially will rearrange it from the beginning two years later in the name of "The Mummy's Ghost" with better scripts and good directors. than The result is probably the best movie in their movie "Mummy", although not as close to the original Karl Freund manuscript in 1932. <br /> <br /> Cabanne's video makes this movie. Became the 3 "new" things to be the 2 best. Dick Foran and Wallace Ford might be happy to see their characters go on, so they don't have to appear in the wreck like this anymore!
