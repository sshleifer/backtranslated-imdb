Before I watched this movie, I heard many people saying that this movie is embarrassing. I don't believe that since Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey have a role in this film and watch it on their own. Obviously they were right. I'm really disappointed and wondering all the time in the movie - why the hell is watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Sure, I didn't expect much from Justin's business, but Morgan and Kevin? I couldn't stop asking myself why they thought of participating in Edison. Honesty, their role is rather stupid. <br /> <br /> You might think that players are sucking and I should pay more attention to it. It is true that it is the core of the movie. But you trust me ... This is not the movie you want to give credit to. Imagine this wise journalist. (Justin Timberlake) wrote anti-system stories and at the same time learned how to be a 'true' journalist from his chief. All of this was supported by an agent who still has a fair heart (LL Cool J) and a great detective (Kevin Spacey). At the end, they beat the system with a happy ending story. <br /> < br /> Jeez I can't continue to do this Just thinking about this movie made me sick. My recommended person. Don't watch this thing! Please save your money and time for other movies.
