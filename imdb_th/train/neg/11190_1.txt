First of all, I must say that I have worked for Blockbuster and have watched some movies until the point that is difficult for me to find something I have never seen before. Considering this, I want everyone to know that this movie is the worst movie ever made. It makes me feel good about Gigli, the daughter of my boss and the other pieces that you've seen. In his mind, I found only one who liked it and they couldn't tell me what this movie was about. If you can decode this movie and can tell me that you have to be a writer or a fortune teller because there are other ways that people can think about it. !
