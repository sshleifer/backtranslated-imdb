I rented this movie to see Amber Benson. But after reading the box, I think it sounds good. ..... However, the first problem is that there is no real story ... or actually there is a story. But it is not reasonable The second problem is that there are no settings for these characters ... Yes, I understand that they go to school together, but in the first 3 minutes of this movie, you know that they have nothing in common and don't like each other. .. So why are they gathering together? Defects number 3 ... The director, despite a long break and shooting in a tight camera, is equal to the suspense. (Especially with the general suspense song that was dubbed in) ... he was sadly misunderstood It was very painful to see a great actress like Amber Benson, trying to bring this thing back to life again ... My only hope was the money she made here was produced for the film. Her own
