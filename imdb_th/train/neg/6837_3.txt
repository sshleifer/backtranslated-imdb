Normally I do not like the movie Revenge .... Time but Double Impact is a little more than the plot of the original revenge. Do you see that DI has precision actions, exotic locations (such as Hong Kong), excellent gun fights and martial arts that are sufficient to satisfy your desire for unarmed combat? Just like flicking revenge, there is a villain that you want to throw away from the glass window on the top floor of the 40-story building! However, Double Impact has no prejudice, scandal, suffocation, and a social and class plot that invades "Eye for a Eye" and "Death Wish 2". <br /> <br /> But in the planning department, Double Impact As transparent as wrapping Saran Chad's parents and Alex are killed by a group of friends who connect with family members who have money problems or at least that's what I remember. Explanation of why the boy speaks with a French accent, so it is a punch. Not a water plot that makes this movie terrible. But using clich√©d and moving from other movies (from Lethal Weapon to The Princess Bride) makes it really bad. However, Double Impact can still be viewed. But why is this movie that has such a scandal? (For example, the greedy British man who killed Chad's parents and Alex and the red-chested lesbian chicks) You like to hate your body.
