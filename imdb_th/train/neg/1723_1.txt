What a fool it is! Not because it's not that good (Because I didn't expect anything from it) but because I was misunderstood by the DVD sleeve that poked my "star" without knowing that it was Stuart Whitman, Stella Stevens and Tony Bill. Appeared in the opening credits of this movie, very few left !! When it appeared, the only film that connected the three actors was LAS VEGAS LADY (1975) that was equally vague? But what we are related to THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER is that everyone can guess? <br /> <br /> Although it was because I paid $ 1.50 for rent and I was in the mood of a monster movie, I chose to watch this movie regardless and it was terrible! In addition to the fact that there are unnamed actors and nameless crews, unskilled air can be seen from many miles, and most of the things I can do is laugh at JAWS and deliberately acting The joke of two ordinary boat owners who often quarreled among themselves, with the local sheriff looking confused. Creature itself ?? a plesiosaur like half a dinosaur / half fish? With imperfect awareness (Naturally) but as it used to be in the case of THE GIANT CLAW (1957) that I just saw like this does not seem to disturb the filmmakers as much as they waved as much as possible. Especially in the second half of the movie!
