This became a cult film in Chinese students, although I didn't watch it until it was broadcast on channel4, UK. <br /> <br /> Full of excuse, arty excuse, 'soul' that wants to convey is how artists independent 'Resist the trade of the music industry' and maintain the 'purity of the art spirit' and probably not sell yourself for dirty money. That is really dizzy and superficial. Most diologue is poor. The performance is not good. The sceenplay is full of art. It's a fantasy movie for children and that's all. <br /> <br />
