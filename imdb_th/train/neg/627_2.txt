Oh dear This movie ... it's scary. I'm a big fan of horror movies. And most of the horror movies that others say is bad. I like The actors playing 'Scarecrow' are great. I will say that. But this plot is very bad It's not reasonable! It has too much blood and unnecessary sex scenes. (And disgusting) At first I believed that the director tried to be 'shocked' or whatever. But it came out very badly To add piles of pus, they are called actors (in addition to 'Scarecrow'), we are scary and I pay attention to them until I forget who I am. In conclusion, this movie made me sick. If you can avoid watching this movie, please do
