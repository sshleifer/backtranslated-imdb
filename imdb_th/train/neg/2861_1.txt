I do not want to believe that I will lose money to rent this movie. I think it's a porn flick when it starts and never gets better. Drowning performers, scary actors, save money! You have to read the movie all along. B They know that the song will drown out the voice. I have never been involved with a slaughterhouse or have to show that cows and pigs are killed This thing is related to BTK "real" killer? I understand why there are no famous actors in this movie. The script will make me turn around on the first page of reading. You should look better than drying the paint.
