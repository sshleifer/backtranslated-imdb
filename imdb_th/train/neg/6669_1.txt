I saw this film in my film class. I'm glad I didn't pay to see I came in with an open mind and a little excited. I enjoy Ed Norton and Ivan Rachel Wood and the rest of the actors are interesting. I never connected to this movie. The performance is excellent. The movie is interesting. But the story or rather the lack of it is a problem There is no center to connect the theme with the movie. Is it love between Norton and Wood? Hmm, not true. Is it a western style? Kind of, but without me, all to twist in the movie. Recently, I saw "Brick" and loved it, but the place where this film went was just out there It's very strange and if I don't want to sit and watch the whole movie, I would walk away. Writing is not scary. But it is everywhere When the film ended, I was confused and hoped it would end soon. There is something about this movie that doesn't reflect. I understand the movie more unusual things like "Fight Club" but I don't care about the characters at all.
