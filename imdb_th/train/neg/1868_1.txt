This movie is terrible. Every line was stolen from 8 mm (at least the Italian version). If you like trash ... Trash, let's see. But be careful: this is not a flick. "This is bad." In its badness, it may look like porn. But believe me if you are looking for "snuff", s & m, hardcore, softcore ... or even erotic arousal, plain to find anything in the store! I told you, 'Make photography that is definitely not boring and unbelievable. Acting, planning conversations. (The good line that I said earlier is what they stole from Joel Schumacher 8 mm!) For a few minutes and "Happy ending" is absolutely disgusting! I will give one star: half for a sudden shot in the background after a monologue "The victim's eyes" (also stolen from 8MM) and the other half for the mother and daughter's sexy body (That is not managed To make me completely awake while watching turkey anyway!)
