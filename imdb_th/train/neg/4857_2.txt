I really like ZB1. Really. I don't have a problem with movies that have a very low budget and I enjoy movies that have a lower production value than ZB3 (if you can imagine this thing, see 'wiseguys vs. zombies'. I like cheap zombie movies because I suspect Hollywood director doesn't understand that zombies are 'about'. <br /> <br /> But ZB3 is terrible. It's a moron. I don't want to be blamed for my criticism. I need 90 minutes to go back, etc., except that it only takes 80 minutes because some parts pass me. Put it forward fast. 1.4X <br /> <br /> Okay, here's a comment. <Br / > <br /> 1 The pacing is TERRIBLE. Everyone is talking alone. Even when someone has just one line, the camera works and editing and inserting a number of chain bombs in every sentence makes the line feel like a monologue. At first I was excited about 90 minutes of work time compared to the 70 minutes of ZB1. But actually there are fewer 'events' in the ZB3. It's all talking. <br /> <br /> 2 blood effects. Make the body puzzled Just rub around the belly of the people. <br /> <br /> 3 Despite the epic show But there is no real plot And the show is absolutely epic! I won't lose if you look at it (don't look at it) but then it's just a weak character. Walk around and fight for about 80 minutes or less if you choose.
