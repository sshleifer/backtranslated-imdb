Two tenants, writers, try to complete their books in the apartment house but empty. At first, they help each other and slowly create tension between them. Start building. <br /> <br /> This Is based on Bernard Malamud's novel Very little dialogue is natural, purple and full of shades of meaning. As if being an English major in college with a chief full of dialogue, script writing It's terrible, and I find myself immediately immune to everything this movie says, which is ashamed because this film has excellent performances from top to bottom. Snoop Dog on down is a good format. That no one can talk about the truth of words and places. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie While not really bad, it preach and pretentious to the point that makes you want to walk away. I lost less than a third of the method and had to fight to the end. If you are interested, I will try using the cable. But I will not earn good money
