I also saw this film in the local film screening about a year ago. First of all, I would say that it looks good. Cassella has an incredible ability and a great cinematographer. I just hope that this movie will look as good as it should be. I will not call this movie horror. Putting some rotting ghosts in a few shots doesn't make it a horror movie. No mystery, nothing to doubt. You know who's doing all the time. <br /> <br /> It's a drama. The performance is ok, I guess. But there is nothing special. <br /> <br /> And the slogan "Vengeance may die" .... Really? ... They should be sure that there are hundreds of horror / horror items. The movie has the exact same slogan. <br /> <br /> It makes me have to say something. But I know that there are many people working in this film and I know that they don't want people to smoke. Their ass so I gave my honest opinion
