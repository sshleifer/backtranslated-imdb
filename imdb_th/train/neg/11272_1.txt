... the first movie I had to walk away And it is a selection of actors and teams in advance (Not that I was involved, I hurriedly added) I made it through the first hour so I thought I had the qualifications to comment. But that is my limitation. <br /> <br /> As with other comments here, this thing has gone through what kind of QA, the worst conversation accumulation, the best of the performances made of wood Casting all the terrifying ones together without planning. <br /> <br /> The selection of Tara Fitzgerald's actors is strange. She has the worst Russian accent in film history. <br /> <br /> When I'm out of the screening, the director and producer are drinking in a bar outside the theater. Obviously they can't sit again. <br /> <br />
