Hunters chase what they think is men through the forest, even if the audience sees him as a werewolf. It seems that hunters will not understand this because after they shoot him, he looks normal when they are executed. <br /> <br /> A doctor implanted a werewolf's eyes as a man who lost himself in the experiment. lab The rich man had sex with his nurse. (Stephanie Beaton) before he can remove the bandage. <br /> <br /> After he leaves the hospital, he finds his wife cheating on him as well When the pump sends clouds through the amateur moon image (There are fake branches in front) He becomes a werewolf! His body is bigger, dividing his shirt and he wears a big werewolf mask on his head with red light in his eyes. His pants still remain. The mouth is incredibly chewing, although some robots (Or the hidden hand) in the eyebrows makes him look scary sometimes. <br /> <br /> Despite the poor werewolf costume But there is enough blood and blood And those things do quite well Despite having a good head cut later in the movie However, when a man falls from a high place, the bad figure will work. <br /> <br /> The rich man has a friend named Siodmak, who is a mysterious mystery expert and he accidentally accidentally encounters a small man. The crutches named Androse are also experts. They tried to help him a little. <br /> <br /> Rich, kill people who have made mistakes. One policeman investigated the murder and tried to attack Beaton, which did not care much for the lesbian scene, so nothing came. <br /> <br /> Quite cheap but between nude and blood and blood. Scary stories include (sort) the most dangerous games with The Hands of Orlac and The Wolf Man. It's quite fun. Available in itself or in the Scream Queens Vol 1 box set
