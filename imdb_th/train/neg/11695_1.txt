Calling a movie like "Thinner" that is not as good as calling around the world or Pauly Shore that has no talent, no news, but the way they get is what people want to know. <br /> <br /> As far as this movie .... This book is good, although it is a derivative of other stories from "Be careful what you want". Burke type plays as an overweight lawyer who kills Gypsy's daughter and Rub Her father cursed (Constantine from the room "TV 222") went several pounds a day. <br /> <br /> Like I said, it started well. But why do the villains have to be involved in it (Mantegna)? Why is changing to rely heavily on FX? I think it might be more effective if it focuses on the subtlety of weight loss, disease, death, gypsy myths and more. <br /> <br /> But it's not. Remember, this is Stephen King, who we are talking about. <br /> <br /> And the end ... almost like a book. In fact, the whole film speaks too much, feeling that we have to explain everything to us. Not that I expected "The Dead Zone" but I can do it without "Pet Sematary". Thank you again. <br /> <br /> At least one star tried to make good half-way makeup. However, the rest of the film is left to ... speak to me ... "thinner"
