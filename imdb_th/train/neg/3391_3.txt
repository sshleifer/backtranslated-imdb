I wonder who it is and more important, why the decision to call Richard Attenborough to bring the most bizarre feelings to Broadway over the years. He is the director who won the Academy Award. Yes, he wins for Ghandi. You are moron! Jeremy Irons is an actor who has won an Oscar. Do you want to see him play Rocky Balboa? Does he really have a musical experience? "Oh, it's a lovely war" You forgot? To answer your question, yes! This movie is disappointing, clear and simple. Not one ounce of fresh energy that survived the hard prosecution All the characters dance beautifully. They are charming. But their image is a drama I don't feel anything But when I saw it on stage I felt everything This movie should have new stars that are unknown. But celebrities with memorable faces, even the most invisible in the group A wonderful actor who can dance beautifully. Michael Douglas is in there. I actually forgot my mistake and you were right. There's nothing like Richard Attenborough's music. Michael Douglas
