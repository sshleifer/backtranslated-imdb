This is a movie that I hope I will recommend to my American friends, but after 4 attempts to finish the movie, I know I can't even close the nasty things. You are almost confident that the actual war didn't happen that long. Others will try to question my patriotism that criticizes movies like this. But you can't go to see Saving Private Ryan to LOC. Forget the difference of movie budget or audience - these things don't hinder the director of making intelligent movies. The length of the movie is not bad and the truth is repetitive - they attack the same hill. But given the name differently, I think LOC is a terrible terrain - this hill looks like my backyard. Character development sequence (The bad events of those looking back in their last moments before being used) should be in the movie and not just But included in one long memory To this day I haven't watched the ending. But there is a much better movie (not much talk) called the border
