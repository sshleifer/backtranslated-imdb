This is probably the most boring, worse and useless movie I've seen last year. The plot intended to have some philosophical perspectives appear to me as a terrible hollow copy of a matrix with many ancient ideas: police, lone wolves, good-looking, disturbed by sleeping with his gun .. . + And shy, but she is a good looking scientist. You add a plot of 2 cents and you have me robot! I was highly disturbed by the obvious advertising of brands such as FedEx, Audi, Converse, etc. This movie has a commercial selling point and tends to be a more poor advertising point, which is unfortunately not ending after 30. Seconds, I won't recommend this to my worst enemy if you have free time, watch good TV programs instead or read good books.
