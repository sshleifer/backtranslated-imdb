A good world follows the lives of young women, slaves and poor farmers in China. This film is based on Pearl S. Buck's novel. This story is great. But I hate that they decide to choose an actor in the role. Walter Connolly laughs as a farmer's father. He has a heavy American accent, like most leading actors that I can't even hear him say. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Hollywood can't get through the racist beliefs. In order to cast Asian people in the lead role, to bring the Anglos and make them look like Chinese people, similar to Anglos, who wear polished shoes on their faces to play African-American
