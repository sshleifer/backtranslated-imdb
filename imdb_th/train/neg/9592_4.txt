I just saw this movie recently, even though it appeared in 2001. I look forward to watching entertainment movies. But let me tell you, Princess Blade is nothing compared to Azumi. "Princess" is not so good at talking as you notice ... She warns me about Jean Claude Van Damme, who is looking at his point only Then beat the opponent's shit During the whole movie, I waited at least to hear a confession about what she liked, why she fought, which she loved and trusted. I waited in vain. A crappy movie. Crappy interaction Don't watch it if you don't want to be bored with your thoughts! It was so bad that I finally wondered how I would not scream in frustration 1 and a half hours. About. I gave 4/10.
