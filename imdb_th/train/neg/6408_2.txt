UPA's film has been surprisingly ranked in IMDb, despite the fact that the quality of the animation is far from Looney Toons, Disney and MGM in just a few years. Sadly, because of the increased costs of making beautiful cartoon with high frame rates and cute UPA style backgrounds (which was launched around 1950), began to dominate in the late 50s and 60s. This is dirty, cheap and they have won many Oscars in order to "prove" that the cartoon is mainstream. Therefore, lousy animations became the norm and this trend did not go back until 1980. <br /> <br /> This UPA movie is one of the first films. The characters are drawn in a simple way (simple. And they will use numbers sticks) and the background looks ugly - drawing a simple line with the colors added in the end style (There are often sponges <br /> <br /> For this story is a hoax with a strong jazz attitude. Some people will love this thing, others will find it very loud. It is a traditional story of "Frankie and Johnny" and because of filming and all, it may not be a great movie for kids. Heck because of animation and jazz, it's not a particularly good movie for me as well! Some people will read my reviews and no doubt I am a fanatic. (Which I am a level) However, I love movies, animations, and UPA style. This minimalist style is very far away and you can't seriously consider their great art. Come out very quickly, don't care about the Oscars and try to watch classic cartoons or anything else!
