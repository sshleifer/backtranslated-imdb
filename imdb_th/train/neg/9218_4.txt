The psychology of this movie is very strange to try and figure out. It is often billed as an anti-RPG movie, but it's not that easy. This is a clear conflict, which makes me wonder what (if any) they are trying to talk about gaming. <br /> <br /> They introduce every character in the house with advice. Those who divorced alcohol and didn't care about their lives, except for the time they pressured them to succeed. Tom Hanks is the worst content that just failed from other schools and still contacted the missing brother and May die. <br /> <br /> It's a couple of times that they play games to solve their real life problems. And at the end, when they went to see Robbie (Hanks), they were all happy and well adapted, having an adult career, solving problems, games (Daniel didn't want to design computer games anymore) And even Robbie's mother, who is constantly drunk and dissatisfied, is a happy and bright housewife that looks bright and floral. <br /> <br /> Of course, JJ (and seems very cheerful) decides to commit suicide. But the reason seems to be because he is a lonely boy genius who cannot date and not because of his character Death, which is famous in Jack Jack, the pathway (which happened afterwards and it almost seems that he intended to do so that he could finish Daniels's game and let everyone come play with him in reality. In the cave seems to be the only thing that helps him escape from suicide!) And in the coolest scene in this movie, Kate looks at the mail, looks at the camera and says something. "The most terrifying monster is what is on our own mind." <br /> <br /> The greatest fantasy element in this film is the two alchemists who walked through the wealthy partners for them. Will rob the dirty man of the shape of his magic bean Recurring theme ("The way we live" for the 80s) may be painful at the end. But it's a way to start this movie seriously and seem to leave the place And for the mystery, one of our heroes, wearing a full Pada device, became his character until he became completely his character and started his mission. So, of course, the first thing he did was Change into women's clothing. <br /> <br /> So the movie may not have a reason. But I guess it relates to an unreasonable topic In those days, the circle of children with dice and pencils was seen as unclean and might be overwhelming and you might be mad if they said mumbo-jumbo to you. Anti-game paranoia concluded in the first scene in which the reporter asked the police what happened The police said that the children had lost their way in the tunnel and had a chance that he and the monster would be involved. Journalists agree that they are not familiar with the game. (Although he allowed his children to play the game) then turned to the camera and rolled out of the cheats that blamed the game for everything and admitted that there was no other explanation. In the end, there is no masterpiece. But interesting, like movies created for TV
