I tried as hard as I could to sit through this annoying thing. But I can't do it. Brad Dourif sucked completely as the leader and all the supporting actors were a little worse. <br /> <br /> The whole thing was ridiculous, from the horrific performance to the amazing FX Laughing until stupid plans <br /> <br /> Wasting time completely without bothering root canal treatment will be more fun. The bamboo fragments under the fingernails will be more pleasant. <br /> <br /> Watching the Uwe Boll movie is a little worse than this. Get ideas?
