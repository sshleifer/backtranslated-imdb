Anyone who has read my review for Uwe Boll's "Alone In The Dark" will remember that I compare the work that no one wants to see that man's garbage with all the lines that your arms pull out. Come Compared to the next step with a non-returnable trough trash and imagine the pain of tooth extraction without the use of toothpaste Do that and you will have a general opinion about what Eli Roth's "Cabin Fever" about. <br /> <br /> I never believed that one movie would be able to fill the painful ruins. Which Uwe Boll swung out to be "the worst movie ever created" but in honesty I must say "Cabin Fever" came very close. This is another sad excuse for a movie that doesn't have a valid reason to meet every type of drama. For those who claim to love horror as much as Eli Roth, he created one of the most annoying and complex movies that I thought I had seen in my whole life. How can you make this kind of thing possible? Try to think about the potential of this plot to be without a badly written character, no bad writing and no unnecessary comedy and no jokes. Movies related to viruses, carnivorous and probably better than Roth made for us here. This script has failed at many levels with me and while I do not doubt the obvious ability that this director possesses, I know that he fumbled a big ball in a very good idea, given the new horror genre < br /> <br /> To say that this is The production of undesirable opportunities is certainly a word of play. Unstable blood and special effects can't even be recorded and that's one of the elements that I should do. Nothing about "Cabin Fever" that I can recommend to anyone. When the three-quarters of the crowd walked out of the cinema halfway, you know that the movie is going to sink quickly. My best advice for those who read this is just to rent before buying. One visit was more than enough for me to know that I would not be busy with it again.
