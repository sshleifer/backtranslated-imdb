This is a typical example of a highly skilled technical director of video clips / advertisements trying to make their first full-length feature film. On the one hand, images, cameras, lighting, CGI, and even the sound that has been highly polished and has a truly "expensive" look and feel The best is not able to hide the bad plot. <br /> <br /> In this case, it's not a bad plot. Br /> <br /> 50% dialogue, consisting of "things What is the hell? "," What is that? "And" What is it? "In some cases, the characters and the audience will not get a dime. In most other conversations, we will feel that there is no dialogue at all, and the actors will have to talk freely with the story that has never been explained. <br /> <br /> The only reason for Skybenette's performance was very well done, as her character as an autistic child did not allow these horrible conversations that other actresses had to deal with. This method allowed her to show her acting ability, which the remaining actors could not get close to. I mean, there are no actors in the world who can create such a conversation. <br /> <br /> Ben: Really? Emily: Stop it. Ben: Psychosis is a group, right? Jon: Someone must control this situation. Ben: This situation is not controllable. Not by you, not by anyone. Emily: Not by you as well. Ben: No, <br /> <br /> Let me go crazy but not for the horror. But for the horrible effort At certain times, I was ashamed that the actors added this to vita. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for excellent technical work.
