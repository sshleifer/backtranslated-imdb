I remember the exact Tuesday, the morning of 18/6/02 is exact. I was asleep, trying to convince myself to get out of bed when I heard a terrifying explosion. I went to the kitchen where I saw the views of many neighborhoods in southern Jerusalem and saw the smoke pillars rising from the point that was far away. The eyes of smoke came in a minute later. I remember rushing to the bedroom, picking up the binoculars, racing back to the kitchen and seeing the broken glass of the bus. The bus is still close to the transport station where terrorists are coming up and with a single click on the TNT device, killing 25 passengers, many of whom are traveling to school. My good friend's wife sat on the bus at the back of an unconventional and meaningless decision to save her life. <br /> <br /> I'm sure all Israelis have at least one fear. - relevant memories that he wishes he would never have, and it was only a matter of time before someone made a movie about it When it comes out, this movie is about to become a repressed memory of yourself. <br /> <br /> This film is about writing a play in the dry phase. Haim Buzaglo (played by hmmm, Haim Buzaglo, who Also writing and directing the film), which takes a better part of him in the competition, staring at his empty word processing program page At the same time, his girlfriend, a field reporter for the Israeli trade channel, decided to make a story about the debt, a former military officer who rode Buzaglo, a bit bored and paranoid because of what the medical profession called "The hottest thing on this planet is dating me." Down syndrome, asked the private eye to make a bet with his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> As a detective, the progress of the investigation His observations are absorbed into plays and later for the lives of actors. At the same time, the drama metamorphoses From this cartoon, has been sued against the alienation of Israeli society For this movie, this movie became a story about crazy editing, which contained in a little cardboard character and unreliable dialogue while drifting miles away from the story that should be Manage in the first place. <br /> <br /> When I say "Cardboard character" I mean, the character under the passion of the writer / director of the movie "meaningful" without any real interaction and credibility. I will not do too much about. this story When I can say that I am sure that the male prostitutes are barefoot, there are no homes, often going to the theater. With the intention of seeing the play, <br /> <br /> this movie, according to Haim Buzaglo himself, is the first part of the current trilogy. I sincerely hope that two other films will be gained from the same experience as I wrote about starting my review compared to the quiet world of characters that have nothing. But actually exists and the plot of the song <br /> 4 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter <br /> <br /> PS This movie is a strict observation point. It was shot within ten days. All the actors worked for free and the total cost of this movie was about $ 12,000 (no, I didn't leave the center one or two thousand thousand dollars). $ 34,000 to complete the Blair Witch project
