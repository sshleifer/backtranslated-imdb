Wow, my first review about this movie was so negative that I was not excluded. I will try to lower the volume to be true !!! No one wants to watch the movie Chuck Norris, which he is not the main character. The last scene of the fight is But the rest of the fight scene ends I have to wonder if Chuck old will not be able to hang with the best anymore. He slowed down so much that he had to throw away the garbage like this and hoped that his reputation would lead him throughout the story? Chuck is an excellent martial arts artist and as we saw from Walker, Texas Ranger, a good actor, but the secret is to combine these two qualities in his movie Very disappointing for us. Norris Chuck fans are still the main characters in your movie because this doesn't work for you ... Gary
