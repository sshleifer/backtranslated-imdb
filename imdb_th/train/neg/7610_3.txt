In general, I do not like the movie directed by Sydney Pollack ("The Firm" is quite an exception) and I have never been a fan of Robert Redford as well. "Three Days of Condor" must be good because of the number of comments received Awesome professional killer, I found that the whole story was very disappointing. This film underscores the irresistible atmosphere of paranoia. But everything was destroyed with a messy plot that didn't seem to make sense. <br /> <br /> The film still has one of the most unsatisfactory endings I've ever seen. The audience floated in the air. And who would say anything about the ridiculous love between Redford and Dunway I want to watch Hitchcock's movie five times in a row, rather than having to sit back and lose it again.
