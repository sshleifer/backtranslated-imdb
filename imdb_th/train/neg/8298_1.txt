This movie is definitely not entertaining, whether it's in its original state or as good as the Christmas story. The characters (except the youngest) try to imitate the previous actors and they fail. Where did the neighboring neighbors come from? Because they were not part of the first film. This thing really sucks, may be good with the original actor, probably not because this story is weak across it.
