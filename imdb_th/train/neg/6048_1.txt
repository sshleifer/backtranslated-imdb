If possible, it is more boring than ever. (I wish I could say that under the guidelines of IMDb) the French connection, at least, tries to absorb the influence of Europe to make the stereotypical view of the American police detective complicated, even though the effort was discovered. By the chaos of Friedkin, Americaness and general circuitousness (Especially with Nouvelle Blemish) allowed to have a great influence on European films in Hollywood This gives new strength and sophistication to the weary media and their best (such as BONNIE and CLYDE, the first Scorcese version) which is a new subversion of the training received. The original connection is part of this movement, with a distant form that is difficult and the image against the detective. TWO is a homage to American values ​​on the right side of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Things This is what happened in the film about America and France. For example, TWO was shot like a French police in the 1970s. Of course, it was the French who insisted on the greatness of American movies. They were ignored at home and, on the one hand, the controversy of Gallic's assumption of controversy can be seen in the form of two movies, CONNECTION. This leads to the disintegration of detectives and poor plot. <br /> <br /> Two Americans have returned to France with an American thriller in the genre. City - the power of the detective is confirmed again. This is the next play in Doyle's relationship with Barthelmy, a French examiner who has a superior influence. He must shake off before he can control the plot. <br /> <br /> The two seem like Will follow the original by destroying the detective hero From the beginning, the importance of Doyle will be reduced every round. Even if the connection ends But he is still considered a hero But he is an American in a foreign land and his inability to control the language or tradition means that he cannot occupy the area He misunderstood the signs of the police, misunderstood as bad news and killed him. <br /> <br /> The detective's power comes from his power as seen and interpreted, but Doyle spends most of his time watching. Movie, control objects, body objects (In the scene after he was left by Charnier) to see and interpret In connection, he urged the act to chase criminals forcing the plot; Here he was dormant, tied to a bed, locked in a drug addiction, relying on it. <br /> <br /> The loss of this penis is a predictable symbol of his gun and movie loss. This story is depressed. The familiar trajectory of Edipal In the heroin sequence, he was comforted by an old woman who said that he looked like her son. His medicine condition is like returning to the womb, robbing pressure from adults Her pursuit of the watch reinforces the immortality of this state, which is twice as important for the people of his career, depending on the schedule and accuracy. <br /> <br /> Oddis is a detective. First and to avoid his fate Who is breaking down his unified identity and killing his father (Charnier) so that he can take on the role of a man that is accepted in society Psychoanalytic theory has been popular among scholars in the 70s (Jacques Lacan, a French man who was ironically involved), but it was difficult to watch movies filled with it. <br /> <br /> If these facts This tends to make Doyle diminish. The style of the movie is not like that. Friedkin keeps us away from his hero by refusing the sympathy or motivation of the character, focusing on the mechanics of planning. Here, Doyle is a very typical Hollywood hero. Instead of wandering in the dark shock, he made the audience know and understand the original equipment. - View, close-up, connected images, etc. <br /> <br /> Two things are all about. with The collapse of the Popeye Doyle plot in this case succumbed to the show, which is typical of hackers. Cold turkey scene, so despite their monotony will not disturb We are allowed to share instead of observing coldly. This is an experience that makes you feel unwell. That scene was shot with the confidence of a lachrymose male model that is very American. <br /> <br /> So, while CONNECTION tried to mimic the complex thriller of Jean Pierre Melville, two people did the opposite. Melville is a gangster that starts with both movies, having an outside language power and creating a breakdown chart. Finally, TWO begins with a disintegrating character that is successful, partly due to the inability of language. Where the rule begins when he steps outside the language. <br /> <br /> In movies, places and languages ​​are important as they correct and undermine detectives. But while he regained his power (Thinking of returning his gun The vulnerability that the Charnier Tower holds) The Marseilles setting is more irrelevant and the legendary standing may occur anywhere. Comparing the ending of both films: One story, accepting ambiguity and hopelessness, other absolute confidence. <br /> <br />
