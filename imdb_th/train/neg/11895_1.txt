Oh my God, what happened here !! I will not say this again But what is the story behind this movie? This dubbing is the worst way than dubbing in "King Kong vs Godzilla". Linda Miller must be the worst actor in that, and the suit looks really scary. With some villains called Dr.Who, a strong gorilla like King Kong But when this robot broke down, he built another one and tried to kidnap Kong when he did (That was when Linda Miller was annoying) He made his slaves. But everything went wrong. Then, Dr., who sent the robot after him While I was watching the DVD While playing, I hope that the madness in the movie is about to end until the end of the fight has to be a terrible thing because they can show Hong Kong to see the dinosaurs fighting his island again. > Do not watch movies in any situation or if you ... beware of disappointments you will receive.
