The thing that the movie did well was to combine action and horror with humor and drama in a unique way that made the audience feel more emotional than a typical horror movie. Unfortunately there are separate storytelling, plotting, frustration, and conflicting scenes. Most of this movie made me frustrated and barely. "The greatest monster movie ever" <br /> <br /> Let's start with good things: comedy, acting and special effects. From the beginning of this movie, starting quickly and assuming the opening scene - the origin of the monster - is a camp and fast, respecting the disaster. The classic 'environment' that gave birth to many other monsters. The pace is fast, which is welcomed by a long and pointless opening scene from other monsters and allows the movie to jump into action within. 10 minutes, you will receive 'Why,' Where 'and' How 'of the beast and ready to act. In this movie, <br /> <br /> After that, soon there will be a character introduction: lazy son and a little girl who is precocious, kind-hearted grandfather and talented sister (aunt) And of course, the creatures are introduced in each other's context, and their conflicts appear immediately, causing the audience to feel when the monster appears. If the river where they lived and worked <br /> <br /> it looks great monsters: Alien familiar - like a dog and a fish being sucked squid. The effect of that creature is second to none and although it looks strange, but it can be believed and there is no point in the movie that you will see that it is a string. Even the monster's movements are horribly familiar, like growing and excited reptiles on a giant oil linoleum, through the crowd slipping on the surface, crushing and eating them on the path When the path of the monster cuts with the family and the actual tragedy, it is a painful time and you can feel the desire to take revenge. But then the movie's appeal began to unravel. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the explosion. This film loses focus and continuity quickly. The plot was presented and then abandoned. The characters changed their positions without clear reasoning and humor was inserted into the dramatic scene, causing confusion as the obstacles appeared. <br /> <br /> A joke for me to say this: I'm happy to admit that a lot of humor may be about culture. I am not familiar with Korean humor, so things may be lost in translation. However, as an important Asian academic scholar in college and as a person living in Japan for the last 5 years (still here), I would like to think that I understand Asian humor better than white people. general That being said, there are many parts of the movie that I understand should be funny. But for me not <br /> <br /> *********** Spoiler ************* For example: after the first attack at The little daughter lost the family to the funeral; Everyone is mourning New characters - brothers and sisters - and tensions increased when it became apparent that two brothers were in conflict. They both started to regret the loss and ended up in a friendly match. This competition is at the core of jokes: two brothers who don't like each other, they compete at funerals - it shows the thorny nature of family love that is common in comedy. Asia The comedy about this pat on pat, glamor that the family and mourning rituals should be a joke. But seems to be really out of place in the context of a little girl who has lost ************** END spoiler ************* * <br /> <br /> Then come to the plot of the plot. There are many points that have happened in this movie that have never been described or worse, explained and frustrated only to prove that it is inefficient and ineffective. Finding obstacles is not an obstacle. It may be good for the character. But you expect to have opinions about that nature But the audience will be attacked with a time of anti-climax when there is a problem just 'Not there' anymore and no one can tell that it's a problem in the beginning. So I asked you: Why did you bring it first? <br /> <br /> This is a prevalent story throughout the film due to problems causing new problems and suddenly the world of the movie is filled with anti-forces. Which cannot be modified Of course, introducing new and great problems is a story based on the time of the tradition. But if bringing a new arc leads to the shortening of another person, you expect at least Not in this movie But it seems like you have received many stories, each one explaining only 20% of the method, and eventually the pieces never converge, so all <br /> <br /> again, I'm willing to accept. This may be a 'culture'. Perhaps it is a tradition that tells the story of Korea in bringing jokes into the tragedy. It may be normal that the story moves around like a child drawing every outer line. But it doesn't end at all It may be good to present problems to develop the plot. But then remove the problem randomly without a clear solution or stomach Or perhaps these things are the hallmarks of sloppy work and bad storytelling in movies that seem to have a better reputation than they should be
