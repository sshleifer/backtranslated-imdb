This movie tried really hard. If you are going to create a horror movie, at least give reason to believe in the audience It tries to end with intelligence and not reveal anything. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of the movie? Where does it actually go And more importantly, what happened ... <br /> <br /> Why are they there and how can they be tied to it? Another horror movie is weak. I like the fake reviews in IMDb that say how wonderful it is with the relevant press releases to hit the movie. (Whether it is a person or a low-level person), it is not worth it for 2 hours. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that this movie is better than fragile. But at least that gives you reason and why things happen and get results This cannot be done, and it only makes waffles with large spaces to make everything look scary. This movie has very little value when a stranger calls. The weak God as well <br /> <br /> A great trick if you make a horror of reasoning and explain to the audience what happened, so they have your story. Because if there is no reason or credibility then there is nothing to hold on to anything and it is not scary Do not despise actors or teams because they do well. It's just a bad writing.
