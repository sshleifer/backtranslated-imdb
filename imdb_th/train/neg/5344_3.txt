How well do you remember the Spice Girls movie (apart from the song)? Simon Fuller, their manager (Including the manager of this band) caused the same error as wearing the S Club (my favorite band) in their own movies. S Club: Tina Barrett, Jon Lee, Bradley Mcintosh, Jo O'Meara, Hannah Spearritt and Rachel Stevens (What happened to the seventh member is Paul Cattermole?) In general, ask their boss if they will stop. See yourself on TV! Three people are alternating, and on the other hand, half of them discover that they are clones that the greedy scientist created and the other half have problems, also starring Gareth Gates as a clone of himself. This movie may have more stories than the movies of the Spice Girls, but apart from the songs "Bring It All Back", "Don't Stop Movin" and "Never Had A Dream Come True" This is the reason not to be missed. This movie. Shortly after the band split well enough!
