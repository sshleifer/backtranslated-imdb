A strange slasher movie from the Charles Band producer on the day of the biggest success of the Full Moon band, saying that he won't do it. "The real killer movie" because he felt that the little puppet and the big monster added a fantasy element that made this movie better - people who killed each other The great philosophy and true shame that the Band has destroyed the Full Moon studio through business contacts that are too low to become a profit from home theaters until he begins to do what Blockbuster truly wants and sacrifices creativity The team behind this thing also works with 'Delta Delta Die!' And 'Birth Rite' - both are polite according to the full moon standard. Debbie Roche is in the normal form here as a rookie with a mentor gang and a Dead Sea Man who decides to create a story about Her 'murder club' - as evidently - doing everything she could to join and then panic because it wasn't real and Ms. Rochon believed that stupid and now everyone had to run away from blood. And may not kill each other. The choice is there and about this movie, it's yours ... not recommended but not bad too
