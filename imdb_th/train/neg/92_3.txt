I really can't believe that I spent $ 5 on this movie. I am a big zombie fanatic and think that this movie is not that bad. It has zombies, right? I'm wrong! In fact, this movie has moments ... I think it's really cool when the man gets his head torn. But that's about it Overall, I think it's more fun to slide the razorblade onto my empty sack in the vinegar tank. Then watch this movie again. The movie seems to be better if we see a fool. But I have to look at an example for another film that this company produces to see buyers. Be careful ... unless you enter the zoos.
