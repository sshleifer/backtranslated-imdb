Not good, bad, bad, bad, bad. I will say anything. Kate Jackson is desperate to direct. It may be that she should return to acting ... in the second that she thinks she is a bad actor. Who will bring money to produce this bad thing? I like anti-Christian movies and often have good laughs and strange scares, but this one is just Bad Bad Bad. The star's performance is worse than what you found in a TV drama. Special tricks if you can call them laughable I will not be surprised if you play the scene in slow motion. You will see a tube of blood flowing out. We have to close the disc after only 30 minutes. This is called the original print of the movie. Should be destroyed, all the discs and tapes that have been destroyed and everyone involved in making movies must pay back to those who rent movies. Then those people should not be allowed to perform, direct or direct the movie in any way.
