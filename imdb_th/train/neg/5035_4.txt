Melissa's sixteenth birthday is on the corner and she just discovered her sex with a boy. But it turns out that everyone she spent with winding up was killed in this 80s general slasher movie. It's up to the sheriff Dan Burke. (Bo Hopkins, Forest Group) and his lovely two cute daughters, Marcy (Dana Kimmel, Dana Kimmel, Friday the 13th, Part 3) <br /> <br /> This film focuses on the mystery and the melodrama of the movie more and less in Suicide and making it possible to distinguish the 80s from the Slasher brothers. Alesia does not hurt to have a great shape. (I feel that I have to stress clearly by stating that the actress is 18 years old and over and that I am not distorted.) The downside is that this film has some cut points that are not developed and not Need a grating pattern that is sometimes used too often and the end point is a tad-like immunity. But goodness is worth more than this (almost) badness, but I won't buy <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Aleisa Shirley shows her bushy tits and ass <br /> <br /> Grade I: C <br /> Code Red DVD Extras: Introduction by Aleisa Shirley and Director of Intruder, Scott Spiegel; Both the director and director of the movie version; Voice conversation with Shirley and director Jim Sotos, an interview with Shirley, Sotos & Bo Hopkins; The gallery is still; Movie trailers for this film; And trailers for Nightmare, Stunt Rock, Rituals, & Balalaika Conspiracy
