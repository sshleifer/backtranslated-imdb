This TV movie shows that there are bad movies going on. The only reason I saw this was that it was covered by KTMA MST3K. It was the Super Bowl at the Superdome in New Orleans. However, there was no football playing and we saw behind the scenes. With many stars in this film, it doesn't make a difference. I don't really know why I watch this thing.
