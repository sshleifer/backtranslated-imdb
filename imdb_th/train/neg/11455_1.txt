First of all, to give you an idea about my taste in movies ... <br /> <br /> Comedy 2007 I like: Superbad, Knocked Up, Hot Fuzz, Blades Of Glory <br /> <br Comedy 2007 I hate: Almighty Evan, the Solomon brothers, good luck. <br /> <br /> I should follow my first instinct and close "Hot Rod" after I reach about 20 minutes. I know that this movie will not make me laugh again. The script is extremely cruel - I don't know how this extreme destruction can destroy 6 on IMDb. Anyone who is over 10 years old who is happy must have some mental symptoms. <br /> <br / > This is not close to Will Farrell and it is clear that Andy Samberg is unable to do anything longer than the 5 to 10 minute sketch on YouTube or SNL. This movie ... They have to obligate or something. I know it's going to be a stupid movie. But at least I thought it would be funny I don't smile a lot. <br /> <br /> Normally I don't comment on movies at IMDb, but this is terrible. I just have to warn people. This is just the 4th movie that I saw that I felt compelled to score 1/10.
