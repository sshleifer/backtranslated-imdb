I rented it on DVD and I feel bad since Dawson and Lucas are very serious about it in DVD reviews. It's not a bad movie. But is one of the movies that want to express deep opinions about human nature while not knowing that its story is a concept In addition, it is a little simple about problems in many ways and the character's behavior often creates beliefs. I will say it's a movie that you will get something if you don't have movies / TV / literature / life is behind you. (To be honest, I used to see the same story almost the same in horror movies.) Otherwise, the point that had been done before and more artfully And that caused a big problem, which is that it doesn't have much interest in movies other than issues It ended up being a rather polite movie that invested everything in the idea that the basic story would be shocking and interesting and that it wasn't actually paid.
