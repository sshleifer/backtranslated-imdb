Otto Preminger brought this light into the story of a Bohemian feather, Jean Seberg and David Niven, the father of a Bohemian-style widow on a holiday in southern France, with Mylène Demongeot. Everything was fine until the Deborah family. Herner appeared. Nivens, a decadent buck, finds Kerr's victory too difficult to resist. It's okay with Seberg. As long as Niven loves her, she leaves. (As he did with all the women of his past ... including Demongeot) when she seems to have become the second banana in Niven's life. Seberg revives Kerr. Of course, Preminger tells the story in a flashback after the point of view. Of Seberg and the combination of black and white with the color scene that looks better The movie shooting by Georges Périnal is amazing. The film has Preminger's least comfortable direction, although he rarely allows close-up shots. In any way, which makes it difficult to identify what the actor feels Arthur Laurents wrote the script and is full of acidic conversations and funny scenes. Seberg admits himself quite well But at least Niven is attractive, at least ... and he doesn't show a chemical attitude with Seberg or Kerr Preminger. Really wrong with casting. It is a role that looks like a tailor made for someone close to Charles Boyer. With Jeffrey Horn as a fan of Sibberg and Marta Hunt is a terrifying mother. Juliette Gréco plays herself singing the title song in a nightclub in Paris. The good name is Normal Preminger Saul Bass.
