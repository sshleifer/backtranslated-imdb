His first movie, after the death of friend John Belushi for a long time, Aykroyd showed great exhaustion trying to pull the characters that would become remarkable for Belushi. <br /> < br /> instead of "Doctor Detroit" instead of a terrible and violent pimp to protect an opponent known as Mom. Not good enough, but he also has a school dinner lesson to host the four girls in the evening. Rotate the protection of pimps and dinner. (Or something like that) to join Not surprisingly, Aykroyd seems to be almost always dazed. Why the audience must be alone. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Aykroyd meets Donna Dixon, a future wife, at least having good things out of this chaos. <br /> <br / > One and a half stars. You want a good Aykroyd. Look at "The Blues Brothers". You want to look bad. "Detroit Doctor"
