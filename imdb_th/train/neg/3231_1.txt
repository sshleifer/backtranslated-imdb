This movie seems to have a lot of people saying that it is one of the most cruel movies of all time. After watching it, I can say that it doesn't depend on those claims. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​this movie is really insane. But overall, executions are not worth it. Even the last scene (Things that the eyeball) is not offensive I expect to have something insane. But it has a lower quality than the blood that was put into the movie like Violent Sh! There is no matter (although most people know this for sure), blood fans will be disappointed since the opposite of belief, blood and courage here is not much. Not to mention the actors who play the victims may be one of the worst history. <br /> <br /> No matter what others say, this movie is not shocking. Avoid it.
