I think I must be someone to say "The Emperor has no clothes" When I saw this show, it was a show for PBS last night that I was both hopeful and apprehensive. Kevin Whately, the character of Lewis, the show of John Taew for a period! After looking at the new "Lewis inspector" (as charged here), I'm more confident that I'm right ... what is good (even though he looks terrible. (Both bad and too old) But he just doesn't have the talent to perform like Thaw. <br /> <br /> And for his fox, "best friend", okay ... maybe the investigator here. From England can understand what he said, but for me, most can't do it <br /> <br /> for Mrs. Inno ... All I can say is I miss James Grout <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say that they should have Leaving the rest "Morse" in peace
