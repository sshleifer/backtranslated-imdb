yuck I think it's strange that their ancient books about curses are made using a typical script font instead of writing by hand. The show is sometimes indifferent, and at other times, why "demon" that killed two quiet doctors who helped make him immortal? Just for the calamity of it? And it's really necessary to show Lilith's motorcycle every time she goes out We understand! You spend a little money to rent three target rockets. That doesn't mean you have to show it all the time! The "Faith's" cave looks like an old Battlestar Galactica school that has changed at the last minute. There was a scene where we were introduced to a few people on the talk show for about 30 seconds before they were killed for no apparent reason. Everyone is a cast character. The memorable characters and the more memorable plot make it one of the bad movies that I have ever seen. The Scifi channel is far away unless you enter a bad movie.
