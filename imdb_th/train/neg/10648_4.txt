The last episode of the Weissmuller Tarzan movie is quite weak. There are some things that derail this movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, Tarzan spends a lot of time in the movie that wears floppy sandals. In my opinion, any shoes in Tarzan, whether it is sandals or boots as shown in the picture, sometimes separating the characters, which should be against civilization and savage <br /> <br /> Secondly, Benji's drama, as mentioned in the previous post, made this film into a foil cartoon. For me, his character does not need to plot the story of the movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, while Weissmuller still cuts the body of the supervisor as Tarzan, he is clearly not in the state. His best Although in his Jungle Jim movie later, his body has improved somewhat from this movie. <br /> <br /> The fight with squid is a great idea. But I think it should be done in the movie Weissmuller earlier when he was at His physical peak In the same way, a battle that takes only 30 seconds will be more exciting if it is pulled out for 90 seconds to 2 minutes like the classic giant crocodile fight in Tarzan and His Mate. <br /> <br /> And while Brenda Joyce is Jane and Linda Christian, as the devil is overwhelmingly pleasing, unable to help recover the last Weissmuller movie, which is a disappointing conclusion for the top character.
