This review may contain some spoilers. <br /> <br /> The 1974 classic car chase movie was lost in 60 seconds. Actually, it works well and the storyline can move quite well. But even the great Hollywood budget doesn't change the fact that the original plot is more reliable. For those who do not know the original plot, there is a thief working as an insurance inspector. Who will doubt them But even with almost every aspect of H.B. Original Halicki's changes, the new creation was a very good movie until we reached the final chase scene as part of version 74 that made it great One of these models is watered down for just 10 minutes and it will reach the special effects of monsters that will bring all the confidence out of the chase. In the event that the traditional chase is very reliable, this star is a stunt driver who shows all his own stunts. The remake fell in the last 15 minutes. My advice, if you want to watch classic movies, chase cars, put the original in the bargain bin at your local rental shop.
