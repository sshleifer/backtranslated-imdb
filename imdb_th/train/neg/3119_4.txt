Robin Williams gave a good performance in The Night Listener as well as other actors. However, it seems that this movie is hustling and leaving the end too loose to be seen as "must see." Because there is no strong enough relationship between the caller and Gabriel Noon (I have to spell it this way because IMDb wants to correct the correct spelling into the "no one" character by Automatic. This movie has more show time than 01:30 and within the first 15 minutes it seems that noon will start searching for Pete Logande, who calls the child. <br /> <br /> This happens after he talks. With the mysterious caller, about 3 or 4 times. The conversation is not too deep, mostly composed of you ... how I am in the hospital ... why did you move out ... etc in the children's book almost became noon Vice and vice On the other hand, and the reader understands why he was looking for this boy when he found that the child had disappeared and thought he might be a hoax. <br /> <br /> In the midday movie became obsessed with Find Logande, but the audience is left to wonder why Because there is no strong bond between midday and caller, why bother? Who cares if there is no caller? <br /> <br /> I know there is a difference between books and movies. But calling and relationships are very important to build on the screen because it is the basis for the rest of the movie. This movie is separate. <br /> <br /> This story is surprising, because Maupin's other work is Tales of the City. When it was created as a mini-series, it worked beautifully.
