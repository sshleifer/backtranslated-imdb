I want to clarify something I am not familiar with the movie Ming Liang Tsai and I am very familiar with the art theater. I grew up in the seventeenth generation of Goddard, Fellini, Bergman, Bertolucci and many others. <br /> <br /> Art movies are really ART's. Express their inner feelings, do not worry about others if understanding anything They are beyond commercial value. Just look at the old Antonioni (or the early Picasso) and you will understand. <br /> <br /> Tian bian yi duo yun (The Wayward Cloud) is not related to that. It was a movie that took advantage of the intention of fooling judges and critics in many festivals without saying anything. <br /> <br /> The story is not reasonable. The lack of water causes the government to promote the use of watermelons to provide moisture. Desperate woman stealing water from public toilets, toilets There is also a beginning point of pornography (neighbors) trying to make movies with actors. He doesn't seem to feel comfortable. There is a romance between a girl and a porn star. The clutter ends with the sex scene. (Not pornography) that many people are shocked But I believe that it's less erotic than you see in American Pie or History of Violence. <br /> <br /> The two main characters never talk. Sometimes, music style number 60 will appear and explain (through Music) What happens in the mind of the character These video clips were truly greeted because of the previous scene without any interaction or music that the audience only occasionally takes 4, 5 or more minutes, which in this movie is too much. <br /> <br /> There are a few bits about "Difficult to have sex without love", "The selfishness of the porn industry." <br /> <br /> Obviously, this movie has a purpose (escape) to fool the jury and Criticism at the festival There are a few tricky scenes. (Within the scope of Taiwan's censorship) and many stories open, but nothing, summarize or go anywhere. <br /> <br /> These techniques make movies have significant prices (certainly not) at film festivals and make movies suffer. Unsuitable commercial success (I see movies in France and the cinema is full) <br /> <br /> However, please don't be fooled. There is nothing new or original or even told or filmed in this movie. It's boring and empty. It's a scam to the public. Boogie Nights (which I don't really like), Intimacy and 9 Songs is a much better movie.
