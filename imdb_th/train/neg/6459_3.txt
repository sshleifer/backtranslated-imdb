This great actor is disappointing. Marlon Brando plays the character and the horrible character. The movie is not funny. There are subconscious messages that can be seen. "It's a curse !!!", "It's hard enough !!", "Throw the TV through the window" etc. It's disgusting and boring. In addition to foolish humor, there are other things. How to decorate a colorful room It makes me sick, everything is so colorful that it can cause epilepsy. Normally I don't care about decorating in movies, but from "Free Money" makes me angry, avoiding all costs! "Free money" - probably because Charlie Sheen, Sutherland and Brando, but the audience doesn't get anything! One person looked at it with consciousness.
