Quite scary But watch and entertain It's an old story (if you've been through the 80s), Vietnam vet fights to fight injustice in America. A-Team finds Death Wish, my favorite person! <br /> <br /> Time passed, soldiers returned home, and many years later a friend was having problems. Don't wait before your friend dies and is his father who has problems. Our first hero Joey was killed by a soft texture (pinnacle) as he tried to protect his father's small shop from the local "defense" gang, even though they were wheelchair from the war. Father asked for help from Sarge, Joey's former unit leader from Vietnam. When Sarge appeared in the funeral, <br /> <br /> Well, the wheel that creaked to get fat for the city, you can imagine that most of the movie What will this be? <br /> <br /> One thing that makes me crazy is that Sarge is watching his people about their plans and the way they really do what they do. When they plan ahead But Joey will not be hit by a gun in a wheelchair in Vietnam at first if the unit doesn't get messy! Then, when things in the city improve as they fight with the gang, they do it again. Without any reason, they crossed their plans and tried to nail the gang without everyone being together. Phh !!!! I raised my hand in disgust. Folly! <br /> <br /> There are also suspicious moments when all the members of the unit make sure to try heroin as they snatch from the gang to make sure they are real. Every single one of them. Um ... <br /> <br /> What are you going to do? Look further, I guess. This movie doesn't look scary. But it's a tease There are moments of these extreme heats when nothing happens. The most amazing thing that happened was the beginning of the movie - the bombing in Vietnam. The battle for the death of Joey and the gang that brutally kicked the innocent teddy bear (terrible doll!) <br /> <br /> I guess my main meat and this movie is I'm disappointed. Even sub-plans that are confused with "Mysterious assistant" and inspiration across their strange purpose is not enough to save it at the end. But someday it may be correct, then they will create a sequel. Hahaha !!!
