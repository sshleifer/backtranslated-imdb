I'm not sure if it's a bad language or performance. But everything about this movie feels and looks cheap and fake. <br /> <br /> After seeing Der Untergang, this is a big disappointment. There is no connection between the different scenes and the performances are so unbelievable that even people may be able to do a lot of potential things. <br /> <br /> And above all, everyone in Germany speaks. English is a big mistake. The German language has some sound, and especially Hitler himself only looks like Hitler when he speaks / shouts German. <br /> <br /> How to tell a story that makes me believe it's an impromptu spot. Empty characters and movies seem to be a collection of random events that may occur. <br /> <br /> Whether it's English or the fact that I've seen Der Untergang, everything about movies. This story is fake and ridiculous.
