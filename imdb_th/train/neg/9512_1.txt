I can't believe it's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I laughed a few times (It may be because of its stupidity) If someone pays me to watch that movie again, I won't do it. The plot is terrible. It's not reasonable and the performance is so poor that I can't tell if they try or not. That movie got a very bad rating: F
