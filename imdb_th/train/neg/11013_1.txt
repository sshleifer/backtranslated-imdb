I watched bad movies But this did not happen Although the above mentioned things are not good I know funny movies and underground movies But it is very boring that the director / writer should not be allowed to direct anything except the local cable access. Love movies and comedy is to insult this movie. I can't understand how boring and boring this event is. If you like this movie, you are a stupid person, a quiet person. What's here? Center! If you want to compare underground movies, see "Kentucky Fried" or John Waters, the movie begins with a satire and I challenge anyone to show that word. The rule of comedy is this ... If it's funny, you can say or do anything. But if it's not a joke, you're not a sarcastic person!
