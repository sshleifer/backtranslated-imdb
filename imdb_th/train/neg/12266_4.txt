Republic images come late in the game with genres "Werewolf" Er Werecat, the plot of this story, has a writer traveling back to Paris after traveling abroad while he was beginning to panic while he was unconscious. He came to great acclaim because of his similar novel to the infamous experiment as the best seller. The French government wants to know if he has access to confidential documents, which seems more likely when the cat staff is killed by "cats". The suspicion arises with the author when his fiance dies. The confusing story is to return to unconsciousness, so the author does not know whether he is a murderer or not. <br /> <br /> Thriller, okay, too comfortable to fully enjoy. There are too many musical numbers at the beginning and too many deaths when everything is discussed in the middle and the next. The performance is good and the scene is quite good. But there is a reason why most of the people I know only remember the top-rated assassin. He is the most interesting thing in this movie. Even though it takes a short time (just over an hour), I think the reason that this film is rarely seen on TV is that after 20 minutes, you start to lose patience. I just want some people to do something. When it finally happened in the closing minutes, it was too late .. <br /> <br /> passed
