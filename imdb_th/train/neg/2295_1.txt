The movie is boring, pointless, with a completely charming Mercurio. Released on Thursday, one day, probably one of the local theaters and avoided from all the population in Sydney except me and the other four people. BACK OF BEYOND is a project created by manufacturers looking for fees. Local actors like John Paulson and Terry Serio deserve better things. (Paulson has changed to be a thriller director like SWIMFAN and HIDE AND SEEK) and Terry Serio looks like But Paul Mercurio should be one of Australia's greatest exports on the screen. This role is a big disappointment and movies like this are just a loss of ability and time.
