This is what you will get if you allow a 10 year old boy (American fanatic) to write a moon travel story. The complete garbage that does not qualify for the return, maybe it will have the charm of 3D, but as an animation, storytelling and entertainment, there is nothing that will cost a hour and a half worth while Save your time and money and watch BOLT instead. <br /> <br /> Damn the line isn't enough. But I feel that it's a summary ... well, I agree with the above review - this is like a cold war propaganda Maybe it will be more interesting if they do flies about the deception of the moon landing or that the flies die in the first minute. BTW - Why do all the main characters fly so badly? - No one compliments the full limbs!
