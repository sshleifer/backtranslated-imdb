Drew Barrymore is an actor who has a bad time, not just But in her career But in her personal life as well After being a child prodigy, she stepped into confusion with a low-quality medium movie. While she recovered from the darkness of the past But this film is a reminder of the worst days of Drew Barrymore. <br /> <br /> The film begins with interesting evidence. With a plot involving many personality disorders that make horror / thriller Barrymore perform as Holly Gooding, a young woman who is trying to create a new life in California after the painful events of her past, which clearly Her other personality killed her mother. <br /> <br /> Suddenly her past returned. Haunt her while her evil personality comes back in her life, willing to destroy her newly discovered peace and her newly discovered love In the middle of the chaos, Patrick Highsmith (George New Bern), his new girlfriend, will try to help Holly to confront her past demons. <br /> <br /> The cracks Unlike De Palma's thriller, most are ordinary movies that are not only But never achieved the purpose only But also concluded in one of the worst endings of film history Although Barrymore is certainly not the best. But she can still maintain her dignity with a higher average performance The remaining actors are from ordinary performances to painful bad performances, although Leslie Hope will be one of the best. <br /> <br /> The script is full of ancient ideas and the influence of De Palma. Is quite clear While the film tries to be original by reference to literature in almost every line, the dialogue is boring and the performances made from wood do nothing good. It has a fair share of nudity and for strange reasons and the use of special effects too. <br /> <br /> Makeup effects made by KNB are outstanding and one of the things. Good in movies However, using the effects in a strange context entirely reduces the impact of the KNB's work and makes the things in the movie amazing. <br /> <br /> The fact that This is a B-movie. There is no excuse for low quality, as well as more good and consistent scripts. May be an interesting movie. The sad thing that we have here is that ordinary movies are getting worse every second. Worth the beauty of Barrymore 3/10
