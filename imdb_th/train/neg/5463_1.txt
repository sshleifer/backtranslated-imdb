I saw Arthur (TV series and books) many years ago and never loved acting (If you are a fan of this cartoon, sorry if I lose it for you. But this is what I think) a lot of people like But I can't. <br /> <br /> The children in the school seem to be fighting all the time (especially Arther and DW). With everyone and his sister DW (however, the name is spelled) Annoyed with what she did like her imaginary friends and stuffed animals) Arthur's friends act like teenagers instead of being in Arthur's books and parents. <br /> The greatest cartoon is the modern life of Rocco, not Arthur. (No offense)
