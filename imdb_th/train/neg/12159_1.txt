I can't believe that I really watched this thing, but I think I just want to know if this movie is more funny and fun without it, and it makes the climax the least effective. That the defense lawyer gave so in real life that even though it is a fictional matter But it was too strange There is no way anyone on this planet can behave in front of the court as she did. And may be the worst prosecutor in the world Why is he in court? He didn't do anything and nothing proved her fault. A simple search of her house will result in a ring but not going. He likes to say "oppose" 2 or 3 times during the whole experiment - that the blonde madman has received real drugs to prove the innocence of you But not Brett The madman almost had Brett's altar in her house that could prove her passion. But no more During the scene in the court, I felt quietly wanting to take the needle out of her hand and hit my head several times. Even the strange ones didn't look fake, "I'm innocent" as she did. And what does this movie tell us Never married a woman with life insurance: As soon as she fell down the stairs, would her husband be thrown into prison, guilty? Evil people
