Yesterday I saw the second part. And I have to say that it's actually better than the first one. At the beginning, I knew that it was actually a sequel, not a new creation. But not good I do not like old movies and the Galactic series, because the cylinders are like a toaster. (As mentioned in this new movie) and not harming the old galaxies completely This film changes sides - humans are not dangerous. But this movie is completely chaotic and foolish. Many scenes are not necessary, such as the story of "Computer expert" which is nonsense If I was a playwright, I would let him die in his home, killed by a Syrian woman. And evacuation from the world? Oh, please, if it will be bombed by 50 megatons (why 50 tons?) Nuclear. They will be killed by radiation. And how is it possible that the giant fleet is completely hidden before the attack? It may be possible that this computer virus, created by Sy-Script, may be written by a ten-year-old boy. The good side of the movie is that the humans are finally defeated !! The population is close to extinction. (Children are dying - two times clear in the movie: 1. Kids !!! May be one month old and girls up to the age of ten - being violent ...) and bad luck won and I think this is the first time in the movie Galaxy Sci-Fi. I also appreciate the design of the cylinders (not just the human shape: -). It's a good job with these ships - I like the design of both ships - as human cylinders. The human ship is an old ship that is never good and galactica - very beautiful with these docks. I like it. But this is all just not enough design. The performance is terrible. All the plot is expected. (There are only two things that are non-human, Zion on Ragnarok and the Xen human at the end). The conversation is not important. Not the film's fault) The entire movie appears to be a starring movie for the series. But who will shoot that series? What about it? One star for the design of the second star for the endangered species of humanity
