No doubt in this series! When one episode ends, the performance is too low, the effects are very poor, and the script is so bad that the last thing on your mind is the way Batman and Robin will save the day. Not true. The last thing you think is watching the next episode! This list is so boring that I can't see what to do. Leave it alone on the DVD! Obviously, the effect does not depend on contemporary Batman movies. But even though the script is terrible Discrete talk about evil teachers and ray guns or something like that. I'm not sure because it's too scary to watch the 60s or 90s or even Batman Begins. Everything in this version!
