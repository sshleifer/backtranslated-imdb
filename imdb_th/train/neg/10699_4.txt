Yes, I sat through all things. God knows why. <br /> <br /> It's afternoon. I have nothing to do. It's cold. Outside is bitter. Okay. All of them are weak excuses. The only person I have <br /> <br /> I give The Darkling 4 stars from the possible 10 - I've watched movies that are worse. But this one is definitely there in the old trash of the movie. Bad - bad. Bad acting script, bad light and wonderful magic effects. <br /> <br /> The story is completely unreasonable. This small, simple Daddy, Mommy and a little girl - that I consider the audience should "identify" with the three people are boring and annoying. You just want the dark side to get those things. <br /> <br /> Father is a chef with a hobby as a car. Father met a wealthy man named Rubin, who collected the car and owned the creature he bought in the "mysterious" East. Rubin kept it in a cage and called it "The Darkling". <br /> < br /> During the film, Darkling is described as about 3 or 4 things: shadows that don't have a person, the inner darkness that exists in all of us and the devil. So let you choose any description that fits your needs - because believe me, it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> Darkling's main problem seems like it wants to have friends - get human companions - Then finally was dissatisfied with humans Of course, this leads to great wealth, followed by a disaster for those who are caught with The Darkling. <br /> <br /> And for the rest of us - it leads to a very boring and long film. . <br /> <br />
