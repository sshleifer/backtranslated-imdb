While not worse than modifying the game against his film, this great cruelty is not much better. <br /> <br /> Boll seems to have the pathological ability to accept that he didn't create it. Good movie One day he will run out of money and stop the world with his bombs. <br /> <br /> The performance is not as important as the dialogue sounds like they are reading. TelePrompTers and the special 'touch' of Boll are seen throughout the story. <br /> <br /> Just like the movie Uwe Boll, this movie shouldn't exist. <br /> <br /> Plain and simple. > <br /> Just like Uwe Boll himself shouldn't be> _>
