My goodness is this movie is not good. I was completely misunderstood from my local movie reviews because this is a certified garbage. Yes, good people wear white clothes, bad guys wear black clothes .... and good people tend to win. Now go home and hug your children and feel good about how Hollywood makes you feel. Blech! I can't believe that this Dead Brain movie was created by Wes Craven. I guess he needed a little money to pay for the mortgage, so he created this animal manure. It is a productive work that makes anyone who regularly watchs movies, believing that they can do better or better than an experienced director. <br /> <br /> Isn't Zeta seeing the bad guys want a hundred thousand women Sweet that loves her father Do the bad things of IL or he will hurt her father. But when you are an All-American girl, we are next to you. We know that she will save the whole day and beat the bad guys ... Ending Girl power ROCKS. <br /> <br /> C'mon. Only silly to find this fun ... "Ride a roller coaster ride". Give something new or new. All "super-duper" comments you see on this website are from the industry hacking that makes money from This flick paid back the favor or they sold the spirits of <br /> <br /> Rachael McAdams is so beautiful .... That's not a good performance, not scary ... She's cute. You have to show a lot of movies to record the movie. this She is not hard enough to be a good female lead. <br /> <br /> Cillian Murphy can pass at least 28 days, but here he plays a stupid villain, pretending to be a wise man. He gets his ass kicked by McAdams 5'5 '' because after all, she's a cheerleader ... and a field hockey player ... and I'm sure she owns all Tae Bo tapes .. So she seems Will be able to kick the shit out of international terrorists to hire I will not trust him to steal gum from 7-11. <br /> <br /> Is this movie done before, except before they do well? Going to rent a Die Hard movie again. You love people who are in danger of terrorists abroad, except the characters are more cute and reliable and the bad guys are more capable and interesting. I do not understand how Hollywood can continue to create shit as if they have forgotten the proper model that they can easily copy. It is not surprising that movie revenues will decrease. <br /> <br /> Leave your $ 6 in the bathroom and save your life for 2 hours. You will never get back. <br /> <br /> ciao, FreddyShoop
