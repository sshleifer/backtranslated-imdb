interesting? Hardly 'scientific evidence', the film gives an opinion (Which basically means that the Jews are cancerous) are stupid and lame (If we don't know what happened at that time) <br /> <br /> Important? Nah, I can't imagine that the Germans (Even in a terrible time) want or believe in this movie Compared to the Triumf des Willens of Riefenstahl, I am now a movie that I am impressed. This is just a waste of nonsense. <br /> <br /> The 'best' part is the scene from M (one of my all-time favorites), which (the Jews as the announcer, so remind us thoroughly) Lorre Play ball - fat and murderer In the eyes of these filmmakers, there is only atheism that can be done. Oh, don't you know that M is Hitler's favorite movie? <br /> <br /> No, it's just a normal STUPID. Nazi propaganda type 2/10
