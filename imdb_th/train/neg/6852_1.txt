This movie is really unbelievable. I've seen a lot of cheap junk movies, especially 'Full Moon'-Pictures, a lot, but' Dollman 'is really hard to come together: laughable stories, actors are always parody and special tricks! How long can I talk about them! It's a very bad movie, but it's one of the most fun movies. If you're a fan of bad movies to laugh, you have to watch it and don't miss 'Dollman vs. Demonic Toys'. It's really fun and worse.
