Wow, here finally it is; Action "movie" without action In setting a really low budget (don't miss the hilarious flying saucers that fly a couple of times) in the future at Seattle, we find that there is a brainless brain looking for ways to avenge childhood. <br /> < br /> Even the original or interesting manuscripts about the story in the distance and the actors' performances are just foolishness by trying to steal from other movies, mostly "matrix" without money being made. must Yes, we will see the running on the wall and slow-motion photography (about 45 seconds), but these scenes are as cool as the stupid efforts that make jokes about the inability of men. <br /> And yes, we still get a lot of sales opportunities that lead to one place, as if the screenplay was considered by an actor who had never seen it before while shooting. Make a scene <br /> <br /> Believe me It's not as bad as possible. In fact, it is not appropriate to be taken seriously. But maybe I might make some people not rent and collect your money
