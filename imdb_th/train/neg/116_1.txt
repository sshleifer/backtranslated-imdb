I can't believe that the audience of this movie here doesn't think of another movie. I am prepared for the possibility that this story will be scary, but the script (or lack thereof) is made for movies that are pointless. In a positive way, the general level of craftsmanship in the actors and technical teams is quite capable. But when you have a pig's ear that will work with you, you can't make silk bags. Ben G's fans should stick to other movies that he once visited. Dorothy S. fans should stick to Galaxina, Peter B's fans should be stuck with Last Picture Show and Target. Cheap fans laugh at the cost of those who seem to be asking if it should be stuck with Peter B's amazingly horrifying book. Of unicorns
