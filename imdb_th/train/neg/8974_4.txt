This movie I will not call it "movie" is about anything and serves mainly for popular performances of the time. Yes, the war is full of intent (Pun Intan) and this film for our army and audience to be treated. <br /> <br /> But we have something more content. <br /> < br /> Love to see the buddy rich young man on drums. <br /> <br /> But one hijack after that one is faster. <br /> <br /> I don't know Zero Mostel! So if you are one "The greatest generation" as they say, you will enjoy ... <br /> <br /> Movie
