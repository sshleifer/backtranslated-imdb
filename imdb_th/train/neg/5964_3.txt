The version of this movie that I see is the name. "Horror rises from the grave". Horror in question is an evil medieval magician played by the Spanish horror legend Paul Naschy. It looks like he's playing Abanazer in a church in the church. He rose from his grave when the children were stupid. (I think he is a descendant while he is played by Naschy). Return to his ancestral home and gather the head and body of a magician who gathered by witchfinders that killed him. Trying to stop him. From the grave <br /> <br /> Clearly, when the head and body reunite again, the hell is broken and many people die. Like a good magician, Abanazer here has a cute assistant. This person, played by another Spanish horror, is a beautiful Helga Line. Like every other girl in the movie that makes her quit work periodically. There are many nudity in this movie and not just women - we have seen Naschy's ridiculous body which is not a beautiful image. I can tell you. Most views of this film are ridiculous. There is a funny scene, especially at Naschy and Line, talking about their evil plans and suddenly decided that both of them had a blonde girl with a husband whom they had. <br /> <br /> It is filled with beautiful blood in various places. Gordon Lewis-esquire The moment when Line dashes her hand into the chest of men to remove his heart. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie. This is a powerful zombie. Even though they have been spreading rapidly and don't have to worry about coming back Which is a shame However, the scenes in which zombies emerge are the most ridiculous moments of the movie. Everything happened in a long time, and we still didn't get a clue as to what happened until we saw some numbers that came out from afar. There are many junk moments like this, thanks to poor editing. When the laborer falls under the hypnotic spell of Naschy's head, there is a big face that seems to last forever and without any purpose. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's not a big but fun horror movie. Sure. The version that I saw is the American version, dubbed as being probably shredded for everything I know. The original Spanish version may be a masterpiece ...
