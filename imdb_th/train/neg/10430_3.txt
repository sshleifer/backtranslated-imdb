There are many good things about the new BSG: There are many roles in Zion for the 8 and 6 models, such as the two female actors playing great There is an old school that feels about industrial design on Galactica ("My boat won't be connected to my corpse!"). In addition, all space battles, special effects (Although every experienced sci-fi watcher) the darkness of their natural characters is flawed. <br /> <br /> That makes it even more bitter when the ending is a child. < br /> <br /> Yes, the first part, the scene in space, the attack at Zilon and everything is very good. But the soft ending? I often watch movies and show today with a hidden timer, so I never knew how much time left until the end. So for me it was a special torture to see the end again and again. Every time I think, Oh, this is the last scene, I finally got it again. Every character that is full ends completely! That's not really necessary. <br /> <br /> Things that emphasize the expertise of all schoolchildren: Roslin scenes that are still young. Why is it important for us to know: {a} She lost her sister and her father in A terrible accident and {b} that she had one night with students / students in the past? What does this lead to? Where is the link? I am now using more European-Ish methods and random actions of anything in movies and shows, but all this is ridiculous. This does not bring meaning to the story. <br /> <br /> In addition, I saw "Last Frakkin special" and in that Ron revealed his irrationality about the story: he couldn't happen. A good ending for this story, so .... He just can't! It's not about the characters as much as they make the final episode. The idea that "This is a thousand years in the past." The mitochondria are used in Hitchhikers Guide to Galaxy and believe that there are many BSG watchers who know the specific H2G2 story. And Hera's speech now has a story that doesn't work well But we made Roslin act as her alumni who were less than 20 years old. Don't understand me wrong. I have everything for older women with younger men. More power with them, but this ... no reason. <br /> <br /> Overall (writing) This set has the flaws that they want. That's what even moreso for the last episode. I hope Lost and 24 can do better with the series ending.
