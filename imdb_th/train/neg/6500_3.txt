Look, I'm sorry if half the world is guilty of this. But life is confusing enough I don't need to look like that. I dug Anthony Hopkins big time. I still see fracture and I know that it is Quentin's steaming pile. But this thing wasn't taken well and it didn't dare even though it was art. Well-produced movies have a reason to cut and fix quickly, not an excuse. "Oh, but it's a realistic meaning." This will cause you headaches. It is the fastest animation that will take you everywhere. I still love AH and I will give him a chance again. But if you don't have time to watch bad ideas on the screen, skip this thing.
