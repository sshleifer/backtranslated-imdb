I remember having watched this movie for a long time on television. I remember the evidence of this film about a group of hotels that were attacked by ants. What I don't remember is how wonderful it is. <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie on television late at night. I am sure that it must be a mistake because this kind of movie usually disappears from existence and will not be discovered again! Susan Somers (At the pinnacle of her playing career in Chrissy in 'Three's Company') plays the camouflage at Lakewood Manor. Construction workers are installing an outside pool and accidentally disturbing the nest. Or should I say * ants bird ants eat ants !! One worker was attacked by ants. One minute he took it from his clothes one by one the next minute he had covered. The next scene shows skeletons in the soil. <br /> <br /> If you think it's quite a long way, you should see Myrna Loy playing the swivel chair that lives in the house. I almost thought of relieving her thoughts that she had received air transport from the movie. <br /> <br /> The last scene shows Suzanne, Robert Foxworth and the third man sitting on the floor. Room in the hotel with the back Each other blowing through the straw and covered with ants. <br /> <br /> that is a movie There is no appeal "disaster" or attracting "big star" to the movie. It was intended to be a 'great' television program at that time. Now it's lucky if it's left at 4:00 am on your local television station. <br /> <br /> If you want to catch Susan Sommer is the best. She should look at the three company episodes. If you want to see Myrna Loy doing everything to put bread on the table and pay to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 0/10
