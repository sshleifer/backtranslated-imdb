I watched the free money last night & it was the longest time in my life for more than 90 minutes. With an interesting character, I thought I was an actor, especially since I was a bad Brando fan! It's a waste of talent. Almost an embarrassing thing to watch sometimes (Like a scene in the cattle) and there are many missed opportunities for humor settings (Why didn't they show Charlie Sheen's character back to Brando's truck? It tries to be a clown. But I didn't buy it this way, only for the hard Brando fans. <br /> <br /> I gave 2 out of 10 because I still thought that the worse movie was Skidoo.
