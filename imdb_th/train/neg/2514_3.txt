I love Dewaere in the Noir series. His abilities are a little bit of "The Waltzers", also known as "Going Places". Okay. It's the story of two men who saw the meeting in the most ridiculous and worthless form. Many people find that such behavior is amusing. This is a boring and pointless exercise designed to scare. I found a smile on Blier's face. The face behind the camera was annoying. The Noir series is an accurate expression of personal freedom and incontinence behavior. From the first moment we saw Patric Dewaere reaching into an abandoned area, we received the idea of ​​resisting the surprisingly beautiful hero. We would spend a few hours. When we saw him chasing an unfortunate middle-aged woman with his friend Depardieu in "Going Places", we had a fair warning that spending two hours with these baptisms would be a spiritual drain. I have trouble eking even "3" for this annoying interference.
