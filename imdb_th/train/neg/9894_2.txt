I missed the beginning of this movie, which could explain why I didn't like it very much. On the other side, I studied the collapse of the Roman Republic for many years, so I knew this. Then again, that may be the reason why I don't like this movie. <br /> <br /> This film has more historical deviations than special. Although it is not correct But I don't think they will try to correct it But in this case can forgive The strange thing is that sometimes they try very hard to be accurate in the past to confuse. Like throwing Anthony's marriage to Octavia and then pushing it out for two more scenes later Why should it be used if it is not intended for the plot and Octavia has never seen before? And like to call Anthony with his real name (Marcus Antonius) in some scenes and with his strange name, Mark Antony, in other scenes <br /> <br /> Although there are historical inaccuracies If not for leading women She has no dignity in the matter of Oz. She is a hippie, boring and completely lacking control. Rather than being Queen Cleopatra, clever and peaceful, he became a teenager with PMS. 95% came from bad performances, but 5% came from writing bad scripts as well. Too stupid drama scenes are written in scripts. Sometimes you don't watch Antonius and Cleopatra. You are watching Dawson and Joey, an immature version of "Dawson's Creek". <br /> <br /> If you want to see anything about this period.
