The movie Jean Rollin, eight stories that I have seen, may be the most strange thing. An interesting plot (as before) seems to be too fragile to maintain, even trim 84 minutes, but there are still obligations to be incredibly baffling! Vampire woman who seems to be (Clothed as promised) was held in a remote castle and appeared only 'raised' in the blood of the victim (Which is clearly a member of the suicide club) as if not sure if all this could lead him or not In fact, the strange father of the hero faced with emptiness ?? Laughingly revealed as a mutant (?!) From the future! A cold rhythm and a dreamy atmosphere (Who wears hats and animal masks to hide their properties from sheltered young women) Of course, it's a model for both filmmakers. (Same as the seaside setting) at {anti} Climax) The "Euro-cult" style, as well as the beauty of the creatures exhibited Personally, the most fun thing about visually appealing stories. But empty, intellectually, is to see the familiar character Bernard Musson. (Which appeared in the movie Louis Buntal in the last six days)
