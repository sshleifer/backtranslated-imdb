Well ... Overall, this movie is quite worthless and it's a horror movie that ends up being a comedian. I just rented this movie last night when I and my friend went to a blockbuster to find a horrible movie. This is not what we are looking for. But it makes us satisfied with humor Actors in this movie (Especially Brandon) is very fake until funny And especially the girl Tracy, whenever she is in the room, tells the clown that will disappear They barely express their emotions and it is clear that they act. And when the clown is looking through the black box and grabbing Mark, he doesn't seem to be scared. And seriously, will you be JOGGING if you are chased? I will run for my life! (Even if someone can beat that joker because he weighs 300 pounds), do not talk about bad effects, such as when the clown heads Susan in the forest. The room with Denise and Tracy, whenever Denise throws his head back Like in the comments of previous people, the beginning is absolutely meaningless, and I don't even see why it's included in the movie. What did this film do in 2003? The song made it look like it was created in 1980 and the camera (?) Didn't look really professional. Half the camera seems to be unable to stand still when it is expected. Overall I have to say that I like watching movies. I would not recommend But if you try to find something that scares you But if you are looking for something to make fun or laugh out, I would definitely recommend using it.
