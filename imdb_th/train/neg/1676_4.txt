Val Kilmer, Stable Performance Dylan McDermott Stable Performance Josh Lucas Strong Performance Three attractive actors give good performances. The problem is who is interested in the land, John Holmes is infamous for his good donations, drug addicts and HIV-infected men continue to create adult movies. But did not create interesting characters. <br /> <br /> Stories that surround the event And the aftermath of the violent massacre that occurred in the late 1980s in Los Angeles, where Holmes was linked, arrested and charged with murder and ultimately acquitted Like in the case of OJ, the fault factor, whether the result is in the zone "He did that" quite high. <br /> <br /> There is no one who can sympathize in this movie.
