First To Die 2003 <br /> <br /> I'll accept my mistake first: I didn't realize that this was a TV movie. I was "dumped" by "R" certification. The story is strong. But the movie is too long, about 40 minutes. The direction and continuity are very good. Most of the actors are excellent and work well with their characters. The downside of this movie is that it falls into the "chick flick" category, although there are some extreme scenes. But there is no violence whatsoever to call the "R" rating. There are no naked scenes or free sex scenes. In fact, there is no Ona Grauer sex scene (the most beautiful), Kristina Copeland, Sonya Salomaa and Glynis Davies. All guests are in the SG-1 series, but this film does nothing to improve their career. Robert Patrick is great, as he usually is, and Mitch Pylekie reminds me of the modern day Limavin, Megan Gallagher, the very talented person I respected as an actor in the Millennium Series. Did not receive any challenges to show her various talents The biggest disappointment for the actor is Tracy Paulan. In addition to being a lower performer and not particularly attractive, her voice is extremely annoying. I found myself muting the TV during her conversation. I would like to recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the Lifetime TV program. I would not recommend paying to watch this movie, however. Once considered, I didn't find anything that would cause censorship. This is a movie that is worth watching on TV only because nothing is cut off. As a TV movie, I scored 5 out of 10 as a documentary film with "R" endorsements and, like strong actors, I rated it 2 out of 10.
