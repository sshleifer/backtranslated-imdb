You will immediately recognize the plot. Divorced couple's daughter trying to get the mother and father back together again. Yes, that's the theme of The Parent Trap in the 60's, 80's and 90's. But this is a terrible thing. Although Deanna Durbin is younger than Hayley Mills, 21 years old while playing as a daughter But Durbin looks older than in adults. And her brothers and sisters, too. <br /> <br /> And the confusion between adults and children throughout the story Girls dress in a cute little sailor suit. But looks ridiculous in them because the director seems to try to point out their greatness and tushies in the movie Therefore, you lack continuous thinking as a child or woman. When Ray Milland and others started "hitting" them, you would feel as if they were pedophiles. Teenagers or deceitful little girls or little foxes. You are never sure what you should think of them. <br /> <br /> Parents alike look very old and this movie looks very old. <Br / > <br /> It is a rusty version of the parent trap and you should avoid it or at least make sure your tetanus picture is present if you don't believe me.
