This film caused a number of urgent questions in my mind. Firstly, Jennifer Tilly, how has it been to maintain the career of film actors over the years, with a ridiculous nonsense voice and a limited number of facial expressions that she uses? ..What people in the world are responsible for creating this nasty and disgusting movie on earth? And thirdly ... because there are enough people in the wrong way to decide to sabotage, this should not be someone in the system - studio, distributor or somewhere - there is enough reason to Prevent it from being completed. You will have to find a very long way to create another film that is deeply disgusting like this ... and it's not being charged as a horror movie - which Even if it is legal Movie type, it is absolutely This film builds the wall from the beginning to the end with madness, violence and misuse and does not qualify for redemption. In fact, I don't support censorship. (Which I don't believe) ... but I can't see who will draw the positive things from watching movies like this
