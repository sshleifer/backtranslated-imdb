Not a very good movie But according to the data, it is quite accurate to explain the torture technique. The purpose of this film is to demonstrate the cruelty of the NK POW camp and do it effectively enough, along with surprisingly straightforwardness. Regardless of any technical flaws (And there are many) By watching this, you will see the forgotten corners of the forgotten war and abominable things - again, disgusting because it was built over the DMZ, not Guantanamo Bay I do not think that any Korean veteran brought his torture to work and if you watch this movie and Pork Chop Hill compared to Vietnamese movies. I don't know if it was someone in '54 who was trapped in the concept of World War II. (Boys tend to be very smart) or war or something But interesting to see this thing from the same system that 16 years later will be Making movies like "Go Tell The Spartans"
