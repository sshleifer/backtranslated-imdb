This excuse for garbage on television is one of the most terrifying trash cans ever seen in Australian television. The house mates are boring, unattractive and unwise and choose from the basics that you should try to kill them if you have to be with them.

What will happen to television that doesn't target the lowest participation of society as an audience? This cannot be classified as entertainment. I think it's true that Channel Ten can rid your soul. It happened to Rove McManus, who was once a respected comedian and when moving to Channel 10, it became a horrible fear. With the exception of The Simpsons, which was produced wisely
