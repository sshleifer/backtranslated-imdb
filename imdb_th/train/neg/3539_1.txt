Ritchie's first two films are entertaining and stylish. Here he invaded two classics recently? 'Normal suspects' and 'Fight Club' ?? And still come out empty-handed. <br /> <br /> Even though the parade itself is a mysterious puzzle (With the twitching of the greatest 'ordinary' suspects he has ever drawn to persuade you that he is "or not ...) and try to twist 'Fight-Club' about the character. With real identity and image in the film, struggling to maintain interest in the second half You know that you are being led to an alley and slowly getting boring. <br /> <br /> The disadvantages of chess and game theory are all excellent, but Ritchie delves deeply into them and Too much to take advantage of the material. <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes the movie (almost) look is Ritchie's brave way with the scenes and the dynamic camera of Maurice-Jones If Ritchie cling to a more satisfying plot and surrender to a more stringent revision, there is no reason why he didn't create another fun gangster. <br /> > Similarly, Revolver wastes no time. Incompatibility is not equal to depth. If you want to see a great movie that doesn't make sense But make you benefit from it (And accidentally involving a mysterious escape from solitary confinement) see 'Lost Highway'
