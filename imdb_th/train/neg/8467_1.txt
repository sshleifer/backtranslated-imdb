My friend and I rented this thing from Blockbuster because we saw the names of numerous visitors on the box. This movie is an imitation. I hope you refuse from your resume. <br /> <br /> "The plot" is broken and weak. Most performances are dry and unbearable in some parts. This movie has no reason at all. The rough plot of the alien-infected human race has been done many times by movies that have a much better screenplay. There has been a misfortune to follow in this movie. I suggest you burn it. <br /> <br /> How is it a character in a horror movie when not using fear, fear, fear Fear Or normal horror movies Techniques I don't know But if you still find yourself wanting to watch this movie, I suggest you have a lot of sugar before hand. You'll find some of it funny.
