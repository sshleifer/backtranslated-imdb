I hope I will give this movie out of the top ten. Before going to watch this movie, one day after the film came out, I arrived at IMDb to see the comments. Reviews that are called movies that are predictable and wonderful with awesome interactions. I never followed other people's opinions, so I lost seven dollars for this shit movie. It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> People who write scripts should be pushed off the cliff. Since when the scary movie has a sappy scene? I swear I am surprised that there is no HUG group ^ - ^ Moments. <br /> <br /> I think I jumped once and that's because I share my thoughts about my research in English. Clich√©d, bird / cat. Emerge from where, when you think of something going on, <br /> <br /> and the character is stupid My friend and I almost laughed when the alarm disappeared and the main character said "I have to take my mother's shawl !!!" Safety is only a few steps away. But not my mother's shawl (That does not match the dress by the way) is more important than my health and safety They brought her back to her house, knowing that the murderer knew where she was. God <br /> <br /> My friend and I predicted all the movies as well. And not only did I bet he was hiding under the bed for a moment, it was "he stole the clothes of the staff, lifted the bag and sneaked out of the hotel" and "it was a detective walking down the path, not a killer!" Should be predictable Disney movies can't be predicted. <br /> <br /> I'm going to rant now, saying that it's a terrible movie. I'm glad I went to see the cinema, so I won't buy it for $ 15.00 and hate it. It's terrible. It would be better if only one thing happened. If after being shot by a detective, the murderer will fall in the same position as he was shot in his hand, knocked down and stabbed the girl on his way. Oh, so cute. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time or money. Go to see a good movie
