This movie started very slowly. But when the action finally begins, it must be followed I do not understand why some events have happened and many events have occurred before they explain to confuse them. The only thing that it does for it is the large amount of blood / blood that it contains, although most of the time there is no special technique. The blood looks like a red Kool-Aid. It seems that some people are tearing the skin that stepped on the paper pile. Again, the story has an amateur feel as well as a writer doesn't take long to make perfect. I feel that it may be a much better movie if the effect is better and takes more time with the script. I sincerely hope that I do not watch it, not because of blood. But because I felt that I had died for 90 minutes. If you like a movie that is full of blood, this is yours if you don't.
