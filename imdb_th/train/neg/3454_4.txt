Cut tries to be like the post slashers. Most slits attempt to spoof the horror genre that is cleverly tried by citing other famous horror movies. Now I'm not bagging 'Scream' as I think 'Scream' is a movie A very good horror that works well in combination of horror and comedy. Cutting failed at all levels It has its time But overall it didn't work even as a movie "Very bad. It's good." Just one lower than average. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes are ok and set. The story is quite good, apart from the fact that Kylie Minogue can't really do the job and she makes her speak. Going forward for a while and a group of students want to finish her movie, which seems to be cursed. And as you have anticipated, one-on-one actors and teams will be chosen by the masked madman slowly. <br /> <br /> The original story, bad performances and predictable endings There are many references to everything from 'Scream' to 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre'. This is not smart as well. It feels like the director wants to feel smart and cool by talking. The other famous horror movie Ala Scream for slasher has the slightest gore and no nudity, which is very negative. When talking about the slasher that doesn't have anything, I should really support this movie because I am. The Australian and we are not good when talking about horror. (We have our gems) But Cut is not one of them. <br /> <br /> However, it keeps me watching for about 90 minutes, so at least it's a good thing. I will not recommend this to anyone other than the hardcore slasher fans who may be able to appreciate what this movie is trying to do. But if you are looking for a good movie away, <br /> <br /> / 5
