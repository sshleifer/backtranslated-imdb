Is a movie that has no long purpose I'm sure that in the past this movie was happy. But when the entertainment went on, it didn't make the score. Ralph Fiennes received in a great movie, a British patient named Schindler But this movie is very bad It seems that it doesn't go anywhere, but his character at the beginning was so shallow that surprised me that his "sister" would be interested in everyone. No need to pay to rent this movie, buy a copy of a British patient instead of yourself.
