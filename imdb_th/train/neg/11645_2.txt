This is a review of the 'Freddy Mercury The Untold Story,' theatrical Chicago Int Film Festival, 2007, one of the most scary and boring biographical documentaries I've ever seen. If the movie I saw in the theater was first released on television, I would ask the producers and their distributors not to fool the audience who paid with the wrong promises of valuable documentary movies. Although it is a documentary created for the TV, the piano is sensitive to the interviewer sitting in front of the flower arrangements in the hotel room and a description of the sound of literature. One aspect of redemption "The story told by Freddie Mercury" - or uh, it is "The story told by Princess Diana" is a traditional concert, video and TV movie - Freddie Mercury and the Queen. Interviews from witnesses that are not related to insights, such as: "He is free." (Actually .. I think Freddie Mercury is the person of the company ...) belittle Freddie's testimonials by Brian May or Montserrat Light and love into your life and the complex nature of Mercury ... it will be like a boarding school like Harry Potter it? An interview with the first girl interested ("... which is now working in a travel agency") and members of Freddie's first school band have helped in what I wanted to know about Mercury. Important milestones of his personal life, his gender, art style and his growth, Queen, the band is still not explored. These filmmakers do not ask questions that provoke or do not participate in independent research or have a vision of their subject instead of sending boring montage of comments that are polite and thoroughly clean about the myth. Mysterious rock History that will be remembered by this channel history. Your grandparents can sleep on Sunday night.
