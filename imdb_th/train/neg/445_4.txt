One thing that surprised me about this movie (Not in a good way) is Nathan Stoltzfus, who seems to be proud of being an important historian on the topic of Rosenstrasse, one of the historians working on this film. Most of the actual events have changed or are not interested. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers said von Trotta said she didn't intend Lena to go to sleep with Goebbels. But in this case, why did you give every impression of what happened? Why not show other possible reasons for the release of men, such as the Stalingrad disaster or the fear of the Nazis, the foreign media located in Berlin, to find information about the protests? /> <br /> Why is the whole story playing the second violin with a story that binds a weak family that is repeated? Of course, some of the best things that can be done have their own history! In the place, as if the film had two stories that seemed to have a slight similarity. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film failed in its purpose, which was to draw attention to action. Rarely known Of resistance, which is a shame because doing better, it may have a major impact
