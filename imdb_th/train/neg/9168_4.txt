Randolph Scott is leaving the United States to be Canada's green grassland of Canada. He wanted to start a ranch there with his partner, Bill Williams and cook Lee Tung Foo. They stamped their small flock on a bridge built by Victor Jory. Later, Jory eliminated their cattle and Williams lost. Lost his right arm during the piano play. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> From 1945 to 1962 when he retired, Randolph Scott Unfortunately, the Cariboo route will not appear among his best Westerners. <br /> <br /> It's like the material that Roy Rogers or Gene Autry might use. Sometimes the story is seriously foolish. Williams, who is ready to sit with Scott, wants to go to the gold because there is a big strike. He doesn't blame the wrongdoer. He blames Scott for persuading him to leave for losing his arms. <br /> <br /> There is also a scene in the movie when Scott, Lee. Tung Fu and Gabby Hayes were captured by the Indians. They escaped because Gabby's lure was ordered to kick by order and he kicked to India to let our hero escape. I'm not sure if there will be a play in the movie Rogers. <br /> <br /> In addition, the story really wants you to believe that Tyrannosaurus Scott accidentally stumbled upon Attack the gold after just a few lessons from explorer Gabby Hayes about how to find gold. <br /> <br /> This is Gabby Hayes' farewell movie. It would be better if he went out in the good west and in reality. He has done two things better with Randolph Scott before <br /> <br /> I will say this, even if there is no Caribou appearing in this movie, as one of the few Canadian movies in the past that doesn't have any mounties. <br /> <br /> But if I am you, unless you are a fan of Randolph Scott or Gabby Hayes, leave the Cariboo Trail.
