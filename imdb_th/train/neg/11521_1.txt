This movie is one of the worst garbage. It is very surprising to have something completely scary. But if you can plot numbing ideas, develop characters and directions, you may get kicked out of the scary music that it's a joke. This film started incredibly and became a subject that could not be viewed quickly. Someone should let everyone involved in this movie be comforted because their careers may be destroyed because of their involvement in the film. If you end up seeing this movie or have seen it (I feel your pain) Then these words come too late for others. Avoid all costs or recognize that this movie is so bad that it takes 2 hours of your life. At least you can clean up or see something while watching.
