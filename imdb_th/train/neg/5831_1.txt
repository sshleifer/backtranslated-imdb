This film is extremely boring and pretentious. There was only one good time when the sailor shaved Barney's eyebrows. Relentless sad song - It is a sad story that Bjork, who has the inner beauty, has been brought down in her art mistakes. The tea service zest makes the ritual beautiful and ridiculous. Myths and cultures are not respected in this film, not only from Japanese culture. But comes from other filmmakers ... (keep up) at the time The perfect "imitation art" - the ship's crew found a giant piece of sh * t, which is what the audience found in the cinema. There are some pieces that are very calm and artistic, without heart --- then prepare for the destroyer. You Barney, you have been outted! I've seen Jodorowsky's sacred mountain and some of your fake veils are raised. You stole your pictures, your style and your entire art catalog from this man. Now the holy mountain has finally been released. Hopefully, the power in the World Art Council will stop you financially! Poor Jodorowsky lost in a financial battle with the Beatles Lawyer when he was Lennon / McCartney in the making of the movie and BTW, while Jodorowsky was Beatle-you are the King! Some price soulless are only liked by kitschy facile college students. And BTW, I'm a movie maker. If you are interested in creating a reality movie - I will fight with you legally according to the law of protecting Jodorowsky - you protect your burglary immediately.
