I saw this movie at the beginning when there was a theater in the theater that was reasonably empty. Believe it or not, after watching movies for decades, this movie is still stuck in my mind clearly that it is the worst movie of all time; Or at least the worst that I would allow myself to see <br /> <br /> After the first unbelief, we laughed while each scene hit a new low. But soon after that, the suspicious happiness was gone and it was really sad.
