Tony Scott destroys everything that might be interesting in the screenplay, a screenplay that exceeds Richard Kelly's lecture. Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) is a model that has fallen out and becomes a bounty hunter. This is your story ... "Sort of" <br /> <br /> The problem with this garbage is that there are not many stories and the extreme graphics of every shot act as a mechanism. Long distance That makes us ignore all of Harvey's busy life. <br /> <br /> You just don't care. Harvey Knightley shows her that she is a nasty and insulting child. What to guarantee our respect? She punches people she doesn't like and sheds light on clothes and restraint when the situation demands. But she is not real and Knightly is unbelievable. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring. It's too loud and binds to one of the music scores, the most annoying source I've heard for a long time. The last twenty minutes came back again with Scott's "True Romance" climax and Domino's gang to meet two formidable gangsters - surprised! surprise! - Determined to shoot at the top of the Las Vegas casino. Unfortunately, this exciting explosion arose entirely from Scott and became a pointless exercise. This is not a job. Brave or experimental art It is a failure at every level because it gives us no way to enter the life and obstacles of the characters. <br /> <br /> Mickey Roach looks good like a bounty hunter. But he disappeared into the background while "conducting the lecture" Chris Walken turned to another hilarious pendant and Dabney Coleman was always underutilized. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the surface that is full. Multi-layer mechanism of this film It is still an uproar, no matter how polished you are.
