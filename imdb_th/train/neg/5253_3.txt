The name of the main character (Frau) is the German word for "woman". I don't know if it's intended or not But if I'm sure there are people giggling from the German audience at the Fantasy Film Festival last year, when it was shown That it is intended for giggling, it is a scary movie for the benefit of heaven! Scary movies in more than one sense It is a shame that this kind of place is lost with horrible moments, even moments that are unbearable for viewers (Of course not for those who are weak !!)! And it is not necessary to show everything that appears I do not have a moral obligation. (Because movies don't have a job or function like that). Discuss what is shown here. But this is new for "Torture Movement" that grows in A few years ago!
