I saw this reckless pile flowing back in the preview, and I blown to the worst of it. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie boasted a gaping blind spot. No people love New York, black or gay? Or who would say that they know white people that are related to themselves in love? I know it's not love. Crash of anvil-tastic inclusiveness But you can't pretend to be a New York movie without being a member of these societies. In addition, you know that the person who produced this thing is what Crash deserves. Oscar has that hand. So where is everyone? <br /> <br /> May be worse than the unnatural social and economic ignorance that is a nasty chapter. (Remember that when you are in high school and people are bored with beautiful girls in swivel chairs? This film runs through the boundaries of the worst way. Bad performances, poor writing, bad governance - all cover all possible categories that are related to wealthy white people who smoke outside fancy restaurants. <br /> <br /> But thank God, finally they have Hayden Christensen and Rachel Billson reunite to meet the jumper. And beside the notes, Uma dodged the gunshot Ethan Hawke looks provocative. Of course, this is one thing in his appearance. But adds an extraordinarily terrifying horror in the scene of his scary script with cute Maggie. Q. <br /> <br /> I have a terrible time to choose. The least favorite scene for the questionnaire at the end of the movie. But must be a bit of Anton Yelchin / Olivia Thirlby for the lack of true taste which makes me sad because I really like both actors I didn't think that I was easily angry. But what I can do is scoff and look around with disgust, like a 50-year-old aunt of someone. <br /> <br /> The second place that is close to the contest is incredibly scary. This is Shia LaBeouf's deaf image about what it means to be a former Disney Channel actor who will be against Julie Christie. I don't mean the opposite. I mean, continue. Contrary to the description only Now I know that the top of Orlando Bloom is a related highlight. Highlight. Remember, when your brain starts to leak from your ear immediately after the opening of the credit, which seems to be Is a nod to the real world of New York This film is a shameful, weird day, ineffective, no attitude, and in the end divorced from the true idea of ​​New York. <br /> <br /> (Special star for the sequence Cloris Leachman / Eli Wallach Actually quite sweet But it is the only bright spot in the feeling of aimless torment for many hours)
