When that line started, the scary sci-fi movie The Great Vorelli from the movie "Devil Doll" created a teleporter to cut his capital by Blanchard, a bearded man with a bow tie and a man with Large eyebrows When his experiment failed, the good doctor knew that Lembach, the person who controlled all the money in the world, would be in London for a few days. He tried to project himself into Blanchard's house with the help of Sheila, a good-looking lab assistant. No need to say anything wrong and he looks like a rat. The rest of the film is dedicated to a doctor with orange hair. Walking around London shocked people with mutated hands and wore diapers on his face. There are a number of killings, simple paper work, and eventually the doctor disappears at the point that I have to face the doctor. Fortunately, no one decides to continue.
