This is the page for "House of Exorcism", but most people confuse this film with the masterpiece of Mario Bava "Lisa & the Devil", which describes the ridiculously high ranking for this "House of exorcism" when "Lisa & the Devil "was screened at the film festival in the early 70s. It was a major success. The audience responded to the beautiful Gothic horror movie. Unfortunately, it was time before and considered too unusual and not commercially adequate for many consumption. No dealer will buy So producer Alfredo Leone decided to fix 'Lisa' with an electric saw by removing about half the original movie and adding a new scene which he filmed two years after the original product! It is important to note that Bava is not related to these horrible new things. Therefore, the "House of Exorcism" technique is not a Bava movie. A few minutes in the movie, the audience was Jared out of this dream world. Suddenly we saw Lisa. (Two years old and having a very different haircut) began twisting on the ground, causing the throat and treble to sound "suck my co @ k", so fragile, right? And this movie continues like this, jumping back and forth between the beautiful visual movies and the movie "Exorcist". Leone is trying to combine these scenes while keeping the look of the story. the same He failed miserably. When choosing to destroy "Lisa and Mara" In general, Bava denies himself by saying that his movie is too beautiful to cut. He was right and it was so sad that this artist would see all his work destroyed and wash the toilet. Several years ago, the original "Lisa and the Devil" was seen again, with a new surface appearing on television late at night. I had seen "Lisa" long before I saw the new version and it was extremely annoying. Saw my favorite movie "Savage" in this way, worth seeing only because I was curious Otherwise, avoid the terrible disasters such as the plague.
