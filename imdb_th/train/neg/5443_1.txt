Terrible. I like Kristen Cloke and Gary Busey. But the director didn't put this together. There are many actions, many promises. But everything fell out The director didn't do his job. Actions that tend to fall out of weakness It seems to have been invented in a great effort to help this movie "The Rage" (DirecTV is credited in 1996). Other directors will work better.
