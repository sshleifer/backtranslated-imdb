I'm not sure why Spike Lee built this train's wreck and gave poor poor Stevie Wonder the eternal matching of his beautiful songs. I am still not satisfied that he uses profanity as part of the normal prose of professional black people. Violation of the occupation of the movie's audience is a shame. The scene that appears to be fabricated in blue and has nothing to do with themes or sub themes. Play as if some college kids wrote this. In particular, I hate the ridiculous scenes that the two leading actors have practiced without any reason, and the police come to find Snipes. Waiting too much makes the audience feel as though Spike doesn't have respect for those. Watch him or he has no clue as to what this movie is about. The final scene seems to have been thrown to show the use of a sledgehammer to the point in the film. It also supports the myth that everyone in the culture uses the word F in a casual conversation. I hope he knows that part. The rest of his film is in the same group that he did not grow as a filmmaker. I think his grouping with Scorcesee in Clockers is a wise move. He should hold the creation of a documentary such as Four Little Colored Girls. The Shock movie is not an Oscar.
