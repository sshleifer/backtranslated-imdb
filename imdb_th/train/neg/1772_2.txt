"Sleepwalkers" is the first film that Stephen King wrote for When receiving this and the wonderful Santo & Johnny songs that they use as the theme of the movie, you will expect a strange experience and eventually fulfill the viewing experience. Unfortunately, that's not what you get. The thing is that they may make it a good movie. The starting point is something interesting in a small town with a horrible atmosphere. But something strange happened about 20 minutes in the movie This movie became a joke without a clear reason! From that time in the whole atmosphere of "The sleepwalker" is destroyed for you who have seen it. Who will forget Johnny, a good old man? After squeezing a pencil into the police ear!? But don't understand me wrong, humor doesn't have the quality to exchange I just rented it again to see if he was mabye. I was wrong. The first time around the original plot that sounds sounded, but I was completely human. I can't believe that they will get the rights to this song Santo & Johnny.
