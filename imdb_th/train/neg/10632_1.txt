There are many inaccurate messages in the "documentary" that I find myself shouting at the television. <br /> <br /> Bart Sebrill may produce DVDs that look flashy. But he was sad to look at At the science behind his claim. <br /> <br /> He lived both incorrectly, not telling the full story or the popular old government. "Lying with us" People do not know and people believe in what they tell and Did not check the accuracy or detail behind the claim. <br /> What's more, his "special" or "unpublished" videos are available for free via the internet from various websites < br /> <br /> More reading about situations related to filming, this film shows that he uses false pretenses in interviews and uses creative editing of Answer to promote his opinion. <br /> <br /> All claims by Mr Sibrel regarding "Inaccuracies", "Mistakes" or "Clues" in the Apollo program have been thoroughly received. ly disproven. <br /> <br /> How can I get a strange 40 minutes in my life?
