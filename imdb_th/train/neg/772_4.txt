This movie is not as good as every movie of Christ that I have ever seen. And I was quite surprised that in this story, Pilate wanted to make Jesus successful when the Bible (Including other movies) are different As Paul said in one of his letters "If Christ was not raised from the dead, our faith was useless" br /> Finally, and in opposition to my Jewish critics, Jesus is not a legend. And in truth he was a Jew There are many documents (Formidable and secular) that proves the existence of this ordinary person (Or should I say that God is a human being) that changed humanity I recommend him (Let him be a historian) to read about Flavius ​​Josephus, the best Jewish critic on the 1st century.
