This funny movie isn't funny. It is the love that plays on the pattern. It doesn't affect anything. It was a movie that jumped so derivatives - yes, even then - it didn't have a snap. <br /> <br /> The actors had enough. Moreover, it's hard to say. However, the good thing is that the players are not familiar at MGM. But work may be a lot of actresses. <br /> <br /> We are grateful that this film is a little known to most people who don't know And the production value is not bad But it didn't make a real impression. <br /> <br /> It's normal. And who needs that
