This movie doesn't have to fix this thing. This nasty thing from the burnt hell pit must be killed before it leaves the writer's head. I might not have happened to enough adjectives to explain this movie. But try again. Scary, bad, uncomfortable, no taste, shit, vomiting, stimulation, nasty gut, disgusting, ugly, nasty, stinking, inadequate words in English. "Plot "Involves a serial killer who turns into a snowman Don't ask if it doesn't matter. The killer snowman works about killing people. How can a snowman kill someone? In a tasteful way that makes you want to erase your eyes, if only so you don't have to endure the Styrofoam snowman anymore in a way that makes you want to fill the hot wax in your ear so you don't have to Tolerate his snow anymore Don't watch this movie! Destroy it in the eyes! For the benefit of your soul, don't look!
