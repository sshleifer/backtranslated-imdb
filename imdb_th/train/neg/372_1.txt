I've been watching this movie for a long time, and I don't want to see it again. <br /> <br /> This movie is about Preston Waters, who is thirteen lucky people who seem to be overlooked. The family and those who seem to be short cash. All this change when the bank robber runs through Preston's bike and sends him a blank check to compensate. Preston uses checks to withdraw $ 1 million from the bank. (Ironically, the money was a bank robber to check him). Then bought Preston Preston mansion and said that he worked as an assistant to a mysterious and wealthy sponsor named Mr McIntosh. (Name after his computer) After that, he was crazy for money. <br /> <br /> On paper, this sound is a good idea. However, on the screen, it's one of the most empty movies I've ever seen. For one thing it's too unbelievable. I know that some of this movie is incredible. But I drew the line that a twelve-year-old boy went out with a thirty-year-old woman and was controlled by a small fate of the imaginary person. In addition, the film also has movies with poor performances, predictable plot and less memorable characters. The characters are both wonderful, annoying or underdeveloped. But "Juice" is a funny character. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good movie to watch with your family, skip this story.
