I am looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for a while ... What it reviews, reviews, nominations and media interests. And I must say that the first quarter of this movie is very good! It shows the black music scene at that time. However, while the movie is on, I and my family are tired of our wisdom. Singing has just come together. I mean, seriously, just one more song number and it will break even with the rent What happened to them! Even when Eddie Murphy's character died because of overdose, I knew I should be sad. But I didn't feel any emotions for that character The characters get a soft background about singing in their childhood and whatever. But there is not enough personality to reveal me. Eventually, the conflict is not important enough to take care of the audience. Which along with the lack of character development This movie reminds me of a cat imitating film based on Ray and Chicago. (Ray and Chicago are great movies in my opinion). Overall, I think this movie is best for people who don't care about the overall story. But will enjoy two hours of fun and entertaining performances
