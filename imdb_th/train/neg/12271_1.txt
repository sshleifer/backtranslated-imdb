Screenwriter Lisa Lutz began writing screenplays at the age of 21 in 1991. <br /> <br /> Are you in the business? If someone gives you the opportunity again after this shit, she is finally up to the Fortunate Person Of Ever award. Do they make this writer apply for a bit? Seriously? I can write shit better in my sleep. <br /> <br /> OK, how many lines do I have to type? I don't get this. I think I am "a beginner. I guess I don't understand why there is a limit to what everyone has to say ... or quota or not. Seriously. There is a sentence .. or even one answer. I mean c'mon? <br /> <br /> Thank you ... It's enough. <br /> <br /> This movie has no value.
