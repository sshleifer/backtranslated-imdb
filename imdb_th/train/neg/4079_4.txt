I bought this movie DVD for my girlfriend who used the same name as the ghost girl in this movie and enjoyed the paranormal movie. This film was filmed in all videos, so there is a special look of PBS about it. Special effects are good. But there seems to be a horrible moment in the movie that allowed us to jump on the seat. There is a particularly powerful fear about the Virgin Mary statue. <br /> <br /> However, the performance is not good. What happens at the finale. If you get a movie, rent it. If you buy, please make sure you pay less than $ 5.
