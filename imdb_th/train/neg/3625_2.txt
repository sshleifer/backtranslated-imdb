This is a film that has taken hold in the 1950s. Surprisingly, the American Film Institute chose this movie as the 100 best American movies of all time. I've seen all the movies on the list, and this movie is one of the most frustrating stories. The number of music (and many of them) is long and boring and doesn't have any involvement with the story. The horrible ballet dance sequence that is naturally not associated with the story of the movie. Have to admit that it is made out very well, the song is ok and the dance is done with professional standards - but there is no real reason why the sequence is included in the movie <br /> <br /> The main character of the movie This story is very young and different and behaves in a way that is not polite. His mental age is about 14. If you want to see a good musical drama made in the "Golden Age" of the musical drama, go and watch. "Singing in the Rain"
