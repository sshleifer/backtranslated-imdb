Terry West has a good idea with this movie. He didn't pass it. There is an endless picture of the creepy exterior of the school that will continue forever and may make the time for screenings longer. In addition, this school has only 2 students. Misty Mundae is as good as usual. But this movie will always be Ruby LaRocca (which is the only reason to watch the movie in the first place). If the script is in the middle of her interesting character, we will have a movie to watch her very beautiful !! Good news for buyers of Terry West's DVD movie "Blood For The Muse" is a special feature. One thing I want to say is that this film feels like a person who is not good at passing the punch line at the end of a long joke for the end. Then again, just look at this for Ruby LaRocca.
