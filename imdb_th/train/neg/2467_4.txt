This movie received both 6/10 points from me and is 9/10. This is the reason: as a standard horror film for the standard horror crowd that takes into account the action and fear and horror films. This will make you bored. In general, it's a family drama that is similar to what you see in your life. But put in the horror universe Hundreds of old stories and recipes If you are looking for originals in a plot structure or a minimum conflict, you will be disappointed. Get rid of zombies and you will have something like soulful like A Beautiful Mind, stumbling on a cheese. This is 6/10. <br /> <br /> However, the summary and basic concepts are quite good and original. It is something that you and your friends will be kidding when you are half drunk .. but that joke actually gets the drama. The idea was given 9/10 from me. The only reason it wasn't perfect was because they might take it further. But they can't. <br /> <br /> The combination of both is mixed. I think it's funny But for most comedies, it's not funny. I have my mother and my little sister watch with me and the jokes that we do about it are more fun than jokes at the script. But there was a time of pure boredom. <br /> <br /> I sincerely hope that other movies will have many risks and original ideas. I can't say it's perfect or close because of the lack of initiative in planning. <br /> <br /> Great family movie. Great movie to watch with a group of men (Or girls) movies that are great for watching with everyone .. but if you watch it alone, it's a bit boring Others always make this type of movie more fun and rich. <br /> <br /> 4/10
