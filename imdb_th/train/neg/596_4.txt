Basically, what we have here is more than creating an eerie classic horror movie in the '70s' 'Death Line' like this rock, and still filming some of the abandoned Aldwych subway stations. <br /> <br /> From now on, the disused Jubilee Line platform at Charing Cross, including Aldwych, as mentioned above, the film has the same story - the plot kills the raging zombies in the tunnel to hunt down those. The lost passenger at the last train could not get to the point. <br /> <br /> The real strength, lack of sadness, the blood from the poor to the flesh, unnecessarily while the sub-Gollum nutter did not fully explain. Will be smaller than the developed equipment. <br /> <br /> Franke Polente is slightly involved. Scripts more than tunnels and screams every time, often times, of course, that she is like everyone else in this movie, with small dogs and tame <br /> <br /> If creepy, the movie is located. On the London Underground is your pocket or you just want to play. "Catch the location of the subway" They will pick it up on the DVD when it hits the trash. If you are looking for a classic horror and dig a copy of Death Line (aka Raw Meat) <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good quality movie and write well, you have to change the train. ....
