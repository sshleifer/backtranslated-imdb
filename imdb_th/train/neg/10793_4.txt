I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival 2005. This film tries to tell the story of Tom and Barry Howe, a twin that was pulled out of their family by the organizers to Create a rock band <br /> /> Almost deliberately gimmicky, this movie is half smart. (If you forgive others) by combining the style and mood of the director (Which the previous film was a great documentary Lost In La Mancha) quickly lost their way I am not sure if I intend to be serious or not. The incident, the dream sequence, it is very little. In addition, the promised rock and roll song didn't move me. I thought of Hedwig and Angry Inch too. The movie that I found was original and moving. But in this case, the song is not good and is not a sympathetic main character. The more unpleasant comparison is the disappointing Goldmine Velvet.
