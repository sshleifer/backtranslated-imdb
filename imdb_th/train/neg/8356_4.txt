Peter Fonda has a strong determination as an actor who reads his lachrymose line, abolishes satire or humor in conversations. He traded thorns and thorns with Brock Shield, as if he were a wooden block. Even his smaller touch (Such as a finger that does not have a mustache on a gray face) does not reveal the character very much as an unsure actor directed by himself. In the Southwest circa 1950, the player was poor. (Not more than a little cheating) Winning a teenage Lolita orphan in an unsettled poker game. After receiving a gold treasure map that promises to be in the Grand Canyon Some lovely scenery and Henry Fonda, a strange pendant But interestingly, as the gritty canyon is just the only compensation in a weary comedy, both of them being traced to the killer cartoon map. She has no screen (And her unhealthy voice doesn't have any range) every time she gapes, tends to cringe or duck * 1/2 from ****
