After finishing the book the same day I watched the movie, I knew what should happen. I have high expectations of this film because of the ratings. The only reason I gave this movie 2 out of 10 stars is that it's okay to try to be a movie. I have a few main points that do not like this movie. <br /> <br /> ********** Spoiler ********** <br /> < br /> 1. The casting actor Jack Nicholson is almost incompatible with Jack Torrence's character. In addition, I will never choose Shelly Duvall for Wendy. I think Wendy is very different. I can see why they chose Jack Nicholson, even though the eyebrows were sharp. But he should not look at 'demons'. He should look normal and change evil. In addition, they are also one of the worst movie couples. Danny doesn't matter, he wants more life. He acts as a way to make money. <br /> <br /> 2 screenplays. They cut a lot of things in the books and add things. The things in the books that I have been waiting for in some movies may be deleted. Change or misuse Something in the book that I am looking forward to seeing. (The animal protects the hare, the mallet, the elevator) is not in the movie and it takes 2 and a half hours !! <br /> <br /> In the end, the ending was completely changed. Halorann died. Jack was so hard to die. Wendy never hurt ... The overlook was not the explosion. The Ending was cool. Books and movies made it terrible. I apalled Hallorann shouldn't die, but Jack killed him with an ax. If they want to kill him, at least Jack uses a hammer to beat the drum. You never even saw a hammer, drumming all over the movie. <br /> <br /> There are other things I don't like about this movie. Camera angels look cool, blood from the elevator. (Didn't happen in the book) was cool, but sometimes I was too frustrated that the movie didn't go with the book. I suggest reading the book before you watch this movie. I applaud Stephen King for agreeing to sign a contract to prevent Stanley Kubrick from terminating anymore. I won't do that. I'll use all the rights I can shout at him all day. I can't wait to see the 6 hour version. At least it has hedgehogs. <br /> <br /> Score: 2/10
