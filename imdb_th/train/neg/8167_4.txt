The Forest is not just a normal person in your daily life. But also an interesting combination of supernatural elements as well A story about two couples who climb in a camping camp. The cave, the homeless, the cannibal, and the ghosts of the deceased wife and two children soon make them afraid. There is something that you do not see in every director slasher. Don Jones has been "A" for the effort, although this film is at a low level, almost every level just showing the average, except for Jeanette Kelly, who is the show. Michael's dead wife (Michael Brody or Gary Kent) /> <br /> The film opens with a beautiful picture of the couple walking through the valley and into the forest. They know that it's too late for someone to follow them. Both of them were sent in general slasher fares. Our killers used hunting knives that were trusted throughout the film, except in the past, when he used saw blades, hurling hatches and rust saw blades to send his wife's lover. <br /> <br /> The forest has a good story. This movie doesn't work with it. I found it boring. 4/10
