Strange, less than 2 hours that can seem like a lifetime when sitting through a horizontal line that is not interesting. If the story is personal as it should be with Sally Potter, wouldn't you expect to show through her performance? Her performance was completely separated and I didn't feel the chemical reaction between Sally and Pablo and the tango scene, which was probably hot because the nature of the dance seemed awkward and painful. Obviously, revealing personal stories on film could be a scary story, and Sally Potter was smart enough to let the better performer perform the mission instead of letting her obsessions fall victim.
