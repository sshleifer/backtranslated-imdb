Happy with Mike Myers' previous work (Wayne World and Saturday Night Live) My expectations of a 60s sophistication are quite high. It became common after the first minute that it was an exercise to be as innocent and guilty as possible. I went out ten minutes I watched it for the second day for the second time to see if I wasn't fair or not for the first time. I closed it after ten minutes. I think it's hard to believe that even a twelve-year-old boy can find this joke. The conversation was a disturbing thing. Myers felt pain in watching. (Like Heather Graham) and the continuity of the characters, including Fat Bastard, makes matters worse. Apart from amusing titles and designs, the psychedelic scene is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I personally advise you to avoid this, like a plague, although many of my friends will enjoy it. (Maybe they may be blindfolded in time)
