If this movie is a joke, I'll give you 10 things. Where do I start? Say this - I've seen many horror horror movies already. But this makes the Troll 2 look like a freakin 'Saving Private Ryan, as if a group of porn makers decided to make horror movies, change their minds about production in the middle, and decide to make comedy. Everything about this movie is terrible: music scores (someone shoots people who write Yamaha keyboards), scripts, directors, movies, performances. There are no words to describe this. Oh, wait, yes. Yes. There: Holy $ *%!.
