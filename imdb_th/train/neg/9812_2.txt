Not only the story of the film was easily planned, both psychopaths were able to kidnap a pregnant woman without sweating. But it was a terrible tear of 'Misery'. However, the main reason I gave this film a low rating because it caused me to be bored. <br /> <br /> I'm not a person who is easily shocked by the things Make movies out and love horror always. Flicks, but this movie goes too far purely in terms of violence and torture, just to get points in shocking factors. <br /> <br /> I think person The majority view is just the first ten minutes of 'hide and seek' to find yourself a long way.
