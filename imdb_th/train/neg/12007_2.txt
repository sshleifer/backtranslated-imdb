It was wonderful to see how Nikhil Advani managed to attract people to the theater until the launch date. I mean ..... Look at the actors here. The promotion was great, good music and trailers Can use This made the house full on the first day. But when people go to see movies they know that there is no way to get a refund. The first full day movie will be released next week. <br /> <br /> This movie was inspired by 'Love Actually', which is what they say, not able to handle all the actors They try to wear big stars. But ended up not even managing to take the average performance of anyone The story is hollow and mysterious, so viewers can't connect to any one of them. It's a big disappointment for anyone who likes big stars or for Nikhil Advani after his great success in 'Kal Ho Na Ho'.
