No matter how happy I leapt when I saw the realistic blood shed. But when I put the DVD in anticipation of bloodshed and what I got was a blood (eyeball) scene at the end of the tail, supplemented by a fake. Chair, desk, I ended up thinking "That's 43 minutes of my life forever." I will not consider this "movie" Flower of Flesh and Blood as much as I can. To see if you can sit through them, the Flower of Flesh and Blood has a strong point to watch the devil's experiment. It's the best, stupid and the worst ... well ... really stupid. Maybe my expectations are too high. I think the DVD "Oh, this man is definitely sick" after watching them pretend a thousand girls. At times, I watched it quickly forward. <br /> <br /> Two people will be interested in this movie. 1) People who search for F movies to see if it's true. 2) The most complete horror movie. I searched for this and other Guinea Pig movies for the latter reason. But even if I fall into the category of the former, this film will not float my boat. As a matter of fact, I can imagine this movie increasing the sexual desire of the blood ... in "You have to kill B * TCH !!" Therefore, in summary, the only reason for this movie is for the purpose of accumulation. If you want to kill with no traditional horror, go to the Traces of Death. Sure, it's too bad. But at least you will get the blood and courage you expect. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can see for everyone who praises this shit is because they feel that they should do it. There is no artistic value that I can understand. There is no reason for bad behavior. It's just a weak attempt to be shocked.
