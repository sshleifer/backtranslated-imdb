Hammerhead is a mixture of mad scientists and shark killer types. In the casting, Jeffrey Combs plays the mad scientist who developed the hammerhead / human shark creature. In fact, his son, who has become this monster to prevent him Death from cancer or something. <br /> <br /> A group of friends are invited to a private island of scientists. They are used as bait for sharks or shark friends. For some reason unknown reasons, the IT department leader has been part of this team. Who knows why Fortunately, he became a skilled hero. If being a fat Ramboesque hero, I worked on the assumption that he learned how to deal with an assault rifle that was part of his daily work that worked to support the first line The normal day for this IT person should be related to fixing someone's network connection, followed by a call to shoot the gun offender. Or there may be a call to fix someone's PC that must determine the time between physical encounters and hybrids between sharks and humans However, he is amazing and saves all day. He is still a girl. <br /> <br /> Sharks - men are the creators of a little lame. But okay, I guess that judging the general effect in this movie And this movie went on quickly Of course, it's a complete hokum, but if you buy a movie called Hammerhead and expect it to be a complex drama about the emotional conflict that a man has become a killer fish living in the land, you really don't have to blame As it is, there is a female gore gun and maybe a helicopter exploded. It is garbage, but not as bad as some people may say
