I agree with the previous comments. The beginning of the movie is quite good and makes you lost. What will happen ....... Nothing. All open stories are still open. The two characters that seem to be important in the first place are completely separated from the picture, saving for 1 or 2 very short scenes. I'm lost. If Ilya wouldn't be better than leaving them all ... For the rest of the characters, there's nothing to do with her. She just visited a bad place and suddenly the movie was no longer about her. But about some elderly witches who spent time making dolls out of homemade vodka-drinking bread and blinking each other Some people may say that this movie shows that society is broken like the judge of IFFR, but for me it's just a bad taste, bad camera work, script, punch and horrible direction So I can't be as generous as my ancestors when receiving grades: 1!
