There is no word to describe how bad this week is. It was challenging the explanation. Something about computers that can turn personal objects into silver balls that are inserted into the victim's mouth, killing them or turning into zombies. All things are so hard that it's amazing. In addition, there is a girl with a personal computer in her room and the computer is talking through a hand puppet !!!!!!!! I didn't do this The computer also controls things like cars, even if nothing is connected to computers and vehicles. <br /> <br /> "Movies" are all trash. Fancy bad trash Impressive garbage that is unique. There are many sex scenes that have been thrown here and that is not hot or erotic. There is even one scene in which women seem to make love or want to kiss Tarantula, which makes me roll on the floor. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the worst movies ever made. Go up there with a terrifying video straight to the house or BOOGEYMAN II (both weekend nights and BOOGEYMAN II has a scene with a toothbrush killed! At least it's fun to watch and try to understand what is happening.
