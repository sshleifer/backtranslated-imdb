LIVE A LITTLE, LOVE A LITTLE is one of the most bizarre movies of Elvis slapstick, part of the surreal part and strange Elvis meets a girl outside of rhythm with annoying sounds. She looks like Jennifer Aniston. The story is not as reasonable as in most of the Elvis Presley movies and there are many strange characters. But there is something I like, even if no one can remember The strange continuity Elvis and Michelle Carey enter the beach house at night. But a few minutes later, what was the delivery of children? What is the essence of the movie? Oh, two good things about the movie: A) Elvis looks good and B) The dog stole the show.
