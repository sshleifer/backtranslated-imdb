This movie is terrible. I have a very difficult time watching this thing all the way. I do not understand the purpose of the movie. What is the point of this movie? Bad soundtrack, poor performances and unimpressive stories The two main characters in this movie are very boring and their conversation is not interesting. There is no chemistry in the cast members. I don't know this But I think most actors are first This film can be cut down for about an hour and a half without losing the plot. That shows that there are many useless scenes in the movie. I will have a root canal. Haha. During the two hours of the movie. I want two hours back! If you want to watch good comedy movies that are family friendly and created by the Mormons, see Napoleon Dynamite
