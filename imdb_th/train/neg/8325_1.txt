I just saw this movie last night and as a person with very low expectations in the beginning, still disappointed. The most glaring error in this movie is the main issue. (Men who wake up during surgery) have nothing to do with the results. It will end in the same way, regardless of What is this point? Who knows. In addition, this surgeon has 4 sets of malpractice against him and he doesn't think people will ask questions if the patient dies on the table Let me take a break. Jessica Alba is completely incompetent and Christian is almost bad. The whole story is laughable from beginning to end. I'm pretty sure that if you feel that someone has a scalpel with a scalpel, you will be more painful.
