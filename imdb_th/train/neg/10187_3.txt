Unconsciously stupid about the jet that gathered within a few hours by a mechanic who had never worked on an airplane (driven by Burgess Meredith), chased a Porsche race car which ran on a decades-old gasoline sediment. Can McGyver spare parts as a radio receiver that can receive all frequencies at the same time and who knows how to receive and use chemicals to cause high explosions in a peaceful society Is mentally retarded The great loss of Burgess Meredith, but at least Chris Makepeace may be forgiven for saying that this is just his second film.
