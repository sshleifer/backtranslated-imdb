About half way, I know I don't care about these characters at least. However, I look a bit more already. Unfortunately I returned the next day and finished it. I shouldn't pay attention. <br /> <br /> If you know anything about this movie before, you know that the lead character will be a survivor of a plane crash - and the name gives a good idea about what Will happen after that - he will receive a phone call and call people about it! That is almost as bad as "Snakes on a Plane" (a terrible flight again causing disaster). <br /> <br /> I know that this is an old movie and the style of acting that day was not more natural. today But even though those standards are, the show is embarrassing. Not all of these characters are stereotypes. I wonder if this movie is Bette Davis' endeavor rather than helping her husband's career (Gary Merrill). However, there is no benefit - I've seen the oak tree show more true emotions than he did. <br /> <br /> Davis SA 'play disabled people who are happy (Such as a role that is not luxurious) may seem frustrating and brave. Moving career is not boring. She is Tiny Tim. In this movie, Trask (Merrill's character) sees the truth about love and forgiveness. (Although she is less charming than Tiny Tim), but she has good intelligence about life and relationships. Just died. <br /> <br /> The last scene at Trask calls his wife in Iowa to reconcile, get affected and act on both sides of the phone line. I'm almost cringed. I have to remind myself that these people have received. The real reward from what they did in this movie <br /> <br /> I noticed that a lot of people seemed to be happy with this movie. If you find it elevated, it's great. But frankly, I just found it bad. There are many old movies from the Golden Age of Hollywood written and performed much better.
