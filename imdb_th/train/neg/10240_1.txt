I love all kinds of movies, especially horror movies. Survival doesn't depend on any hype around. <br /> <br /> I can't give any points to the initiative. There is nothing wrong with exploring the same theme or creating things that others do. It just turned out to be a police movie for an indie movie that will take us bravely in the wild, a mad killer, and recently threw some crazy family. In those lines, I have to compare with the likes of Texas Chainsaw, Wrong Turn (although the twist in that game is clear) and others. Survival decreased compared to comparison movies. The plot is not original in any way. Some movies can be passed with a weak plot. (And doing too much) by showing special fx layers or other factors. Survivors do not participate in this matter If you want to observe the following things: The movie's performance has never been removed. I didn't blame or blame the actor for that matter or the director. The conversation is the best at the medium level and the related actors never show their ability to pull it out. I'm talking about 2 standouts. The lead man in this movie has a definite look. But I seriously thought that he had to consider additional training before he was ready to perform the movie. The actor shows that Greg has the potential, but we never saw it. (Watch the movie to see why you don't believe it ..) <br /> <br /> The movie looks grainy. Oh yeah, the little story of the creation of a magic movie designed to lead us into the glorious era of the movie "Grindhouse" in today's movie creation that has become a mechanism. Is it usable? In this case, it doesn't work. There are many other defects that occur, so it distracts from movies, not additions. As I said, I think they do well to increase that grain. That is good quality rice I think with different scripts, better directions and possible actors, they should try "Grindhouse" again. They might pull out. <br /> <br /> As far as in terms of technology in My idea Should receive better care with sound (Seems to be entered directly into the camera But there is nothing wrong with that) and for shooting in DV it's too soft for my taste. <br /> <br /> That's all I have to say about that .....
