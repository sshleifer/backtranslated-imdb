Another horror movie in which a teenager is crazy about fighting crazy people and his supernatural close friends who want to take over! Yes, but the fact that this one comes from Canada gives a slightly different feeling. "Brain" has a teenage problem. Jim Majelewski receives treatment with leaders becoming cult leaders, assisted by "ugly" brains. large Can Jim stop him? I guess that because our northern neighbors have done everything successfully, they have the right to create at least one ridiculous horror movie. But even then, they may want to be known for the care of national health and all. <br /> <br /> The bad guy has a brain. Why can't people who make this movie?
