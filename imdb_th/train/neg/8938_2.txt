I still can't believe how bad this movie is. If I am not a masseuse, do I not know how to survive from watching? It seems that the price is about $ 1,000 to do, but not the money brought down. The show was terrible, not just the 3rd grade students who could read the line better. Secondly, other reasons to watch this type of film are skin and that is a huge flick. We're not going to look chic, more attractive than in movies. <br /> <br /> Ah, better luck next time, right?
