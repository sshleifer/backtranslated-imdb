Some people may mock, but actually there is a real art about making movies that are not particularly good. This thing is not to be missed in all aspects. <br /> <br /> Young people - women with stable breasts and a naturally wet t-shirt - go to the movie "Blood Surfing" and end up. Running into the 31st crocodile. <br /> <br /> Not only is it obviously fake. But some of the props [Notice that the boat hit a particular coral reef] It looks like they came out of the lightning! <br /> <br /> Not good from beginning to end. Don't see it!
