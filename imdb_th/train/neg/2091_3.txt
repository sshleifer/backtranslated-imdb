I remember watching a BSG pilot. I can definitely explain that night. I remember what I was sitting in a magic acting chair. It lives I enjoy the first two years of BSG. I enjoy some parts of the third year and I watch every episode of the fourth year with full hope that it will change. That's ok. <br /> <br /> I watched the pilot, Capricorn and attracted There is hope for good things here. Then I started to watch the normal episode and they became more and more tired. <br /> <br /> It's too clear, too predictable. It reminds me of the dignified political correctness of his last failed performance. Virtuality <br /> <br /> Most of his work on the DS9 is good. When he focused on BSG systematically, it was good This is especially true at the beginning when they follow the episodes of the episodes set by the first BSG series when they left there after meeting with Admiral Adam and Crow and Pegasus. Into the pot It's as if he had written the rest of the list without knowing where he was going. <br /> <br /> Maybe it will be better. Maybe it was only the first weak episode. But i am very worried
