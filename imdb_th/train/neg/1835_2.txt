Start with the script I see cartoons that are deeper than "jealous". Every character will repeat what you have seen and not funny. For the first time, the movie is in deep trouble which is "jealous". Somewhere to go with Here, of course, we have movies that go wrong. Christopher Walken, in particular, wants to forget this bomb because his character is very weak. Ben Stiller is in a cute black comedian like "Flirting With Disaster" and "Duplex". Immediately thinking about making sure "jealous" is not a black comedy. There is no double meaning, it is all nonsense. "Envy" deserves a low score because it seems like it is foul. - MERK
