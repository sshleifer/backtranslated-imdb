Oh, brother ... After hearing this nonsense story for many years, I can think of it as the old Peggy Lee song. <br /> <br /> "That's all there, right?" .. I was only the first teenager when this smoked fish crashed into the United States. I was too young to go to the cinema. (Although I sneaked into "Goodbye Columbus"), then screened the movie at the local film museum, beckoned - finally I was able to watch this movie, except now that I'm very old like my parents when they schlepped <br /> <br /> The only reason this movie is not Condemning an anonymous time because of an obscenity lawsuit caused by the release of the United States Millions of people flock to this smelly person, thinking that they are going to watch sex movies ... but they have a lot of close people, Swedish people who are disgusting, street interviews in department stores. Interesting who-cares sex scenes that are simulated with saggy actors, pale <br /> <br /> cultural icons, holy grail, historical artifacts .. No matter what this is, tear it, burn it, Then containing ashes Bring a box! <br /> <br /> Great estate continues to scrape the worth of haunting the boring political revolution. But if it's not a censorship scandal, then it will be overlooked and forgotten. <br /> <br /, instead, "I Am Blank, Blank", the name repeatedly repeated endlessly for many years is a titilation For porn movies (I'm curious, Lavender - for gay movies, I Am Curious, Black - for movies blaxploitation, etc ..) and every ten years or more, what happens from death will be seen by a new generation of shoots that want to see "Naughty sex movies" that "r the evolution of the movie industry" ... <br /> <br /> Yes. Avoid the epidemic .. or if you have to watch - rent a video and forward it to the "dirty" part just for To come with. <br /> <br />
