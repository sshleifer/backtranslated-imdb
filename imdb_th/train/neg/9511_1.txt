I want to watch this movie since it was first advertised on TV. I went to Tinsel to see it last night at 7:40. I regret the day I lost the ticket to this trash when I saw something better. The starting point is the sex group and the garbage group. They exaggerate how love works in reality. Every girl is stereo. The boyfriend is too stupid for his age. The gas that passed by pregnant women still couldn't laugh. Bank robbery is completely boring with the gags used in other movies. Their getaway car is the old Chevy van that they claim to have no breaks. Hey, why don't they get a beautiful car with theft instead? It may help stimulate the audience's opinion about the movie. The film is very low, low, low, low, low budget, because nothing in it has been damaged or destroyed. This movie has a lot of content in it that will push the Christian people crazy. Hey, I still expect to have a chase scene because every movie that robbed a bank has a chase. But I never had So I rate this movie. B, which stands for low budget and 1 in ten stars.
