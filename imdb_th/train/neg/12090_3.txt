Although I can see the potential for redeeming in this film in an attractive way. But I think that the nature that has long been painful in the way that the scene structure is too much to ask the majority of the audience "Your father died today" The mother's comments made it even more difficult to try to understand these characters. <br /> <br /> This was the first win in Cannes in 2001. Is a shocking consideration Perhaps the French people may be starving for the Noir movie that year and feel hopeless about something cruel when the film is born. I understand the long scene is a device that makes the audience feel as uncomfortable as possible. But when paired with the inability to relate to the main character, it is too far for me and keeps me away from the whole story. <br /> <br> This is the movie for the most dedicated fans and is People who expect to be dissatisfied when watching this movie I love movies like "Trainspotting" or "Requiem for a Dream" - which is more disturbing But at least makes the audience have something in the way of fixing and pacing When wanting to see a slow and painful teacher, the silent scene after the scene began to be redundant until I found it boring - and I wanted to like this movie every time.
