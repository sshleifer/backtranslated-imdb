I watched it last night and one thing that didn't make it so bad was straight forward. There is no hitting around the bush that this child is an Anti-Christ. However, this film is not good enough. For example, they never explained that they made the dentist an "accident" or at the end that the police had just ended miraculously at home in time to help children without being called by the police Death scenes are terrible and not fun at all. The children they choose to play Anti-Christ are boring and they can choose a better child. Don't just waste your time watching this stuff.
