Becky Harris plays the unfortunate female shopper who has to stay in the shop at the wrong time and clearly the only purpose in this film is to give reasons for wearing a remote control. ! Miss Harris seems to be in the age of fifty or more when she first comes here. When the red-haired thugs do with her, it is clear that this is not the AARP queen. If these are not the best possessions that have ever appeared in celluloid, I need someone to take me into my mind and me. Wearing a VHS, mimicking her charm I want to know if this movie is available to play on DVD. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie is not worth mentioning. I hope to see something credible and intelligent. But I was disappointed with both God Bless Becky Harris!
