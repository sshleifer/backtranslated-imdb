"Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned" is the third part of Gabriel Knight, an adventure game about paranormal writer / detective Gabriel Knight. Gabriel and Grace, his colleagues, have been Pleading with Prince James Albany to investigate several mysterious attacks called When the son of Prince James is kidnapped, Gabriel follows the visitor to Rennes le Château at night, where he begins to combine puzzles related to the Holy Grail. <br /> <br /> Even though this game is not About vampires. Vampires are a token in the game. But never controlled the center stage, like voodoo in the "sin of father" or werewolf in "beast" Gabriel and Grace did not try to reveal the true nature of vampires or research the myths about vampires Although the vampire killed three people during the competition But their victims will be randomly selected and not involved in the main plot. <br /> <br /> The majority of the charm of the first two Gabriel Knight periods are in the relationship Gabriel formed. With the villain Through these relationships, players cannot help. But sympathetic to the villain and causing the villain to become less human and monster However, in "Blood of the Sacred", Gabriel's only interaction with the villain is through a wonderful interview that does nothing to make the villain and the villain. <br /> <br /> Role Where Gabriel and Grace play In this mystery is quite useless Gabriel spends his time spying on the identity of the members of the treasure hunters who come to stay at his hotel. But what he discovered was more than a red herring Grace spent the time researching the mystery of Rennes le Château, but all her research was useless by having a suspicious ally who knew the answer to this mystery for centuries. <br /> <br /> Action Of this confusion His allies and the opposite pole --- the vampire leader --- can't help. The Alliance issued a hint about the mystery of Rennes Le Chateau in the daytime and expected to receive favor. (Not other treasure hunters from the tour group) to find them However, he may reveal the mystery to Grace completely on Day 1 instead of taking the kidnapped child at risk for another 48 hours, and in the end he just says that it is a complete mystery. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the vampire leaders failed to reach the goal of many centuries of planning because he chose to refrain from action for two days after that. Kidnapping The only reason he decided to delay the action was that he wanted to taste his victory. <br /> <br /> The game will be better if it is focused on the holy grail. Should abduct kidnappers and vampires instead of competing with the Vatican to find the mystery of Rennes Le Chateau Since Gabriel reluctantly portrayed more than once as a Catholic, this conflict will have many opportunities for character development. <br /> <br /> All the games are disappointing in the Tim Curry series.
