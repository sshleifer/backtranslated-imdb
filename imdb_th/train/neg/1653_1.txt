It seems strange that people read this script and think "This is funny! I mean, it's very funny to do! "Who is this person? Is he or she really responsible for this? Are they people who owe me more time than my director / writer? <br /> <br /> This movie is involved in every way possible. There is no one good conversation and not a favorite character ... It seems almost comparable to Shakespearen. <br /> <br /> The ending is filled with scenes that take several minutes and still doesn't take. 80 minutes. The scene includes actors who laugh at the 'hilarious' mistakes they make and the things that are wrong in the 'funny' scene. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie is a joke. Nothing. It just happens. It's a really weak thing. I love movies that are terrible. They are good. This is terrible ... something, but I don't know anything and hope to never know About the movie Wannabe, but that means a little. <br /> <br /> Avoid all costs.
