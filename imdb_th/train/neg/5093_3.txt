I just went to the Russian forum of a TV channel that showed this movie. Hmm ... 99 percent of enthusiastic Russian audiences are disappointed. We want to see the true facts of our space success in this film. But in the author's heart there is something else ... :( We are a big and beautiful country with wise people living here. We are proud of all our space dreams. True success in one hand in this field and In science So I want to ask the author: Where is our LUNOHOD and where is our MIR station? Ah, I'm pretty sure LUNOHOD events happen faster. Armstrong's "Walk on the Moon" And scientific errors - I don't have enough time and space here!
