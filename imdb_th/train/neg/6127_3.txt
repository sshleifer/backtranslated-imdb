Since I am from Hungary, I hear many people talking about better and better things about gvegtigris, but actually I don't understand the reason for all the difficulties. <br /> <br /> I like many movies. Some words really encouraged me, but the characters that were fixed came back to appear again, like in all Hungarian movies, and the story was boring as well. I like the first half But after that I became bored and I found that this movie is just boring. <br /> <br /> Rudolf PÃ©ter is also good. Reviczky is also great ... do nothing. <br /> < br /> How long does it take to get the GOOD Hungarian movie ???
