This review is based on the Shock-o-Rama video published in an inappropriate world in 2002. How bad is it? It's terrible, which is what '1' shows at the IMDb level - but it's much worse. It's good to imagine that typing German manuscripts may help to make matters better - funny English dubbing is not a joke - but in truth this is one of the worst amateur movies. In any genre. Zombies in this movie are slow and clumsy as before, and it seems that they don't have the ability to speak or think anything other than the next meal. However, they are still smart enough to use electric saws and are dangerous enough to know that Western sexual taboos will no doubt make their table conversations smooth. The land of George Romero's death formed a zombie nation that still maintains social unity. Here, zombies are nothing more than a blank canvas for the brutal imagination of director Andreas Schnaas, without having to exchange social values, and worse, being completely out of entertainment. For anyone who loses money with it
