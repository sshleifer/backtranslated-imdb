Ursula Andres's naked body is one of those things that make you believe in God. Two women (Especially those who play as housewives) also have great bodies as well Then why the higher grades I can give to movies with the quality and quantity of nude pictures, just 3 out of 10? Because to go to Ursula's unbelievable body, we have to sit and watch movies that are not fun and boring. (Remember, I watched the full version of 101 minutes, not the American, 78 minutes, which might cut a lot of external material) according to Italian tradition - general jokes. Most characters are caricatures. (Freaky army, "Latin lover", fixed drunk, innocent housewife) that is not funny, just overacted. Last word: see this thing, but take your finger to the fast forward button, you will need it. (*)
