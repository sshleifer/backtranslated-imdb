Yes, even as a fan of programs such as survivors and followers, this list is quite bad. I'm not interested in the first couple of performances. But then realized how pathetic everyone would go to perform in the first place. Alex and Aaron's comedy show that men have bad names when they cheat or throw away choices. In the first opportunity, it really didn't look good for the show. <br /> <br /> Ryan, you can have Trista. She has the most annoying voice I have heard on television and she is not the smartest woman around. this (Understand the media a lot, but I wonder if there are many more) <br /> <br /> I didn't really watch any performances since apart from the new screenings on the daytime TV. I think the important point of reality TV is the practice of being "Trash for entertainment" looks like something you can laugh and don't have to think too much (I don't watch CSI. It's like reality TV, tired and old-fashioned. But you have to think too much while watching)> <br /> A few ideas for some reason that happened in the list. At first, the woman told everyone that "A woman like Amy (With many classes about her) commented that she had tried every scene known in bars and clubs to meet a man and it didn't happen for her Hey Amy, how to join the club, get a hobby, work, charity, change your job, a job that you meet more men, all I know is going to the bar is not the perfect place to meet with future partners. < br /> <br /> Amy and many other girls seem to be obsessed with the idea of ​​meeting "Perfect man" Clues to women: He has no identity. However, there are many great men who may make your husband big. Some may be right for you! They may not receive six numbers per year or JFK's junior version, but they are all great people. The shallowness of women on this list is unbelievable. I am still a teenager, therefore believing that women will gradually grow from their shallowness when they grow up and become more realistic about their future partners. This show proves otherwise. <br /> <br /> Overall, this show has many things to confirm that the image of women looking at men in society. It's a very bad item and I think all of these programs should stop. The best dating list by country miles is Blind Date and The Fifth Wheel because they are fun. There is nothing that is handled between "lovers" rather than going out for a night out. The bachelor's degree takes itself sadly too seriously.
