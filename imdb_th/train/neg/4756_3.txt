The movie remake of the 1972 film The Great Show of Caine's stage performance as his character from the first film. <br /> <br /> The performances that were not performed by the actors, Law and Caine, diluted more in their own direction. <br /> <br /> The warmth of The traditional setting was abandoned for modern home settings. The deep relationship between Oliver and Ken, which made the first film watched, was replaced by the horrific arrogance that immediately mocked. But this is not the ingenuity, thought and passion of one character that the original characters are well supported. This is the assassination of the obvious OTT characters of both characters from the word go. > <br /> This version of Sleuth doesn't look worth watching. Watch the original movie and be dazzled by the opening scene.
