In my eyes, this is a perfect example of Hollywood's ego. But was hit by a new King Kong movie Superman is a true superhero and deserves to be treated with respect, even if he wears stockings. Brandon Ruth is the worst superman I've ever seen at the beginning of the movie. You just want to. Will take a rock of cripple down to the neck, he looks stupid, just wearing a dress But about him, Kate Bosworth is a bad choice for floating channels. But in this movie, she looks more like a student. The story is weak and predictable. (Wow, actually he is the son of Superman, who used to think ....) and the performance was horrible. This movie has one thing that is good for this movie and its name is Kevin Spacey. His description of Lex Luthor is excellent. Still, he was unable to record this movie. What this movie needs is the performance of "lois and clark" (except for Kevin Spacey's course) and other subjects. I watched this movie after watching "The hill has eyes" and I was forced to know that there are movies that are worse.
