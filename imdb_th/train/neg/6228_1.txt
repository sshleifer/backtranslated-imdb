This movie is so poor that I can't understand it. It started with a random explosion several times, then cut into the T-Rex puppet that talks about (!) To the audience. It went back and forth between the sock puppet and the animation. Can buy live actors I will give you a boring plot and not stop to show this pathetic movie for 85 minutes. <br /> <br /> One of my friends found a very rare video at a hobby store. Some where Type the movie b and he buys it for the purpose of making fun. But it turns out that our intervention is not necessary This movie makes it fun for ourselves better than we can. <br /> <br /> Edwood's I think "Plan 9 from outside the world" is the most charming movie in existence. He, if you watch this movie everywhere, buy it without hesitation. It's rare and worth the many laughs.
