This movie is not normal. It's not worth watching to make it fun. Professor Madman is just plain annoying. Even suppressing the unbelief that will allow it to be invisible (Which I am a good filmmaker) and allow the foolish victims of the horror movie, this movie is more requested If you are looking for a shower scene in the women's locker room and random sexual encounters, get porn. If you are looking for a bad movie, find something else. If you want to waste time with annoying bad movies, rent this thing.
