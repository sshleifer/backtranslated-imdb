The first (and only) I saw "Shades" was during the Sneakpreview. It wasn't in the premiere. I remember having the staff of the directors there. Don't remember anyone. It's a Belgian movie. We have never heard of it. So we are quite neutral. Don't know what to expect. Mickey Rourke is a great actor and he stands several miles away. He acted as an actor who starred for a long time. He helped to realize the movie in Belgium "Shades". <br /> <br /> As soon as the movie began, we noticed how much swearing was there. Nothing with the occasional swearing However, this is an annoying way. Whenever Rourke uses F *** to show something, it will be natural. However, when someone comes from an actor who speaks non-English, use F **** or S ***. It will become arrogant and aggressive. <br /> <br /> We quickly disappear that they How many times have you used F and S? Everyone is glad to leave the cinema. And we have to give a rating But it's hard for us because it's just from 0 to 10 and we're looking for -10
