Live broadcast is quite funny. But people who say this like watching SNL's short skit is a rather stupid person. It's not like SNL. It's just nonsense. <br /> <br /> Andy Samberg tried to act like Jon Heder but failed. Jon Heder is a funny person in Napoleon Dynamite. Andy tries hard and people think he's funny. <br /> <br /> Only funny people in the movie are Danny McBride and Bill Hader. The only funny thing about Andy is the pool. <br /> <br /> They should make "Quiet place" is a lot better. If they don't make the scene fall down 3 minutes, <br /> <br /> The part that he pronounced H more than was stalled. They tried it for too long, and half the time it seemed that Andy was laughing as he acted ... He was a scary actor and didn't deserve to get a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is Funny and suitable for people with a simple mind that has the brain of a 10-year-old comedian, about half of the United States.
