I think Laurel and Hardy are worse, better, no laurel and hardy, but it's hardly sad that the Fox movie is a big movie released on DVD. People who are not familiar with L&H and their worst things than the classic comedy <br /> <br /> Again, the boys have to regret. With a romantic dumb story about a man who invented an invisible ray He falls in love with the daughter of the chief who hates him and likes a slim man. It's incredible to think that Genius at Fox thinks this is what L&H wants in their movies. <br /> <br /> Without having to make pancakes, the kids look tired and old. The only scene that worked for them in this picture was when they tried to sneak out of the bedroom window at night and the rather bizarre scene that Robert Mitchum was a classic noir. br /> <br /> Otherwise, this script will not be a mess. Forget this and see if you can find a copy of "A Chump at Oxford" or "Bohemian Girl" or "Sons of the Desert" instead.
