1. The 3-D good news is very well done and they do not play at the gotcha gimmicks. This movie is based on the true story of the highest point in human history and also one of the true participants in that story: Buzz Aldrin <br /> <br /> And now the meat of the story: It's about flies for krissakes! Flew with a large human eye that is a real googy but still can fly Remember when I compared the movie "Underworld" with rats and cockroaches? That is not intended to be a praise, and I never dreamed that anyone would truly receive it. Does this person have less sympathy for the child worm? U. In one strange combination of the Hollywood group, this idea is evident on the drawing board at the same time as "Space Chimps", which involves critters in space. <br /> <br / > Rent "Apollo 13" movies with 9 stories about REAL space (RIP)
