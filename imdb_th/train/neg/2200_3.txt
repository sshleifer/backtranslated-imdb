I love shark movies that are bad. I really do. I laugh like crazy at them. And the sci-fi channel is having their marathon, which is the highest point of their new original image. Hammerhead: The crazy shark from this example looks like it will be a lot of fun. Basically it was the creation of benchley creatures. It was actually launched by showing shark attacks 3: megalodon, which is the best shark movie. I'm in the mood; I am ready to bring it to use hammerhead-mad-Scientist-man! Oh, God, that's the movie that's wrong. <br /> <br /> Wrong. Wrong. <br /> <br /> Sick, sad. <br /> <br /> This is the worst theoretical repetition. my friend When a girl with a sickness was pulled out of the animation that was hung and tied to the table, she screamed out because of a cross between a shark and a human in her womb. That's what I call a disturbance. <br /> <br /> That's how the plot works: hmmm thinks mad scientists. My son died of cancer. But I brought him back to life by combining his DNA with the hammerhead shark because the shark doesn't allow cancer. Oh, look! Is the perfect amphibian! I created the next evolution of the human race! I know that! Let him repeat! But unfortunately, if those shark genes didn't make my son blood thirsty Instead of raping a hot baby, I sent it to his little forest paradise. He continued to eat him, but try it! Among the random ones that had a major uncertainty ended on the island, my research was the woman my son was engaged before he died! I bet he will do her! All this leads to an impressive and heartfelt reunion: Young woman: Are you going to keep me moist? The mad scientist: No, he is. (Indicates the shark who hijacked in the tank) Sweetness <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie ever.
