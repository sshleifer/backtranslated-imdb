This shows that it is part of the 59th Edinburgh International Festival, though for the best reason for the remaining power. It seems to be true that it is the first Thai film made with actors and Thai teams. But directed by Westerners No need to pay attention to be honest because this movie is boring, boring and boring. Why must something be wrapped up in a mystery? Why is it called a thorough feeling when you can smash the point back home with a dubious voice, a noticeable image of a spurrier lamenting endlessly? No hints, no need to guess it all up on the screen, no need to use our imagination. Wondering when a bit 'scary' is coming? No, you never make music composed with intimidation and intensifying. I make words to explain how bad it is. Wondering whether the demon demon is real or imaginary? Why tax yourself - is it really a snake and yes, it bites his target and has blood spilled everywhere It's a strange and uncomfortable movie for many reasons. It should be a horror movie. But it's not scary - shaking with signs & clear. It may be a seedier offensive attack in Thailand, but the director has a slippery and smooth style when showing young teens. Perhaps it might cast itself as a pure Westerner who planted the seeds of doubt in my head. Or may be just pants Those who do not receive requests are not boring, repetitive and ineffective - all applicants will receive the best explanation. But boring and most appropriate It has been seen before. It may be better to have more ideas, less imagination, or flames. Sorry. Give a thumbs up every time. Truly dire
