Nothing can help this movie. Even Superman <br /> <br /> Ten years ago, amazing special effects. Better governance may cause better feelings and performances from actors. But nothing except to give food, the script to the dragon may be solved, the plot hole, the bad line, the horrible walk, the repeat of the CGI dragon image repeatedly in the hall ... eh <br / > <br /> Avoid this at all times. <br /> <br />
