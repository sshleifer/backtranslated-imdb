I sincerely consider this film as a bad attempt for the Dominican film industry. The first 30 minutes of the movie were a little funny. But when they change their roles in society (Men do things that women often do. Became boring and not funny at all They leave things without explanation and the end of this movie is predictable. I don't like the way Roberto Angel plays his role and his little ones. I went to the cinema, hoping to get a good job. But I'm really disappointed. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie.
