Okay, if you've seen The Ring, you'll see The Grudge. It's trying to be scary by just having a surprising camera job and loud sound. But it failed miserably PTSD If you can call it weak and full of holes, for example, how does the care center know that Yoko doesn't appear to work when people living in the house don't exist And it is unclear what Bill Pullman's character relates to He just came out of nowhere to plan. It doesn't make sense what happened to the traditional family. Who was hanging in the little boy's room or father? And Yoko lives or dies when he finds that the care center meets her. There are too many unanswered questions and I'm bored to think about it more.
