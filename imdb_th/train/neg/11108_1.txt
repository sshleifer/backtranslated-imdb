Where to start The movie started out quite well, but after 30 minutes I caught myself watching the clock. The horror at the beginning of this film is good. But then the story began to come. It was just stunned and stupid. Over time, <br /> <br /> The performers gave the average performance in this film, but I got a little bored with Vinny Jones, which shocked the movie <br /> <br /> When this movie is dragged and using my words, it is dragged. It can pull more. <br /> *** Spoiler alert *** Spoiler Alert *** Spoiler Alert *** Signings, I think this film will not deteriorate to the point, if the load is a monster skeleton. Which is not reasonable It turned out to be a meat-eating cult and the good people eventually died. In fact, the ending makes me laugh how bad it is. When Vinny Jones's leading role became a new killer, <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, Creep looks like the best horror movie ever. The work is quite good. But even though she couldn't help the wreck of this train, the movie !!
