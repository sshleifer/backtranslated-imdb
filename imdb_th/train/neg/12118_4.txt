In 1972, after his wife left to follow her own path, Elvis Presley began dating Linda Thompson, Miss Thompson, a beautiful beauty queen with long, cute hair. And elegance was created to fill the emptiness of Elvis' life When Elvis's divorce became final, Linda became a fan of the actors and legendary travelers until 1976. <br /> <br /> This is an image that looks amazing Love and friendly Linda fully cares for the needs and desires of her lover. And even quit using his swallowing pills by handing and introducing her to her love affair with Valium Sometimes this movie is cruel and gloomy. Looks not very interesting at 'King' and his queen. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is terrifying like Elvis. The expression of the handle is not interesting. Stephanie Simbalist lacks Linda's level. But works well The supporting actors include: John Crawford, Ruta Lee and Rick Lenz. Watching these two times is more than enough for me. But don't let this comment stop you from checking for most Elvis fans that I consulted with. This is not a favorite presentation.
