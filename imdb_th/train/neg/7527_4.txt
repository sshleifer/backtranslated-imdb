There are many stupid moments in the 'Tower of Death' / 'Game of Death 2' that you suspect is tricked or not. Sometimes it feels like I'm watching the sequels of Kung Pow more than Bruce Lee movies. <br /> <br /> In truth, this movie has everyone buzzing about 'Game of Death' if What is it? It is the sequel / re-creation of 'Enter the Dragon' that combines many elements of this film - especially the true picture. Billy Lee's character (obviously) examines the sudden death of a friend. His and found This part of the film is left with the man's daughter. When the body was stolen during the funeral (!), Billy was killed and it was up to his spoiled brother to avenge the deaths of both men. <br /> <br /> Dao Tong Long in As brother Bobby Lo Special ability to carry movies His fighting ability is very good. Apparently Bruce Lee turned around with a deleted picture. (Not anymore) in exchange for heritage Overall, the modified image is better in 'Game of Death', but it doesn't stop the film from being messy. <br /> <br /> Ok, so the fight is really fun (I dare say incredible). And can make the movie at least look But there are many daft elements in this film that will test your patience First of all, there is a villain who lives in his luxurious land ... or does that mental institution? Seriously One expects that someone will take him back to his room. <br /> <br /> Actually, the middle part is terrible and when the scene is involved Naked, hooker and lion set came to me off it However, I finished this movie and I'm glad I did it because the ending scenes (like 'GOD') are all reasons to watch. While the story is embarrassing, the action is very good and has a great choreography. <br /> <br /> But even the ending is disappointing if the place is something to do. What we have been told is 'Tower of Death' is an upside down and underground pagoda. This sounds great, like Bruce Lee's original idea of ​​having different fighting styles at different levels. Is this probably the 'game of death' that was originally planned? No! This film should be called "The birthplace of death" because that is the way the tower progresses Of course, there are one or two different forms ... with the words covered with foil, henchmen, leopards, skin and stupid monks, as if Enter the Dragon had never done before with a plot that mimicked Poor <br /> <br /> Worth to see once for a quick fight scene. But sometimes it hurts If this was intended, then However, thumbs up for creating a new projector room scene from 'Enter The Dragon'.
