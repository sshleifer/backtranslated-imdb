I've never seen anything scary for a while now. This film is boring, long and scary. Special effects suck like hell - it's like watching a movie back in 1999. It wasted half an hour. The performance of Matthew Settle is quite bad. I saw him in the Band of Brothers playing Lt.Speirs. He wasn't that bad. In fact, not bad at all. But in this film, his performance is not convincing enough. It's quite bad and doesn't have any chemistry between the other crew. In addition, his eyes are empty. It really surprised me because he was good at Band of Brothers. <br /> <br /> However, I didn't have to watch this movie. It's a big big loss. Even if you have to kill one or two hours, do something other than watching this movie. Believe me, you will be sorry!
