I find it very difficult to watch this story after the first 5 minutes of the movie. I handled the stomach 45-50 minutes before closing it in disgust and watching the Monster House instead (which was fun). <br /> <br /> The story has a big hole in it. The plot line is highly mentioned and tedious. The performance is very bad, especially from Justin TImberlake, which should stick to what he did very well. (Looks crazy and sings like an actor) Morgan Freeman looks incredibly uncomfortable, especially when dancing around to listen to rock music without reason. Clearly halfway through the movie after him and Timberlake Meet Freeman's and Timberlake's characters seem to have a parent-child relationship or something that doesn't appear clearly beyond the fact that; Although Freeman's character seems to be nothing but insulting the foolish and stupid people of Timberlake But he never stops, every time helping him to find something completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Unbelievably stopping to believe in any story that is devoid of The essence and being blown away from every proportion. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie.
