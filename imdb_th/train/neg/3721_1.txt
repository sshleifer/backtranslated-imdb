Two movies are useful in making people afraid of God and 'Event Horizon'. One has other important and painful messages, one dimension as a religious film. Terrible. Paul Anderson went to the cursed Resident Evil movie. He had something really happening. <br /> <br /> Night robbers were thwarted by many outstanding independent film features. It's clear that the film's intention is from the beginning. The Christian film industry does not learn from the failure of this story, so we are stuck with The Omega Code, Left Behind and other Tribulation films. Their basic element is that they are very concerned about selling their messages. He: "Be saved!" Everything will become the second story that will make the audience stunned by the head. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can't believe it. Me to write about this movie. Skip it all and go back to Sam Neil gouging his eye out 1 out of 5
