The sad and sad thing is the revenge of Munster Munsters being brought back for the last time (Fred Gywnne received a large salary to return to the role of Herman Munster) in the movie that was created for the TV about the movie's double simulation. Grandpa and Herman who are robots The city to prepare for the robbery of the mummies of the exhibit When the police caught the heel of the television icon, the elderly both tried to find out who was behind the crime to clear their name. We saw them dressed in drag as a waitress. (Being the highest point in the movie) Grandpa became a bat with two wires attached (Once even flying to Transylvania and Herman, whatever the "annoying" phantom, constantly singing and breaking glass sausages! The most sad thing is hard to identify: It is at Gywnne (especially) and Al Lewis looks pale in every scene and doesn't care about the material. It is a hokey set of robots with production values ​​that schools look about. he Maybe it's a ridiculous script. Sid Caesar is the most funny. Or maybe it will see something that makes me happy and a lovely memory like a child who has been treated to K-Mart's top fashion makeup. In any case, the results are disappointing. And stupid even with the standard of monsters For the remaining actors, Yvonne De Carlo has the most empty role. (Although showing more disparity for women during the time and experience) KC Martell makes Eddie Munster a respectable person. Jo McDonell is an attractive Marilyn. Bob Hastings is a phantom that has already been seen and done and spoken in a manner. The most ridiculous This film gives a true feeling, even with movies created for TV.
