This honorable game (dis) is the first game I have stopped playing in the middle and feels like a bit wonderful and burning. Congratulations FIRST and LAST Tomb Raider. I will definitely play. I assure you. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: Just typing the words makes me laugh. No character development. Finally we have a young woman who can take care of herself, which is not * beeping * mary-sue, but unfortunately she is dressed like a slut and her breast is very big. They have to attract sex gamers that you see. What she did was go into the grave after the grave shot things as she walked. Why do you do this? I have no idea. I have subtitles and tv as loud as I can, and I still don't understand what is offensive, development (or lack of) for you, her two friends and * villains * laughs. Must do without having to say anything about what you need to do next, and you will be in a monotonous tomb like hell for hours trying to figure out what you are supposed to do. There is one course (from two) by Whereby her motorcycle (Believe me, it's not fun) that you will join to get one hour without a safe point. This means that you are affected by the driver and others in the van firing at you or you hit the tree where you started the journey for more than one hour. <br /> <br /> Boss Stupid F * ck: You know how to make levels There is no floor, no record points, no stories, no character development, no variety of games, there are most songs at the longest level, ears bleed and do not give any suggestions to players so they can last a long time. up In place instead of going to a plot that doesn't exist. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck One: Those sounds sound like ideas. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck Two: I agree that those who want to develop characters, plan or play games that don't require Bond. <br /> <br /> Todd: I'm sorry, but these ideas seem to make them worse. < br /> <br /> Boss Stupid F * ck: Shut up Todd, you are fired. <br /> <br /> Playing the game: What you do is shoot. Of course, she can flip while SHOOTING jumps while SHOOTING or kick again. SHOOTING But jumping, jumping and kicking does not erase the fact that she's finally doing is SHOOTING bored !!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!! Music: Intro music is very beautiful. I like to listen to it. The music in the game changes from patience to wanting to cut your ears. <br /> <br /> Picture: Considering this game created in 2006, I expect That the picture will blow me away. I'm good, but definitely not in a good way. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: This game doesn't have a plot, no messy character development with unmarried young women. body (Thank you very much) that led by a boring tomb for some people. Boring reason (Things that may not be possible that I can't tell you) by playing a strange shooting game Stay away from this B.S !!!!!!!! It received two stars for having women who are not young women in distress. (Regardless of how she wears and covers) and the beauty of music
