I've seen bad movies in my time But it really requires biscuits! Why, oh, why does this movie happen? Nothing here Please trust in you, flick the switch off and destroy the copy of this movie. There is a plot ... which may take about 5 minutes to show on the camera. This is an important issue. 'Based on the real story' (mmm ... whatever), in any way, will make yourself hit for 80 minutes, so we have to sit and watch people walking around for hours In the first half of half an hour, nothing happened except watching someone walking to the store ... and 3 people walked through the forest. This time may take time to develop the character ... but not so there is no connection with the people on the screen, so when they start being shot, we don't care less! In fact, I am in the final step in baddie certification so that the movie will end! Above all, the operation of the camera is great! The director / editor / writer / producer of this Ti West is rubbish. I hate to hit men. But actually his job is pants! These monotonous close-ups continued and then the singles followed other people while walking. They walked - I'm sure he thought he was smart. But the results are boring. I just want to stop the film. The way this guy was directed to the next film of the cabin will be beyond me! In order for the performance to end, it was horrible, which was the result of the film as a whole. Keep your consciousness clear from all garbage piles!
