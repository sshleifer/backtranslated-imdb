I may not be the biggest Blair Witch fan. But still admiring the effort, so I look forward to changing, especially after reading the superlatives that have been thrown out in IMDb's comments "unique", "smart", "futurism" and Others ... You have to wonder what people will think about bad efforts. <br /> <br /> Because alas, change is A bad and weak movie that fails to respect every aspect of folly is not a joke. Horror and blood are not terrible. And anything that "thinks", something that the poor who see in this movie is caused by severe delusions because there is nothing profound or wise about it. <br /> <br /> OK at least Can it bear it? Is the experience worthwhile? Unfortunately there is no For starting to receive very bad performances It is not a stretch that most B movies today feature better performances, featuring? Boring and messy dialog? Many amateurs do better. <br /> <br /> It's the direction that unlocks the mystery. I did not expect the significant improvement of the Blair Witch, but at least stepped forward. Our director seems to be getting worse over time without ignoring the previous experience. <br /> <br /> If there are significant shortcomings in Altered, it's the main scene. The main part of this story takes place in the only place where the main character is detained. But Sánchez failed to give any personality to any place, considering that in the Blair witch forest there was an important role and character. (If you are an enemy) Like three students, you think that the director must be aware of this same thing here, but not ... There is no personality here, thanks to the sloppy direction and not paying attention to details. > <br /> There's nothing to help here. The big fan of "Blair Witch" is better than following Daniel Myrick. Although his results are far from gold, it shows a better structure than Sánchez and some lessons. Absolutely The Blair Witch was applied (unfortunately, in a weak but still).
