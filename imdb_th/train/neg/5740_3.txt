I found darkness that is too dark. It has cool ideas and ambitious ideas, not a bad action scene and a great time that will make you go UGH! But it is the beginning of confusion You don't really know what happened in the dark scene, and for movies shot in Super 8 Film, you already have nasty tablets. Like Nathan Schiff's movie, it's too much. Director Leif Jonker seems to want to create an original movie. But he lacks the knowledge to do The camera never points to the correct, lacking basic factors such as how to shoot simple conversation scenes and how to damage the movie as well. But even though these are negative, the music is good. But the blood is abundant and there are from stupid putty to really good electrical appliances Is this a classic as it says? Is it worth the praise for both sheets? NO, but it's a good first attempt. Now if these people stop themselves at the back about this movie (From what I understand here is the only thing they have done) for a while and try again
