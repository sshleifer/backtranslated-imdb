This is Jane Eyre's worst modification I've ever seen. Not sure if the screenwriter had ever read Bronte's book? George C. Scott was ridiculous and failed like Rochester - when not just an angry performance, Susannah York had an old hairstyle. Most of the 1970s that I had seen in Victorian movies The characters rarely speak to each other, so the happy seer in this book is the basis for a deep and well-rounded love. The ending is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Please rent a model Timothy Dalton instead. It's true with the book. It's like the novel reads aloud for you. Dalton is excellent as Rochester G. C. Scott can laugh.
