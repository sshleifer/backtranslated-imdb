For my life, I cannot understand the blindness and dedication to this unbelievable movie ... ... and I think I have the qualities to say so .... I am a military unit. Special in the past with 14 years in "Lifestyle" ... This film is not entirely true and written by people who do very little research about life in the army in combat or on the team or at the military level. <br /> <br /> Sa The EOD trouncing around Bagdad yourself ????? Get real ... no command line ????? Get real ... EOD is cleaning the building ??? Get Real .... EOD / Military Intelligence / Sniper Sergeant Qualified Sergeant ???? Get real .... Wait, I shoot and kill the bad guys and let the two men take me without another shot or injury ???? Actually .... I caught an Iraqi civilian while I was armed with only 9 million raids into another civilian house. His wife was ruined and returned to camp by walking in the middle of Baghdad at night without Must be as much as scratch or confrontation ???? Get real ... <br /> <br /> There is no adherence to the military protocol {army} and there is no similarity to the military units that I have ever met. Not entirely convincing and disrespectful to EOD's men and women who are against this poor movie. It's not an adrenaline that is searching for yahoos, but highly qualified professionals work incredibly hard.
