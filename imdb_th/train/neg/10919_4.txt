Bollywood fans would rather hold Mard of Amitabh Bachan at a high level, but I think it is very overrated. Manmohan Desai teamed up earlier in the movie, such as Suhaag, Parvarish, Amar Akbar Anthony, Naseeb, Desh Premee and Coolie and I can. Saw them all I liked so I had very high expectations before I watched Mard and bitterly disappointed My main feeling about Mard is that it feels like Amar Akbar Anthony. Episode 2 Maybe Mr Desai has no idea after he has used that formula for many years. 1. First, some members of the actors are repeated. From AAA, for example, a police inspector who brought Amar, a Muslim who brought Akbar Up Barunu, Puri and a few others. 2. In AAA Nirupa Roy lost her vision in Mard. She lost her voice. 3 In AAA, there are famous songs (Shirdi wale sai baba) In Mard, we have Amitabh singing Maa Sherawali. When he saw more than 1,000 AAAs, I noticed immediately. <br /> <br /> The rest of me was some ridiculous situation. Manmohan Desai at It truly makes your brain like being in the house, but with Mard, I think he's gone too far. The last thing I caught was compared to the song in the movie Manmohan Desai. In the past, I found the song quite disappointing. I know that there are many fans who swear. But I don't like it at all In fact, it allowed me to write this review because I was a big fan and liked his movie since childhood.
