This movie is like "The Disney Channel after Dark". Bring language and theme. "Not a naughty story" goes out, and you will be left with a conversation device and plot that insults the intelligence of anyone who doesn't explain "Saved by the Bell" as a quality television. Such conversations are boring and dirty. Anyone who thinks that the screenplay is the result of Aaron Locke spelling and Joester Haas in a room with instructions to create a collection of scripts that don't Good for each chapter If that was the intention of Roger Kumble, the mission was successful.
