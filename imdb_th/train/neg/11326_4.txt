This film is one of the fantasy movies. postapocalyptic that Albert Pyun created in 1993 and is a bad movie Obviously all his energy went into "Nemesis", which is a non-stop action movie and paying attention to a much higher price. "Knight" is clunky and wonderful. Sci-fi below the barrel is often too similar to video games. (New opponents appear all the time and must be eliminated as soon as possible) The only thing that helps this film from the trash can be Kathy Long; Not particularly attractive women But cannot deny that it is a mercilessly powerful fighting machine For Chris Christopherson, considering his age at that time (58), I hope his partner will receive good compensation (* 2/1).
