For those who have little time in their hands, I will quickly summarize in one word ... Poor. There are many good examples of why this film is very suitable under that description. So much that you can barely pass the screen for 2 minutes without seeing anything stupid and pointless, forcing you Want a completely naked woman in the first 10 minutes? You already understand! The reason she appears is useless, even though it sets the tone for the rest of the children and youths. You almost glimpse into the delusions of the 12-year-old boy who wrote this junk. Just watch this shit that they expect the public to pay for! <br /> <br /> I've watched the movie. Many franchises over the years, but American Pie; Beta House must be one of the worst offenders when you consider that despite the average appearance of the original movie. More than a thousand times more fun than a wreck. <br /> <br /> The story is predictable and sometimes you feel like you're watching a school drama. What happened in this movie was unrealistic to stop believing to watch it. (We're talking about a break from Star Wars, just like you have to convince yourself. Jar Jar is true. <br /> <br /> The story is paper-thin, and most of the events are there to show. Another pair of breasts or another set of pathetic jokes There is no acting ability to speak out. What you will receive is a number of cute boys trying to make us laugh. And how they fail !!!! Gag every time it is flat, and the only thing I laugh about is the way that the social ignorance that dramatists seem to be. How do you explain the cow? They try to pass on the story. <br /> <br /> They pass every opportunity to do something worthwhile and fun in favor of bad writing. The characters will have to complete the required amount before they are accepted as members of the Beta House, but most will be managed by a short set of montages that indicate that they are working to finish it. But we see very little evidence actually. It is a very lazy way of telling stories. Also missed the opportunity to be funny in doing so. (Imagine that the Wizard of Oz, where all important events take place outside the screen instead of that, and what we see is Dorothy, giving the scarecrow high every time and saying "Of course, it's a great adventure that we Just come back. ") Lazy, lazy, lazy !!!! <br /> <br /> Female characters have little or nothing to say. What they do is naked without a clear reason and use as a visual props through movies. Most of the braindeads that seek T&A will not be disappointed. But for this reason only makes you shame If you buy this in a DVD format, you will be involved in the collapse of the society in your own special way. congratulations
