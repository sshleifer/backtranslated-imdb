Most of the scenes should be cut off. There are many scenes that should be cut off. For example, the scene in which the hunter states that "I got a spider on the dick", "I like the dick", playing in the mud scene or the bar scene where the main event, a professional hunter is a snake killer. <br /> <br >> How about a continuous scene like Other scary that there is a woman, Diane, who wants to release her innocence to a boyfriend who walks like he wears three small women panties too. While they made love, they didn't realize that they were doing next to the little boy who would run away and loosen his head. Why do they do in the living room I mean, his head really flipped. Then the beach scene is reminiscent of Steven Spielberg's jaw scene at Grant Lake. All of these strange scenes can be easily dubbed and billed as a joke. <br /> <br /> Here in the local town of I'm a cinema. The cinema has advertised for months about Dinocroc and I'm glad I didn't watch. Because later I found that it was shown only 1 or 2 days before it was canceled This movie is terrible. I wonder if Dinocroc is not a good movie that looks like it has a Dinocroc leg that looks like a child wearing a green pajamas and sandals with claws and walking up and down like 2 years old. Easy as Baby Geniuses <br /> <br /> If any student who makes a movie wants to learn what to do Like Diane's girlfriend who walked like he had advanced syphilis, you wondered what this poor girl looked at in a drunken man before he drank beer. When this happens, who cares about Dinocroc. The pants look even more interesting than all Dinocroc's movies. His performance is terrible. He has a much better role for Mr. Bean. Moving to ROWAN ATKINSON. This is a funny guy. Better in sci-fi horror movies. Perhaps the worst casting in the history of Hollywood.
