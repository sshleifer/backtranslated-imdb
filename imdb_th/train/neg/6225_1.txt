I wonder if this will be a cult movie. I love Gram Parsons to make sure and I don't expect much from this movie and get less. Things that are intelligent and moving are camps. It has no music that makes Gram and has more fillers than cheap dog food. There is no background about gram or colorful people of that era. Characters that are not familiar to me, even as Gram's fans and all versions of "Adventure after death" that I have heard Rock and roll is full of good tales as well. But one should also take salt They can be a wonderful story even if exaggerated. However, this movie takes a good story and becomes a rag, stealing any corpse and the consequences should not be boring. But they make it boring I was tempted to steal all copies of the Grand Theft Parsons. Head to the desert and burn them all.
