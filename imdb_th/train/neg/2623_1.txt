Sly Stallone is hardly the best actor in the world. But when compared to his brother Frank ... Okay, then get these awards! I have Mullet muppet. Frank seems to think that every part he plays calls him to act as an American / Italian Wise-guy refugee from 'Godfather'. 'He can refuse.' The film shows the place, despite the scandal. Frank still steals the reputation of the show. Everyone compensated for their lack of talent by shouting their lines and throwing their arms about the fiercest style of patrol that went out of fashion back with silent movies. Plot what is available is There is no feeling like a meteorite land, and every woman turns into a sexual nymph. But it is a 15-certificate movie which means that they undress in their underwear Finally, I was not sure if I would have died long before the movie ended. <br /> <br /> Avoid this, such as epidemics and see 'Deep Impact' for movies that are sensible about. <br /> <br /> NB Order point: When a woman brings a strip down to her underwear, she has pants / underwear under her garter / belt. Pants that are hung over the chest strap to allow women to go to the bathroom with less daze Maybe a little issue But shows how stupid this movie is when they can't do this!
