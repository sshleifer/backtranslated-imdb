First of all, I saw this movie when I was 7 years old at Christian Scholl that I joined. Needless to say that I was scared of my heart. Not because it's scary But because the content is ... I am 7 years old, but the movie is terrible and the performance is wonderful It's terrible when considering that I'm just 7 years old and I can remember. One thing that still haunts me is the scary music. "I hope we are all ready" that the singer ends with "... You are left behind" I do not recommend watching this. I may be just for nostalgic reasons. Also, I'm sure the remake is much better. Although the best part of this movie must be when everyone "disappears"; Empty cars banged, lawnmowers work by themselves ... pretty hilarious
