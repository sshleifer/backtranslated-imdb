Joan Winfield (ditzy Rich) is a cunning man, Bette Davis, who is engaged to marry a fool Allen Brice. (Jack Carson was lost) Her father (Eugene Palette) was determined to stop the marriage and let her pilot be kidnapped by Steve Collins (James Cagney. Serious). The ground in the desert and hating each other but (sighing) began to fall in love visit But they are known for drama, not a joke and this movie shows why! The script is very scary - there's no real laughter in all movies. The joke that is happening this time has Cagney and Davis falling first in the cactus. (This is three times!) There are only their important talents that will save them from complete shame. They both do the best with punchy material. Cagney tries his best with his role, and Davis screams at full power. But it didn't work. Carson had this "hell thing" look on his face throughout the movie. (Probably because his character changed mood in a few seconds) only the Palette with his distinctive voice and the highest reading range to stimulate a few smiles But all this is boring and without laughter This is just two stars for Cagney and Davis performances and beautiful movies. But actually it's not worth seeing Cagney and Davis hate this movie in the coming years and you'll see why
