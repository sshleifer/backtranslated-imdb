As far as I can tell you, although previous comments posted by other reviewers, this movie is currently available on DVD. I found it a few weeks ago. <br /> <br /> It's on the DVD price tag and I paid a total of 98 cents plus taxes for it. I found it at the store, 98 percent amid shelves, plastic bowls and disposable chopsticks. Now you are not the one who peeled off the beau coup for a super-duper model. Imported Swedish limited edition feels like you have? I think so. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth 98 cents, 99 cents. I might start arguing with you. But obviously worth 98 cents and remember that talking about getting what you pay for For slasher mavens movies only
