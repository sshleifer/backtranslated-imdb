Before I started letting me say that my experience in this film might be influenced by copying, which I compiled from other opinions, as the original is considered inferior by some people. Therefore, it may be possible that the new subtitle or DVD version will make a difference. I haven't read the relevant books. I am familiar with other Japanese manga only and may lack the cultural context. <br /> <br /> A little bit of potential spoiler ahead. <br /> <br /> I always like science fiction stories that are written. Dark Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, etc.) but I didn't enjoy this movie. While it started mildly interesting, it became boring when it finished only half way. Have all kinds of problems Starting from the most violent thing: character dialogue seems to be unable to complete the sentence. If they didn't shout the name for the nth time, they would say one word. ("Kanedaaa!", "Tetsuoooo!", "Huh?", "Grrr" etc.) This makes most of the characters underdeveloped and completely two-dimensional. It doesn't help anything that many people spend a few minutes on the screen, with nothing interesting to say that it will develop them away from the map. Proposed by the image. <br /> <br / > Roar is filled with random, pseudo-randomness. The philosophy that sounds vague and undesirable, even according to Star Trek standards, is nothing deep and meaningful here - it seems that everyone is randomly blurred. Various parts and sci-fi ideas of stock without any links. <br /> <br /> No more than an excuse to start a long, continuous scene that consists of scenes of Increased physical assault and destruction Not that there is anything wrong with physical harm and destruction. But in this case you will find yourself asking "What is the purpose of it all and for how long until it ends?" The character development in the last 30 minutes consists of a little Tetsuo that transforms into Pizza the Hutt without clear reason. <br /> <br /> The ending is similar to the picture in 2001 - a strange image that is far away. From editing or explaining anything, let the viewer feel that he is looking at the kaleidoscope for two hours. I'm sure some people will claim that this kind of art is But for me, it's just using imagination and colors that are highly acceptable. (Some songs are quite interesting as well) It's a pity that it's stylish and without content. <br /> <br /> Bored with Disney? Want to watch animated movies that deal with "adult" themes. Wise or not I am sorry to say that you are likely to find those things in "South Park".
