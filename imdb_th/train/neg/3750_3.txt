Finally, I had to watch Lynch's experiment. After a long wait .... and unfortunately it wasn't worth it! Even the dead Lynch fans, I found it really boring .... <br /> <br /> Nothing happens. There is a long, long-lasting pain that has nothing to happen. Speaking and all things ended with the audience not knowing or interested in what it was about, what happened before and what happened. After that <br /> <br /> Mulholland Drive - Girls Blonde and brown hair are very Diane and Rita-esque and the Lost Highway period with allusion to important events <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's not very interesting and boring, nothing happens. It's very memorable and I think I will remove it from my computer and forget. So I used to see it. Sorry, David!
