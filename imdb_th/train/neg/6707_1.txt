Please make me forget please. Please. This is the worst movie I have ever encountered in bad luck. I think that this movie is insulting my brain, just like my back, both of them suffering from sitting and watching this movie. I have not seen the damage caused by vision and the ability to complete the sentence. This lot of garbage !! And don't let me start acting ... someone help me too !! "Strange Science" - Back! Everything is forgiven ... <br /> <br /> I'm "proud" to make this movie the first movie here at IMDb ... and I voted for hundreds of movies ... Many of them c ** but this is terrible. I can't believe it. Has anyone really thought of the idea and thought it should be worth a movie? Has anyone read the script and decided to make a movie? Has anyone read the script and selected it? People have seen this movie and decided not to put on the shelf to collect dust for eternity. * These are the questions I need to answer. It's not a philosophical question about trees in the forest, and well, you know ...
