I missed the movie for the first 10 minutes but didn't think that watching from the beginning would make a difference. I found this movie extremely boring and disappointed with the performance. I remember Patrick Swayze and other actors (such as Roy Marsden) have a prominent role. But they were disappointed here because of the very weak script "Kind Solomon's Mines" ... The short part of the movie in "Mining" is as exciting as watching the paint dry and I suspect that even pre-school children. Learning will be spelled by watching the battle of the "warriors". The whole film is reminiscent of a television series produced in America for me. Indiana Jones every day!
