Oh dear me! There is rarely a movie "horror" that makes me bored or makes me laugh as much as this movie. After a lively beginning with interesting evidence, it is no more than a fervent slap with supernatural help. Alice Krige is often wasted in this and twisting the plot funny Don't worry until you're really hopeless. Score: 3/10
