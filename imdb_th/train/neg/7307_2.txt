This may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The events that occurred in it were completely random and unreasonable. The fact that there is a sequel is very perplexing. I may come down with the case of fever in the cabin. (I'm very sorry) I explained that it was a mistake that was smooshed to the newspaper because it seems to be a different part of things mixed together, like Kevin. And then there is a strange police and a little unusual behavior, then addiction Suddenly, the main character is having sex with his girlfriend's friend just because she says something stupid about the plane down. Then, at the end, the racial discrimination of a good old family followed by using a rabbit and Kevin Karate. It's really disgusting that they can use racism as a joke in this movie. There is no reason everyone will enjoy this movie unless you love Eli Roth, although it doesn't make me like this movie. Hate is a strong word. But seeing that is the only word I allow to use, it must be done BOYCOTT CABIN Fever 2 !!!!!
