When I first picked up this movie, I was fascinated by the basic idea and was eager to see what would happen. I am a fan of animation and like when it integrates with live action videos. However, the animation in this movie is something I like. Although having to say that the actor's performance is excellent Visible look - including animation - gives the air an amazing surprise. However, this is the quality of the uneasiness that disappears among the overblown images, both in the image and in the script that you are actually crushed. The most annoying thing about this is the lack of importance of the plot. It seems that such a plot would be stabbed by him at irregular intervals, causing stuttering that deviates from the mass flow of parts. The voice from Felisberto - especially the ending - feels like a great effort to fill the loophole in the plot that has been overlooked on the side, such as the whole ant. Correctly corrected) I'm afraid that all parts will come to the best as 'Reasonable first attempt' by teenagers who spend too much time reading DH Lawrence is not what you expect from an experienced filmmaker.
