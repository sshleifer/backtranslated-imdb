Let's face it; Some lame children who have died and their spirits turn into a scarecrow No need to happen. Neva! OMFG A stupid loser boy who can't stand up for himself, gets his donkey donated to him by a drunkard bitch who is drunk. As soon as he died, he looked up at the scarecrow and he let his soul into the scarecrow. The drunken man obscures his death by making himself seem to commit suicide and thinks he has gone with it. After that, we saw that he was thrown out of the trailer and later received a confrontation with the scarecrow again. They met briefly, including a drunken man who called him a loser and a scarecrow that reflected back too. The scarecrow splashes out of the building, calling him "Father-o" and then cutting the poor head. We can see how this great movie will be revealed. He went to kill many people after that. He mostly kills people who make him have a hard time in rl and go out to kill random ass people. Some people just to laugh. Don't laugh here He added a pearl to kill every time as well. Every time he kills someone, he will make a karate flip and finish it with his unique finisher. In the case of people who are hard to hear, he will say "Here there is corn ears!" Then push the ass up. Or we can take samples from movies! He just killed the police and was about to kill one person who stood up for him. Her sheriff's father shouted to the madman to stop and he said "Hey, wait a minute!" And throw a dagger to throw his chest and stick him on the tree. At the end of the movie, he kills two men and throws in Punchline "must separate!" And kill the two men by pushing the sickle into their heads. Maybe the next time this guy makes a movie, it won't be gay.
