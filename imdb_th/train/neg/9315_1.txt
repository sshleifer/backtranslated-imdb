This movie is terrible! It's terrible! It is scary! I can't stress it enough! Acting, directing stories, characters and everything about it is terrible! It's repetitive and repetitive. Don't be fooled by cover or tagline. "The Texas massacre" has nothing to laugh at. "You are fooling me! It's ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The first 2 minutes of this movie is good until it reaches the main character. Brendan is now closed. What I received from the movie was a group of ugly, annoying and underage people who went to the jungle hut and the clowns who sang the nursery rhymes to kill them in the wrong way This movie wasted my time and money and it was a waste of your time and money too! I went ahead quickly through most movies because it was terrible. I just wanted to see how each actor died and it wasn't worth it! Just looking at the cover is a waste of time. This is the worst movie seriously! Rating: Not deserved, either
