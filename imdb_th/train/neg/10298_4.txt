Lynne Ramsey created an image that can be captured and Samantha Morton is able to call his feelings. So dragging to discover their talents has wasted now. <br /> <br /> Ramsey can't make Callar live. Her efforts are too cold and tilted. Her camera echoes the quiet image of a woman suffering repeatedly over and over, as though Morton's gaze alone was able to create a character in the empty Warholian hell of self-release: for a movie. With a few minutes to trap insects that crawl on the floor But what to do if she doesn't speak? Without the interior of the celluloid novel Morvern Callar, no one doubts that Ramsey has Morton, often undressing. <br /> <br /> Saying that the first ten minutes are very impressive. Give this movie a lot: Know how to make a contract if you don't do it.
