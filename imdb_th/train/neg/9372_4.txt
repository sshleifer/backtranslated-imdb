This is a Universal Horror flick. General line: It is based on academic principles if numbers with cookie cutter plotters and excessive heavy usage. The most interesting part of the film is the casting of Rondo Hatton, a man with bone disease as "Monster" of the movie. It's sad to see that this man took advantage. But he may use the money they pay him. Hatton is less frightening than the studio he hoped for because I tend to feel pity over fear or even hate. Martin Kosol is currently being a crazy artist of the movie and he enjoys this part a lot. I'm happy to see Koslack in everything. For some reason, this guy makes me fun. Another part of the movie that entertained me is the ridiculous movie in the art world. Here we will show the evil art critic who is happy in the ability to destroy artists; This is side by side with the male "hero" of this film, which is the "artist" who draw ... get this ... pin up girls. Anyway, the work of our hero has been examined alongside the statue. The absanous absurdist of the villan is the nasty critics' head of the movie, which at one point claimed that he insulted the art of the hero because "That woman does not exist" in which our heroine responds confidently. Finally, there is a small story about the heroine. (Who is a critic of his own art) is the story of a leading man .... resist the feminist and completely ridiculous Overall, this movie is a rather moderate image and has some fun elements.
