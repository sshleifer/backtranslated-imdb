Hate it. If you believe that everyone in the South is a fool, wrong, morally foolish, violent, religious, or child abuse, this movie may be right for you. Everyone is poor and ignorant. In one scene, two old men were talking at a general store and another said that he had molested his sister before they tied the shoes. The man looked proud of his actions and another man saw that it was normal for his life. Very good. A teenage girl walked down the road behind to find her sister and no one offered to help her - Despite having a limp and lack of food or water clearly (No backpack, etc.) Strathairn's characters are not only disgusting and slimy. But also shows that he is a religious believer who is a model of Hollywood One scene in this film is reminiscent of the late episode of Cape Fear (the scene with DeNiro) - a Bible verse spewing out by a bad man. I came from the Great Northwest, but found that the film was disgusting because of my wonderful people Know who comes from NC, WV, AL, MS, KY, TN, etc.
