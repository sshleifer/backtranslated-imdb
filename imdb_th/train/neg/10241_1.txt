This is a horribly low budget that can't be understood. <br /> <br /> I don't have a word to say that it's bad, boring, boring, confusing and strange. Just this effort (Hey, what? I know I do ....) Set in a post-apocalyptic America, some people find it on the beach and kill and ensuing chaos - it's all incomprehensible. I can't make its head or tail. > <br /> This Lamphun picks up How to seriously overcome me: It's really bad. <br /> <br /> And it's not that bad. It's a good way. <br /> <br /> It's terrible, terrible, terrible. <br /> <br /> Truly, if you still don't believe me, try with the intention to love it and come back here and tell me what you think. Even acidic gerbils can't help but understand this. <br /> <br /> Better avoid or destroy ...
