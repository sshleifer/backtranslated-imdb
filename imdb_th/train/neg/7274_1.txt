"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is simply said, the worst movie ever created beyond even the "9 from space" plan that is ineffective. "<br /> <br /> Lamphun story film Each of the three parts should be a spoof of an ordinary movie type. But each person landed on our feet with a disgusting voice There is no rhyme or reason for these nasty short articles and no visible stories. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers on this site wrote that the best point of this film is the real nude scene. Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry do a little bit of meat and are good too. But the director doesn't seem to realize that even T&A needs a good story around There is nothing here. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the worst thing in the three groups is the last group with Robby Benson and Richard Widmark. Here, we see that Benson is an ardent young cop that is paired with oldtimer Cynical, played by Widmark and only for a moment, those of us who are still watching this nasty cinematic exercise were inspired by the idea that we are about to see the story of redemption How about the police, the ideal woman brings the police, but no such luck. As we have already said, this movie has no ransom. It's disgusting to the end - the long stretches that should be on the screen. Obviously, the filmmakers know that they have bad things to happen and want to make the least.
