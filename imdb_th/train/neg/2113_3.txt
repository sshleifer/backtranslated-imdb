The bride is dying at the altar and their bodies are about to disappear. No one knows why or who But investigative journalists (Luna Walters) noted that each bride wore a strange orchid and she interviewed Dr. Laurence (Belaluko), the creator of the episode, Dr. Lawrence is a mad scientist with strange habits, including sleeping in a coffin and injecting his elderly wife (Elizabeth Russell) with the fluids of a young bride for her children. <br /> <br /> Corpse Vanishes corpse, interesting evidence and a short, boring time. Unfortunately, when it started quite well, it started to drag before the midpoint and was quite boring with the old ideas and predictable plot. <br /> <br /> There is something good about it. - Bela Lugosi has charm and evil and performs brilliantly; Elizabeth Russell is also a beautiful, gentle and eerie lady. And I am always a fan of Angelo Rossitto. Luana Walters is also credited as a journalist here. <br /> <br /> It still retains the Gothic atmosphere and the scene is quite good. <br /> <br /> But overall, it doesn't manage. Hold my attention through the overview and so that I must give a bad rating.
