A skilled performer could not raise this issue regularly by the secretary who was killed by her wedding lover. In fact, there are more questions than answers on love and murder. And since we have been notified by the prosecutor only, there is no answer to these questions. This is the type of fare that is attracted to the club "He Woman, Man Hater" of America, as presented. It is the story of an innocent woman who just happened to "sink" in love with a high-profile wedding lawyer. Is it possible that if she had not had time with her male friend twice and had a relationship with a married man, all nasty and disgusting murders could be avoided? When you look at this, don't worry about going to the refrigerator, you won't miss anything.
