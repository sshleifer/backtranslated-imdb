This is a television movie. This movie begins like the episode of 'Xena ...' with a dialogue or a description of the characters that are meaningless. It will get a little more for a moment. But all the characters are still cartoons. <br /> <br /> Salma is an exotic beauty. Richard Harris is a wicked and sexually rebellious Frollo demon that will capture beans in Salma. Other characters, including Quasimodo, are quite forgotten. <br /> <br /> Frollo is an ideological inhibitor. Of enlightenment, like the abbot in the 'Name of the Rose' and Quasimodo is the champion of freedom The shadow of the character Quas was overlooked, even though he poured the liquid on people. He is the only outsider that he looks different and enjoys playing with bells more than the average person. <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie is suitable for children, but I suspect it because of Frollo falling blood thirsty for Fix his monkey craving Most are uninteresting and recognizable. But not scary and sometimes entertaining the action of the story
