This film is about escorting a man who is involved in the investigation of the murder that occurred in the power of the man's wife. <br /> <br /> I think "The Walker" is exciting and charming The pacing is painful and slow, almost bloody, even after a 40-minute movie. Nothing happens. Seriously, the first hour may be a total of ten minutes. How slow is it? <br /> <br /> The fact that it lacks excitement or action scenes is even more boring. Almost as shocking as even the controversial scenes are simple and emotionless. Maybe because of the stiff upper lip of the higher social class? <br /> <br /> It's sad that "The Walker" became boring even though it was a strong actor. Blame it on the plot that is not good and even walking back and forth worse
