Ever watched a movie that made the plot? Now it doesn't have anything to start with. <br /> <br /> Where will you start? The boring scene of our heroine sits around the house without feeling dangerous or even the foreboding created even during continuous thunderstorms. (Which is not actually heard in the wonderful double glazing)? Obviously, a house that is only a few miles from the city But went out for many hours (?) Or the third girl who had no purpose for the plot, except the murder of blood, full of blood, surprisingly fast Or even the beginning, which shows killing more than 20 times throughout the area, even though it is clear that the killer never went far from home? Or a strange ritual with salt and pepper, which is the sum of most movies without direction. <br /> <br /> Add a lead actor who can't do it. But at least willing to do all unrelated things The naked shower scene and this video are truly nasty. <br /> <br /> Let the following things be banned in the UK in the 1980s (mostly because of the surprisingly last murder). There is nothing but value. Curiosity and murder 'classic daft' (don't worry - telegram for at least ten minutes before) <br /> <br /> After walking into the forest, our prey arrives steep The slope is clear, which they fight. Half way through, they saw the body on top in a black dress and wielding a large buffalo. What do they do? Scroll down and run like the rest of us? Of course not - they fight for the highest point and stand comfortably and set up in front of the murder weapon. <br /> <br /> It's just the movie they say ..
