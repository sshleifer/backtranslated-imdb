See this thing with my girlfriend after stumbling while being channeling. <br /> <br /> I guess we both hope to have a cute Christmas movie for a happy family. But very disappointed Or when he was pleasantly surprised with the woman he loved, he was horrible Actors and do nothing. We do nothing but laugh at him. <br /> <br /> Then there is a cute blonde girl who is blessed with the ability to count points and cheat on his girlfriend. you And the ambition of her life is to live with her parents and count more points. <br /> <br /> So it's a story about a man who doesn't have the emotions or feelings that fall in love with people who count the points. And cheats with her boyfriend It can be predicted as much as it is, and it really is a waste of time. You can't get anything from watching this thing, except for a strange laugh because it has a lot of repetition. He only eats only French fries, not French wine, and everyone laughs. That is the attitude of the outsider that this movie is doing. Also, if my father's girlfriend is taking care of me around, what can I say or But not our army No veteran. He let everyone be their leader. <br /> <br /> This movie is what First Blood seems to be if John Rambo is burned like the greatest man in the world.
