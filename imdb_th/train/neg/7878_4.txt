I am a big fan of original books and this adaptation is not good at all. First of all, there is a problem in deciding whether it is a small or an adult that causes a strange mix of adult stories and scenes that are quite violent with stupid little ducks that give "funny" moments in the episode. First, br /> <br /> But that's not important. This movie is boring, not moving and is not true with the original story. It failed to transfer to every picture that Orwell tried to do with his book. <br /> <br /> {Spoiler} <br /> <br /> The Revolution two? !! Didn't they learn anything? Who will be the next Napoleon, Benjamin? !!
