As a living person and still remembering that decade, if half of the actual 70s were funny and semi-normal, they would be more fun. Children of that era did nothing. In order to be bright and normal like these children, the youth of the country are still under the influence of all the hippies and drug culture that revolt in the 60s occurred, especially in the department of righteous behavior, Childhood, their irrationality - no character that represents that <br /> <br /> People compare to "Happy Days" and I can see why: both the sitcoms that happened 20 years before the current time, they aired and they offered only one surface, showing the true era, not close to the full extent of it, just showing clear things - fashion, toys, music, contraception, etc. and that Is for people who do not remember or do not trust me. 70s is not the case anymore. "Happy Days" is like the real 50s because "M * A * S * H ​​*" does not show life. At the base Bay Area of ​​the US Army at the time. Korean War etc.
