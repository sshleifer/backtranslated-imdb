I am a big fan of both Shakespeare and MST3K, so I waited to watch anxiously. I will comment on the movie first. At the MST3K, the formula for this movie: Bringing Shakespeare's talented and beautiful performers, beautiful and elegant, and a $ 1.25 budget. Movement until boring and lifeless Serve cold in a normal large stone pot. The movie I gave 3 out of 10 because at least the actors deserve a little credit I understand that it is a reaction of many aquatic animals as well. However, when I watched it a second time, I realized that there was a whole host of intelligent references and a good line that I missed first. The trick now is: listen carefully! Need to use a couple of times to capture each line Give a second chance to it and you will see what I mean by MST3K: 7 1/2 out of 10
