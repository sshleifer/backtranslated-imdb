I am a big fan of Karishma Kapoor and Govinda. I watched this movie after I saw Fiza, which was absolutely fantastic. <br /> <br /> There are bad movies and movies at cr * p, but this movie. Just take biscuits. <br /> <br /> We were very annoyed that we were tricked into paying to hope for a good movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid all the expenses. br /> <br /> 1/10
