The protocol is an unbelievable movie with only one saving grace: Goldie Hawk star, along with supporting actors. The story revolves around a famous cocktail waitress, who is known after accidentally saving the dignified Arabian life. The story fell halfway through the film and Goldie's charm didn't record this movie. If you're not a Goldie Hawn fan, don't go to watch this movie.
