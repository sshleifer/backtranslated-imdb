In all low budget history This movie must be one of the worst stories. Actually, it's a joke of the movie. But in general it is really scary I can't understand what people can't go out to use a bunch of slugs. I mean, they must be one of the slowest creatures in the world. The only thing that is worth while in this movie is the attempt to bite the finger of the slug man. It's quite fun
