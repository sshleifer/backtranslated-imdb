Becoming Hawked is the most nasty film ever guaranteed to have someone - guess what? It works. I am not satisfied that we have rented this money. I'm bored with two friends and decide to see if everything about the movie we see on the TV is true or not. Curse Comedy Central and all the other networks that push this garbage to us! It's the worst movie I've ever seen since Hollow Man. I tend to avoid crappy people. But was sucked into this We overcame a prick that suggested renting and the right to choose his movie was revoked. There is nothing funny in the distance about this movie ... even the scene. "The adventure of a dickman" looks very good .. Color me p *** ed Think that the production value is boring for some important reason ... No .. it's just suck. Never watch this thing! For any reason Not even having a lot of illegal substances, this movie is a very funny joke. Ask for love from all things sacred. If you hold on to your consciousness - never watch this movie. There are many things that are stupid, pointless and worthless to tell the name. But the main thing that it targets is: aggressively funny - it fails miserably. Mistakes and burns ....
