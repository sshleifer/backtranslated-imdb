SCARECROWS seems to be an unsightly horror movie that meets supernatural movies. A group of gangsters robbed a salaryman like a soldier at Camp Pendleton in California. They drilled a cargo plane, kidnapped the pilot and his daughter with the need to fly to Mexico. While one of the greedy robbers decided to help with landing the money in a field that was examined by a strange looking scarecrow, these things were not just scarecrows that followed ... but they could kill. The performance is not better than the horrible conversation. And the effort in humor is not a joke Very low budget and filming in the dark. <br /> <br /> Performers include: Ted Vernon, Michael David Simms, Kristina Sanborn, B.J. Turner, Phil Zenderland and Victoria Christian.
