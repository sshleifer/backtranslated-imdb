Ouch! They weren't worse than the adaptation of C. S. Lewis's romance novel, while the adaptation was very true to the novel. The performance was terrible and the special scenes and effects were at the same level as the school's drama. I read that the budget for this drama is the greatest thing that the BBC had given at that time. But of course, they can copy together more than $ 2 that seems to be filming. The worst effect is Mr. Beaver. I know that computer effects are not at the required level or worth at the time. But people who wear clothes in the suit look scary. Better to just cut the character from the movie than do that with the script! Avoid this at all costs.
