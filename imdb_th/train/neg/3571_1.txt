The most sexy movie actor in B is part of the future of "Goodfellas" fans. In the movie Ray Liotta, in the movie box office, she plays Marion. There is only one line of dialogue and WORD. She shouted out "Joe!" While Ray's character violates Piaodora, who is poor with a springer, plastic garden hose. This movie is terrible, although it's funny and hilarious all the time. The Mystery Science Theater 3000 will love this thing! See the hysterical scene at the end, where Pia breaks down, and all the editing and magic effects they make to try and show that the characters of Pia look terrible. Pia plays as a Hollywood script writer. Wood, who wishes for this story, Pia Zadora is the author of the script? Yeah, Pia is hardly able to talk, write alone! Pia is the most stupid person in this chapter. But who cares? The true star is Glory Annen that is hot and refreshing in her part in the opinion of this cat! Rock in Glory!
