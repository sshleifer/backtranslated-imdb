I read all the books about the series that were left behind and the movie was almost unfair. Of course, I've watched movies that are worse. But it was very disappointing This movie will make the episode good. MST3K script is a scary adaptation book and feels that the actors are reading their script instead of saying they are really. The result is wonderful and looks very fake. The ending is terrible. First of all, it doesn't go all the way through the first book. Secondly, it is not reasonable. If you don't read the book, you won't know what happened. It must be a movie that looks the most wonderful ending I have ever seen in a movie. I'm really upset that I paid for this movie. If there is a certain miracle, it will release wide, they should lift all the machines and let Hollywood take possession. Both film producer Wannabe and director Wannabe should leave the film production for professionals.
