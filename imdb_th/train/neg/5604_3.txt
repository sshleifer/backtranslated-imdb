I've heard about this movie for many years and finally have the opportunity to watch. The great cheerleading killings in 1963 and 1969 finally made the Cheer camp nearby. Fast forward to 1982 and Bambi, a former student, accepting new applications with Kandy (Carol Ken), Glenn (Judge Reinhold) and Sandy (Debralee Scott) individually. They were killed by the murderer until only one person left. When we know who's doing and why, <br /> <br /> In this movie, Tom Stokes speaks of a terrifying Canadian accent and Paul Rubens makes Pee-Wee Herman schtick The overall score has not been well developed and is quite lame. But there are some funny scenes that happen: House of Bad Pies and poker poker scenes. The ending seems to have been thrown together, which is a shame. <br /> <br /> Overall good, about ten or fifteen minutes in total, the rest you can move forward fast. May catch it on TV But it is not worth buying
