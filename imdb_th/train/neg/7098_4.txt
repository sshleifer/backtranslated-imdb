An interesting idea for the film, both showing the last dragon on the planet and showing the battles that he and the wicked have together. When he was younger, Einon was stabbed in the heart, so Ven (Dennis Quaid) took him to the Dark Lord who made him half-hearted. Now Einon (David Thewlis) now grows into a king. Selfish and evil At the same time, Bowen is using a new friend Draco the Dragon (voiced by Sir Sean Connery) to receive the "Dragon Slayer" award. But since Einon hears only half of the Draco, they both feel the pain in one of them. Injured or killed, starring Pete Postlethwaite as Gilbert of Glockenspur, Jason Isaac as Lord Felton, Julie Christie is Queen Aislinn and John Gielgud as King Arthur. It was nominated for an Oscar for Visual Looks good!
