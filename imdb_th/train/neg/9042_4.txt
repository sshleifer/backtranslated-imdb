I want to like this movie But it was separated in the middle All places are good places and have good ties. But in the middle ran out to touch each other The person I watched was frustrated while it ran out of the way and hoped it would end faster than it was. Another person fell asleep in the middle! I found myself dreaming elsewhere during the day, as Schtick was not related to the plot. I bought it as an eye candy and it delivered like that. But it lacks the writing and spirit of Pixar. I think children under the age of 8 will enjoy sitting in the face vaule while missing the plot. People who are old enough to follow the plan will find that wonders are too far to come back quickly and easily. Fixing most of the middle part takes 50 minutes and it will flick firmly. I hope I have something better to say But i can't
