This is not a movie Trainspotting or Guy Ritchie. It's a great day. It wants to be a movie that is laughing, frustrated and paranoid in city life. But it is very annoying It's easier than mimicking other examples rather than creating real stories with real characters. From the beginning, I didn't care about characters or things that they had less involvement. They often pressed the surface or cried each other always Only without any content with what they do The dialogue between the characters means that the hips are revealed. But it comes out repeatedly and another scene after another guess I know there are spectators there who like this movie so I might be wrong.
