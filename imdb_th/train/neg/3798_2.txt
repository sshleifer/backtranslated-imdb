And that is the only reason I have this DVD Now I don't see the first movie of the story. But I checked the information from it and I came here by saying: What? Why? Because in the first movie, Alex is a man But then the first one was created in the future, so this Alex may be a new person, and scientists have just made Alex a woman this time. Who knows at least not talking about it at all? <br /> <br /> Here is a brief summary of the story: Alex is already a child, in the future). Escape with her mother. By using a special boat and ending in the 80s Africa, with a mother killed and Alex (Price Sue) growing up in an African tribe Then the tribe will be killed by robots from the future, and Alex runs away and hides and she eventually kills the robot. So there Sound familiar? <br /> <br /> The Terminator is not the only film that has been ripped here. Predator gets a fair share as well, and I think the first Fly movie is Vincent Price one. Nominations to be a strong base in building your cyborg head. <br /> <br /> Let me see, what's more? Okay, this movie is quite a small flick. But it has a special effect that is not good for movies in the mid 90's. It will look okay for the 80s flick. As always, the biggest problem is the plot. Things that just happened and the audience barely cared for the nemesis 2 is not the most disgusting movie piece that I was happy to see, but it was already close. I won't say anything about acting: Has anyone expected Oscar's precious performance here? Oh, well ... At least I found that Sue Price was hot as an Amazon warrior. <br /> <br /> "Real" movie scores: 2/10 has not many advantages about all quality. Even though it is a very simple plot, this movie is not very reasonable. <br /> <br /> Movie rating: 4/10 I occasionally get laughter from the horrors of movies. So it has a small merit in it
