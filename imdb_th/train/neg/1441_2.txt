I chose this film only on the cover, thinking that I was on an adventure at the level. "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom", unfortunately, I am in a yawning place Unlike the yawning that I had before This yawn is so large that it is almost impossible to find anything in this movie. The cover describes no special effects that are amazing. The film is very light, even the pattern shows extreme. It gives the idea that you can solve the problem with violence. Well, if you want to teach your children that I don't. Avoid this. If you are looking for family entertainment, you may find something that inspires more people.
