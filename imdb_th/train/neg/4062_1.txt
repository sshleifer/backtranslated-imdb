There are only a few movies that make me feel uncomfortable and this is not a compliment. When I saw it in the theater (How did it end there? I wondered.) I had to be disgusted with 90 million junk. The main impression was a movie that didn't look like this. "Don't answer the phone" - but worse All its disgust, rape and all performances do not have any distance (unlike strong things like "The last house on the left") and insulting the victims (Perfect?) And everyone involved Sadistic voyeur At the end I felt like being showered. No credit for the director
