I watched Lord of the Rings Peter Jackson version. When I read the two towers halfway through and I thought it was great. <br /> <br /> At this time, the animation film of The Lord of the Rings was released in DvD, but I told myself that I would read the Two Towers and the Return of Kings before watching it. (As I think it shows all the endings) <br /> <br /> So when I finish the trilogy and take the DvD, which is a stupid idea because it is absolutely rubbish > <br /> I'm really bored for 20 minutes, which is very strange, because I love books and I tremble that those who do Of the film may think of at least 1 book, half in the movie 2 hours 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> The characters do not have any characters that have emotions when talking and they seem to be Will read it from the face, even if my favorite character is Gandalf, it's not interesting. <br /> <br /> The animation is the only thing that can be done in the movie, except the orks (they look bad. A lot) and Aragorn and Sam face <br /> <br /> I don't know how this movie Was released because there was not even an appropriate ending But it may be a good thing that the creators don't have money because this movie doesn't work well. <br /> <br /> I just hope that no one will judge the book from this movie. <br /> <br /> 3 / 10
