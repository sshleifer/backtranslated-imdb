As mentioned earlier They are amazing Personally, I use Blender and that kind of graphics is not easy. But that's all this film is Not only plot But confusing But the overall conflict is not clear. For example, in the first scene, Proog and Emo try to escape from who knows what. The conflict seems to be between man and nature here. Later, when they entered the room of the deep pit, Proog explained that "one step away from that and (You are dead) "Here there is a more precise conflict between the careless and natural man. When the film proceeds, it is clear that conflicts arise between man and nature. But suddenly the conflict arose between the man and the man. When Proog came out of nowhere, Emo Proog changed from being a caring guardian to a lost child, a "sick man." But we do not care because the conflict between the thoughts and actions of the characters does not develop. It is not a story about someone passing through a stronger fight. It was depressing and did not point out because there was no great truth about the human spirit or about the world that brought to light as this drama did. In my opinion, this film has been developed strongly in all aspects. However, the graphics are amazing. But movies are more than just eye candy. There is no truth, no struggles and bad surprises ended. In summary, underdeveloped movies do not have a point ... but the graphics are good.
