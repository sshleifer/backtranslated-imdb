My roommate & I almost cut short our TV from a lot of spit that we made while watching the hilarious parts of the 1970s. Fake cadaver that fooled himself. I have read about this camp for a long time and have scanned my local late-night TV program for many years to find this chaos. For many years, our ABC affiliates are known to perform cool flicks over the past weekend (such as "Frogs", "Night of the Lepus", etc.). Happened: at 1:40 pm on Saturday night (more than 5 years ago) there! We have more than 15 people and flick and don't disappoint. <br /> <br /> Look! Andy Griffith is the worst and most dangerous bad guy since Jaye Davidson in "Stargate"! <br /> <br /> Look! William Shatner plays many sports on his head, which is similar to human hair. (Or whatever is organic for that matter) <br /> <br /> Hear! The jaws fall unreasonably in the 1970s that made "Chicken Soup for the Soul" sounded like BF Skinner. <br /> <br /> Feel! The content of any decade is better than the 70s. <br /> <br /> For those who are still reading ... The plot surrounds the middle-class middle-class who decides to suck their heads. (Griffith) by joining him in a cross-dessert competition that covers California and Mexico They all wore leather jackets looking at Christopher Street more than anything else. Along the way they stopped at Cantina, drunk, smoke joints (Robert "Mike Brady" Reed's eyes together, a picture you won't forget), start a fight, try to rape and act like a bunch. Jack's middle class, the suburb doesn't like Although I have a wonderful copy that I put on TV, I hope it will be released in the video so that the whole world can enjoy its stupidity.
