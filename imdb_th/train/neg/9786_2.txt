OK, I bought this movie from Woolworths for my friend to receive a funny gift on his birthday because the front cover had sex inside For a hilarious purpose "OK, this may be true" That because he has an accent Which I can not say that who acted as dearly <br /> <br /> then reached the end Final paintball <br /> <br /> The only thing I like about this plot is that they didn't win. But annoying enough that they will win by default. <br /> <br /> And I know this is not related to it. But the team name received is terrible. Major damage I mean, they can choose a better name, such as "The Destroyers of Anti-Christ" or something. Or that is what this movie should be called
