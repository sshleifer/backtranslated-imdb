There is a UK version for this program which is somewhat less extravagant than the US version. The person involved will receive a new kitchen or maybe a bedroom and bathroom and are extremely grateful for what they have received. This version of the American version is everything that a reality TV shouldn't be. Instead of renovating a few houses, where residents cannot buy or do themselves, the whole house has been rebuilt. I do not know whether this program is trying to show that the flea welfare system is in the United States or not. If you ask enough, you will receive. The placement of products that are quite vulgar, especially caused by Sears, has not been demanded as well. More than changing a family in an area that has been deprived of becoming a potential millionaire, it is better to help the community as a whole instead of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on a house Perhaps a place that can borrow and return DIY tools and power tools with building materials so everyone can get the benefits they need. Providing all to one person may cause great dissatisfaction in the remaining local communities that still live in the same house.
