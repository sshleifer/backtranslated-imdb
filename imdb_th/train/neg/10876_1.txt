What is D-Movie like that? Bad performances, bad special effects and conversations / the worst stories I've ever seen. The only interesting thing here is Coolio, who has a good pendant as a policeman who lost consciousness. However, the rest of the film is scary and boring. It's not bad. You can laugh. Just plain shit And anyone who compares this to the Evil Dead series may compare Tomb Raider with Indiana Jones (at least with Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider) 1 of 10
