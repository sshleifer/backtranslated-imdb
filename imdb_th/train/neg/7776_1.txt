It's a burden .. I can't even explain how scary this movie is. Ratings here are difficult to believe. <br /> <br /> Avoid ... especially if you enjoy the first ginger. The first movie that was well written, well directed, performed well .. Great movie with beautiful beauty and amazing atmosphere. The second is 'alrite' - suitable for movies that stand for themselves. But not clear until the first level ... The third story is the insult to the monthly series. I rate this movie: 10, 6, 1. It's so bad. <br /> <br /> Oh and yes, it's in the past. The sisters still call Ginger and B Fitzgerald ... All confused with the Native American fairy tale. Sister has no real story or progress, or even a clear relationship ... They just try to survive and live together forever. That is the deepest thing possible. <br /> <br /> Seth, the girls agreed to stay in the mound after reading the script. <br /> <br /> Oh and another story. One drama The action is terrible - people appear from anywhere, like girls, turn back and have a detailed candle light, with a mysterious Native American woman sitting there to speak. The scene was terrible, unable to escape from the fact that it was based on scenes that didn't help anything. In addition, there is still snow outside the camp regularly. But there is no trace inside (.. in the scene) <br /> <br /> Arkham, terrible! I hope it will be at least as good as the second.
