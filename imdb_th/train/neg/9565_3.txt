I can't say that Wargames: The Dead Code is the worst movie I've ever seen because it has a good time or two. But I can say that it is the most transparent movie I've ever seen. The plot device never appeared, which I did not predict 10+ minutes in advance. There was no subtlety to what the movie did. There was no intelligence in the background. The intentions of the lines that were spoken or printed, everyone clearly saw that it was impossible to "enter" movies. <br /> <br /> I found myself laughing at the frightening thoughts of the story More often than I find myself enjoying movies.
