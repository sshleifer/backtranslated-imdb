The destruction of the popular "Gremlins" in 1984 could be the largest train wreck of a movie ever created. Despite being a 'B' grade movie, all other cheap horror movies on the same platform are dwarfed by this film, both in the plot, performance and goodness. <br /> <br /> It starts with Old security guards randomly and The younger punky security guard whose name is not important. Why? Because in a few minutes in the movie, he went into a 'prohibited' safety box and was killed while using his imagination as a rock star in a cheap pub. <br /> <br /> This is Just an appetizer - main dish, Kevin. The main character struggled many times to prove himself to be more than just a pussy. Maybe he was successful in the movie. But for the audience, he proved himself to be nothing more than a bad actor. Kevin worked for the old security officer and was guided through security in the abandoned studio. Yes, why do you need to create a scene when you can use the studio yourself? Back to the movie Kevin opens the forbidden safes and releases Hobgoblins. Hobgoblins forces people to live the most cruel imagination and kill them for some reason. They have to come back before sunrise or the other ... or something else. <br /> <br /> Other characters include Kevin's military friend, NICK, DAPHNE of Nick's daughter. The drama does not have any more content than the attitude of a bitch and a prostitute. There is Kevin's girlfriend who likes to provoke and is a 'reserved' AMY, whose deepest desires seem to be a bad image of a cry of fishnet stockings with blue grandmother's pants on top .. Don't ask How do i work May be the most entertaining character, KYLE. How to set up such a group of friends? Kyle is a mischievous animal who cannot go one hour without stimulating himself. His hobbies include calling sexual conversations from other people's homes and most intimidating lingerie. <br /> <br /> Stories that appear when heroes find Hobgoblins: creatures that are knee-high. (Aka hand puppet) which for some reason tries to travel far beyond the boundaries of the neighborhood Finally, each character lives in their most fierce imagination, which has never been involved in millions of dollars ... or a movie with a huge budget. <br /> <br /> Warning Front spoiler: This movie's twist will make watchers wonder "What?" Hobgoblins will be sent back to a safe place by ... their own free will. Sometimes they may lose patience waiting for the sunrise to wreak havoc, or perhaps the story writer is the author's cramp and decides not to worry about the ending. Upon returning to safety, the old security guard reveals "What he learned in the army" and detonated the bombs that destroyed the safety signaling the end of the evil Hobgoblins and the end of this rollercoaster; It's better to sit on the escalator than <br /> <br /> The badness of this movie is enough to send someone out of tears. If you plan to watch, I recommend a few alcoholic beverages in advance to seriously consider this film.
