This book is a great book that at least opening a movie made for this TV will make you move. But when it became more and more separated from the books, bringing religion and love and mathematics into the candy, it was boring from the comments I had heard. People who didn't read the book often liked it and if it made the child read it A Wrinkle in Time, it will serve the purpose The most embarrassing change is to make Happy Medium a clone of Mary Poppins Albert's uncle (I like to laugh). There is nothing that would provoke the characters on the screen to laugh at things that are disgusting.
