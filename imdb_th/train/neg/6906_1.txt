This film is not only But with a bad plot, bad direction and terrible performances only, it also opens up to a whole new meaning about racism. <br /> <br /> In this movie Is a gangster and successful (Yes again) Businessmen "white" are disgusting toilets. <br /> <br /> I'm just wondering what will happen if I do the same movie with the same story and The only script that I made about white people "He is a good person who has seen you stop dating those black chicks." <br /> <br /> No one seems to notice. But watch this movie again and you will vomit out how they show new images. New Zealand "White Boy" Suddenly, white people, which are the main cause of gang and prostitute aggression very quickly. There is only a Samoan girl with a heart. There is nothing that is a white girl that is not cool. <br /> <br /> It makes me bored that they cannot make this film without the New Zealand Caucasian community Nasty If you think I am very fat, go watch this movie and see what you do with "White boy" just because Samoans choose to call us "White boy" in real life does not mean funny. If I said that a black boy, hey, I'll make my teeth. <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie. Don't waste your money. Do not racist
