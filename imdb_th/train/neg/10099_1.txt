thanks to God! I do not lose the money to rent. But I downloaded it! This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The visual effects f ***** g, unnecessary gore and nudity! Far from other zombie movies such as Night of the Living Dead and others. There are many holes and mistakes in the movie. OK, if you get the time after reading this comment, please check the director's profile (Ulli Lommel) after seeing that I have received my own explanations as to why the movie is like this. Ranked between 1 and 2, and now I'm not willing to find out that these movies are directed by him. Complete all this by speaking one strong sentence. Even for fun or passing time or even in a very boring situation, please do not watch this movie.
