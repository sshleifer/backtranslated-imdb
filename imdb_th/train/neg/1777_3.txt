If you are a movie viewer who likes original content and clever skepticism ... then go look elsewhere. Kids make Sleepwalkers really bad. Usually I will talk better than that ... but wow ... This is terrible. I love it very much when Charles brings the car home. Thanya refuses. And then he sees WALKING HOME. Where is his car ?? However, just don't see people. I want more specific But the words escaped me Cats jump on people One man was stabbed by corn. Cheesey entered the proverbial "wazoo" line. Just don't see it Wait, I'll take it back! See it for writer Stephen King Jutra, who is the owner of the cemetery. He's quite good. Despite the presence of guest guests by Mark Hamill and Ron Perlman, King gave the best performance of the film. But other than that ... wow ... BAD
