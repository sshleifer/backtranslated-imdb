Yes i already know But this film is a good example of how to gather the indicator of 'depth' (political turmoil, love / sexual desire) can be combined incessantly to fierce acclaim Kaufman's movie is shown together with a free sex scene interspersed with frequent painful conversations (In one scene, I count the accent "Europe in general" with three different accents that are affected by the actors) and the state's performances may be eased. Kundera offers, and over a period of more than three hours, it can handle Franz completely. The fourth part Missing in the love triangle, which is at the center of the plot and in this way, will sacrifice the main mechanism of expressing the emotional spectrum and Of the power relationship received in love It has not included the token screen time for the son of Thomas, used in the novel to illustrate some of the political points kundera is doing in the novel. When combined with the soundtrack that is too much, these shortcomings make the film sound too strong in three hours. But the content is still light
