As a poker enthusiast, I look forward to seeing this movie - especially when Scotty Nyugen is there. <br /> <br /> In general, the short point in this movie. Scotty Nyugens is everything that happens.> <br /> The characters are different and annoying. The soundtrack is scary and the plot doesn't have one. <br /> <br /> I'm a headache in good faith. Found himself reading the barcode number on DVD box after twenty minutes I was bored. It is true that Nyugen is in this movie, otherwise I wouldn't have to buy $ 16 from Ebay. <br /> <br /> Take it from me - avoid like 7 2 offsuit !!! Disastrous :(
