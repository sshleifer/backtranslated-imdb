I have read many good reviews that have protected and criticized various aspects of this movie. One thing that I regularly see is the annoyance of Megan, an ideal political scientist who is trying to change the world. I love your character Probably because I am a 23 year old political science student and I think I will change the world too, so I relate to Megan. In addition, she is cute. She is not a super model. <br /> <br /> Ok, so she cried and screamed a lot. It's amazing and seems to be too much. But is it not suitable for her character? She continued to perform with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove the point. She thinks people who enjoy this kind of acting are not comfortable. I think she makes her argue very well. Of course, being a naive girl, she was afraid of what she was facing. I think her performance is correct, showing that a young girl shows moral courage despite overwhelming fear. In addition, I think she still maintains the dignity of humanity throughout the story, even if she is in a hopeless situation. <br /> <br /> For movies in general, apart from Megan, it's what I expect It has a great gore scene according to a small budget standard. PTSD may use the idea quickly, hardly pondering. In general, it's just a horror movie without humor, which is the name I love the sadness of doctors He kept Megan's shirt not only But will cause daze (But mostly) but still makes her torture before he kills her The house is hilarious. For slasher movie lovers, he may be the best character. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 10 out of 10. It has a good setting, almost no plot and mix between. Good and bad show I would recommend for cheap excitement. But hardly a diamond in the rough that is a small budget horror
