This will be one of the most popular movies in Spanish history. The lack of subtlety and complexity as well as overall political corrections make only good / bad characters. The world is not like this, and good movies show complex characters with opposite motives, crisis, etc. However, the thing I hate the most about this movie is the father of Bola's friend. Artists with shaving heads are not always bad people. In fact, they may be better than those who look better than normal. (Wow, this is like ... philosophy or something) Thank you Achero. I will offer you a Nobel Prize in Literature.
