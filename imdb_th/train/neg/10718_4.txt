Come to Tina Fey. You can do better. As soon as the movie started, I knew how it would end. Of course it's funny all the time. Even laughing out loud, funny, but without enough laughter to record this movie. I do not recommend buying this thing. Mostly I recommend renting But that is all. Baby Mama has a funny but predictable scene and fails to make the heart warm in the end. <br /> <br /> Tina Fey and Amy Poalher build a good team. Mean Girls is one The movies I like are Tina Fey and Amy Poalher. Both are good at that and they do well in this story. But this is not the best thing. Mama Baby has great supporting actors. Dane Cook, Sigourney Weaver and Steve Martin add greatness to actors. <br /> <br /> Another pregnancy movie that Screened in the movie world After the great knocking and Juno, Baby Mama looks very ordinary when comparing Knocked Up and Juno is funny, hilarious, warm and has a ending that makes you smile. The end of Baby Mama is not boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Baby Mama is not the best comedy of the year and it doesn't try. I recommend here But don't expect it to be completely hilarious Expecting an ordinary comedy that didn't make the ending of the big emotion. I gave Baby Mama ..... <br /> <br /> 4/10
