I watched 3/4 of this movie and wondered why it received such horrible reviews. It's quite easy to watch (at 3 o'clock). It has a good selection of actors - Kevin Dillon's role in the serial killer in sociology is very reliable - he is both charming and cool. The remaining main characters are not too bad. <br /> <br /> This is the movie that provokes / suspects your movie. Spouses cannot conceive, so they go to the clinic of fertility for help. Donors "genetic material" in sociology pinned to the recipient and in a typical stalker form invaded into their lives. <br /> <br /> As I have said, most movies are quite good. Obsessed with raising more children and creating a perfect family with the mother Of course, things didn't work for him the way he planned. Not a bad plot line. <br /> <br /> But the last 15 minutes are terrible. I am quite patient with the movie. (Especially at 3 am!) .. but I was very surprised to write a bad ending. Actually, I mocked outloud! <br /> <br /> In every story, it's not the worst movie I've ever had. See But I can't sit and watch it again (Unless I skip the ending) The only rewarding quality here is the role of Kevin Dillon - one of the best serial killers ever. <br /> <br /> Take a look at Other channels before watching this .. Let's see .. =)
