This dumb movie serves well to lose funny abilities. In particular, Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman were misused here. I might laugh at once or twice in this movie. But in general, it's a boring movie with a little foolishness at a good level. Location, although routines are still not bad. But when the movie plot is set, there is nowhere. Don't waste time on this misunderstanding.
