This is one of those topics that I can relate to a lot more people than most people, because I hate loudness and have no idea that those people in New York City, especially how people sleep! It surprised me that people can endure loudness today. The basic story of this movie is making it an interesting topic. It's terrible about it. Tim Robbins is a good person, even though there are only a few scenes. (Especially with top model Margarita Leiveva), he doesn't seem to be together My greatest hope for this film is that the casting agent will see the talented and amazing actresses like Margarita Levi√®res. You don't have much to do. But she is a beautiful young model Even if they try to make her look more feminine It makes me sad that people like Paris Hilton & Kim Kardashian in a world that doesn't have the skills or talents that can be exchanged for fame and success rather than beauty with this ability. I didn't really care about this because the script wasn't good. But I'm glad to see new talent. I hope producers and directors think Margarita when they want a beautiful new actor to be in a big movie with a budget. If they can make Megan Fox a star (She's not hot and her "talent" performance is worse than doing a Disney TV program) from 1 movie. It's likely to be easy for her Beautiful and talented! I suggest you change her surname so that we can pronounce and make it more desirable. This is the hope that makes her career & if there is any justice she can appear in a big summer movie or two in the next couple of years.
