This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Despite what Mikshelt claims, this film is not close to the accuracy of the past. It started to get worse, then went down from there. We have Hitler's father cursed his misfortune in the "truth" that he married his niece! They are the second cousin. Hitler's mother, Clara, called his father "Aloha" because Alou was raised and raised by Clara's grandfather and raised his son when he was his grandson. Alois is older than Klara and when As a child, she had a habit of calling Alois "Uncle" <br /> <br /> The scene in which the Hitler trenches were mocked by his fellow soldiers and decided to Taking it out with his dog is just a shame and insulting the intelligence of all viewers. We saw that Hitler drove the dog through the waterway when he found the poor things he had done to disobey him. At the distance that we saw and heard, his fellow soldiers continued to mock and punish the cowardly little man. But then the gunshot fell on his persecutor directly and everyone we were told was killed If so, if Hitler was the only survivor of this incident, did he hear about his cruelty and cowardice? Hitler then went "to brag" about it or not? - I don't think so. <br /> <br /> Go on top, Hitler bully and intimidate the poor, stressed, stressed and waged by the Jewish authorities who are tired to give him an iron cross! I can assume that this Jewish officer was the owner of a pawn shop before fighting for patriarchy and thinking of bringing a pledge from his shop because I am confident that Iron Crosses was not delivered as shown in this comic book. /> <br /> All the strange songs are here, not the quietest and hypnotic effects of Wagner's music on the little ones. If only the manufacturer that made Ian Kershaw next to them, then they might discover that Franz Lehar's "Merry Widow" was more likely to cruise the Fuhrer than "Flying Dutchman" from Richard Wagner's cannon! <br /> Hitler may be responsible for the deaths of 60 million people, but how can he be forgiven for the horrors of music? <br /> <br /> I'll go, but I'm here. For many hours <br /> <br /> Let it be Miss.
