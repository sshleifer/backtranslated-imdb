I received the Kazaam version of the book for my 8th birthday and people always say that the book is always better than the movie. But this time they were wrong At least with this movie, it ends very soon. <br /> <br /> The performance in this story is terrible, which I expect from the movie Shaq, a genius player, rapper Genius coming out of the old slum slum. It may be a good reason for him to be stuck in that.) The children in the movie who play Max are shy and actors that are scary. He was persecuted by children in the neighborhood, which I do not blame them because he is a little water injection bag. <br /> <br /> The story is simple, stupid and very old-fashioned. About the boy whose father worked all the time and had never met a new friend who made his life better and eventually helped him contact his father. <br /> <br /> Even at the age of 8 years, I think this is a stupid idea. It's surprising that people working in this movie have a career after the ward because it's embarrassing and shouldn't be done. I can walk even more about how this movie sucks. But you should know just read the plot
