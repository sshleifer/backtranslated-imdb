I won't be enthusiastic with The Pallbearer. It's not bad. But it is very slow sometimes When the movie continues, it's a little more interesting. I really like David Schwimmer and I think he's good here. I'm not a big Gwyneth Paltrow fan but sometimes I don't mind you and you're ok. But if you like leaderboards, you will enjoy it.
