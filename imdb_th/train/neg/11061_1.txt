Curious, take me to this "masterpiece", unfortunately I did not rent, I bought it! The most annoying thing about this movie is that it's not annoying. For reasons known only to them, the filmmakers set out to show the human side of Jeffry Dahmer. Are you kidding me? This man gave a new meaning to the word "finger lickin 'good"! And with flashback and flash forwarding, I have trouble tracking the story. Overall, Jeremy Renner's performance was not bad. You can catch him in "S.W.A.T." which he plays as a former police officer who is not satisfied. However, I will rate this as 1/10. There are only 1 because of Renner's good performance. There are many books and television documentaries that help protect Dahmer's crimes. Avoid this
