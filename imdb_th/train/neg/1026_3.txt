Wow. I don't think I used to watch movies with many great actors who played such an important role. Perhaps Justin Timberlake may be the only worst actor to play an important role in the movie with the power of the stars and the money behind it that Edison has. <br /> <br /> Performances His is awesome. The story is ok and all other characters are shown by professional actors. Even heck LL Cool J is ok because he has a lot of small pieces to cut his teeth. The way in which the director and the film company thinks Timberlake is ready for this role. There is no way to understand <br /> <br /> His character destroys the entire experience since every time he is on the screen. In order to conceal his regret, and he should be a hero ... I will not waste money on this theater or in the video. Maybe if you have HBO and nothing to do at the second hit on Saturday night and you're drunk and drunk, this might be ok. <br /> <br /> Timberlake viewing in this role is like watching. Humans' Kermit the Frog's performance in Hollywood Blockbuster doesn't work at all.
