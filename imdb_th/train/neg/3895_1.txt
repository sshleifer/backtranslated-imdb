Once upon a time there was a wicked man making a movie about a man who was shot into space, should go to Saturn. But in fact, there is only a stock of solar flares, and then he has blood flowing out his nose and before you know it. He lay in a hospital with a bandage, head to toe. Then an overweight nurse with an inappropriate uniform came and was eaten by a guy who should melt all over the place. But seems to not lose mass at all Or at least one person that NASA felt uncomfortable and called another man to hunt him But the men they sent to hunt down the melting people had to go home and have the soup first and his strange-shaped wife forgot to cracker, so he couldn't cracker. Then he had to go outside and look for The men were dissolved with Geiger counters and that didn't really work. So he followed the path of the half-dead body. And there was something about the sheriff and two ugly old men in the lime garden and women who had a meat knife Some industrial plants that have security guards that are happy and because I can't tell you how the movie ends, all I can say is Jonathan Demme in there with a guy named Burr. DeBenning has a fair world in which everyone involved in this movie died horribly, deadly, and unable to make a lot of movies. The world and was happy as never seen before - the end!
