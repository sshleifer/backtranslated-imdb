I guess I have only myself to blame for the enormous chaos that is "Virgin's internal organs" You already know not to expect a movie masterpiece when you see the name that is so juicy and promoted like this, and the first impression will be specially confirmed when observing the movie. This is a production in the mid-80s from Japan. Now there are many filmmakers who are insane and sick, working in Japan. But Kazuo Komizi surpasses all of them with his nasty and disgusting trilogy that revolves around in vain. Not even trying to tell the story "Entrails of the Virgin" is just a presentation of a mix of semi-obscene sex that aroused and truly poor blood, which would not be the favorite horror fan of the 80s. Pictures of many photographers and their fashion models were interrupted unbelievably with scenes that distorted pornographic images that had rude sex with younger girls. The seemingly He couldn't leave her for a minute after the peak (general) and she begged him to stay, even if she had to share him with other women. Because it was so obscure and really wrong However, back to the group of photographers with horns and tame models Surprised by the oncoming fog, on the way home, the group seized themselves in an abandoned house in the countryside where they had more horrible sex and eventually fell victim to the ridiculous sex demons that killed them all. The show has expertise, dialogue and the original direction and the direction of Komizu is weak and undesirable. I can endure everything, including the unfriendly sexual expression of women. But I came too close to close the movie during the brave wrestling sequence with meaning. A man was brutally attacked, kicked and threw a girl and called her a dirty prostitute until she put on her underwear and cried painfully. This sequence is in my humble opinion, the lowest point of exploitation of Asian movies. One to avoid and may boycott
