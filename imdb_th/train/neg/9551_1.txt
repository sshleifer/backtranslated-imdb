This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my whole life. I hope I will go back in time and do the following things: <br /> <br /> 1) Find out if the "movie" "war game - dead code" was filmed. 2) See the original war game. With my present Computer knowledge and the eyes of thirteen years 1983 3) Penning the computer in the 80s with knowledge and perspectives learned and remembered 4) Reprogram WHOPPER to the NUKE position of the DEAD code minutes before the first day Filming 5) Back to the present, there was a beer and won Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones to "flash" all my memory empty. In particular, watching the original "The Dead Code" 6) Having another beer and watching the game WARS 7) Happy until the next GOOD 80 movie is rebuilt. <br /> <br / > 8) I forgot Jar Jar to kill. I'm not sure if I have to travel in the future for that thing or not. Maybe I want to access the worm.
