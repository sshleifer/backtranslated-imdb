This story is about a romantic triangle during the first day. African male prostitutes, transgender French prostitutes (Stephanie) and Russian-speaking waiters and do not seem to shave. <br /> <br /> As a movie watching Boring, boring and depressed Winter days or in the dimly lit interior where everyone is bathed in a strange blue glow. And yes, I know that it's because of the white balance. Everyone is haggard and pale, shabby and dirty. The body is a bone and shot in close range until it looks ugly and has no charm Stephanie's mother is dying. The three characters return to Stephanie's home village where there are many past events that make the countryside and the interior unpredictable. We see Stephanie's childhood a bit as a child. The mother named Pierre died. Well ... and it's really about this. Developing the character as little as possible. <br /> <br /> I think the story is not linear. (It can be described as not a songwriter) But actually after paying 7 Euros I don't feel like creating a movie myself: that's what the director. Take my money In order to expect me to join the story telling process and make the hands dirty, say so, ask too much (Such as shocking straights) I can see that it is interesting for the Berlin Film Festival and I can see why it is nowhere.
