If not because of bad conversations and scripts I mean, that direction actually touches the object. The actors performed well in bringing the characters to life. But in the end what is really missing is a stable chapter that will gather everything together. I highly recommend that you do not watch this thing. Unless you are a favorite of Al Pacino like me and will watch everything he plays, even though the results are not good This is after S1m0ne. The second movie is very bad for this actor who once knew how to choose a role.
