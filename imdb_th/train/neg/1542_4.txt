Is Tim Meadows the first actor in the movie? Leon's character is very funny. But soon after, the jokes and sexual humor were too stupid to listen to. Some movies are able to escape from sexual jokes and make the audience know when they start advertising. Some movies that do this are American pies and scary movies. The scary movie is stupid and the American Pie is doing well without sex. The only role other than Leon with some humor that follows is Ferrell. The character is really stupid and that's all. Humor humor is all I have watched. This movie is ok and nothing else. I do not really understand why the SNL people who are dying from the show often receive movies based on the characters they play in the program. The game takes about 5 minutes and if they can create a movie for 5 minutes then what will the world come to? Molly Shannon has a superstar, cheri o'terri. There are horrible movies. But she did not have a leading role and would have an elves, but that was good, but he made some dumb movies But I can't remember and Mike Myers and Wayne's world Why is the TV crew crazy about not receiving movie offers? Saw only one breakout But only in 2 movies and TV shows with Andy Dick But the man depends on the humor for his life to continue to joke or not This movie is not good. But with positive humor It's a waste of money and money. (D D-)
