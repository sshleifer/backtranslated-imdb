I understand I'm watching a movie I've seen. I know that almost all of the naked and bloody images were cut from this film, thus completely sterilizing it. When seeing the names like Ginger Lynn and Jenna Jameson attached, I know I won't get the classic horror. But at the very least I expected the breasts and bloodshed to be worthless But it shouldn't be the most horror movie that I have killed. I mean it's easier to say that there are more scenes. 'But they were immediately cut off or the scene ended immediately when it started. How can one make human and porn stars crash? I mean, the winning formula makes me wonder if the director is sleeping with the wife of some executives or something because it's really amazing. When reading this story a few years ago in Fangoria, I was excited. It looked like a fun movie. Unfortunately, the real movie was trapped in a grave somewhere and we had to endure this excuse that was called Evil Breed. Hopefully someday will be released without charge because I think That there are good movies in this regulation But until the end, grabbing ten packs of shoots, making it the only way you can do it through this movie.
