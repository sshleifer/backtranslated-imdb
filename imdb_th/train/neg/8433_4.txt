Pere is an idiot. But he knew and followed that His life is completely boring and he doesn't know how to change. When his last friend, Nicco, died, he felt totally empty and decided to go drunk. When he returned home, he had a problem with a girl wearing an ad. Even if she doesn't care about him But he fell in love and began to follow her enchanting The beginning of the movie is a bit slow and may cause most people to be bored. However, when the action begins, it will be a little better (not much! Probably the best part is 5 minutes sex (almost 30 different scenes about it) that you can see in the middle of the movie. It's not good. But for funny and unexpected people, the scene is probably the best movie, both the actor and the director, and the result is a boring movie that some people might joke for me). Subject (A fool as the movie says) which has something interesting. I like Ventura Pons, but I have to admit that this is not one of his best movies).
