I didn't expect much from the movie directed by Sidney J. Furie and starring Dolph Lundgren, but I expect more than I received. One liner user comment - Action movie # 2 - doesn't seem to be a depreciation for me for the Lundgren movie. On the other hand, I wouldn't be interested in watching this movie if the rating is lower than 5.0, but wait a minute. This story has a score of 5.9 out of 10, which seems acceptable for this kind of production. <br /> <br /> Now I understand that 37.5% of people who rate this movie 10 (excellent) are Jane is a public dwarf because your intention is DETENTION, a waste of Nu Image that you have seen before. Lundgren was not persuaded as a former soldier who became a history teacher assigned to a rough school. His performances were terrible, emotionless and planned. Lundgren was unable to show clearly in the scene where the children who were children were wrong. Whether they are great actors or compared to Lundgren, they seem like great actors - because they look natural and reliable. <br /> <br /> Some participation. Interesting for this low-budget movie - for a high-security high school, four teenagers were imprisoned by veteran teachers and cruel criminals who tried to go - but the story (Eg The BREAKFAST CLUB meets DIE HARD) or not? Full of unbelievable situations, ancient characters and many stereotypical characters, and don't forget Dolph Lundgren is the main actor. <br /> <br /> Alex Karzis and Kata Dob√≥ play couples who love Bonnie and Clyde and They give the most acceptable performance of the movie, even though he looks low. Sam Rockwell's budget version and her Milla Jovovich wanted to be in a movie where everything failed, their madness and style gave fresh air enough to prevent my attention from falling to the ground as a center.
