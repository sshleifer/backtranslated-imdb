The theme or other parts of the story are the same as Leon. Then, the other parts feel like other movies. I don't know what they are. But has a familiar feel throughout the movie It's a good thing to watch. But it would be great! If the story is more original The little girl of the bad killer theme from Leon is just a little refinement. The scene is really good :-) It's strange that people like to fight in the kitchen in the movie :-) My biggest problem is remembering which part came from Leon, Nikita and if they come from the French or American model. Didn't see Leonny as a good movie If you like this movie, I recommend Leon. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, / Rick
