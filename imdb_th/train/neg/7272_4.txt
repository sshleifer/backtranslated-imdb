This movie is quite boring. Most of them are silent movies with a lot of stories made through voice-overs. While doing silent movies, this is not a bad idea. But this is one of the movies that lack talk and the first scenes repeatedly make it boring. You do not understand the reason of being boring until it comes into the picture and it is too late. The first 40 minutes of this movie is about a slow Mexican porn movie and a strange soft porn movie. In the movie, the style of the first 40 minutes has a reason. But it was too late because at that time the audience would disappear There is a good filming location at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. I often wonder why this film was not shot more. The campus is built on the edge of a lava field that feels like being on campus. My biggest problem with this film is that the director / writer created the movie the way he wanted to watch, regardless of what the audience didn't know. You can't ignore the audience when you tell the story.
