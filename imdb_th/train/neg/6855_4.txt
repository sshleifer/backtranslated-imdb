Why can't a woman be a strong character in a movie without having to sleep with a leading man? Campaign manager in this movie dreams of bringing Tom Sellick to the White House. It's all she can think of. So why do you have a relationship with him in the world? It doesn't add anything to the plot and only serves successful women. The only value of a delicacy is a lovely scene. "We all slept with your husband." <br /> <br /> Also, did the person who created the movie watch the national meetings they were pretending to be? Discussions between the two major political conventions are only intended to highlight all ignorance of the recruitment and selection process.
