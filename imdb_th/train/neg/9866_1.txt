You want to watch the movie "Gamer" by Dead Gentlemen Productions. This is not that movie. This movie is not funny. It's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> All good comments here seem to be written by a third person. (Disguised badly) The fake people who created this movie seemed to try to synthesize fake interests. <br /> <br /> This film is not ridiculous. Compare with "Spinal Tap" or Christopher Guest insulting <br /> <br /> This film has the meaning of courage that I can't imagine that everyone is familiar with the story that is funny Being able to laugh with yourself is an important feature. But if you are a sarcastic person in this way, you must hate yourself to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The movie is not nasty. Grand satire of prohibited topics But due to poor stubbornness
