I like movies that have traces of the story at least. This didn't happen in this movie. It is a short series of articles that do not stick together. <br /> <br /> There are scenes of people who collect pineapple cans. Women with blonde wigs never take off sunglasses. This woman shot another person at the beginning of this movie and we never knew why. She completely disappeared after about 30 minutes. There was another woman who was coquettish. There are endless scenes in fast-food restaurants where Mamas & Papas 'California Dreaming' plays a huge role. (I used to like music) Most conversations relate to food. (Pineapple, salad, chef, and drink order ??) I think most actors take weight during this film because of the fast food consumption. <br /> <br /> There is no passion in this movie because No matter This is true love - it's not like that. I'm just wondering why I didn't press the Fast-forward button. I'm still waiting for something important to happen? It's not. Maybe that's the only consolation of this movie - the scene changes so quickly that you think that there will be a revelation of all nonsense.
