While I was never a fan of the traditional Scooby-Doo (due to the terrible production value) but it seems that Shakespeare compared to this crap pile brought to us by Hanna. There is no doubt that Scrappy-Doo is the most annoying and scary character created for children (including Teletubbies and Tommy the Tapeworm). Who's the brightest idea is to create a mutant dog. Some short and open to speak and then saddle the character Scooby-Doo! Anyone who deserves to die or see this program (I think death is better.) The most important thing is that small dogs are annoying, annoying and grotesque animals - and this is just a better episode !! After many years, it would be better to finish the franchise than create this mess! I can see why in the Scooby-Doo action movie, they created the Scrappy-Doo villain because everyone hates him!
