Lorne Michaels once again proved that he doesn't have a movie production business. <br /> <br /> You think that after the melancholy flicks like "Superstar", "Night at the Roxbury" and "Coneheads", he wants to start thinking. That sometimes he doesn't know what he does when talking about movies (And many argue that he does not know what he did when talking about television) trying to create a documentary film from a game that was not welcomed for the third time with SNL. Unreasonable. <br /> <br / > I personally like Tim Meadows and think that he will be good at the right thing. It is a shame to see people who have lost their ability in a movie that presents an unsightly situation after the situation. Not smooth, and end with song and dance scene, too bad. The laughter here is because the movie is terrible, not because it's funny. <br /> <br /> Okay, at least we have to thank that there are many tired SNL characters who have never made a movie about them. Come first. It's terrible that this makes the big screen.
