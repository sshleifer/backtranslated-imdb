Baby issues are one of the worst movies I've ever seen in the last decade! This is a bad movie about a cruel boy who two parents raised. But he has a problem The junior person can drive his grandfather's car. He can make people afraid of bears. He can put the room in the fire! It's a movie that's not as good as BATTLEFIELD EARTH. The sequel is a terrible fate. Rent RUN Kai instead. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 from **** I gave it
