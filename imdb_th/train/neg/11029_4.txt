Anyone who visits the drive-in in the 1950s, 60s and 70s must see one or two films by American International Pictures, a distributor that resembles the 1980s giant Cannon Films. Whenever movie viewers AIP will be there to provide the latest movie en vogue - in the 1950s, horror movies such as 'Voodoo Woman' and 'The Undead' Glory Stompers; 'and in the In the 70s, AIP produced Grindhouse trash, such as 'Cannibal Girls' and 'Sugar Hill'. <br /> <br /> 'Dillinger', which was launched in 1973, is one of AIP's efforts to capture the true spirit of Making movies It is one of the uneven movies and is a popular movie that satisfies the masses for entertainment, crafts and common sense. Overall, 'Dillinger' is normal for the era of entertainment and a few worthwhile. Hour But certainly not memorable Hard and short performances, both acting and history 'Dillinger' is a fair effort for director of screenplay John Magnum Force, but leaves the room to develop his extensive career. <br /> <br /> 'Dillinger '109 minutes - The ultimate scope of AIP - Follow the mission of Melvin Purvis, FBI Midwest FBI leader, played by Ben Johnson, the Oscar winner. Purvis was a detective who tried to avenge four FBI agents killed in 1933 in Kansas City, helping the villain Frank Nash escape justice. In a broad sense, people are planning to have a breakout, including professional banker John Dillinger. (Warren), Pretty Boy Floyd (Steve Canali) and the Baby Nelson priest Finally Dillinger joined Floyd and Nelson with Homer Van Meter. (Harry Dean Stanton) and Harry Pearson, the sponsor. (Geoffrey Lewis) Harry He also was courted by Billie Frechette (Michelle Phillips) is a prostitute, the French and Indian extraction. While several months in 1933-4, 'Dillinger' was a chase movie with Purvis's followers looking to run down and kill the people he wanted by J. Edgar Hoover. <br /> <br /> 'Dillinger' has a documentary feel, a list of dates and locations, while Johnson tells the loose story as Purvis Milius maintains the look of an economic downturn faithfully using genuine fashion, cars, weapons and buildings. In addition, he sprinkled around black and white photography. This movie is never boring, moving fast if strangely stepped. Action scenes are the strengths of Dillinger, which was edited by Fred Feitshans Jr in his professional endeavors. Thousands of empty ammunition must be used to make this film, not to mention explosives. This film is not intended for nausea as people are shot and dumped throughout the place. Violence, while unreasonable, brings an understanding of the crimes that have been left in the lives of Americans. <br /> <br /> This film has never crossed the status of exploitation. But because the necessary writing was not there John Milius played a role as a producer too. Action scenes (mostly a bloody penalty spot) were impressive and comparable to the major crime movies of that time, including 'Bonnie and Clyde' in 1967, but we didn't know much about Dillinger and his gang members as people. The important relationship between Dillinger and Frechette is hardly touching when they meet at the bar in one scene and spend time with their loved ones only ten minutes later. It seems that Melvin Purvis will walk in and out of the story, becoming an important person when Michele wants to prevent the film from unraveling. Often this film plays an important character in the detailed survey. <br /> <br /> In addition to this, the main crime of the image is historical ignorance. While many people say 'Dillinger' is just a movie. But it's a movie like this that creates a story and makes them permanent Those who have knowledge about gangster history will point out that John Dillinger is not the last person to die because of Milius's screenplay and the documentary style of the film encourages us to believe. In fact, Dillinger died before Baby Face Nelson and Homer Van Meter; He is said to not hold a gun on the night of his death, and he does not have Billy Frechette's trailer, while these inaccuracies may be created for the high drama. But there is no reason why Milius was unable to live with the facts and write a wonderful story around them. <br /> <br /> Warren Oates's performance due to Dillinger is quite good, sometimes unreliable. Oates is a funny person and shows how Dillinger consumes a bigger image than his life in the American media. However, we never felt the danger he called in his life. Ben Johnson gives life to Purvis. But rather flat, Michelle Phillips brought the emotion to the characters of Billie Frechette and it was terrible that Milius's script did not show a relationship with Dillinger. We never learned what attracted her to be a cold-blooded killer, in addition to the image of a girl who was easily attracted to danger. The supporting roles with Kanaly, Dreyfuss, Stanton, Lewis and Cloris Leachman, which appear briefly, are acceptable for such abilities. <br /> <br /> As a piece of exploitation in 1970s, which is what I chose to buy MGM DVD for $ 4.99. This movie was well presented on the widescreen. (Things that must be in the drive flick) with French and Spanish subtitles Dillinger's movie trailer is specially created alone. Forgetting except for movie fans, gangsters, and those who are crazy about driving, this movie doesn't claim anything more than other supplementary media for fans of this genre. Of course, it's worth it to check out. > <br /> ** From 4 <br /> <br /> Roving reviewer - www.geocities.com/paul_johnr
