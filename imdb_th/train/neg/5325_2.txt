Critics from Poland have to be feminists because she finds that "Young Catherine" is a great and accurate movie in the past. Nothing will be further from the truth. As a Russian historian who has practiced for many years, I have excluded the YC almost every turn, and especially her politically correct description as the boss who moved Russia to one direction. She was taken to St.Petersburg To be a wife and mother only and found that she had to "bond" with dvoriane, the boyars and the army just to survive As long as she doesn't challenge them, she can / be allowed to indulge in her cultural desires. (Filling Hermitage with artistic properties, etc.) There are many proofs that she is not "excellent", but in this part of the revision that is not popular, YC is just a flaky costume From Ted Turner, like Peter the Great in 1986, is another example that shows that Russia has a bad image in the west.
