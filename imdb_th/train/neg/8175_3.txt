The mood of this movie is quite good and it gives a feeling of being 80s with good performances. <br /> <br /> However ..... <br /> <br /> The script has already been done. The mill, except for a few minutes of funny moments and came off as a strange person, I expect it to be frustrating. The characters are too dramatic and unbelievable and full of ancient ideas that script writers might see watching a documentary on the national front line. The biggest problem is that this movie has no real story. It marks the correct "arty" box, but nothing actually happens and at the end you wonder what the point is. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing.
