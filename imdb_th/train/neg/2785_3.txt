I know that some movies (I mean: European movies), which are not very good movies, are regarded as excellent movies from some "critics" only because they are not Americans. I see the score 8.1 IMDB For this film and noticed the fact that this was chosen for the great festival Don't let this fool you! Unless you are one of those people who like to watch movies that are stupid like this and call it the great art. After that, skip it! This film has one hilarious scene after another (similar, Italy, the movie popped into my mind. PREFERISCO IL RUMORE DEL MARE AWESOME (I like the sound of the sea). Problems with these movies are them. Not only But boring as with other commendable movies, but they almost played like a camp I mean, let's go ahead. The performance is awesome (I mean: opera class). The story is not surprising. (This story ended like never before, much better.) It's not a real character like that. (There are some people who truly look strange during the way of observing daughters like zombie hilarious) and others etc. <br /> <br /> As if not enough This film is 135 minutes (count it!) Long and eventually the director opens a can of compassion. After the movie with such bad dialogue and the scene that made the public to screen the movie, laughing incompetently ... This is an insult to the movie and only received high ratings. In this case, Spain The strange world that we live in ... 3/10
