Need to have an excuse to leave the house while dry - leave the movie after one hour to come back and see the color that is dry. <br /> <br /> I don't remember ever going to see a movie. Come first but i really try The script doesn't depend on the actors and just "keep on going". Not good - come in! Did Utherman do this? Special technique, rather lame These are the characters and actors who are over 20 years old who live superficial - just the annoying and wrong feelings. <br /> <br /> This review is based on the first hour only - it may be good. up I have to go home and see if the color is dry than the shade.
