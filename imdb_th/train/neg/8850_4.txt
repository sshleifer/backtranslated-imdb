Now this movie will not make anyone afraid. But it's interesting for two reasons - two reasons, big and small - good. That's three reasons. Not it. <br /> <br /> The first reason to do this is a special effect. I found them interesting and quite exciting. To see the hair that grows on Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning is especially creepy, especially when they are involved in ménageà trois. <br /> <br /> Interesting is the fact that Marsha Hunt is famous "Sugar" of Rolling Stones and she is in the infamous nude scene in the performance of rock musicians in London. <br /> <br /> In addition to special effects, there are two notes in This movie And they were repeatedly brought out during the closing credits I lost count But I swear that Sybil Danning separated those points for us in at least a dozen off credits and probably more. They are the most outstanding feature of this film.
