LAGE RAHO MUNNABHAI is a really disappointing movie. I saw the first part of MUNNABHAI and it was really good. But this one really disappointed me ........................... ............ <br /> <br /> This movie Really waste your time and money. I went with my friend in this movie on the first day of the release and both were bored in the cinema hall. .......................... ........................ .... <br /> <br /> The role of the circuit is very small and useless in this movie. I think SANJAY-DUTT reduces the role of ARSHAD VARSHI down ............ ............ <br /> <br /> The characters of this movie too. It is not clear as before. This film shows the results of confidence ......... <br /> <br /> MAHATMA's ideas are not yet determined and confusing. ............. <br /> <br /> Really great disappointment
