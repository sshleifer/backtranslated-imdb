Ya, I rent it, so shoot me. <br /> <br /> Good evidence, set an awkward thing, other without real rewards. But at least it shoots well. Director Jon Keeyes takes the simple idea of ​​a fake haunted house with real dangers inside. In most cases, this should be a slam dunk, but this small smelly person happens quickly. Movies are higher than average and performances are the best. But the story and the writing are very bad. The slower scenes will be dragged forever and the fear will be too little and far between each other without the true climax of the movie Creepy mood is set at the beginning. But lost luster before having any horrible images and I found myself bored to die and make sandwiches ... the cover image is attractive and I think it is worth the rental For a reasonably low budget wreck But if you enjoy a good story and an important end, go find something else.
