In my life I have seen many wonderful and scary movies. I'm not an expert in professional reviews. But I have something to say about this First of all, these actors are the worst people I have ever seen ... Their performances are not real until you want to leave the DVD in the first 2 minutes. I think these actors don't care about quality. <br /> < br /> Another terrible thing about these conversations - they are very weak. Sometimes you feel uneasy when hearing. It seems that your 14 year old son will do better. I feel that this movie has a budget similar to my 14 year old European car ... <br /> <br /> Please, if my message comes to you - save your time and money.
