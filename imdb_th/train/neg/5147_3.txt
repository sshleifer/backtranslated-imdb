"Blue Desert" may have the potential to be a more reliable and happy thriller than the main character, Lisa Roberts. (Courtney Cox) is not a fool When she was the victim of another attack on the streets of New York comic book artists, Roberts moved to a small town in the west on her first day. There, she met Randall Atkins. (Craig Sheffer plays this question very well, suspiciously) which will not leave her. With fear after being in this situation two times before, she made an appointment to meet the suspicious friendships and relationships with the city police. Believing in the red bird flock that the writer threw), Smith needed the cooperation of Robert because while he told her Atkins was a former prisoner and guilty of rape. But the police still lack the evidence to bring him out. <br /> <br /> The film has enough ploys to create an interesting movie, at least fast, with confusion that Robert should trust. However, most of the skepticism seems to be too oppressive because Robert's character never responds to the simple things that we think the right person might be. And her delayed response caused many suspects to happen easily and unbelievably, especially at the end. Perhaps Sweeney may be the wrong choice for this role. Too young, faced with a way of remembering that Kevin Anderson's personality appeared in his character in 'Sleeping With the Enemy' or if Lisa Roberts wrote a stronger character. May suffice as well At the same time, this film is not as great as it should be, even as a cheap B thriller.
