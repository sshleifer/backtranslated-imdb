This film was recently released on DVD in the United States and I finally had the opportunity to see this rare gem. It also comes with the original drama samples of other classic Italian horror movies, such as "SPASMO" and "BEYOND THE DARKNESS". Unfortunately, the preview is the best thing about this movie. <br /> <br / > "ZOMBI 3" in a form that is really strange and linked to the infamous Lucio Fulci "ZOMBIE" which began in 1979. Similarly, compared to "ZOMBIE" "," ZOMBI 3 "consists of plot A flaky and very bad actor who kept Each 'horror' is barely afloat. Blood almost does not exist. (Unless someone is afraid of running around with green moss on the face) and the English dub is below embarrassing. <br /> <br /> The story at this time involves some sort of Military secret operations with a group of unskilled scientists (Such as stupid men and stupid women) who are developing some chemicals called "Death One" which should make the dead alive again In addition to my ears being checked, I do not remember the REASON for research. "Death One" seems to exist only to create a disaster for the poor souls who make mistakes in choosing to be 'celebrities'. In this laughing drama, <br /> <br /> However, "Death One" was tried on the corpse. I swear, like Yul Brynner) and after it was injected into his system, he sat straight and his head exploded! The sound effect is quite hilarious - when the face of the corpse has green slime, can hear the sound. "Paper Crumpled Paper" can be toxic. "Death One" is sent outside and is 'hi-jacked' by the bandit who has done it. But infected himself after cutting himself on an open bottle. <br /> <br /> There's no need to say The man became a zombie. But not before he escaped to a cheap, infectious motel, carrying luggage and killing the housewife by pushing her face to the bathroom mirror (!). The soldiers caught the current of this matter and proceeded immediately before 'eliminating' every People who are unfortunate enough to be in 'Contamination zone' and turning the hotel upside down They found an infected thief and burned his body just to get the smoke caught by the birds that were flying over the chimney chimney (!) <br /> <br /> We cut off the recommendations of the people who Resigned from the army and listened to the 'Groovy music' that came out of the little voice box while dragging the trailer of a cool girl who was leaning out of the window and showing their ark Who can say "Zombie food". In addition, we have a sub-map related to the girl and her boyfriend driving a car that stops to check the group of birds that are lying on the road ... the same bird that is infected by smoke ' Zombies'! <br /> <br /> The birds attack the fans and the girls drive away at the abandoned gas station to search for water. This was one of the most funny moments in the movie. She walked around the old buildings that were dirty, rusty and clearly abandoned, which she still asked loudly. "Hello, is there anyone else here? Please don't. I need some water!" She found a group of zombies, one of which was chained to the wall (!) And the other swung the sword. After a loud noise and rolling on the ground, she escaped. But not before exploding the gas pump with her lighter. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the bird attacked the trailer, loading the prostitute and a woman pecking and infecting them. All pulled up to the motel. Same as the original infection and this is the most hilarious moment in this movie After a few hours (Most one day) Now, this hotel is covered with dust, with vines growing up and it seems that it has been abandoned for many years. What better way to escape than this building? Needing to say that the group began to collapse because many people walked together to get themselves stuck in an incredibly stupid situation associated with a zombie attack. <br /> <br /> A very hilarious moment. The third most relevant to men and women Explore an abandoned village where the woman commented that "This place is a garbage dump!" Then she proceeded to 'push' out of the balcony by the zombies into pirahna (?). The water she was bitten on her legs and turned into zombies within seconds! At the same time, her friends go back to the motel that was pecked and the infected hour before still turning into zombies! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is too much dissonance in this film that makes this film too stupid. For example, the rate of the time of the infected person being 'zombified' is very different. Sometimes it takes a few seconds, sometimes it takes hours. Some zombies are running, some dragging their feet and walking slowly. Some people even move kung fu while others hide under the hay to surprise people. Some zombies are talking about! The most fun time is definitely 'The Zombie Head in the Fridge' is infamous for 'elevating' yourself in the air and 'attacking' an idiot that goes to find food. Enough fun for his girlfriend to be torn by the head without a head (LMAO!) <br /> <br /> The greatest disappointment for me, even though there are no stories related to the people in The truth is killed by zombies. We have never seen them return like zombies. Actually, only those of us who saw 'zombies' were animals that were pecked by birds and a woman who had bitten her legs. At least I was expecting couples killed in the kitchen and / or people killed on the bridge to return to be zombies. It is also amazing that these zombies only take 'Bite a few people' and then go to the next victim. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous moment in life is the zombie in the womb. Pregnant women infected in a hospital bed Women who seem to have Many 'medical knowledge' try to send a baby (!) And have her face pulled out by a zombie before having her head pushed into the belly of a woman whose hand burst out and proceed to tear. The rest of her face has no time. <br /> <br /> As usual, all the characters are the perfect image of this genre. Military officer megalomaniacal A poor aimless woman who screams to be killed, the obvious character that is about to be killed. (For example, watching the chase man!) I think this movie is a joke. There are many ridiculous scenes, such as a grenade with a grenade. (Obviously, it is a scene that uses all budgets) and a climatic scene in which a man screams. "I am the third person .... for your blood!". The costume is not really good - the same zombie appears again throughout the movie's time. 'Like Asia' that may be found in the Bruce Lee movie and beware of the 60s blue skirts of a girl at the motel. Wearing when she and her boyfriend collide with an infected person <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, open the door as usual for the story of Sansai. Radio DJs who tell stories throughout the story become zombie themselves and warn listeners about 'The Beginning of the End' While two survivors boarded the material helicopter "DAWN OF THE DEAD", hardly if you asked me. <br /> <br /> No matter how much this movie will produce a lot of laughter The blood is low and the thing is that it is very unbelievable. Normal blending of venous blood, thick green thick substance from crying wounds and "Zombie Makeup" consists of a green moss "ZOMBI 3". Ideal for party parties or beer and popcorn at night. In addition, horror fans should stay away. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
