I found that this movie is terrible. First of all, it is not very objective and one-sided discussion. There is only one person who has been presented as a faction that says he has a group of people who came from the revival of Billy Grahm. Secondly, it deviates heavily from the topic that Jesus (Yeshua) actually exists. In order to talk about the violence of Christianity and show images from Mel Gibson's "obsession". In the end, the director interviewed former private school principals and tried to trap Whether he's about teaching kids to have faith Oh, and Techno Music makes the film look more difficult.
