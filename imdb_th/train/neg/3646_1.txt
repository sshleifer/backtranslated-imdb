Oh ... My God ... This is without a doubt the most wonderful movie I've ever seen. The performance is not good, the story is weak, the characters are weak and all the movies are not reasonable. Pair this with a normal director, a strange scene (such as a scene in which the boy reaches into the valley and the mystery) and a deep dialogue ("Look!" Failed, not to mention the fact that the only thing that Mr. Atlas seems to be able to overcome is the chocolate bar case. But this is part of the charm of the movie. Sit down and watch with a few of your friends for a laugh. <br /> <br /> I love this movie because it's terrible!
