DeNiro is a master ... one of my favorites And i love good sports movies {Not very baseball But hey, it's a sports movie, right? I expect more for this movie. It seems to be a good start: DeNiro is what I expected. Snipes {that I don't like} is very good, like the star that was robbed. Barkin's role for me is ok. She is a good actor. But does not seem to be in this role For me, they always seem to hasten that scene and drag it to another location. It looks like I'm not balanced! Considering the characters and the story, it should be much better. I rate '4' and I'm generous ~ I am a person with a lot of numbers!
