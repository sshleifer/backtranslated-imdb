This movement reminds me of a story from the Crypt Keeper. It has the same idea that people get what they deserve. I think it's always the story of Crypt. For bad performances Terrible performance I enjoy movies that know that most people don't like it and I don't expect much. Whenever I watch Stephen King movies, I don't expect much because all of his films are terrible compared to the genius of the novel. I read The Shining and Carrie. They're a great book. I like it. That Carrie plays like it is true and the whole book is a report and many theories are great, but I noticed that both novels are nothing like movies. The ending is very different then the movie version. I assumed from both novels that all of his novels have changed dramatically and the ending is a wonderful story. Thinner's ending is the worst. So wonderful. I want to read the book to find the true end. I encourage everyone who intends to read Stephen King's novel to see his movie first hand so you can compare. And how much you will be satisfied in this book I intend to do that with all his novels made into movies. I am sure that they become movies. They are really good books ... and the screenplay is very wrong.
