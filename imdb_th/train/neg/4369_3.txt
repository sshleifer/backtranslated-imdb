*** Spoiler *** *** Spoiler *** Juggernaut is a British "thriller" game that was released in America by First National Karloff as Dr. Sartorius, who had to leave. His research because of his drought money, Karloff was forced to retreat to France and start medical practice. He was offered by a girl who wanted to get rid of her older husband. She knows that Carlos wants money. <br /> <br /> Carlos agrees with the proposal and soon becomes the husband's private doctor. While the wife was walking around the city with local people without a good playboy, Karloff eventually injected the old hot springs with poison and he kicked out. However, his son (From marriage again) arrived a few days before the murder and found that there would be a change. When he spilled the beans for her wife, she was berserked and even the son's hand bitten. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Carlos's nurse put Carloff, who had killed an old man. When Carlos learns that he has not received the money, he asks his wife to poison the son. The nurse suspects that Carlos and the people are lost. Toxicity analysis But not so long ago, when Carlos kidnapped the nurse, <br /> <br /> To make the short story short, the nurse escaped the police and managed to save the son who was being injected by Karloff Karloff. /> <br /> This film has some good points. Carlos is obsessed and shows the type of mad doctor he has done in the command of the devil and the living man again. However, it is strange to see him walking around as tense and slightly curved. We never knew why he had walked this way. I wonder if the director thinks it makes him more scary. <br /> <br /> Actress who plays with wife 2 strokes doing something very bad. She has a French accent. Even if you do too much, you still hate her. (Or maybe you hate you because of your performance ...) <br /> <br /> A little below average for Carlos If you buy a Sinister Cinema VHS copy, the sound will change slightly.
