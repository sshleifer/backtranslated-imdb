This is a direct vibration to the video of the Tremors series, which has sixty seconds of inspiration (saw blades: you will know when you see) and boredom and filler than you shake. Shot clearly in a very low budget. This means that they have enough special effects for three to four minutes of violence on human worms. Boring and unskilled dubbing writers and actors ensure that the remaining time and half of the Tremors 4 experience is at least fifty thousand years old. Only hardcore Tremors fans can pass Can enter If you are not among them - don't worry.
