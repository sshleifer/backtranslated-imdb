Okay, so I discovered about this movie and I watched the preview, read almost all reviews, and had a hard time discussing whether or not to watch. Before I watched this movie, I felt strange. I'm not sure if I would watch this story and be disturbed for a long time. So I choose to take risks and see and what I think: Beginners start well for me. Seems to be heading in the right direction Through the rape scene and I can't think of why people are disturbed or bored by movies. Don't let me misunderstand that the rape scene is sad and scary. But it didn't bother me in an amazing spot When the middleman came in, I understood the boring things that happened. Like nothing in 5 minutes, but people walking around, talking or showing anything! It is one story that will have a shock with someone showing some emotions. But this movie has no It has about 3 pointless scenes where you see the main characters of the uncontrollable Maya. But it didn't show that it was right, so I wanted to move forward quickly. Then, when she joined a hardcore party, it wasn't boring. But still boring Oh and as a note, Rosario Dawson still works well. Eventually, OK went on to finally go after the pointless hour in the middle of the hour. Revenge came from Maya's attention. That is what it is disturbing. I didn't feel bad about him or nothing that he received what he deserved. But the whole scene was really annoying and I felt so frustrated after that. I can't tell you whether or not to watch this movie because it's ... I don't know if I can find a word to summarize it or not. But if you choose to watch it, it will not be canceled.
