See this on DVD in the original language, along with English sub-categories. The subtitles are not very good or the actual conversations do not create much stories and character development. In this film there are only a few Hong Kong celebrities. But this film does not require their presence to make it better or worse. It's terrible. The bright and colorful scenes made in CG are attractive for true color and brilliance. But it can be overwhelming soon If there is anything that reminds me of a children's movie with the non-stop partition of cg, fighting scenes and shit plot I'm sure I understand what happened in this movie. But all the stories that were sent were quite nasty.
