This is the type of movie that I'm most afraid of. It was arrogant and irresponsible. It was a sketch presentation of the conflict of the Colombian people. So cliched and dumb. It was an insult to all Colombians. The performance was godawul from Grisales (her very poor nude scene) to Bejarano to Fanny Mickey (which looks out of Tim Burton's nightmare) to Díaz, who strives to make life as a character - three-dimensional, cliched and poorly written. Leaving it to work with is a mustache No need to mention the ending without the horrific festive reason that Ed Wood flattering. It failed in all aspects of film, direction, art, costume, make-up, editing and most directors Jorge Alí Triana were lousy filmmakers. But at least his previous film has some dignity I can't say anything good about losing this money, except that I hope Colombian filmmakers will learn lessons about honesty, integrity and responsibility from failures intended to be made.
