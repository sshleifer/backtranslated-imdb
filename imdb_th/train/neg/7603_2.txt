I'm blunt, I'm not one of the politically correct movies that this woman plays with bad characters who won't receive anything from anyone. If one of the cast members wants, they may take her out with a heart beat. It's fun with MST 3K, but don't rent the real version. Believe me. Have I lied to you?
