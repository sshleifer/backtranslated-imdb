The only thing I will talk about cats in the hat ... is KIDS and good comedy movies. It sucks ... I follow that there are many scary jokes in the movie that not only suck but not. Can 'children not be right? Oh, and by the way the cat in the talk hat is annoying ... for the story that I've forgotten Anyone who cares about it sucks I'm not sure why Mike Myers joined But I think writers try to make him look like he has power in Austin without talking at swinger and being too successful - but the thing that is annoying is not seeing it - it's in the lowest 100 ... .......................... The funniest gags are without thought. It's funny.
