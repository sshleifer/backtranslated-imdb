This movie makes it one of my top 10 scariest movies. <br /> <br /> There is no time to fight with one of the monsters. There is no chance for character development. They are too busy to run from one sword to another. I have no emotional attachment. (Except for the large bad machines that want to destroy them) <br /> <br /> The blatant scenes from LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix, <br /> <br /> For example, <br /> <br />> The ghost scene at the end was stolen from the last scene of the old Star Wars with Yoda, Obee One and Vader. <br /> <br />> The first spider machine is like Aphrodite. Dole is attacked by a spider in the Return of the Kings (Elijah Wood is a victim in both films) and waits ...... it's hypnotic ( ) Its victim and wrapped it ..... uh hello ???? <br /> <br />> And the whole machine model compared to humans is Matrix..or Terminator ..... < br /> <br /> There are additional examples But why waste time And some people will tell me what happened to the Nazis?!?! ???? Nazi <br /> <br /> There are stories of children and youth running into the summary of children and youth. The movie cannot decide whether it is a movie for children or an adult movie. <br /> <br /> Terrible, real disappointments to say the least. Save money.
