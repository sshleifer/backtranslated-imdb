Lynn Hollister, a small town lawyer, travels to a nearby town to contact the business of Johnny's death. (Yes, Lynn is a man, although the Christian name that sounds like a woman, the playwright is trying to refer to the fact that John Wayne's birth name is "Marion"?) At first, Hall Lister believes that Johnny's death But soon realized that Johnny had been killed The investigation further reveals the web of corruption, crime and election control linked to the political leader Cameron Boss. <br /> <br /> Looks like a plot. Scary crime thriller The film noir style, which became popular in 1941, was not "betrayed by men." Despite the content of a romantic comedy that was lighter than crime, Hollister fell in love with Cameron's attractive daughter, Cameron and this film Focusing on the love that follows the doubt. <br /> <br /> This movie may be used if it is made straightforward. A drama. Said John Wayne was unbelievable to be a lawyer But he could not play cowboys in every movie, and the crusade attorneys who had the power to commit crimes could be in the circle That I agree with the examiner is that when he said that Wayne had no identity, Cary Grant Romantic comedy, not on his street One of the weaknesses of the studio system is that actors may want to play any part that their boss demands, whether they are on the road or not, and when Wayne is one of the few people working with Republic Pictures. There is no doubt that he will get the most miles possible That doesn't reflect his comic ability. It reflects the lack of humor in this film. I wonder if anyone, no matter how good the humor will develop The sound of this film doesn't make it a successful comedy. It just prevents being taken seriously otherwise. This is one of the movies that are not fish or meat or poultry or good red herring. 3/10
