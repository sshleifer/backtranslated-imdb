Why have to see this There is only one reason and that is for the greatness of John Saxon. I love his performance. The thing that I like most now is Nightmare On Elm Street 1,3 and 7 as Nancy's father, the Black Christmas Police as a policeman, and again from Dusk Till Dawn as a police officer. When I was searching for a video store in a local department store, I found the Zombie Death House movie and I threw it back quickly. But before moving, I noticed that John Saxon was not only an actor in this movie. Heard the director This makes me amazed. (Such as a cheap price tag $ 9.00) and me and I must have When I returned home, I knew that this film was not at the other Saxon work, even his performance, which may have been confused by the increasing pressure from directing. But it's not just him that other actors will suck as well. It seems that all of them have been pulled out of pornographic pornography recently and said that now you have to act really. The movie also looks porn in the 1980s. Honestly, I can't recommend this movie to General audience But if you are a big fan of the 80s who have missed the culture that came from that era, born in line or are more shit fans. If you dig John Saxon like me
