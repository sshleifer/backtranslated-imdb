A model named Laura works in South America when she is kidnapped from her hotel room by the gang and is taken into the forest. They need a lot of ransom for her release. Peter is hired to take her home safely and there is a bonus for him if he can bring the money back as well as girls. Peter is taken to the forest by helicopter with Jack's friend. They tried to give fake money to the kidnappers in exchange for Laura. But the plan was horribly wrong and they had to bail with a helicopter. The helicopters were shot and they still had to bail from that (go badly). Surfing in the forest was a terrible thing. In fact, it's just a black man with strange big eyes and breathing problems. He began to kill the robbers, kidnappers and Laura, fleeing only a few places that were originally captured. The rest of the film is a bit blurred. <br /> <br /> Right now I'm not a big Jess Franco fan. Actually, until now, this is just his second movie that I've seen. I can tell that this is not one of his best efforts. This movie is going slowly, without much happening. The whole thing can be solved quite easily on the TV program. 25 minutes. There is a long shot of people walking through the forest which may be lifted straight out. <br /> <br /> Devil Hunter has a bad light ( Infact, I don't think it's going to be bright.) Acting badly and slowly. But for some reason it doesn't make me bored I think the main reason for this is some bad scenes in it. For example, the scene in which Laura was walking on the street was shot in a real street because many people stopped staring at the camera while shooting. Another funny scene, there is a gang that was killed, hung in a tree with blood drops, because one of his friends stood beneath him screaming at what looked like a few minutes. Then there was no reason for every man in the tree to fall from and hit the man under him. Must be seen to believe Of course, there are real demons. It was only a naked black man, despite the fact that he had big eyes. But he had a blurred vision. <br /> <br /> The film was stuck in the scary video section of the 80s in which Britain was banned. Now, why don't I know? There was very little blood and almost no shock. Remove the nude pictures that I can say that they can escape with PG. Almost the only thing I can think of is that it never really looks and is added to the original list because of word of mouth. <br /> <br / > There is no reason to watch this movie unless you are a big person. Jess Franco fans have a lot of pornography that will prevent you from falling asleep and some very bad scenes. You can laugh at them, but others. That I would say that just cant afford a ticket to South America and disappeared into the woods. It should be more fun. <br /> <br /> 3/10
