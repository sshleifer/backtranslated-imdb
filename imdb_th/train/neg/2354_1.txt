I don't want to call this film - it's a movie that shouldn't have won any awards. The performance is horrible like in a foolish situation. This is a type of movie that a lot of people think is suitable for NRI audiences. But in reality, foreign hatred and overwhelming "trying" feelings in the movie. Strange that many actors who are familiar with English have a difficult time doing this in front of the camera. I'm sure many readers know what I'm talking about - all English phrases thrown into Hindi movies and in regional theaters for points of interest. There are some Indian movies that truly look real English - Cyrus is the latest movie. Although not a great movie But it's a good movie and the language doesn't look like "put" The background is quite catchy. In addition, don't waste time on this movie.
