This movie is terrible. The story involves a woman trying to find out what happened to her sister. This movie fights with one's self by lurking from noir / thriller to erotic. This film has a confusing structure, such as being used backward, often unexpectedly. The plot is poorly developed and the characterization makes it difficult to distinguish who it is and which parts to play. Some unbelievable things exist in many movies. But the scene in which the main supporter was willing to come with a virtual stranger at his home, then agreed to go upstairs alone (Which he said she would find the phone) erased the gun that she called the police too hard to believe Some movies are not very good: we are watching a 42 inch TV so everyone with a small scene can figure out what happened in a scene that was almost perfect in dark
