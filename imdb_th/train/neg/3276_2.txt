80s TV show updated with fresh meat of women and porn language "The Dukes of Hazzard" passed me; Unique every time I am in front of the TV, either in New York or California. Or i might watch Still from somewhere (For example, a clip that came with the 2005 movie update) I know it's about the Dodge Dodge Charger and the fast orange - "General Lee" is still good. <br /> <br /> Seann William Scott's cousin And Johnny Knoxville (as Bo and Luke Duke) are the new riders of Orange Sage. Jessica Simpson is beautiful (like Daisy) fulfilling her short-term flaws - but even Her pink bikini will not be able to overcome the competition from the dormitory. With the coeds bare, the stupid plot associated with Burt Reynolds (while "Boss" Hog) in gray threatens to turn Hazzard into a mine. <br /> <br /> ** Dukes of Hazzard (7/27/05) ~ Seann William Scott, Johnny Knoxville, Jessica Simpson, Burt Reynolds
