The king is dead. Stay alive! The third group of Caddy Shack Two, The Family under the stairs and Troop Beverly Hills is bound to the worst movie of all time, until they look like icons in their own right. But there is a new king ..... hmmm, everyone praises the new king .... "to the world" but something like Tiny Tim is terrible. That mimics not being a cult movie So go and see this thing .... This one .... Just take my word to see. Everyone praises the new king!
