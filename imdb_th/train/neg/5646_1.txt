The most stupid act of speculation about a man who killed his wife by cutting her down while driving and claimed that he had been extinguished. Why is he still driving? Why did he still feel able to drive a car that killed his wife with the same car? This question does not occur with writers. Then the story arose about the psychologist and her failed marriage, linked to the failed marriage of the driver who killed his wife. A knowledgeable and one-dimensional mother was thrown into a good temple, and all created for the storyline, predictable stories, and the ending collapse. Is the police psychologist easily arrested? Dangerous writings that actors do their best too. But they failed This is always with Harlequin Romance. Don't waste your time watching this thing unless it's your goal.
