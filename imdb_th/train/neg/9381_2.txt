Mona, a homeless person, lives in a French society in a life without meaning, purpose or direction. <br /> <br /> I watched this story because of all star reviews. But I was afraid that I had to miss something. Mona's character had a lot of personality or not while drifting through a rude life with people and did nothing with anyone's life. She's not interesting or exciting. She is useless. <br /> <br /> I've seen and known enough people like that: There is no secret meaning to what they are doing. They are lazy. I do not want Mona to be near me because she tends to steal things that are not nailed and leave her friends in a lurch. Of course, she is a mystery - because nothing gives her many junk, winos and bums that I see as a mystery; I do not want to watch movies about them as well. <br /> <br /> It may be that there is something I have missed all. Otherwise, I suppose that all the reviews are from people who think that French female directors do everything as high art.
