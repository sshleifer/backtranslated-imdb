Watching this movie like I had done for the first time with Turner Classic (identified as "Dangerous Female") can increase your value for the Bogart-Astor version in 1941. Only Ricardo Cortez must get the money From smiling I hope he remembers his dentist and his Brylcreem salesman in his will; They made him an actor. Women are good But no better than that. Okay, Una Merkel is a little better. More interesting is "traditional" Joel Cairo and Mr. Gattman, who has the ability to send a lot of personal tics. But almost nothing changes the atmosphere of successors in the role of Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Humphrey Bogart and Maryster can overcome the major violence of their characters here. Sam Spade and Ruth Wonderley (!) Can't do it. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't absolutely stink. It was there like a large ham. Today's core values ​​are a reminder that great movies like 'Falcon '41 not only occur in levels 1 to 10. I give 4 points, mostly for camera work and supporting players.
