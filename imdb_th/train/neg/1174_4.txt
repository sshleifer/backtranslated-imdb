Eric Rohmer's 'The Lady and the Duke' movie is based on the journals of the English nobility that lived in the French Revolution. But it is a boastful story with a strange backdrop, painted and courtesy tone The most notable thing is the picture of the age of fear that occurs almost entirely in one image from the true act. We see very few ordinary people in this film, and chaos, poverty and a little fear spread from the drawing room of the persecuted. The result is often tedious and eventually does not inform about the forces that sometimes drive society to the brink of destruction; It's a frustrating movie from a famous director.
