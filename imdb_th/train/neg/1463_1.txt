Just think that the real Hitler, who is an expert in propaganda and speech, is a moron that Carly shows him in this movie. <br /> <br /> No one follows him. The guy in the 1920s <br /> <br /> This is just a piece of Hollywood propaganda disguised as <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Carlyle and the producers didn't do anything right in this story. <br /> <br /> Why did Hitler win? Many people have both districts for their ideas if we are sausages like this? Why do people follow him to death? By describing him as a loser, they make their movies truly unbelievable. This film is a mixture of old WW2 propaganda and MTV city legends about one of the most important people of the last century. Imagine a movie about Churchill that the director showed him to be a drunken man for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This film is embarrassing and I wonder if they will talk to one another How to show Carlyle into this wreck
