This is a classic decorator with a big name actor, most of which is a senior who has gone through good times and sleeping in this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a rather depressing movie when you think about it. On the world and you will face illness and finally your death. <br /> <br /> Gwen Vernon shows that she can still dance. Unfortunately, this film does not emphasize that much. The hilarious Maureen Stapleton still shows those steps from the "Queen of the Star Dust Ballroom" more and more from the world 10 years ago. /> I hope this movie will not support the senior. To kill a lot of Jim Jones' levels, everyone will be stupid enough to be like this and say that makes you think. <br /> <br /> Why does Don Am√©e win the Oscar for the lack of money? <br /> <br /> If the elders do that What a wonderful thing at the end. Why did the youth be encouraged to drop a boat? Why did Steve Gattenberg jump into the boat? In the end, he found his young lady's love. <br /> <br /> This would be a good movie if the elder just find the fountain of youth on earth and there. <br /> <br /> Sadly, except for Wilford Brimley in this writing, Vernon, Gilford, Stapleton, Ameche, Tandy, Cronyn and the Lord knew who was missing. The author should bring the screenplay to this group as well.
