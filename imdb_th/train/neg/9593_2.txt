Judging from some comments in IMDB, I expect to have action movies - maybe something that is amazing or easy or simple or funny. I watched, it certainly didn't feel like a movie. The story is simple and straightforward. (Although the prologue tries to make it look complicated) Use three groups of interests: 1) Government 2) Rebels 3) Killer groups <br /> <br /> Now remove the first group. (They never appeared in the movie.) Then let one of the killer princess become a rogue in the vengeance journey. Increase in love, interest, rebellion with conscience And you get the ingredients. <br /> <br /> But they still can't change it into stories or movies. Between the random action scenes and strange images that try to be sci-fi with a low budget, what you left is an empty feeling. This film doesn't feel like a movie. But a strange, intermittent and boring dream. <br /> <br /> Avoid <br /> <br /> 2/10
