The world may end. Unfortunately, this film survived as a testament to Canada's inability to create superior movies. It may be because of our good people (Norman Jewison, Martin Short and the faculty) go to Hollywood.) Actually, it's terrible that Short doesn't act in a movie that pretends to be boring. He may give him some credibility. The Canadian government should be aware - and this film is a great example - the fact that digging money in the trough does not have a positive effect on movies. If the people break the money, these public funds are competitive, they may be forced to think of something worthwhile. As they have produced yet another disgrace
