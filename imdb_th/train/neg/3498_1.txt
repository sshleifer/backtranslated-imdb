I just watched one episode of this program and I couldn't reach the end of the program. Every minute I watch this program, I have to leave about 10 points. This is like a program for children but with swearing, not even swearing and insulting that she tells others to make me laugh. However, the story must be written by the monkey and the person who placed this script for this program through the filming must be held at the gun point and have no choice but to shoot this program that is slowing down. Sarah Silver Mann should use the little money that she created from this program and receive lessons for performing gods.
