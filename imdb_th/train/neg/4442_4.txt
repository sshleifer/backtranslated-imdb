I do not know ... probably because I am a Brazilian But everything is too much Too much love for music, too much party, too much difference between the good life of the main character. (Come, it's not sad) and the aspects of the city that the director expressed Everything looks too fake for me: family, relationships, music, "happiness". It sells Latin Latin culture a little fake. I must be honest: it makes me a little lost But who will not indulge in fake life made from good music, sex and party? I am not a fool, what kind of world do people suffer from diarrhea, profound sadness and sexually transmitted diseases? I like this scene with Caridad's mother's phone and the conversation about the contract with all musicians and Spaniards.
