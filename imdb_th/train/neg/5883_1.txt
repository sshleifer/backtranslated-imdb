This movie has no humor for anyone who has been with a family member who has a mental illness. There are many scenes that remind me of my life experience. This movie is a version of Mommy Dearest. It shows both the correct images and graphics in the lives of many children of the mentally ill parents. It also shows how easily the psychiatrist can deteriorate and act like God. <br /> <br /> Some people say it's funny. There is no way I can speak! It's the best sick joke. <br /> <br /> The film is very intense and makes my son and I have to leave the room. The best use for this movie is for people who do not understand mental illness or do not really believe what our family lives.
