The end of the world looks like a good movie on the box cover. But was warned that it was terrible because it was a big fan of actor Christopher Lee. I was tricked like a mustache (77). A good actor didn't mean that it would be a good movie. The movie became too dull to see what had happened. The remaining actors were briefly shown, such as Lew ayres, dean Jagger and MacDonald Carey. As a security guard, I expected to improve from Charles made the movie more fun and re-animater dolls.i heard Christopher lee is tricked into creating this film. Told his co-star that he would be Jose ferrer, john carridine and Dean Jagger.well dean Jagger were there but the other two had never done (Good luck to them) If you create a movie about the end of the world, use a bigger budget and A better story. Jagger went to make two good movies. After that, the crocodile (80) and the game of death (79) sued Lyon (Lolita). In addition, the movie also removed her lollipop if you were a glutton for punishment The world that I dare you to speak awake throughout the movie 1 of 10
