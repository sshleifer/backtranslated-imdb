This movie is fun. Lea Thompson, Young Joaquin Phoenix ... and Terry O'Quinn in the space. But it is dragged with unattractive characters and no prospects. <br /> <br /> Children Some people go to the space camp and have accidentally launched from their robot friends. The space scene is long and repetitive. (The same accident occurs twice) and either magical or scary depending on your perspective. Adults will feel bored and smiling. Children may be scared because this filming method makes them really scary. <br /> <br /> There is romance. But unlike the shuttle. Why is it included in the first place that is not clear, except it may increase the tension between the characters - but it fails if it is an idea. <br /> <br /> Young Lea Thompson should be strange and Interesting, right? I mean, "Go back to the future". Great. But not. She is annoying and looks good. Not the person you want to meet as a friend or think of a typical Joaquin Phoenix? He was very lucky that he had appeared in the movie again. Maybe he acted like Mikey in the commercials of life cereals. But he seems to not know how to be an ordinary child He doesn't fit the screen and I think we can't identify him at home. In fact, I will be happier if he never returns to the world. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend movies. This to everyone
