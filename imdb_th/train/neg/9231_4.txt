I went to watch this movie, thinking that it would be the next clerk. But left feeling down The humor is weak and the characters are quite flat. That doesn't say it's all bad. The idea of ​​dating in a grocery store seems to be a rich material. But the director changed his focus to the group of ancient people, "Save Mom-and-Pop shop from the bad guy company." More memorable Now, to do justice, I came from the Rochester area and liked the way he showed Webster. In fact, the best respect of Kevin Smith (the clerk) is to give props to his hometown. Webster, New York is the payment. What Red Bank, New Jersey is the clerk. The director threw wisely at Nick Taha's appointment. Trust me as much as possible in Rochester. The garbage sheet is at the top of the list. I was fortunate enough to watch this movie at Little in Rochester so everyone knew that when ode went to the city and appreciated them.
