I have high expectations of this film (the name translates as "How can we get rid of others?"). Finally, this concept is excellent: the near future, which the ruling elite has seized on the consequences of verbal and persecution The law of the right-wing government, commonly called freeloaders and left-wingers, generally decides to leave everyone. Who cannot prove that they are involved in the establishment? (The establishment called "good general" but actually means the interests of the ruling capitalist ideology) <br /> <br /> Great ideas! Suitable for friction, friction! Only this movie exploded the opportunity. A few words and scenes are absurd. But this word is not sustainable It's not sharp or witty. And for the alleged comedy movie, almost no comedy I think funny should be in a ridiculous situation. But most situations are uncomfortable and too violent to wake up laughter or thoughts. <br /> <br /> The script is full of graves. Management errors Actions should focus on political issues and mistakes in doing that. But instead of spending a lot of time with a young woman who is writing a new law for fun and anyone trying to help everyone By providing resistance to sending people to Africa All this is beside the point! This kind of movie should not pretend to be serious! It's a wording! Political statement But it didn't start to solve the problem that should be true Maybe it's scared to go too far? That's fun. That's not art. It's not even true words. <br /> <br /> SÃ¸ren Pilmark is very serious and now one of Denmark's senior actors is doing very well. He has a little entertainment that makes movies worth everyone else: nothing special (maybe except Lene Poulsen, which has a reliable show) <br /> <br /> Actually, the problems of most Danish movies Is a language that does not look natural Both formulas and delivery Why is it difficult to make the sound right? Why does it have to boast and invent I hope that when people watch these films fifty years from now, they don't think this is the way people speak in general Danish society. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
