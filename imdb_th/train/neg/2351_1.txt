I don't know if someone will wake up during this performance. The show is a story that requires ham and amateur. Such stories are old news and the development of the storyline (or lack thereof) consistently makes my eyelids sagging less than half way in each episode That's all about it, to talk about it because it doesn't have any real content. <br /> <br /> How do you like this shit? It's stupid, stupid. It's insulting your intelligence. I don't even know how to explain more ... as if some people stared at the garbage without reason because you liked the way some actors looked or for whatever reason. I've never seen the same formula on dozens of shows before. <br /> <br /> I'm just .. forget it. This show sucks and thanks to it forever. I hope they will work to destroy O.C every time.
