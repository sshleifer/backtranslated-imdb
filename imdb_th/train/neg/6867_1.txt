We can start with a wooden show. But this movie is a disaster When growing up in New York, I can tell you that this movie is an insult to those who are familiar with the community or people. I am not a protector of any culture in any way and find that this is a piece of trash like Hollywoodized To be suitable for presenting the culture and language that are absurd of the fictional characters This is a huge waste of time, and even worse, it is certainly not interesting, because the results are clear and the scene of confrontation is not as good as laughing. Who does this? Nobody. Israel or something like that But it is clear that he has no clue about what he wrote When looking at his history, it was shocking that he lived in New York and wondered if he had any real relationship with the community. Even ordinary movies like "Strangers among us" are still better and closer to the truth than this ruins. Reading this man's credit is not surprising that he wrote a script in every C grade movie starring a stunned actor. Maybe he knows someone because this script is below the standard for a bad Dolph Lundgren movie
