My wife and I rent this movie because some people draw a line between it and "Office Space" Blockbuster and IMDB, even though it is an "recommended" option. If you like "Office Space" <br /> <br /> Now I see Office Space. There may be 15 or 20 times. I love it. Maybe one. In my favorite movie, 10 witty stories, humor and characters that remind me of people I've worked with over the years. "Haiku tunnel" is similar to "office space", which they are both movies. That is what similarities end. We sat through the first 50 minutes of HT, which was useful for questions, no hope * Pray * that it would be better. It couldn't. We couldn't get it again and stop the tape. Thank God for free rental I will get *** if we actually pay for it. We should get a refund for sitting through it. Now, since we do not see the end, maybe it will come together miraculously and redeem itself. I doubt it. <br /> <br /> The Haiku Tunnel is so bad that it is hard to believe that it will happen. This movie is really fun. It's painful. Just send the letter friggin !!! Location is asinine. Scary joke. We have reached the scene. "The printer is not working" and must stop. We can no longer accept it. This movie is EMBARRASMENT for Josh Kornbluth. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Office Space ...... don't waste your time with this chaos. 0/10
