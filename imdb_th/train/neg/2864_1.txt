This movie is terrible, it just challenges reality. Filming the best learning materials, acting is pathetic, and the director should be forbidden to make movies in any form. Terrible that it cannot be viewed as something of a showgirls comedy. The only thing that this DVD has is the cover. <br /> <br /> All I can write to those of you who do not have the misfortune to testify about this is to please a good favor. In advance and don't waste your time or money on this piece of junk. If you want to watch a movie for a joke, there are many more valuable things in this trash.
