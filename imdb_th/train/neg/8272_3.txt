At the end of "Dragon Heat", all I can think of is the reason I care about it. <br /> <br /> The evidence of this film is interesting and that's what attracted Maggie Q. With the movie at first But I've been disappointed Writer Daniel Lee cannot hold a candle with someone who likes John Woo, Ringo Lam and Corey Yuen. <br /> <br /> This must be one of the most annoying film I've ever seen. Lee is wrapped in his visual style - and I use that phrase incredibly incredibly - he fills the film with a monochrome slide that is completely unnecessary. Frame frozen, slow motion, fast movement and Other nonsense, I think he did everything to compensate for the lack of stories or good conversations. <br /> <br /> The action scenes are nothing special and can be played. Music video jumped more than anything else. There is little to pay attention to any character - including two professional snipers who can't shoot the barn from the inside! - Who is full of the most wonderful conversations I have seen in one of the Hong Kong actors? <br /> <br /> The story is without twists and turns - from the initial setting. The predictable fashion - and Lee felt the need to remind us of the story of the character in the event that we didn't receive it for the first time. This is an unpopular writing and filmmaking and makes the talents of Sammo Hung, Michael Biehn and Maggie Q. Although straightforward. But I can't remember if Biehn was in a good movie that wasn't directed by James Cameron. <br /> <br /> If you are a great actor in Hong Kong, you will feel a lot better when you stick to the wire. Stapler - The The Killer "(1989) and" Hard-Boiled "by John Woo 1992)," Fire City "by Ringo Lam (1987) - Quentin Tarantino steals "Dog Warehouse" (1992) - or "Blank Spot" (2510) Remake "Contact" (1992) or even check "So Close" of Yuen (2002), a fun popcorn movie And there are also excellent French police actors named "The Nest" (2002). <br /> <br /> Actually, if not all is normal. But they are exciting movies Exciting and even suspense They have a character that we care about and an amazing action scene. <br /> <br /> "Dragon Heat" On the other hand, it's just a simple matter. The problem is that Lee is not doing bad action movies. He makes boring movies.
