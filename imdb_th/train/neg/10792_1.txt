This movie has nothing but the most stupid dialogue possible. In fact, most of you may not be able to imagine how movies are meaningless. Synthetic dialogue may be possible until one hour ago. In movies that are not based on powerful scripts, we expect to see good conversations and good conversations and at least may have some sense of humor. You hear me, it lacks them all. There is no single point that I like about this movie. I hate it. I'm sure everyone will do as well. The name is intended for the target audience to have ideas about nude and objects. But it failed even in the nude I don't know what to do. But I watched this thing for about an hour and I advise you not to do that. The worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life. If someone offers you to see your ruuun awaaaaay saaaaaave liiiiiiiiife
