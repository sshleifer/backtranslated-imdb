OK, first of all, let me say that I'm still surprised with the plot of how bad it is. <br /> <br /> But again, it's the sequel to Steven Segal's next movie. Without Steven Seagal OMG !!! /> <br /> Random action scenes, no cost points. I'm still surprised that I burned 90 minutes on this shit. <br /> <br /> Just rent the movie Jacky Chan or go more fun. And without and presumably no and the plot !!! Please avoid it !! btw The best actor playing there is Bill Goldberg and that said very much !! <br /> <br /> And no, he can't play well as I said. Please avoid pfff pfff. I still don't believe I lost 90 minutes and used to write this 10 minutes !! :)
