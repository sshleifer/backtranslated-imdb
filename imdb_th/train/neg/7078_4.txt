This movie is probably a good B movie. If 3/4 of this movie doesn't focus on the sex scene too much I mean, he is a sex addict and I'm sure there is so much going on with sex addicts outside of having continuous sex. Michael Des Barres works well considering everything he has to do. Which is not so much at one point or another to laugh at him because his personality is very poor. Nastassja Kinski is okay in her role as a related sex therapist. And I do not advise her to have sex The most outstanding person for me in this movie is Rosanna Arquette in her convincing role as a loving and caring wife. There is something about both internal and external beauty that attracts me so much. She plays that role and when you watch a movie, you start to feel bad about you. <br /> <br /> "Diary Of A Sex Addict", while not a modern or classic Oscar material according to anyone's standards Fair work to show you how personal demons can take possession and destroy things in life that you think a lot.
