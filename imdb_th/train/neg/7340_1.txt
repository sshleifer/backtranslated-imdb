Impress! This is the worst SRK movie and one of the worst Bollywood movies I've ever seen! I don't like fiction But this movie makes it worse! The music is very bad, the actors are even worse (apart from SRK, of course, although he can't record movies) and it's not reasonable The director makes everyone look very confused. God knows why ... probably because he tried to make it look very realistic. But reliable Now he manages both. <br /> <br /> Even if you have a few hours to loose (Speaking this for your own well being!) Continue searching. You'll find other things to watch!
