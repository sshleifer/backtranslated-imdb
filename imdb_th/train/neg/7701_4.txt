Traditional performances are much better. They should leave in a good note. This movie kills all ideas. It's too boring and funny parts are too far to be compensated. This movie looks like it's actually trying too hard to be serious and that's not what I want from the sequel. Not to mention that for a long time, it just fell down about the same thing over and over again. So sorry Tyler Perry. But try again more difficult This movie is boring and not funny. Sorry. 4/10 stars. Yes. <br /> <br /> Jay Addison
