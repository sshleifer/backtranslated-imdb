American Humane Association, which is the source of familiar disclaimers "No animals that have been harmed ..." (AHA's registered trademark) began investigating the use of animals in film production more than 60 years ago after closing their eyes. The horse was forced to jump from the cliff to shoot in the movie Jesse James (1939). Needless to say, the brutal action kills all the entertainment of this movie for me. I think at least it can be said that at least the horse does not die in vain because it is the beginning of the public's awakening with terrible and terrible pain that makes animals so glorious. Making movies But I can't help If the poor animals have a choice, of course, this will not be the path that he must do!
