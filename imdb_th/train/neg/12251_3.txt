Oh CGI blessing when used correctly Sin used by people who do not know what they are doing. Sadly, that's not the only thing that doesn't work well in a large selection of jaws. <br /> <br /> Ok, anyone who has read a lot of my reviews may notice 2 things. 1: I like it. Low price horror movies and 2: If there are cute guys in the cheap movies mentioned above, I tend to point them out. So try this method first. This is a low price horror movie that I don't like. Most of the performances are scary, laughable effects and rival scripts like Battlefield Earth are the worst I have seen this year. As far as the local cute boy ... Dax Miller (Bog) won that award This boy is hot! And surprisingly, he is not just a compact body with beautiful eyes and cute buttocks ... he can really perform (as good as he can in this nasty movie). House cleaning. Let's go ahead. <br /> <br /> In the Cliff Notes version, this is the story. (Do not worry, I will try not to give anything) ... <br /> <br /> The movie team travels to a remote island to film a documentary about two players. (Cute boy and his best friend) who surf the waves with sharks They do not recognize it as a large saltwater crocodile lurking around the island. Croc appears to hurt the body, ensues, and people eat the end credits. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier It started quite well. But soon fell into stupidity and foolishness The main character became a lunch. (In a rather humorous way) and the rest of our animals send one torpedo in charge of the victim. In addition, if this crocodile is at the top of the food chain, both on land and in the shark fish, what is around? If this thing can eat 40 feet of a boat, I don't think a few stingy sharks will be stuck around. FX is the worst thing I have never seen before. CGI is horrible and they deal with the crocs of the app Animation Movie maker interest National Geographic. Discovery Store Crocodile hunters. They know what crocodiles look like. Obviously, you don't refer to any of these judgments from the cruelty seen at the end of the movie. Then what is the gang stealing drugs / drugs? Do you just want another reason to cut the top women? <br /> <br /> It's funny that we have a few subcategories in the film world with the Alligator and its sequel, Lake Placid, Crocodile and now Blood Surf. Now it looks like a movie. "Big crocodile / alligator" should now receive their own category at Blockbuster. The crocodile is good. Lake Placid is good. I still think that Tobe Hooper's crocodile is good. My classes: D-
