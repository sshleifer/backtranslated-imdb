***** May be a little spoiler ****** <br /> <br /> I can't tell if I like it. But I can't tell if I'm not ... It's very strange. There are bad things in it. For example, the shark that came out of nowhere. There is no worst CGI you can imagine. Cutting that part out certainly makes me want to stop watching the rest of the movie .. For some people it will be boring because of lack of action. Feeling like at home sometimes ... For example, a scene in which a friend Died, and the next thing they do? nop, don't cry ... tell horror stories to each other .. * sigh * (after crying for the way he lost) <br /> <br /> Another stupid thing is when they're talking in the boat. He likes "hundreds" of candles in the table in front of them ... The boat is surrounded by some types of curtains. (Old rag covered windows) and sofa / sofa ... I thought it was dumb using candles. But didn't think about The environment in addition to being in the high seas alone. <br /> <br /> Well, the scary scenes they've done, I like it. Sometimes horror movies work better when they are hidden in the back instead of acting, so this movie is well done. Perhaps because of the low budget that I don't know. But it works well for me! You will feel tension if you forget some of the holes as mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Don't expect much. But if you like anyone who likes to watch this movie, be patient. Have fun .. lol <br /> <br /> (Sorry about my raw English) =) <br /> <br /> Cheers
