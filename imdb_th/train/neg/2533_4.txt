I agree most if it's not Tom, all previous reviewers. (bighouseaz@yahoo.com) The Zatoichi series is an excellent character study when combined with sword and excitement battles. <br /> <br /> I saw Zatoichi 1-13,15,16; I believe that 14 is not yet released in Zone 1 (USA). Zatoichi the Outlaw is disappointing. The story is complicated and appears to be a mixture of many previous Sato stories. At one point, I wondered if I didn't see Zatoichi's new movie before. <br /> <br /> This movie was disappointing because it started with the effect. (Head, limbs, lack of blood) and less than in the high society of the characters Satoichi All previous movies were successful in the story and action, and won a great track without having to turn to using effects. <br /> <br /> I just hope Sato Chi's movie at The rest will not follow the trend. This is Zatoichi's first film from his studio. I recommend all previous Zatoichi movies - and recommend them.
