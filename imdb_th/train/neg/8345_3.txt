This movie is probably much better, especially considering the special abilities. The image of Larenz Tate about Frankie Lymon is not particularly good in music. He didn't speak fluently, and his attitude was Larenz Tate. When he was supposed to be Frankie Lymon, the portrayal of women as a gold digger was written throughout Hollywood. The obvious power pushed it. But it makes the characters more unrealistic The advantage of this movie is that of Richard Nunez's little Richard and Richard's own pendant. Lela Rochon is an eye candy, as always, even in a conservative role. It's too bad that the talents of Halle Berry and Vivica A. Fox are lost. Frankie Lymon fairy tales are all fascinating in real life. Unfortunately, this movie is a waste of opportunity.
