As others have said, this film has a criminal offense in describing the life of the artist and I am very annoyed and offended ... from the transformation of her rape to a sad love story. 'Awakening her abilities' without ignoring her work, as it turns her into a sexual object, you get ideas. In addition, I found it disturbing people who are not familiar with Gentileschi to watch this movie and walk out with her impression.
