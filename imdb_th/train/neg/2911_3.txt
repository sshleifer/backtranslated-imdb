This film is overflowing, predictable, hypocrisy and hollow into its core. Settings are honest to the era But nervous to expand the image with long exposure Give depth to the character, just make your face empty! The content does not guarantee the interesting performances of Paul Newman. This is a fool wrapped with an atomic bomb.
