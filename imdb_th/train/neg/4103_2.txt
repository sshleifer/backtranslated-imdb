This movie has an IMDB score of 8.1, so I expect more. It starts with fun and is loved by energy that gives a natural feeling. But before the movie goes half way, it starts to drag and everything starts to be predictable. The characters in the office are happy in the first three parts of the movie. But we know them too well They became caricatures, not real people at all. This is the same story that I've seen hundreds of times, just told here with a slightly different situation. The thing is that I can conceive the predictable love story if only the conversation is not boring! <br /> <br /> The only thing that might be worse is if the character has inconsistent and unbelievable motivation. In this case, with the letter office dead Hope this movie will end in Dead Movie Office soon.
