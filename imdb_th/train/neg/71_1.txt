This movie is incredibly terrible. I hardly believe that I watched it. Directing the production and editing of the whole chapter seems like they are made by junior high school students who don't know much about movies. There is no story telling that causes any feelings, moments, big emotions and climax. (Like the first time between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and the relationship of the characters (As told from the beginning) Where did they come from and not be provided as they used to be? And create movies effectively Sadly underdeveloped characters make it difficult for us to relate to them. Surprising performances were not entirely bad. But poor writing abolished the show's credibility This movie played exceptionally well, especially the West / Epic and sadly, which reduced the interesting (true) story that it was trying to tell. I have read a lot of reviews that protect this film that is important to Australians because of that. All of this is very good. But just because Ned Kelly is an important historical symbol of Australia, doesn't make a good movie at all. No one says that the content is not good. But the quality of the movie itself Pearl Harbor is a very important historical event for Americans. But that doesn't mean that I will protect the movie and say it's good because it's not good. Failures around, though. Heath and Orlando will look cute.
