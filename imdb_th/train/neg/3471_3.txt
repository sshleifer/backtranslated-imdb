This movie has more holes than Swiss cheese. Ben Affleck is not serious about acting in any form or style. He immediately sucks. There is nothing about this convincing movie. The first problem arose when the man gave everything that was precious to Salvation Army Santa Claus but didn't show why. And Grandma took her head into the oven - very beautiful and had nothing to do with the movie - it was not in the same tone as in the movie There is no explanation of the motivation for Ben Affleck to choose the house he chose. The family he chose has no convincing response. And people wandered here and there without any reason to be flicked (for example: Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck's character throwing steep stones Have a funny time or two - but they are rare in movies Need to rewrite (or 4) seriously. Hope you enjoy!
