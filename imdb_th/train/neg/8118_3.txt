EYEboy I must say that it will make me not stop when someone comes to help me and try to make me fun, especially when it's a smart person like you. The part I like in your post is "But without the big bang - good people, bad guys, guys here, Kimosabe. I suggest you stick to the movie with Banga Bang Bang." <br /> <br /> Say good. I like action movies. Especially if they do well But I like movies that do not have many actions as long as they do well. I'm sorry. But Secret's and Lies aren't consistent with that category and it's a terrible movie. I didn't watch movies that were not very American. Maybe I was spoiled and didn't realize how bad the foreign movies were when I saw the secrets and lies. Maybe if I judge foreign movies according to different standards, I will see some days that the secrets and lies may be one of the highest rated movies in IMDB. Hmm ... If true, it's very scary. <Br / > Jeremy Barger bits@midohio.net (new email)
