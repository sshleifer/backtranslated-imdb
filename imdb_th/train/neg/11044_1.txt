Shown in Australia in the name This incredibly bad movie is so terrible that you are hypnotized and have to watch it to the end just to see how it gets worse ... and it's done! The story is predictable, so it seems to be written by the drama school in high school. The scene is pathetic. But better than the synopsis and acting in wood. <br /> <br /> Looks like a 'stupid' baby is stolen from the closet. 'Total Recall' seems to have no original idea in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I found this movie so bad that I laughed all the time. <br /> <br /> Malcolm McDowell should hang His head with shame Obviously he needs money!
