I read the runners from the King's book as Bachman and I feel the main character of John and his family. This movie should have more problems? It was set during the popularity of the big action movies. I watched this movie and felt pain throughout the story. I don't feel anything for the character and less for his cause. Yes, it has a funny scene. (Or laugh) even though I think it doesn't record movies in my eyes If you read the book, you will feel the important point and fire in John's heart when he gets the last revenge. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a small amount. It may not be low if I don't read books.
