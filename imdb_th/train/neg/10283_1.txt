I hate to listen to 'old people', but frankly I don't watch too many movies that I like that were created after 1960 ... In general, the movie seems to be getting worse (even though I like Scott. Baio is a lot of vehicles, "The Bread, My Sweet" except the sex scene 'de rigeur' which adds something that is not worth it to the movie). Can survive Switching gears with herself, even though she was 50 years old at the time. (Even though I was 40 years old) I didn't buy it. I'm 57 and like all girls I know in their 50's and 40's, rather than being able to survive on their own. (Like I did since I graduated from secondary school 13, get legal freedom and leave my own life, traveling.) <br /> <br /> The daughter is unbelievable in her job. .. She was promoted. She did not deserve (good opportunity) and released that ball too. But when another female employee stepped up Into the plate and ready to deliver the writer to shoot her down as 'An opportunist' when she has just done what the work-oriented person will do - taking advantage of the open opportunities created by the lack of (Her colleague in this case) <br /> <br /> Her daughter allowed her 'mother' to be with her reluctantly. Temporarily But then treated her mother (The woman who gave her life and raised her to be 'adult'), like her parents, apparently the 'writer' of such rags did not understand it. 'Ordinary' for parents to behave like children and then be treated like children by their children. That's just the 'baloney' of society that Hollywood tries to force our neck as if we were. Their people are foolish because they want to be entertained by creative presentations. <br /> <br /> This is sad. Movie with a stupid end If the young man cook is real and not Two-dimensional 'TV character', he will be with a mother who is older, he is not quite and interesting. But in the end, he fell in love with a cute, adorable and adolescent little girl (a girl who 'took the opportunity' to work with this woman, nothing more attractive than physically) <br / > <br /> There is no credible reason to present to the audience why restaurants like daughters (which are selfish, centered, b * tch, which treats her mother with disrespect With a mother - a woman with a gentle heart, sweet emotions, humor and Joie de vivre. The daughter can't even understand Of course, my mother had her own flaws ... She responded to the death of her husband by drinking herself as a stupor for a year or two later, which created a rift between her and her unclean daughter. br /> <br /> Whether the character is or doesn't have developed this character as a baloney movie and wasted valuable time watching you unless you really like baloney. Where is the mustard?)
