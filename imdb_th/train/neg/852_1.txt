I will make this story short. "Adaptation" of this miraculous King book is a bad joke and nothing more. Of course, there are many Kubrick and Nickolson fans on this website and hence this movie finds its way. It's mysteriously in the top-250. <br /> <br /> Jack Nicholson laughs like Torrance Shelley. Duval's story that has nothing to do with this book is a mess. The character of Jack and Wendy Torrance Lawrence. Is a complete joke. <br /> <br /> My advice to everyone who doesn't read the book and wants to understand the characters in this story: next to the TV series ... <br /> <br / > Oh, and the people who say that Kubrick has the right to destroy the story of every king, make the king ... not a good writer. Anybody should check. "Masterpieces" such as "wide eyes closed"
