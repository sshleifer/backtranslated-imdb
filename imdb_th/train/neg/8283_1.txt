This is a shame for everyone and everything that is used to create this joke. Personally, I don't care about Jessica Simpson in any way and her ability or what many people find fascinating about her. Like this movie, it is something that cannot be passed in a film school. The script is messy. The show is cruel and the truth is Luke Wilson. (Co-author of "Rocket Bottle") made me wonder what he was thinking. He made "Old School" because crying out loud! This is not in the same status as my "Old School" DVD! Please for any reason, do not watch this thing! I see that there is a comment that this is very bad. But frankly, too kind When we will stop seeing the singer who is clearly unable to continue trying, I hope to end soon. The worst part is that there are some actors (Penelope Ann Miller, Rachel Leigh Cook and Luke Luke) who are part of this filming. As far as the plot, it is almost non-existent and is not well done and written. (Yes, I know it's a new style.) I doubt it. Who will remember anything about it? Please do everything you do not waste time. But if you feel sorry about the actors involved in this time bombing Jessica Simpson, you're cute But like to sing But I am not a fan of that And anyone who makes this movie I will not put into your resume 1/10 because you can not give the center
