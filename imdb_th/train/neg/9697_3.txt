I used to watch the first dwarf movie and sometimes I enjoy watching it. There are many famous TV / comedians appearing in the first part and presenting in the usual fantasy fantasy series of Stand-Up-Program And now is the problem that the second movie has to face Everything is there .... nothing new to get You are often familiar with "jokes" that are dull and stupid, and you often feel that their goal is to put all the Comedylooser in the past decade who want to come back on stage. There is nothing important about this: general fairy tale stories of Rumpelstiltskin Without any significance, I expect something like that. But there is nothing I can complain about. I'm complaining about a lazy writer who has all the stories behind. Their only business is to create a porch and a parody within But they didn't do it This shit excludes the excellent appearance of the Helge Schneider, which is a waste of time and money overall. (If you don't like him, delete 2 points from my assessment). If you like to keep your money and pick up jokes, casting every Friday evening in SAT1 or RTL for free, I'm sure you'll remember "laugthers "Something I saw last night in a movie theater
