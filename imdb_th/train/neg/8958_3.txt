I do not like the first movie "Cube". It really is a good idea. But the acting and the annoying characters make me not like it too much. Didn't feel the need to see its sequel But when I heard they were creating a third movie, which would be like the original prequel I was intrigued to think that they might fix some of the same problems and give us memorable characters. I think wrong. <br /> <br /> "The cube center" starts well enough by introducing us. Two plays that look after and watch the endless maze of traps that threaten people in the cube. The filmmakers succeeded in creating a mystery by creating the daily routine of two men. There have been many questions about the reasons why people have been sent there and the true nature of all business people. All that is left for the audience The show is quite weak. But in the first half of the film is quite good. <br /> <br /> When the story continues, one of the two "watchers" begins to seriously suspect about what he does. And later decided to help the trapped group This is where everything begins to melt quickly, becoming a boring cheese. <br /> <br /> Sent by someone who runs the cube program. We are introduced to the character "Jax" along with both followers. Two of them have important reasons why this movie failed. In the beginning of "Jax" looks and talks like the third villain brought directly from the James Bond movie, along with "popular" glass eyes that used to destroy any atmosphere created by a good rhythm in the first half. Moreover, it started to feel like a clown rather than a serious movie. With incredibly curvy lines, script writers might be bored and not interested. The show will go down to the next level when the "former" followers meet with the group in the Cube. All interactions are painful to watch and everything else will follow. <br /> <br /> Failing to impress at all Things except weak characters, conversations and "Cube Zero" performances are a waste of time for those who search. Horror movies.
