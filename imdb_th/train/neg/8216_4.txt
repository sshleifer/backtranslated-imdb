And as Fred Sandford once said "One cross over the lips" for those who released this movie in a public place that is no doubt And perhaps for those in the "Rue Morgue" who called this "Fender Hellbender" and said it was good. <br /> <br /> Five girls seem to take home short from high school football games. Lost his way and stopped asking the route at a small shop in the middle While the driver of the SUV accidentally crashed and hit the headlights But every woman decided to go out and not go to find a driver But the driver came to them and not only that her car's headlights were obscured, it was another reason that women still didn't understand. When the driver first caught them, she (Yes, it is her) Make a shotgun and make it land and scream at them. "How much do you see?" Of course, girls are afraid of death and do not know what she is talking about. <br /> <br /> When the girls fall into the cat and mouse game with an SUV driver who is the manager To inflict all kinds of injuries to girls who have incredible flexibility in shooting guns, bombs and screwdrivers that they don't want Eventually they found that something happened at the store after they left. That's the reason for this woman's anger. And finally they have the opportunity to take revenge and get it as much as possible. <br /> <br /> There are elements of this film that are quite annoying and frightening. Unfortunately, those moments were destroyed by poor performances. Bad conversations and a lot of credibility A girl was shot with a shotgun and seemed to be seriously injured and she felt cold. Her life passed before her eyes. But is she better then? And how can a small van run on empty gas tanks that have speeds of nearly 80 miles per hour? I want one of them that seems to get great mileage. <br /> <br /> There should be an ending when the girls get their revenge. The climax, but at least they learn that What is this woman and the driver still worried that "Make her mother's van mess up" which is clearly the least worry of everyone. <br /> <br /> So this is It's not the worst movie I've ever seen. But it is a good amateur and sometimes scary and scary But it must use a cake for manic, shrill, howling and you have to put two ears if you look at this Which by the way I do not need to recommend 4 out of 10
