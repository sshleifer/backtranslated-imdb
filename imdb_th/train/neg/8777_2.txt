Okay, I try to avoid the fact that in selling EVP, in fact, this movie lied to me from the beginning. I argue that hell I do not believe in vampires. But I still like Dracula so I can live with this thing. <br /> <br /> However, even though I accept that this movie is not good It was created and made out well. But it didn't attract you. There were many "jump" moments and I just looked at them and thought "Yes, I didn't expect" without jumping a little. <br /> <br /> The resolution is not reasonable. If the power behind this thing can do what seems possible, why use a proxy? In addition, the narrative ending is ridiculous. Apparently they placed there as part of "Given the credibility of the movie by claiming to be real," but for that work, it really needs to start. But they can't put it from the beginning because then they give it away ... sticking it at the end makes it appear like a sore thumb
