Now I don't hate cheap movies. I don't see why you should waste any money for movies you can shoot with your father's camcorder. If I rent a movie, I want it to be MOVIE, not a group of people who think it's a good idea to lose. MiniDV - Tapes <br /> <br /> Maybe I hate this very much. The guy in the video store said it was great and it wasn't. Maybe I hate it because of the cheap price, the most stupid plot ever, the most unrealistic characters and the worst realities in the history of movies. Even Tom Savini was unable to record this. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this time is completely wasted.
