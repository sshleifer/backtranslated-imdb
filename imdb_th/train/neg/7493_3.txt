I don't want to believe my eyes when I watch Nuremberg yesterday on Dutch television. It started very slowly. The background of Nuremberg's experiment became clear, step by step. German had a funny English accent. But suddenly, in the last few minutes of the first series, the audience will see the most. The shocking and scary video I've seen <br /> <br /> It's important that people see that picture. (Although I do not agree with people who indicate that there is no minimum age that children can experience For this type of content) but in this film it's completely ridiculous It is truly meaningful to improve the impact of ordinary TV dramas. It means to shock the audience, which is incredibly cheap and easy. Instead of trying to move us with scenes that are well-done, inspiring conversations or interesting perspectives, the audience is tortured with horrifying images of prisoners, movie and bone inmates It doesn't show respect for the victims of the disaster. <br /> <br /> I'm very angry.
