Cinderella tales are created for adults living in a dream world. The romance is unrealistic, witty, behaving like a perfect person, the plot of Cinderella until the end and Shahid Kapoor is the only reason for the star. If you are looking for a romantic love, this is your movie. But for the rest of the world, we recommend that you save three hours of viewing time. The people who wake up <br /> <br /> Four of the five people who see this movie with me will not recommend this movie. We have a good time to smash the most unrealistic scenes. Maybe I miss something .. I can't believe that this movie will beat the classic HDDCS !!
