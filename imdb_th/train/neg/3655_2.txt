Oh, I think this is probably the most wonderful movie I've ever seen. I'm serious. This is one of the b-ultimate movies. The first evidence is that it's not a DVD for $ 5. Oh, it's not too important for this. I got this on the VHS from a tank full of old videos at my local video store. <br /> <br /> If I talk about the reminder: "In the 17th century, Japan had a samurai to Set The standard for all ages. His name is Mayeda. He was sent to great adventures around the world to receive 5,000 muscats from the King of Spain. While the storm was severe, the sea storm swallowed their precious gold to buy weapons. Maeda must fight for the survival and destiny of his beloved Japanese. " "An epic, multi-million dollar action adventure across three continents." <br /> <br /> I have to watch other movies. This is not an epic, and certainly not millions of dollars. No, 'Shogun Mayada' is just a mad adventure of Maeda who speaks Ethiopian (Shoko Koku). He's not really shogun. But that doesn't matter The important thing is that he was very impressed with the charge from one of the castles in John Cleese's 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' and his ability to shoot serious scenes to show the samurai's mental power. br /> <br /> The greatest thing about this movie is the Engrish accent of Sho Kosugi. The movie may lack everything that makes it a good movie. But made with the thinnest lines ever made by the best Engrish accent And honestly, do you need anything else? You can fast forward 'Shogun Mayeda' quickly and repeatedly played the final chapter of Kosoki. The tape may deteriorate before you get bored with one line. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - Great.
