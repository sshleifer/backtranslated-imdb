George P. Cosmatos' "Rambo: First Blood Part II" is truly fulfilling desire. Clear that the United States did not win the war in Vietnam They have caused more damage to this country than can be imagined, and this film is still a fairy tale of innocent soldiers. The only bad person who is the leader of the nation that makes this war happen. The character of Rambo is perfect when observing this story. He is a very loving person, lamenting that the United States of America does not appreciate and celebrate the success of only one soldier. But there is nothing to trust for leading officials and politicians Like all movies that protect the war (such as "We are soldiers") and the film avoids the need to provide compelling reasons for participation in South Asia. And for that matter, it is the reason for all American-American soldiers who are there too. But Rambo will avenge revenge on the wound of the whole nation. It would be better to work with how to handle memories instead of suppressing them. "Will we win this time?" Yes, you do.
