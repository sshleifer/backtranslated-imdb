I have to watch a movie that is different from other reviewers on this website because when screened this movie last night, the audience was shocked by the half-conversation. (I'm not kidding) went out to shoot, as if the filmmakers thought he was approaching a brave new land by presenting stories from the homosexual era. Inspired by the visual performance with Fassbinder, the acting in this film is boring and boring until I think one of the actors will pass away without them getting the attention. tHIS The worse thing is that it has colors like the episode of Miami Vice. I don't know who this director thinks he is. Perhaps he would pretend to be Surreal like Bunuel, Jordowsky, etc. But the problem is that all the directors mentioned above demonstrate the level of guilt that is missing here. I understood the meaning of this movie ten years ago. But when we have masterpieces like Bad Eduction, Mysterious Skin and Show Me Love, why worry about this movie? There's nothing new to see here.
