I am very much a fan of Tony Scott. When this movie came out, I had high hopes that it would be 'Man On Fire'. To know that this movie is the most far from it! The story is filling the water from the journey and Mickey Rourke's selection is not a good idea. And their arms were too worthless! <br /> <br /> The movie is centered on Kiera Kinghtly and this film reveals that she won't become a movie star! The movie brings the worst performances of all time. <br /> <br /> I like the direction of Tony Scott. Sorry Ton 1 of 10!
