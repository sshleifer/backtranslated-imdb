I usually do not comment on anything. (I read the opinions of other people) ... But this person, I am _have_ to comment ... I believe that this movie will be watched by the world, such as the F-117 action and high-tech stuff. But only the first few minutes and I changed my mind ... Lousy, the show, the script, Lousy and the big science fiction <br /> <br /> It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> Just ... don't worry ... <br /> <br /> And another thing before any movies that I always check user comments and ratings on this website. ... 3.7 points and I give This movie, try now. I wonder who gave this movie a rating by scoring more than 2 points ??????????
