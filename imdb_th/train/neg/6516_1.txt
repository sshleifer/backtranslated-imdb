.... Many better movies Especially Steven Martin's "LA Story", which at least has an elegant elegance, even though it starred his girlfriend and played his girlfriend in the movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, boys and girls are innocent. "20 days" is a mocker, although I'm not sure if it's the intention of Myles Berkowitz when he started. My impression is that he started the semi-serious project, then quickly realized that it was pathetic and not funny, unless he made the situation look ridiculous more and more. As a result, the whole thing had a cheap discomfort. And not sincere about this. <br /> <br /> While there are people who point out wisely, this movie has two "dates" to sue and place orders to rest Myles. I also They appear in movies which are impossible because they have to have a consent form. For me, it seems that most women who appear as "dates" are professional actors. (Not famous people, except Tina Carrere) - They are clearly beautiful, polished, thin and comfortable in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Berkowitz made a classic mistake in choosing this cute actress, rather than using a woman with a variety of beliefs that could cause a presumption ( Even in mockumentary) that is more reliable and fun He also skates over what may be a problem in his real world, and that is both the movie character and the real world. Myles Berkowitz seems to be unemployed as a function (real-life IMDb credit of He doesn't exist except for this movie.) Even in the film world, his ex-wife is divorced because he never has a job. I think the audience (Let alone the real life day of Mr. Berkowitz) deserves an explanation that he managed in the most expensive city environment in the United States in a luxury apartment, driving fancy cars and eating out expensive The restaurant when he doesn't see any income sources (he is a drug dealer or doesn't live with his wealthy parents or has no clue!) <br /> <br /> You can escape. Get everything in the movie. If the joke is a joke, "20 days" is a painful and shameful thing. UN-funny. The funny idea of ​​Mr. Berkowitz is to have his character while in the restaurant. His friends know that Ah The serving is likely to cause him to have diarrhea or constipation, which is the worst potty humor. <br /> <br> It is not surprising to discover that Mr. Berkowitz had never made a movie before "20 Dates". And in the last 8 years, not creating a single movie, appearing as an actor in other people's movies or writing or producing any credits, my instincts tell me that this film has not been Supported financially by "Elie" (the gangster's money appeared off camera), but more likely by the rulers of the wealthy Mr. Berkowitz or may be expressed using a credit card misuse. No matter what it is, we can all relax easily without having to see Myles Berkowitz or any of his creative endeavors. Hallelujah !!!
