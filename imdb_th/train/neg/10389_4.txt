Director Kevin Connor and the action hero / romance actor Doug Mackel are back on the team in the ghost story in Japan. They achieved moderate success together in the 1970s with the passion of 'The Land of Forgotten Time' (1975), 'At the Earth's Core' (1976), etc., where plastic creatures cannot describe this story <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a prologue chapter in the 19th century, with a samurai husband killing her wife and lover before committing suicide. Moving forward to the present, introducing Ted & Laura married couples who went to Japan and entered the house where the tragedy occurred. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly what will happen next with the spirit of death that started. In order to receive new residents with friends, the family Alex (McClure), assuming the role of his wife's lover In conclusion, the main point of interest is the loss of two weaknesses ('The Omen' has many answers to promote this as a standard horror scene) and the love-making scene with the scene. Scoop Dramatic eyes But very strange. Susan George was the first piece that was inspired by 'Don't Look Now' along with her hubby, along with piano songs. The second time is much shorter. (May be her confirmation) and McClure both looked rather uncomfortable However, every cloud has a silver lining and the two scenes show her great tapping, so all is not lost. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can't decide 'home. That Evil Dwells' is rubbish or entertainment in the form of self-punishment in the wrong way If you are not in the category, there is nothing here at all, but for scary fans, it may be enough to cause a strange smile and appreciate the value of the effort. <br /> <br /> Scene The best - in any place, other films that are large, black, climbing Japanese crab trees that mutter will steal the show. They were obscured by the legendary food scene of the family where the demon head appeared in the daughter's soup. When I saw this ghost, she asked what kind of soup it was (!!!!) to tell the meat and vegetables before saying the immortal sentence. "Uh - there's a terrible face in my soup." If this isn't enough, the answer is "C'mon, eat your soup for the father." Laurel & Hardy breaks in pieces.
