One king is money The hero of the Mafranant Charles Forestier is constantly rising at the social level due to a precarious problem. He loves every woman who can help him in his actions to climb the social level. At the end of the novel, he married the daughter of the owner of the greatest daily newspaper in Paris's greatest church: "La Madeleine". "Le Tout Paris" is there. He has fortune and others. He will be a member of parliament and later a minister of women "useless" away from his point of view. But he is always in touch with women who are beautiful and useful. The image of "Belmi's personal struggle" is a story of morality. It is everything But not the story of Maupassant's thoughts. Why do they put "BEL AMI" in their name?
