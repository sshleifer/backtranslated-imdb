I have a high tolerance for strange things, but some movies are straightforward, far more than strange things - until when they hurt your brain. This is a movie Trying to understand or explain that it is impossible and I think that this movie is best understood while taking drugs because it is difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Japanese animation. Very cute about cats However, from many distorted and harassing things, I wonder if I lost something in translation. However, even if it is so, why do we need to be treated for the image of magic that involves the separation of women with cleverness, defecation, gulp, light animals on fire, etc. All of this seems random and pretty scary. Strangely and I don't know why some people see this as a genius job. I just don't understand
