There are people who look very good in this movie. That may be the best thing about it. Maybe that might make it look worthwhile. <br /> <br /> "Load" tells the story of Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe), a young man who is going to build a reputation for the world. He is the son of a famous famous family and he is traveling to law school. But as with many settings, things are not as perfect as they appear. This family expectation is more than love. Except the father school of tunnels, often allowing him to leave the house This should be the result of a disturbing event in the past that shook the family, which was partially revealed through the incident. But not spelled out until the end Tristan's uncomfortable environment allowed him to leave the opportunity at the first opportunity when his friend took him to a strip club to celebrate his graduation. Celebration Soon there will be some dancers back to the beach party, and then Tristan brought his friend Sebastian Cole (Corey), who pulled him into the drug dealing business. <Br /> <br /> The movie suffers from a lackluster script and a story that is not very interesting. Counting with this film is a constant camera trick, which generally seems annoying and out of place, such as slow motion, fast motion, freezing frames and resonance. This is the type of effect that the director may use to show the character's perspective on drugs, except in this case, they seem to be thrown periodically in a random spot in the style that was <br / > <br /> Although it is unknown But the performance is good all around, especially when compared to the main enemy (Corey Large). I wonder if we can see at least two people in a bigger and better project in the future. <br /> <br /> Of course when Talking about the actors, I have to talk about their faces. Rating based on popularity This movie scores 11 women in this movie. Looks fabulous and distracts you from the movie you're watching. I'm sure the male characters are quite interesting. But you have to ask others to comment on it. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can't recommend this movie. Or even see free Unfortunately it's not worth the effort to do it.
