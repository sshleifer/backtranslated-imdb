80 minutes and feel twice as long! The conclusion of the cross is not short enough. In fact, the first 50 minutes or more contain almost all the conversations of a woman who is approaching middle-aged, boring, annoying about "men". Her latest is French. She met a teenager at the ship's cafe. <br /> <br /> The only person who is still boring continues as they go to the duty free shop and go to the bar. Of course, the story could not end, so she persuaded him to listen to her nose up when she took him to the cabin. <br /> <br /> Romance, sex or whatever. Anything that this movie has, in addition to bitter talk, is hardly enough to prove the price of the rental unless you are one of those who love drama that has nothing to do. Yes, the ending is very good. But it is a very small reward that will make your living room become a virtual therapy session using narcissistic drinkers. <br /> <br /> Sure, some people like it. I may Will be wrong
