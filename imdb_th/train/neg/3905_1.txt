Forget Plan 9. This is the ultimate failure, improperly directed costumes, action scripts and more. This film is based on a better novel by Isabel Allende. I hate Meryl Streep and Antonio Banderas (in non-language movies Spain) and other actors, including my favorite actor Winona and Jeremy Irons, try hard to overcome a terrible chapter. Many mistakes (Eg, for example, when snow fell in Christmas in Chile) and very cruel, with so many evil called "The magic of magic" This thing stands out as the worst movie of all time. It's terrible !!!
