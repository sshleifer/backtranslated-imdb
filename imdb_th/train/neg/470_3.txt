I used to love this movie since I was a child. But when seeing again 20 years later, it's really bad. Maybe it's time in 1980, but there's almost nothing to offer today! Movies like Caddyshack and Stripes can be considered much better today, without T&A. There are no great jokes, except for one liners that we've heard millions of times. That it will be a jewel that I remember that it was me going! The soundtrack contains only 2-3 popular popular songs. (Not the songs that others are talking about) and the dubbing is often terrible. For me, the only interesting thing is to predict what the character's character is before they speak. Yes, I watched this movie a lot! <br /> <br /> The only reason I wrote this review is to give my two cents why this movie should forget, forgot to say :(
