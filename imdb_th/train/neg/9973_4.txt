"Child problem" is one of the best-selling movies. It's not the worst (Although some people do not agree with me on that matter) but not the best as well. It's about a 7 year old boy, a villain who sabotaged a cartoon in a husbandless couple. This movie is too stupid and unbelievable because I didn't buy it for a second that the child can act as emotionally as children in this movie It was strange and disgusting even though I laughed many times. (I don't know why) but I can't recommend this movie. I know I'm too kind. If there is one good thing about "child problems", it is better than the horrible sequel. <br /> <br /> ** (out of four)
