The most common thing about the negative aspects of this movie is true. <br /> <br /> But if I had to watch a movie, it was: <br /> <br /> Director. <br /> The director of photography <br /> <br /> Editor <br /> <br /> Never miss a glorious microphone, boom comes out and leaves almost every movie in the movie. How can I enjoy and concentrate on this matter, and believe in the horrible things when I think of techniques for creating movies !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> Wait for the DVD or not.
