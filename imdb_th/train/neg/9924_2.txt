"Dutch Schultz" AKA Arthur Fleggenheimer Being a real person and his rather disgusting life has been recorded quite well This film that claims to portray his life should use the characters that wore roles, because the events that are too necessary are too strong to get out of facts and events. Interestingly, there are other versions, including the failure of public relations in northern New York and changing his religion. It is true that he was executed by Luciano, Lansky and others. Al, but as far as possible The scene of the explosive plate showing Luciano carrying Bo Weinberg in his own home. The help from his mother is ridiculous. In addition, there is a scene in which the Dutch approached his mother to protect the diamond legs. It does not work. The character of Mrs. Follenheimer does not work as well. This film doesn't have to have a Jewish mother who has a cartoon interest. The representation of the leg of the Diamond leg is quite funny. I'm sure the man is turning his grave. And in fact the Dutch had killed people personally But he is not Rambo or 007. The scene that he wiped out of the brewery is ridiculous. I don't know. Maybe it should be a joke and I don't understand.
