This film begins with a strong LL Cool J (title deed) as a plainclothes police officer with the Sgt Lazerov alliance (Dylan McDermott from training may see that it is a bad guy?) Committing crimes and murder The deed refused to kill the drug dealer, which created a dirty police conflict with good conscience. Other big names (Freeman Spacey Al) were good actors and the film was shown. Seeing that the contract <br /> <br /> the movie begins to shorten as soon as Justin Timberlake (Pollack) launches the opportunity to create a good movie that people may see repeatedly. Or one of the children I will go to see once because Timberlake. I will choose the past. Even talented actors have to work hard in their craft. Timberlake has no ability and no hard work that can help him. I will think that he will show better because of the fact that he has been capable for many years. Everything he does in this film is unreliable. <br /> <br /> Just because the singer sells millions of records and sells the stadium, it doesn't automatically translate that they can accomplish in the documentary even. N'Sync's hardcore fans are unable to ignore the lack of performance. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are little channels such as the ability to sniper. Pollack This movie has many promises. Thoroughly disappointing
