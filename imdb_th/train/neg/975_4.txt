I saw the director "Woman On The Beach" of this director and didn't understand the good comments about the good reviews. This movie is like two people who have very little relationship with power and don't care about anyone. Like all of his other movies, you have to want to listen to an empty dialogue that is very low and fascinating with characters that are not interesting. If you feel like you like this movie, don't let my review stop you. I like the simplicity of the movie. But I feel that the movie of Tsai Ming Liang is superior. He has a great actor in Lee Kang-sheng in his movie. Nothing here. I hope IU will like it, but can't do it. Oh well.
