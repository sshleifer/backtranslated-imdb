Men, what the hell are people doing this movie? And where do I find it? The opening scene makes the tone of this movie happen. A woman is twisting herself in a fire, becoming a werewolf. And this is the American transformation of Rick Baker's werewolf. We are talking about the worst makeup ever made in a movie here. I can imagine that there are glue stains from Italy stuck on the naked Annik Borel (Daniela player, the protagonist of this film. (What is the word?)) And ask her to roll with wool. How bad is it? <br /> <br /> From here, it's not much better. The minute that was lost because of the scenery that chewed the actor about Daniela and her condition or something (I can't remember but the conversation is terrible if you don't laugh, you will cry) <br /> <br >> Funny stuff. Daniela is not a werewolf. She is a psychopath that goes mentally whenever there are men around him. (Understandable because she had been raped since childhood) so she thought she had become a werewolf like her ancestor. The opening scene). She couldn't help tearing the neck of every man she met and she wanted to get Love only! Everything started looking for Daniela when she met and fell in love with the stuntman who didn't make her 'episode'. Let's look at the montage here, which is one of the most wonderful things you have ever seen. (Laughing and hugging after diving through the window) <br /> <br /> Daniela's luck is not a matter of violence. Suddenly she was severely beaten and raped by a group of thugs who killed Stuntman. Reminiscent of "I spit on your grave" Daniela extracts the vengeance of her rape. <br /> <br /> This is 100 minutes in my life. I will never return. But wait, that's the game you played when you were a movie star.
