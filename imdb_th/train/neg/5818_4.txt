--- What happened to those who are not like these people? Alan Archin is normal, not scary and has just walked through the role of children, all of which are messy. Mariesa Tomei may hope that this role never comes her way. And Carl Rainer and Rita Moreno do something in this movie that is really bad If you enjoy watching the loser in distracting and not trying to do anything better, this is your movie. All the other people walk, read a book or see something else. <br /> <br /> Jane
