When I was 11 years old, grease 2 was like a crack. It's a classless experience that is shameful, cheerful and addictive. My sister and I will watch it back and watch it over and over again until we leave or become confused and hostile to stand each other. So if you are an 11 year old girl and you check this movie as "smart" or "fun" or "better than traditional grease", you have a teenage hormone to blame and you can be sure that <br /> <br /> If you're not a little girl, you don't have an excuse to suggest that Grease 2 is nothing but a shy, unassuming. In production, distribution and / or consumption <br /> <br /> To criticize, I will honor the movie now by explaining why it exploded. <br /> <br /> 1. In music The music should be developed to tell a story or develop a character in Grease 2. There are a few controversial exceptions for that song that are pointless aimlessly. Most songs seem to be related to satire about having sex in an excessive and general manner ("Score Tonight," "Reproduction," "Do It For Our Our" and "Prowlin '") without confirmation. Concrete, any character or theme of the movie In addition, every song is an idiot that is awkward and no one in the actors shows the ability to sing the most brutal dance Was not satisfactory But instead of being each of them as In the end, when Johnny Nogerelli offered Michael a sacred T-bird jacket and started him in the gang, Michael should kick it on the floor, spit on the floor. Then spit down and go out to scrub any part of the body. But of course, he accepted it as if it were gold because even though they were a group of hammer heads with bubbles But there is no more honor than being one with the birds. <br /> <br /> 3 Because Michael is beautiful, intelligent, intelligent, and above average in every aspect (his musical weakness ) Although it is possible that Stephanie would embrace him in the end when he revealed himself to be the person behind the mask On the other hand, Stephanie is a lazy, jaw, jaw, gum, bubble, wearing a dirty T-shirt, dirty, rude and innocent. In addition to beauty (I guess), she doesn't have a satisfactory appearance, so the audience doesn't get any proof that the things that Michael attracts her are deeply interested. <br /> <br /> I can do Can continue, but I do not want to talk about the cruelty to the pioneers because of the many crises that seem to feel that such comparisons are unfair I will say this to people who think that you want to revisit this story again because the Grease 2 is the same experience as your first kiss. Now you are only 32 years old and kissing a young boy under the age of 13 with braces and spasms. The magic is gone and you feel dirty and disturbed. Believe me.
