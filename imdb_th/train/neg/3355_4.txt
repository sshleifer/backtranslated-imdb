There are only two things that make me interested in this film: I wait, Owen Wilson dies and Catherine Zeta Jones. <br /> <br /> This is a single female program. Catherine Zeta Jones is at That is to give the eye candy Liam Neeson completely lost in this movie. Like Jones, he has no role at all. This film is all about Lily Taylor (Ransom, Ready to Wear). She is the only person who actually participated in this crappy script by David Self. It was his first song and he redeemed himself with Road to Perdition <br /> <br /> I don't know what the director's problem is. He did very well with Speed ​​and Twister. He really fell down on the job here. Maybe he will still recover from the disaster. Speed ​​2: Cruise Control. He should thank his lucky star for Wild Wild West. It's the worst picture of 1999. <br /> <br /> Avoid all costs.
