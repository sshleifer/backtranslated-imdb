This movie led me astray with a crossbow RPG (rocket grenade). It's like someone is cut and put on a scene from Robocop. I expect Beowulf to say "I like it!" > I watched it because I liked Chris Bruno from "The Dead Zone" and he did his job. He chose a strange accent. But at least he made it consistent with the whole movie - unlike any of his costars, they still use all kinds of words, from old English to modern English, sometimes in the same sentence. <br /> < br /> There are many opinions about how this movie differs from the original content. However, despite being his own, the plot of this film is not good. It is boring, which even a low budget does not justify. Having a low budget means that at least you have to have a good story, a conversation and an appropriate performance. Those things do not cost much. But they spend money on CGI and suit. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to watch this movie.
