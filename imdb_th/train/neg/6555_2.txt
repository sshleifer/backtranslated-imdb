The night before, I decided to watch a story from Hollywood Hills: Natika Jackson. Or power, passion, murder as it is called in Holland When I bought this movie, I noticed that Michelle Pfeiffer was starring and I thought I had to say something about quality. Unfortunately it can't be <br /> <br /> 1) The story of this movie is really confusing. There are two story lines running simultaneously during the movie. They only have something in common. Throughout the movies I waited for, these two lines will come together so the plot will be clear to me. But still not so. <br /> <br /> 2) The movie's title says that this movie is about Natica Jackson. It is sometimes. As saying that this movie has two different stories and the shortest part about Natica Jackson Therefore, other titles for this film are not the wrong choice. <br /> <br /> To summarize my story, I suggest you leave this movie where it is. Will not waste 90 minutes of your life like I did
