This film has one redeeming feature. At one point, after the character was attacked by an ax ax, wielding his brother, he asked him "Why is your dick thrown there?" After suffering from a bad movie for almost an hour, it almost made my drink come out. My nose. <br /> <br /> Some performances aren't. Get worse But every child stinks and PJ herself makes this movie. The story is weak and nobody does what you think. (Or general feeling) they should definitely. <br /> <br /> Of course there are many stories that do not increase. For example, in one scene, the ghosts of young children must concentrate heavily on moving physical objects so that they can prove that they have such a difficult song because they cannot interact with object However, a few minutes later, they all picked up the branches from the ground and toothed the fairies together. Obviously they were unable to move the story and sometimes they could not think together. <br /> <br /> Many blood and courage, though ... But this doesn't compensate for the defects. <br /> <br /> If you want a movie about the Tooth Fairy, rent "Darkness Falls". I think it's great. But there are many other investigators who don't share my opinions. At least set the mood
