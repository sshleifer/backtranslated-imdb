In Bridgeport, Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech), a crazy high school teacher, is dominated by teenage students Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow); She saw him kill her family with her. But Richard was arrested and sent to prison for life. Three years later, the wounded Donna felt better. But still under psychological care and taking medicine On returning to her prom, she went with Bobby's girlfriend. (Scott Porter) and two other friends go to the Pacific Grad Hotel for a party. But Richard Psychiatry escaped from the prison and was imprisoned on the same floor in the hotel, chasing Donna, stabbing friends and hotel staff who crossed his path. <br /> <br /> Cut "Prom Night" Collection of clichés with a lack of overall initiative The stupid story is a shallow and stupid story with the bad acting of Johnathon Schaech in the crazy killer role. The predicted screenplay is excellent because it can predict what will happen in the next scene. My score is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Morte Convida Para Dançar" ("Death invites to dance")
