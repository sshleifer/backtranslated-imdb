I have the most enthusiasm to screen this movie in advance. Finally, this is one of the oldest and most complex tales that humans know and is one of the first epic tales that I read when I was a child. (Even before Tolkien) I have to say that it was a huge disappointment. They make the storyline completely funny and change that to become a television drama. The elements that are faithful to the plot are constantly sprinkled in a haphazard manner in which the audience laughs many times in a silly episode that just pays the lips to fight every war. It was a huge disappointment to see the complex characters like Achilles (who had a strange combination of powers that were almost mercilessly matrix-like, and male couples in traditional poetry) turned to the script. A good movie and more effort can change this to become the most complex and original warrior image of Hollywood that was ever produced). In fact, it was a loss of ability (Peter O'Toole stole the program and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were poor) compared to LOTR or Gladiator and not even holding a candle with them. There are many hunting scenes to choose from. But the fight scene is not enough for a movie that has been fought and surrounded for a long time I would not recommend anyone to pay to see this story, drag through the soil like a character. (At least they got that part)
