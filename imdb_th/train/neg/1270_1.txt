In general, Herculis Puaro is a well-known 'hero', well known from books and movies. This movie or this story doesn't work and I feel it's not Agatha's fault. The actors are not good, the actors are too stubborn and make stupid gestures. The costumes are clean and orderly. (Even Arab clothing) looks fake and for serious viewers who think this movie is a joke instead. Of a mysterious drama The actors playing Herculis Puaro perform well, but there is nothing magical. Various scenes, as mentioned earlier, are perfect and look fake. The story is not very charming, although the mystery of the murder. But who cares about the death of a cruel and cruel blonde woman? 45+ people in the Irashi desert! 'Victim' is not satisfactory
