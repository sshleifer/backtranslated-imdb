I want to enjoy this movie a lot. It moves very slowly and is boring. If on the TV, it lasts for 15 to 20 minutes. What happens to this? Excellent actors and photographers are working on an unusual foundation. If this is loosely based on the life of the director, why doesn't he let anyone see that writing is loose? Then he was directed by the snail, which may be the source of a few people nodding off during the movie. Loud music But for other movies, it's not this story .... For TV drama There are times when the conversation doesn't understand when Armin Meuller Stahl is speaking. I'm not alone because I hear a few voices crying as to who said anything to anyone. This one has good nuggets. But was executed badly
