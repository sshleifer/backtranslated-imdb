Poetry is often a risky business and I think this effort should be regarded. There are many abilities involved here. Actors, directors and writers with many talents Unfortunately, I can't enjoy this movie from the three problems I have <br /> <br /> First of all, the parts are different in tone and unbelievable quality. And unfortunately some people clash with others. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I feel many underdeveloped. Like the seeds of a good story that never happened before I didn't mention the happy ending here. (Or even the end time) but they lack basic development or even a stable setting that attracts you. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, I do not feel New York and residents are properly conveyed. <br /> <br /> What you leave is a short film with high eyebrows that may be of interest to some people. But will make the average audience not satisfied
