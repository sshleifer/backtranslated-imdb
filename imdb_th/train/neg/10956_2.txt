I bought this movie from Gamestop's discount, using trash, leather and cover, making me laugh uncontrollably, so I bought it for 99 cents. The movie itself was retarded and they used like ten monkeys. Varies throughout the movie that is almost identical Not to mention, they use an acrobatic pair that is just a short man to dress up to try to disguise himself as a monkey. <br /> <br /> The director rather than commit suicide with a chimpanzee after his debut. In the preview for the low-cost Warner Bros. movie and he ended up with money at the studio In addition, it didn't help him not be ashamed for the horrific work he did. He didn't even know the production of poop-movies. <br /> <br /> Why did this movie ever be done?
