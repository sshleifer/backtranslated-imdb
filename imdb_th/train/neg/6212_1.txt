It used to be my idea that movies wanted to convert or other methods that made you interested in the story or what happened. This movie shows me that you don't have to have anything like that. <br /> <br /> I can easily summarize it, but IMDb wants me to have more lines. It's pretty, not very interesting. The way the characters talk in the movie makes you think it should happen in a few days. But no time has passed and I'm pretty sure it happened in an hour. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for entertainment for yourself, buy milk gallons and see how fast you can drink before you throw. up It will take your time better. When you don't return, Jurassic Park 3 is pulled out better than this movie.
