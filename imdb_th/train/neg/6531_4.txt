First of all, I would like to say that the opinions of users only make me tears from tears. One comment that a bad SF movie becomes a good comedy is right. MST3000 makes it live like that. <br /> <br /> If you watch THE ANGRY RED PLANET, it's a hot dream. The force of comic book readers aged 10 years in 1959, you will have this handle. All elements are there: pseudoscience Sometimes logical, often fun, hilarious The attitude of a teenage boy towards sex with the captain "gigolo" (called the good man!) Puts an eye on scientists. "Scientist" has a red hairy, so it's not surprising that it does not set fire alarms. The absurd idea of ​​Mars as a planet, so the aliens that everything glows red. But an alien monster has a mouse face and the alien drops are eyes that rotate like a baby toy. The cartoon relieved the overweight (!) Astronaut, who sounded like he had never graduated 8th grade in Brooklyn and had a mental fix with his ray gun. And of course the fact that aliens = dangerous evil If these people meet with E.T., they will roast him in two seconds! "OW" Of course! <br /> <br /> Don't understand me wrong. I rate this movie low. Still, it's never boring. (Except when scientists try to explain everything - just to make it sound more ridiculous) and you have to admit that in your baby's core it makes you jump a few times. <br /> <br /> Oh K then does not accept I guess you never 10
