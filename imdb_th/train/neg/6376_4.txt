Jennifer Cassi (Gina Philips from "Death and breakfast") returned to the house where she had recently grown, which she inherited from her deceased sister. Jennifer decided to sell because she needed a lot of money for her grandmother's disappointment. She began to have a recurring nightmare problem of a mysterious crow. No one really related to this movie. Jennifer looks cold, distant and narcissistic, while Grandma looks enraged, sad and narcissistic. This movie is good and well done. But no one sympathized, I found it difficult to pay attention to what happened to them. <br /> <br /> My grade: C-
