I feel less generous with this film than anyone else in the family. The depiction of a madman of this century often happens to them, especially strange to different species Their comedy is too scary. Everyone is Napoleon or other historical person or they are charming with chickens. They are in doing or beating each other. As if the script writer said that I would do anything for them to do without feeling mad or having a mental disorder See the great human depiction in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest". The illness is reliable and true. I used to work in the mental hospital I don't see these guys at all. These things are too smart to calculate to make life lively.
