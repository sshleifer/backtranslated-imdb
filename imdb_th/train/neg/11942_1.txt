It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It started badly and worsened. Katherine Heigl was a cunning man in the role of Lolita and Leo Grillo, fighting with what was the cutout character. The only energetic actor is Tom Sizemore, who is a gangster and becomes a bad person and has a full role. The script is terrible. The show is horrible and it has a large enough space to drive a double-decker bus through! It's a movie about women I've seen! The character of Katherine Heigl is not sympathetic at all. She was seen as a wicked man, tempting a man who had been seduced by an innocent poor married man to cheat his wife. It is implied throughout the movie that she is underage and the message that comes with the plot story, begging to believe! At the end, she could not redeem herself by shooting people who were clearly (ha!) Angry and angry, but the script allowed him to commit suicide, therefore ransom himself in the eyes of men everywhere.
