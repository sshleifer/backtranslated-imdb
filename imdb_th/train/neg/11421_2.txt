I might have been a lot to hate this movie - I guess I didn't approach it with my olden days nostalgia. But when I can say that - St Elmo's Fire is a man who is unethical, even the Brat Pack movie is still there. <br /> <br /> Here is also another lovely example about neurosis. Everything in the 80s (for renting anyone?) The story is almost non-existent and that philosophy is the best and doesn't give the rest of the time. The lack of something similar to a sympathetic character is not perfect. No growth at all, no forward movement. Even the suicide scenes that have been rejected for death or something similar to reality or adult life. <br /> <br /> The shape of each cookie cutter will make you hate them like Super The possible way, Stalker is an unreasonable reptile, unless he is a beautiful Stalker and Andie MacDowell. Jackass does everything in his power to remind you all the time that he is a Gorgeous Slut. Hide the deep pain. And full of emotional poetic lifestyles and mopes a full round of 3/4 movies until he can reveal (!) He actually is full of teddy bears, sunshine and rainbow Eventually, the Virgin became a happy human being after receiving all the wishes of Virgin in a sack with Jackass before he left her to change (actually, at this time). Cheating rogue until the time he had to arrested And finally, feminists prefer to drink holy water in any spirit mentioned "Determination" <br /> <br /> Which leads me to my last beef - What is Super Cement's bond? I can't imagine being alone with them - now imagine the vortex created by the narcissism centered in one bar. And they were very scary in the toilet near the rape and sleeping together forever After that, two BFFs acted like baboons, all after the girl screw, and she likes "Umm, actually I don't want to be with you either anymore. Let's be friends! The day I knew I might be in contact with any one at any time. But both of you are not satisfied enough for the commitment (Not that word!) And they all smile as if saying "I don't think so! It's a great idea! "<br /> <br /> But it's not quite the way to watch this movie.
