I am a Batman movie and TV fan. I love acting (Both old and new) and I love all movies But this movie isn't as wonderful as some people expect to be in my Verifyon. It's a big deal. I think the problem is that there is no Batman drama: the mask of dreams and Batman: The return of Joker has many plays and Batman & Mr. Freeze: Sub Zero has some plays In addition, I think this movie gives light to Batman. The only scene that seems a little dark is the big fight with Bane at the end. However, it's a Batman movie. Okay. But i will rent it
