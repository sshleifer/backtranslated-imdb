This movie has everything. The work of the camera is fluent, reminiscent of Martin Scorsese or Oliver Stone, a strong performance of 'heat', explosive action of the Brooke Highmer movie Jerry, an intelligent dialogue. br> <br /> The judges confirm the characters show their emotions. But also shows the true depth and emotional intensity His performance reminded me of Robert De Niro's jake la motta in an angry scene. <br /> <br /> The action scenes are truly amazing, not because the bullit has a movie. Showing high octane This special technique helped push the boundaries of technology and filmmaking to their limits. Independence Day sets the standard in which this film is clearly matched and surpassed. <br /> <br /> Overall performance Excellent from the actors list (Such as Oscar Night Party Invitational Program) And strong scripts
