This program is not made for me even though I am a fan of the genre. The main factor that disappointed me is that there is no single scene that is not the main character. This makes it a two-dimensional model and I give up before the program ends. <br /> <br /> I hope to release the criticism there because I don't have a film critic. You have to put 10 comments. It reminds me of Hudson Hawk in the way that the main characters are in every scene. I don't doubt that the ability of any actor and team is just that. After looking at things like "Wire" I came to what I expected from the police drama.
