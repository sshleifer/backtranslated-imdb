I expect this movie to be completely dumb. With low expectations, entertainment in any form is surprising. The soundtrack is the best part of the movie. But mockery of the nonsense that continues in the protection of singles is also fun. <br /> <br /> This thing says that there are many things about the Singles Ward that are annoying. The name is not good and makes the mouth look while listening to their sounds very annoying. The lack of professionalism was discovered by the Mormon stars who did not do business. <br /> <br /> This film will do well in the Mormon Dom, especially in the college community where single people live. However, the conclusion will not give hope for the poor loser who finds himself unmarried. (Only beautiful girls in married Singles Ward, obese people can't do it. But the ugly men do). Finally, we realize that this movie is an advertisement of LDSSingles.com
