There may be people who are afraid of dentists rather than saying that monsters or dolls look scary. Which makes it a perfect story for a real horror movie. <br /> <br /> Dr. Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) is a successful dentist for many years. But when he caught his wife cheating on him with a poolguy, he snapped and he brought anger and frustration to his job. Now, have a dentist punch and mouth, and you might guess what will happen next ... <br /> <br /> As I say, a great idea But did not send as it should Especially the ending is a big deal Last record: See Mark Ruffalo (You can trust me, Eternal Sunshine ...) In this <br /> <br /> 5/10
