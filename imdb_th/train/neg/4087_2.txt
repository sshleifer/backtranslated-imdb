I often talk a little about the story in the first part of my review. But in this movie there is nothing to say much about. Just the mistake of other FARs that are better than swords and magic spells. The lack of continuity ran as rampant as ordinary. Even the main villain who refuses to wear other clothes, the loincloth is boring because she has a very young chest. The fun of the worst and worst folly is that Lucio Fulci is fighting the bottom of the tank here and it shows. See my <br /> <br /> grade: D- <br /> <br /> Special DVD: Lucio Fulci Bio poster and slide gallery; And trailers for US and international theaters. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Sabrina Siani has no upper part at all. (Some people may think that I don't care.) The specialties are not top as well.
