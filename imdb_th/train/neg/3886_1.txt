Is this a stupid movie? Bet now !! I didn't find any moment in this film that was creepy or scary. Stupid moments? Fertility, stupid characters? Bet. Bad effect? everywhere! Rick Baker may go and do something bigger and better. This is not one of them. Oh, good people have to start somewhere, Dr. Ted Nelson cheese. He is the smartest doctor I have ever seen. He had a man who was melting in Ventura County. He wasn't too happy that his wife was pregnant. (Probably because she is 55 years old and weighs 90 pounds) and does not have any cracks And the local sheriff wanted to know what had happened, although Mr Nelson could not tell him anything. In addition, there are some random characters that are thrown in for a good measure that meets men who are melting. Finally, the film ends and the monster that is swept into the trash to become compost. In the end it is just what you need for an excellent MST episode.
