After reading other reviews of this film, I have seen that the high marks may be paid to the studio that is not as good as the movies I see. Lack of fierce It is a dramatic scene, while the film has an amazing backdrop with spectacular views and breathtaking skies and open grasslands. Sadly, when the most memorable thing in the movie is the part behind the actors. Must be a quality warning sign In every movie is an interesting western movie, even at a very reasonable price, can be obtained from the best DVDs to avoid.
