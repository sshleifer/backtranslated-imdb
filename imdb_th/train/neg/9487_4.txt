Actors, although nothing special, everything works well, the story seems to be a good idea, the script can be received and the end is quite good. And what happened to it? <br /> <br /> For the beginning, the special technique is terrible (if done in the 60s). It makes me laugh that the DVD cover claims proudly. 'From the creator of the special effects of Creepers Jeepers' <br /> <br /> Secondly, the direction is weak. Providing food to inmates in the hospital to the devil (Or demonic animals) should be tense or scary But still the best thing left alone. <br /> <br /> A is quite sad. 4/10
