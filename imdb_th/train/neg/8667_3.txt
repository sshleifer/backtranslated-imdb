This sport is a good and deep actor. But for the thriller, you will deliver more than the actors, names and talk. The first three of this film is nothing but talk and talk more. Most of them are women who talk about everything. <br /> <br /> The first five actors shown here are women, so check that they are "flicks, chicks" and others. Should be playing on a lifelong network. <br /> <br /> There is a fast murder scene and more talk. They make me stray. <br /> <br /> Sally Field looks here for about 15 years.
