Less than 10 minutes in this movie, I want it to end in pain. The movie "Horror", all about this is a group of harsh prostitutes doing stupid things for 90 minutes, arguing, crying and screaming. Don't give positive comments to fool you because this is a terrible movie and you shouldn't watch it. <br /> <br /> The movie plot has the potential to be good. But it didn't happen A group of five girls are driving home one night when they find themselves being hunted by a crazy female driver who wants to kill them. Entered the movie for two minutes and the characters were arguing and this didn't stop What we have for 90 minutes is a group of women who are wailing, crying, screaming "show" and arguing there are no interesting conversations from afar as well, so you don't really know these characters or have fun. <br /> <br /> The performance was terrible and I was shocked when I found out that these characters were meant to be teenagers. These women didn't look at age 20 days and a woman. Information like that she was almost 30 years ago, at least get someone to look aged. No one in them has performed remotely, and it looks like they were chosen out of the street or a friend of the director who was not capable of acting But she at least shows that other women can't - a little talent. <br /> <br /> The characters didn't help because of these women. A bunch of silly bitch bitch That's all I can say about them and it doesn't help them survive. If I had to go into detail in one scene, the girl was chased by a killer and caused their car to fail a lot. A woman hurts herself and laments about it ... Four people don't wear seat belts ... What do you expect? One of your friends is being brutally attacked by the murderer ... and you are all just "comfortable" to help. <br /> <br /> Filming is extremely scary. I don't care whether this film is peanut-sized or not. The filming is terrible and it's like watching pirated movies. The camera technician was clearly seen in the car with the girl pushing up the window somewhere and the number of times the camera blurred and shook and interrupted with the "horrible" actors and sometimes you couldn't hear what the characters were saying. (Not that it's worth listening to) <br /> <br /> Predict that the killer car in this movie. Although we only heard that there was an accident) it was actually a car director in real life. No wonder they didn't show that the car collided! This movie is very cheap, they can't show the car to see scratches. Oh have to mention the soundtrack too ... If that's what it is It's horrible ... sad one second, then the next hard rock. <br /> <br /> At the end of the Five Across Day, The Eyes feels like a horror movie filmed in the middle of the street at night. A number of silly young women shouted and debated for 90 minutes. It didn't help anything when the script was terrible. Fear / tension / suspicion and (almost nothing) didn't exist. The performance was terrible and the quality of Pictures and excursions Made terrible <br /> <br> This movie is a movie that cost a lot worse. Avoid all expenses. <br /> <br /> 1/10
