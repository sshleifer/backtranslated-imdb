"Mistress of the Craft" Celeste works as an agent for Interpol's 17th office in London, which specializes in mysterious criminals (I think). She possesses the fate's eyes in her hand, dangerous if anyone gets it. Satan from California Hyde (No relationship with Dr. JKill) Detective Lucy Latz of LAPD flew to England to take him back to the United States. Lutz is a connection to the previous Witchcraft movie, played by Stephanie Beaton in Witchcraft 9 in episode 7 Lutz. Played by another woman in 6 Lutz as a man! The Lutz part in 9 is not very big. But she is one of the main stars in this story Although she was left behind her high heels and short skirts But she still revealed the tops on this list This time, she has a nude scene and a sexually attractive Beaton. In this chapter, <br /> <br /> As usual, there are a number of sex scenes, an anonymous clubgoer, three people who died with two vampires, Satan and a head. The vampire makes it kink. Lutz meets a British friend and Celeste and her boyfriend make love. <br /> <br /> The main character of the Witchcraft Will Spanner series will not appear in this chapter, although Lutz will mention him. With Bureau 17, Dixon representative in conversation about With a vampire She still calls her detective partner Garner (Episodes 6, 7 and 9), even though we do not hear his conversation. <br /> <br /> Hyde is bounced out of prison by a group of vampires. Led by For Walpurgis rituals, there is something related to God named Morsheba (I think). Hyde sends all of his chapters in a very smooth manner while Raven acts too much at the camp level. The fight scenes are horribly designed. <br /> <br /> The sound of the movie is poorly recorded and is not well resolved. In addition, some conversations will disappear under the music or sirens. The movie wasn't great as well. Having movies and filming in the UK is a novelty, at least for this series. <br /> <br /> Wendy Cooper is very good like Celeste; Definitely charming But more importantly, she is easily the best actor in the movie. (Bad fight scenes, though there are) I was quite surprised that her film work is very small. If ever there was Witchcraft XIV before and I think there will be, they should take her back, even if it means taking her. Go to California! <br /> <br /> Witchcraft X is in itself or in the Hotter Than Hell collection DVD along with Witchcraft XI and two unrelated movies.
