"Little Man" is now on DVD and is a failed Wayans Brothers. It is the story of a small criminal who is smaller than the one played by Marlon Wayans, who hides a diamond in a lady's purse after a robbery. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, made a smart plan to disguise Marlon from a young age and plant him at the girl's house. He then went through all "Home Alone" or "Child's Play" categories such as physical assault to get the gem back and be treated like a baby. I was surprised by the humor in this movie. Jokes have been made in other places so many times that they are not cute or funny. I almost thought that this movie might be more fun if they didn't use CGI and use the small actors that Marlon's face was overlapping to see the deleted scenes (delete CGI). Mini-me but they choose another route A little pendant and Tracy Morgan make funny scenes .. Spend your rent $ in Borat if you really want to laugh today. <br /> <br /> http://mcmusicnotes.blogspot.com
