In summary: This is a romantic comedy movie that really cuts the cookie that is needed and tries to be more than anything. It wants to be Harold and Maude, Annie Hall, graduate. It wants to be deep and human. It has a camera shot, light, music, interesting editing, all of which gives the feeling of an important movie. The dialog is smart - sometimes there are times. "Laugh out loud" <br /> <br /> But this is something that makes it impossible to be more late than late night in a killer flight. Time: <br /> 1 David Schwy Murder - Joe's sorrowful puppy dog ​​can stare empty in space with his jaw hanging open before it starts to bother. Perhaps some drool may help. <br /> <br /> 2 Gwenneth Paltrow - She's really flat here and not just But in the chest Her role should be this lively and lovable woman who is making himself in a situation that is not very confusing and that is why the sacking of the sorrowful, like Schwimmer Had a chance with her, but Gwen Nath played a very boring person Combine this with a dog, drool-face, puppy (above) and you have very little chemistry to be interested. <br /> <br /> (I imagine other people in this role - for example, Kate Hudson) <br / > <br /> 3 scripts and stories - things that have happened, basically, are not real All the problems were ended with a neat and orderly bow that appeared to sound like a whistle and the script writer said "Oops, time to close it. So they pulled the Hollywood formula out of the box and returned home.
