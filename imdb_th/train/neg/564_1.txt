The producers made a huge mistake in selecting the actor, Leicester, who could not perform or sing in the title role. In addition to the "bad" performances, all of Leicester's songs had to be parallel. Behalf by women I do not know why they threw him because there are so many boys who can play the role never ending and sing their own songs as well. Chaniwallis is too old to play Nancy, which should be just 16 years old. The current West End version is better than movies in every way. Ross McCormack is the best Dodger of all time and he looks good. Than certainly Jack Wild. Obviously, it's a political story that will reward old-fashioned musical actors after the chaotic events of 1968.
