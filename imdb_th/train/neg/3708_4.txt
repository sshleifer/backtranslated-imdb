Down to earth is about Lance Barton, a black comedian who hit a truck. He went to heaven and received a new body. Lance makes Charles Wellington's body a white man. Lance did something in Charles's body. This movie has a few laughs. But nothing special It's a good movie if you're a Chris Rock fan. Madagascar, the 2005 animated cartoon is better. This is a good movie, but Chris Rock has done better. It will make you laugh about 4 times of the whole movie. And it's not funny You will laugh with yourself and you may laugh. But you will definitely not laugh on the floor.
