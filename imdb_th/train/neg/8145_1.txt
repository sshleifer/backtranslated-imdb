This movie is terrible. I can't believe it was actually shot. People who voted 10 or 9, 8 and 7 are you crazy? Are we really watching the same movie? Or should I say the same Everything is not good in this movie. The story (with a story or not) is going on. (Some conversations just ridiculous) Music scores (what is **** what?) Editing and especially artistic direction Pure disaster Remind me of an old Macist movie ... to give you an example of an amateur in the production of a mermaid's costume, a sleeping bag that is sparkling. I'm not joking. That's what it is. <br /> <br /> Another example of the big mistake we found here: You see in the scene of a special, fat woman, about 200 pounds talking about. you cellphone. The next appointment, which is in a completely different place, you can see this woman still talking to her cell phone (!) Yes, it goes so far. <br /> <br /> Big, huge money, useless.
