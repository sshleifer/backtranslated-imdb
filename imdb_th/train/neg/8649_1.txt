This film failed miserably at all levels. I have an idea to take everyone involved in this film and send them to the hot zone in the Middle East. Maybe if we are lucky, they will be shot and killed and we won't have to waste time on them again. I mention that I never had a bitterness about the shit of the movie in my whole life? My God, I can't think of anything I've seen that is a bad thing. I should watch Ishtar 25 consecutive times instead of sitting for 10 minutes of excuse for this movie excuse. If I ever met anyone involved in this movie, I would spit on their faces and then beat them unconscious. That is my two cents.
