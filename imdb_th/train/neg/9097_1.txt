Who created this shit? This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. It's a waste of time and money. I hate that they create a low-budget sequel with actors D-Lister and the story is similar to 1st person. <br /> <br /> I found this movie in the trash, bargain, sitting next to Wild Things 2 and Death To The Supermodels, for $ 2.99, is something that I think it might actually be good if I watch with disgust because of the poor acting, tearing the story and the script from episode 1. <br /> <br /> Anyone who really thinks this Creeps video production even half a good movie, you will need a chipmunk or something, because I think most people who've seen the film think CRAP !!!!
