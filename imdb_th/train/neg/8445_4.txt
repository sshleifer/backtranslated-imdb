For me, every piece of art must be judged by these criteria: form, function and meaning. Seems to be a sweater dedicated to the style: good images and sometimes interesting performances Long distance, suggest that the function that the viewer may fill out by himself Due to the lack of texts, the story became a question. Introverted person recommends deeply But sometimes it turns out that he has nothing to say This film acts like an introvert. If you have not read the summary, you cannot see that it is a suicide. (And the question of why there is no answer?) That changed Anna's view of life and made her wonder 'Why don't you say to me?' Sebastian asked. Anna didn't answer. She started to look at him for a long time without saying anything. What is the function of that shot? What does it mean? My question is like Sebastian: What will this movie say? What does this movie mean? The answer to me: It shows us that a few people are fascinated by a glass of water. Their life story is simple and boring. The motives behind their actions are not shown. The rest are: movies, housing, landscapes, good and beautiful. But without meaning without leaving In my opinion, this film was created for fellow artists, not for general audiences.
