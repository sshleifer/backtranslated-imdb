A funny film about stress, a movie that looks like a sketch, which at first was a vehicle to show Jack Pearl on the radio only once. But now it is best remembered as the introduction to the Three Stooges of America. In fact, Larry, Curly and Moe were charged alongside the cartoon Ted Healy while Ted Healy and his Three Stooges. Will play Jimmy Durante (Which is completely wasted with dim sum) and ZaSu Pitts, but the only audience in this movie today is the Stooges and even though they are not appreciated As shown by how Hollywood needs to reach the level of complexity that is sluggish * 1/2 from ****
