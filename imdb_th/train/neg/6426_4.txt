I found that documents about Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control are interesting documentaries. The documentary contains four "mini" documentaries about four interesting men. Each of these people is heavily involved with his work, showing love and enjoyment in work. <br /> <br /> The sad part that I have to say must be the subjects that these people work for / Study. They were interesting, about five minutes after that became boring and lasting too long. <br /> <br /> This video was filmed in a very creative way. I enjoy a movie that has another dub. It plays great and is close to music.
