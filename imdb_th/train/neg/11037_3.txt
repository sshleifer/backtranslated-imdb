I love when Jim becomes Greenman. It's great! When Jim threw a small person through the window, his face seemed worthless. Then, when he started talking about the monk on his wife's name, only to find that she had become a pee woman? Great writing and the selection of excellent actors with great performances makes this a must see. I am trying to find photos from that time. I want to use it as my symbol in the message board because I think Greenman is hilarious. Does anyone know if I can download Jim's photos to the Greenman? Can anyone point me in the right direction to find the image?
