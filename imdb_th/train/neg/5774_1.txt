This movie is Spike Lee's modest effort. He has more talent than this film. Receiving on the Bus while opposing racism clearly does nothing but fight against white people and makes the status quo worse. The story of the film is about a group of black men traveling on a bus to the millionaire men of Louis Fargo in March. Buses have all kinds of people you can imagine: gay Muslims, gangsters and Uncle Tom. (He was thrown from the bus) On the bus, there was only one white person. He was accused of being a nation in the minute when he took the bus to drive. Although he was a Jew and the fact that he described it as a situation in which he ended up being racist and left the bus, I hated to speak. But this kind of movie needs to be aware of democracy. This should not be seen as a victory. But is a sad disappointment You may think that I am a racist for writing this thing. But i mean well Wish you good luck next time
