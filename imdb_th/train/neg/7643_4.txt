When a famous actor fell on the earth, became a small town with problems with drug dealers and the bodies of federal agents. Combining with one former co-star to clean the city. <br /> <br /> The low key, which often reaches the comedic point, "Action", mostly ineffective. Part of the problem is choosing Chris Klien as an action hero in the past. He's not bad, but actually he is unbelievable, like someone who is taken to be a grueling person As I said he was not bad, he just made a mistake that what his story was. The real problem here is the combination of scripts which are not really funny and it seems to be invented sometimes and the direction that goes to the docks of dullness. There is no life in what is set. It's as if the director has an appointment and goes to that list. It's done for movies that don't involve. And sometimes the movie comes back to life again, such as in the final show, which ends the movie But since the previous part of the movie has lost its power, <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie. It's worth taking a picture if you are a big fan of the actor or a big fan of independent movies in all forms. But otherwise it was disappointing
