When hearing that many people praised the film, I thought I would let it go. In addition to being incredibly slow, which I do not mind, as long as the wait is worth it, but not as many people say that there are many inconsistencies and most of this film is not real. The reaction of the 4 men changed from the horror of the fear of finding the body to indifference while the fish were. Of course, if they were the type of people who would happily fish, they would report the body and say they discovered it after fishing. Why on earth tied the tree? And tell everyone that you found the body 2 days earlier? It is difficult to watch movies that know that the behavior of the main character is not very consistent. For the remaining townspeople, you think that at least one of them may show curiosity, wanting to see who really killed the woman! The body itself is naked except for the pants .... What situations lead to that? If she is raped, why is he still in prison? If she is raped by wearing a shirt, then why should they take them out later to protect the pants? If she hadn't been raped then why remove her clothes from the bar to the knee ... leaving evidence to get rid of? I can't think of any real situations that will lead to anything other than killing people to steal their clothes so you can fill your sales channels. Confused! Oh it looks good But only and just because even a bad chapter, the performance is strong
