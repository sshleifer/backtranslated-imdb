This movie is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. From the first scene, I knew it would be a crash. It started with a girl who seemed to kill a group of nuns on a mission. When it appears, the people in it are randomly assigned by some zombies. Some years later, there were some college students who played as a pledge. The horrifying performance begins with a pledge of jock heads. Things like Jock shouting at him to do things that are not chalonte, by pledging to respond and do all things "eager to be popular in the role." cake Special effects that are absolutely scary with guns. For example, a gun that emits loud noises with a muzzle and vice versa This comes with the stop animation zombies. (Why are they stopping in motion is a mystery?) Magic songs and about 40 guns coming out of nowhere. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is ridiculous. Like many others, you can rent 50 cents at a place to rent your lowest eyebrows movies.
