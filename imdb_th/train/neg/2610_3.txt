102 DALMATIANS [Walt Disney]: I'm not a fan of the previous sector, and this effort has all the weaknesses of the first story, the terrifying cushioning story that is too scary to be played by Glenn Cole, who staged Every scene as if she was playing Her own entertainment and leading actors are boring and amazing. Again, the dog is the only "actor" that seems to be "real" and that is a stretch. Wasted effort again here. Grade: D
