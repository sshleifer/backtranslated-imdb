This is a very scary movie. Don't be tempted by Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside. Both are great actors. But this must be the worst role in history. Even their great performances could not be exchanged for the ridiculous story of this movie. This film is an early propaganda work in the United States. The most pathetic scene is the scene where the Columbian rebels made a case for revolution. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared fake and her love affair with Walken is not just a pathetic emotion in a true meaningless movie I was disappointed that this kind of movie destroyed the reputation of the famous actor Christopher Walken. I couldn't sit there.
