I am a Christian who generally believes in teaching theology, leaving behind. That being said, I think leaving behind is one of the worst movies I've seen at some time. <br /> <br /> To have a good movie, you must have a well-written script. Left behind, cynical about this For one thing, it is completely different from the book. Sometimes this will make the 400-page novel shorter as a two-hour movie. But in this movie, I see a change that is not reasonable. <br /> <br /> Other things don't have character development. When the characters in the story were recorded (I won't say who) This book clearly shows that it is a process that takes a long time to find. In this film, it's fast and inventive. This book is written fairly to people like Rayford Steel, Buck Williams and Hattie Durham. But in this film will be treated quickly In another scene, one character is angry at being left behind. (Again, I won't say who) seems to be true. <br /> <br /> I know that as a Christian. But I can't have a good conscience. I recommend a movie that I feel is horrible. Perhaps it is better to make the first book as a 2-3 movie. In any way, Christians need to realize that as a serious filmmaker, we have to start by collecting movies in a quality way. I know there are many attempts that may come to Left Behind, but that's the way I see it.
