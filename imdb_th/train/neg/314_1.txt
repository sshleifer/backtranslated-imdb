I chose this movie for $ 5 dollars at a discounted bookstore. Adam Sandler is a great actor and I think it will be a good movie. There is no story. Funny, bad and other comedians say "The F-Word". Every word he says, curse often doesn't bother me. But this is over And even worse than the lack of stories is when Sandler just started talking to the camera in a random part of this movie. It reminds me of Dora the Explorer when they turn and watch the screen and ask questions. You And finally, when they randomly put bikini girls at random in the movie In my opinion, don't buy this movie. It's a waste of money.
