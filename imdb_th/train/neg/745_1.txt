I'm not really sure how to start explaining how bad this movie is. I like movies that are not good because they are always the most entertaining. I love bad special effects, bad performances, bad music and inappropriate directions. With the exception of music (Which is better than I expected) This movie has all those qualities. <br /> <br /> Amazingly terrifying special effects. The worst thing I have ever seen since my Nintendo 64, some scenes that have to be watched, including Thunderchild, a woman who is struck by a mechanical foot, Big Ben scene, a train wreck ... Wow, there are many bad effects! On the positive side, although the scenes of some foreign travelers do well, <br /> <br /> The performance is not as good as it should be, according to HG Wells' book, directly for having good resources such as That was almost as though the actors tried to make things too funny. And then had a mustache ... one piece of facial hair that I lost the most I had seen for a long time Of course, only half of the movies are shown. The rest is a character that walks aimlessly and the shock shot effects. <br /> <br /> If Timothy Hines says that he is an incompetent director By using different color filters during shooting without any reason, using a background that does not display well even in poor green screening scenes I don't think it would be possible to turn a great book into a bad movie. Cheers, Mr. Hines Cheers <br /> <br /> My advice to anyone who plans to watch this movie. Is to do what I do: have friends who enjoy bad movies, go drinking, playing poker while watching it, continue drinking Makes everything go through It makes the movie worse, so let's have fun and laugh at this disaster.
