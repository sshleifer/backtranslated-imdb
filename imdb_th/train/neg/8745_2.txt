One of the most professional movies about computer programmers. <br /> <br /> It seems that the author of this film doesn't know the true identity of the programmer in the world. <br /> <br /> The top 20 programmers of the world have their own satellites (for what purpose), programs that use satellite freq. Some people kill someone to steal the code (why?) And a very stupid moment in this movie. > People who have Yes programmer at Will see horrible things in this movie because it's not a professional in this matter But people will not see the real thing. <br /> <br /> The programmers will find this movie strange and scary - because many times in the movie is not related to real life. (Why does the movie not be scifi in this case?)
