I may not be admiring people in the movie "Creepshow", but the sequel of nonsense makes the poem look perfect! And to think that I am entering this thing, expecting to like this thing more Five years after his predecessor, George Romero, returned to the EC Comic style and on the screen of the film for Steve King's three-screen script. Although the direction was given to Michael Gornick, the film was mostly stumbled on that side with an uneven brush by Gornick, but most of the offenses had to go to the Romero's script that was unbelievably frightening Believe (Especially in those conversations that stream through the first and last stories) moral messages (Which comes from the sour characters in the group) came in with black humor Oh, it's painful and can say the same thing about the lively rotten music score with pictures. The three links are loosely (the Old Woodenhead, The Raft and The Hitchhiker) together. It's a gentle and powerful story that is made in an animation style. Nostalgia (80s) I like the segment. This is over and the smartest Creep character is the shining light. <br /> <br /> # The first story, "Old Chief Woodenhead", sees two elderly owners (George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour) of the Dead River general store. Native community Received robbery and finally killed by two punks who were dying to stay in Hollywood. The front of the shop was a wooden statue of an Indian chief who lived to avenge their death. <br /> <br /> - Listen to George Kennedy, Waffle .. and Waffles for 10 minutes about how he is committed to his 'wonderful' community. It's a wonderful time. As with Kennedy's speech, this is a colorless and oblivious item that is monotonous. Exaggerated scripts are common and therefore appropriate to perform. These two factors caused me headaches. When the Indians came back to life again and became vengeful, they found fast death in the right way. Interesting effects But what about the smooth hair How can Hollywood knock me at that lock? <br /> <br /> #The second story, "The Raft". Follow drug groups and yahoo teenagers. Head to a quiet lake. After swimming to the raft in the lake, they were attached to the podium because the ominous creature lurking in the water. <br /> <br /> - Now it's better. What started when your basic teenager ran around became a mysterious creepy setting that was full of tension and uncomfortable. And it does not deal with the flicker of nude or splash of spitefulness It is quite unusual and that causes humor too. The ending, ironically surprising, has a beautiful touch to it. The performances from the nobles were accepted without a large mark. The direction of Gornick was next to the offensive side and rather gooey. While scoring this shocking song, press the appropriate chord Sediment-like creatures in the lake (Like many people talk about) looks like a frightening black tarp (Yes, you are reading right!) Floating on the water. <br /> <br /> # Finally, the third number ends with "The Hitchhiker" rich woman. But lacking sex, traveling home after living with Gigolo, her man, but she came late When thinking of some ideas to explain her delays, if necessary, she jumped out of the road and accidentally hit the car. Instead of checking or asking for help, she drove away in the hope of returning home in front of her husband. Soon she was threatened by the dead body of a car wrecker. <br /> <br /> - Not scary, but I didn't exercise that laughing. Compared to the first two, this is different in tone and trying to tickle the funny bone instead. Lois Chiles doesn't matter in the leading role. But the constant confidence and small dialogue that she has with herself has become a pathetic and tragic story. The bright make-up effects are well displayed and dripping with vision. When she pressed the button, waving the car, that was when it became chaos and surplus in the execution. Then onwards, we will hear the hitchhiker of the dead unceasingly, repeat and repeat ?? And repeat the line "Thank you for the woman riding!" This happens every time she decides to run away. There is a little courtesy for the dead beloved. <br /> <br /> In every second short story, "The Raft" and the unpleasant effects are the most inferior sequel.
