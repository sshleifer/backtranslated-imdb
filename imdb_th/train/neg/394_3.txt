I was encouraged by the movie that filled the gap in the world movie. So after watching the movie trailer of "Water Lilies", I expect to like this movie because I think I stumbled upon something unique: a movie that shows a straightforward teen lesbian love - Beautiful. Thing "<br /> <br /> The main character is a French woman, aged 15 years. Marie is a slim and beautiful person in the style of Tomboy Floriane. Outgoing, strong and beautiful. And Anne Chueong, Chubby and not yet underage The relationship between Erotica and Marie and Florenne is in this movie, if not at the surface. <br /> <br /> However, "Water Lilies" is not about beginning to love Les. Deceit when two teens It is a matter of sexual frustration, suffering, annoyance, adolescents who work in purpose, and - at least two cases - without sexual pleasure. It also proves that screenwriters and filmmakers create their own works when they become cheating. <br /> <br /> In the special feature of the DVD, "Lord of the Flies", the director Peter Brook said With sexual arousal "Means that the French considered children to be angels while they considered teenagers and adults with widespread cynicism Part of the film's destruction is Celine Sciamma, the filmmaker emphasizing this great cynicism. <br /> <br /> "Where is happiness?" I asked myself while watching this movie. Yes, the first love may be painful and frustrating. But can enjoy and arouse victory in a fresh and agreeable way of life These positive aspects are missing from this film. <br /> <br /> In general, this film wants to celebrate the first love that is painful, but Sciamma is too impressed with the cynicism and ingenuity and ruins of her. First of all, what is the only show of plump girls? I know that there is a accepted tradition of tasteful nudity in European theaters, with evidence from movies such as "The Slingshot; The Rascals; The Devil, Probably; The The Little Thief; Murmur of the Heart; Friends ; Beau Pere "and" Europa, Europa "; But in this case, it is an invader-like invasion - "Watch the audience. I can create a movie that I show to those who are not beautiful. See," Whether it is nudity or nude images that are distributed equally, it is the way. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in the club where Floriane and Marie are dancing. The following things are not just a mockery of Floriane. It's a filmmaker. Sciamma mocked her audience. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the betrayal of true authenticity and the greatest natural honesty occurred when Floriane warned Marie that She asked for something extraordinary. Marie asked in understanding that "Who cares about being a normal person?" Then Sciamma played a lie with her audience and the shocking momentum of the movie. Because Floriane's request was a fake question, the question came and the question changed. About the movie, the character of Marie and the audience who wasted time. <br /> <br /> Here are the two moments that sound like the audience's nerves: 1) Every French person is Bathing suit and swim to Turtle Action When? 2) Which teenager - which nation - will sound the core of the apple that is thrown in the trash to get the taste of the mouth of the loved one And if They find a better vehicle for their abilities. May become a great actor. Louise Blachere (Anne) is a great actress in the technical field and can have a successful career in supporting roles. Adele Haenel (Floriane) may become a heroine or ammo, or both. Pauline Acquart (Marie) has a violent and magnetic power that is not distorted. In the future, she can play everything from sentimental librarians to seductors to the mysterious lusts that politicians are reluctant to ridicule as meteorologists Much The faithful filmmaker will please create a genuine movie about two young women who fall in love! No - not necessary for this middle-aged man - but in order for a lesbian girl to have the quality that they can see and identify with And yes, to fill the gap of content in the world movie
