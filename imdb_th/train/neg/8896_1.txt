Last night I saw Brigadoon on TV (12 September 2009). I was 61 years old and watched the movie for as long as I can remember. I can truly say that Brigadoon stands alone by far the worst movie I have ever seen. The accent is shameful. Local children's clubs will produce better sets. The characters are wood, they may shrink dry rot from the tears of customers who are unlucky to watch them. Hope that the star of this movie will be thick enough to protect them from the shame that they suffer from seeing this movie. The owner of this rag should do an excellent job for humanity and destroy all copies of this movie.
