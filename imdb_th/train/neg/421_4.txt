My name above says it all. Let me make it more clear If you've seen "Planet Earth" on the BBC, which I'm sure most of you have, you won't like this movie too much. And I am the owner of all discs of "Planet Earth". I have seen the film's ratings very high and read good reviews about it. I'm excited to check it out. <br /> <br /> Alas, I went to the theater and the movie started. I saw that it was a Disney movie with the BBC and Discovery production companies and when they started the first scene about The polar bear I remember them from the home DVD of "Planet Earth". <br /> <br /> The movie continues and I and my friends realize the various scenes from "Planet Earth". <Br /> <br /> We were very disappointed because 90% thought that the picture is from "Planet Earth", I'm talking 90%, because some of the scenes that I do not remember. I have a feeling that I do not remember them. <br /> <br /> So what is this film in the end? What is the collection of videos from different discs of "Planet Earth" with subtitles? Focus on children. Yes, subtitles are quite kiddish. Let me give you an example. When they showed the polar ball that went out of the mother, the narrator said "Polar bear children are not like human children. They don't usually listen to mothers." (I can't remember the vocabulary. But here's how it is) Summary This is "Planet Earth", a short version for children!
