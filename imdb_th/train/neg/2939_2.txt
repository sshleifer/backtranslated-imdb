As others say, "No, Luciano" is a name that is smarter or more responsive to this movie. For entertainment, the great opera singer should sing ... Not that he's an awesome actor. It's just this movie, stink. <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes are good - good family movies like it used to be - but after that, there was nothing but a boring opera. <br /> Properly playing the Pavarotti singer while "Giorgio Finna" loses his voice a few times and the doctor "Pamela Taylor" (Kathryn Harold) came to the rescue. Then the singer fell in love with the doctor. The doctor fell in love with the singer slowly. <br /> <br /> Pavarotti has a winning smile and a lovely person. It is Harrold who destroys things and after watching her here I am not surprised that she is not a star /> <br /> There is a beautiful scene in the movie to enjoy the good images of San Francisco. Sisko and Italy, at least in the first half of the film. I'm bored and don't remember much about the second half of it.
