As much as we all love Al Pacino, it's very painful to see him in this movie. The publicity hacking at the end of what seems to be once a career that is outstanding and idealistic. Pacino shows his role to look like a bed that is not sewn. Spool came out this way and had many endings and it was impossible for the mind to roll (and then retreat). <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger is there, not doing much of the scene. She and Pacino are flat and unbelievable. Hard to believe that they are meaningful to each other No energy at all. <br /> <br /> Tea Leone, on the other hand, makes the screen brighter. She is electric and her scene with Pacino is the most interesting in the movie. But not enough to save Al from shame
