Backed by positive comments about this movie, here I am looking forward to watching this movie. Bad mistake I've watched over 950 movies and this is one of their worst movies - it's scary in almost every aspect: editing, walking, stories, 'performances,' soundtrack (one song Of this movie Less than four times) The film is insulting and disgusting and boring. I am not happy to see the credits at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes me unable to score 1 is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from the best performance He, at least, he seems to be trying at least The only one for Keitel obsessives only
