Denzel is the only thing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe in the beginning, this might be a better movie. Some people decide to cut the action and plot the entry point to the beginning of the movie, causing most of the story to disappear in about the first 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> So first, it makes you confused and makes you confused. Acting too much to stop believing. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a sense of injustice and anger that makes this kind of movie to impress the audience. Actually, it does that if you're looking for ... to make yourself fall down.
