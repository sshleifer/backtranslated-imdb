* There may be strange spoilers? * Crispin Glover's mention is enough to send underwear in the bunch. The presence of his landmark in Back to the Future while George McFly sealed him into American conscience forever. Recently he has tried to return to the subconscious mind of Bartby and Willard again. <br /> <br /> This time, however, Crispin has created a cheap Da Da movie for 76 minutes. Reminded me of genius while overall it almost insulted me But not because of its content, content? What is it? Is a movie in which half of this movie, all the actors have Down syndrome, making it feel strange. The other half of the film is Crispin Glover, Adam Parfrey and men with cerebral palsy. All of this has the feeling that John Water is trying to do with Desperate Living and at the same time feels miserable and unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> Half of the down syndrome actors are still. There are many snails killed. It's about a man who has snails and ends up killing people. He was tortured by other groups and grasshoppers. He fell in love with two women, one of whom had sex with him in the cemetery. In addition, he also fell in love with a friend who teased him. <br /> <br /> Chris Pin Glover is the director of this program. He is the man who controls the mind of men and the cerebral palsy is something that likes sex. At least he helped himself in a clear scene with other "shocking" images that created comedy like Nazi Swaztikas crossed with Shirley Cathedral and musicians in Black said that they were Michael Jack. <br /> <br /> In the outside world, the suffering person is still related to him. Love to kill shellfish and be hurt by other people They hit him with stones and so After that, they beat the musicians after experimenting. <br /> <br /> Returning to Crispin's room, Glover is still the guardian of his set and tries to control everyone. But failed miserably. <br /> <br >> What makes you feel less than Dr. Caligary and more than the style stolen from it An awkward mental area that feels like a scene in which Dr. Caligari felt uncomfortable. They still have absolutely ridiculous conversations. And it is full of ridiculous fantasies for jokes. <br /> <br /> The problem is about 20 minutes in the movie ... maybe more ... what is it? In the next 56 minutes, we continue to run along the same set of images by introducing new images in the form of ridiculous puppet performances. It seems that this movie will be more than a movie that is trying to push the envelope out proactively and forbidden images. It tries to ridicule and confuse the audience. But the problem is that it has enough different images for a 40-minute movie. <br /> <br /> The worse is the movie, the design of the scene and everything else is very cheap and hardly planned. It feels like "Okay, this is how we can do it and make it out of the way." It doesn't feel interesting and rather boring ... On the other hand, Dr. Caligari has amazing movies and framing. The difference between the two is quite surprising. <br /> <br />: C
