I have to agree with the first comment: this movie sucks very hard. Although there is a large B-list of actors covering the film (For those who do not watch in the Comedy Central during weekdays, which is probably the only thing to get from this movie.) Trying to accuse Dangerfield. From the 1980s Randy Randy? Check Ed Beckley, Jr., check out the voice of Lisa Simpson? Now she can say that Maximum Overdrive is not just her only scary flick: check again and many more. <br /> <br /> The sad thing about this flick is that it's about Comedy written with funny stories There is nothing about this movie outside of the joke. You better see the dry color. This is a video that is directly copied to the bottom of the video that still believes in the old video proverb: Throw the old star on the cover, and you'll get a refund from the rental. Consider one of the last examples of littering. <br /> <br /> Using only one movie if you're having trouble sleeping. It will take you there.
